According to Mei, they had fun. Perhaps too much fun. Regardless, Jiayi ended up working for Lucheng Interstellar at &lt;a href=\"Lijiang%20Tower\"&gt;Lijiang Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Red Promise.\nJiayi while working with &lt;a href=\"Lucheng%20Interstellar\"&gt;Lucheng Interstellar&lt;/a&gt; was sent on a secret mission to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars\"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes of expanding the reach of humanity, called Project Red Promise. Over the course of many years, Jiayi worked with her colleagues on Mars to expand their base and terraform the planet. The plan was for them to kickstart the project, with more personnel and supplies arriving later into the project.\nWhilst on Mars, Jiayi birthed &lt;a href=\"Juno\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;, the first and only Martian. Jiayi raised Juno alongside her colleagues on Mars, where they treated her as one of their own, celebrating her birthdays and helping teach her. Over the course of Juno's time on Mars, Jiayi and her colleagues pitched in to gift Juno her own spacesuit, giving various upgrades to it over time. \nProject Red Promise had been affecting the Martian atmosphere, creating more intense and violent storms. After a while, the base lost contact with &lt;a href=\"Lucheng%20Interstellar\"&gt;Lucheng Interstellar&lt;/a&gt; back on Earth. During this time, Jiayi and her colleagues tried protecting Juno from the fear and anxiety of the situation, knowing they had limited time. \nAfter months of no contact, Jiayi and her colleagues built a ship for &lt;a href=\"Juno\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes she could go back to Earth. Whilst hesitent at first, Juno ultimately agreed to leave with the data Jiayi and her colleagues gathered on the martian climate. Jiayi and the rest had a farewell party for Juno, which was interrupted by alarms from the base of another martian storm. Jiayi held Juno's hand teary eyed as she boarded her ship. While Juno couldn't bring anyone with her, she kept a photo of Jiayi and her friend, &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;, attached to her ship interior. \nBy the time Juno arrived on Earth, Jiayi and the rest of the Red Promise team were still alive."}

{"id": "36717", "revid": "240650", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=36717", "title": "Julian", "text": " was a member of &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Rebels\"&gt;Ashe's gang&lt;/a&gt; in the period following the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nStory.\nJulian is slightly shorter and slighter than &lt;a href=\"McCree\"&gt;McCree&lt;/a&gt;. He has red hair and a thick spray of freckles across his face besides the left side, which has pink scarring that runs over his cheek and down his neck (courtesy of burns suffered in the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;). His laugh often sounds like a cackle.\nJulian is skilled in demolitions and in obtaining contraband. He is a compulsive gambler, but good at haggling for a deal.\nEarly Life.\nJulian lost his parents in the early days of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. They were apparently killed, but he survived, and was pulled from the rubble. He spent over a month in a med camp before joining a resistance group. He survived the war, and picked up some of his skills in the conflict. However, he was physically and emotionally scarred.\nAfter the war, Julian spent a lot of time on his own. He came to &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; where he tried to work demolition on the transcontinental lines. This didn't pan out, and he ended up working on for at least two years on various farms. His last stint was on the &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Valentine%20megafarm\"&gt;Ace Valentine megafarm&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeadlock Rebels.\nMeetings.\nWhile still on the megafarm, Julian talked the farm's foreman into giving &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt; a job. The two became friends, Julian often saving McCree a spot in the chow line, and made sure they didn't get the beds with bedbugs. Julian reguarly frequented &lt;a href=\"Cutthroat%20Trout%27s\"&gt;Cutthroat Trout's&lt;/a&gt;; a seedy pub outside &lt;a href=\"Bellerae\"&gt;Bellerae&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne day, Julian bet the other farmhands that McCree could shoot a playing card from fifty yards. Julian won the bet, but the farmhands took umbrage at losing, and a fistfight broke out. McCree dove into the brawl to protect Julian before Sheriff &lt;a href=\"Carson\"&gt;Carson&lt;/a&gt; arrived, arresting McCree. Julian was fired as well, as the farm had no shortage of aspiring workers.\nSometime later, McCree contacted Julian about some \"friends\" he had made. They met at Cutthroat Trout's, where Julian met &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Ashe\"&gt;Elizabeth Ashe&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; servant, &lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;B.O.B.&lt;/a&gt;. They were joined by &lt;a href=\"Frankie\"&gt;Frankie&lt;/a&gt; (a hacker) where Ashe declared her intention to carry out a series of heists over the next few months\u2014weapons tech shipments, extremely profitable. While Frankie was cautious, Julian instantly signed up for the endeavor and left the table. He made a bet for the bar's next race\u2014if one of them won against &lt;a href=\"Dezba\"&gt;Dezba&lt;/a&gt;, she'd give them four &lt;a href=\"hovercycle\"&gt;hovercycle&lt;/a&gt;s. If they lost, she'd get B.O.B. He also made a side bet of his own on Ashe.\nAshe was aghast, but there was no backing out, for if they did so, Dezba would win B.O.B. through forfeit. Regardless, Ashe won the race. Julian was happy, but Ashe made it clear that if he ever did something like that again, he'd wish he'd never come within a hundred miles of Bellerae. Julian got the message, and revealed his side bet. With their combined winnings, the gang had a start.\nThe First Heist.\nAshe took her gang to her base of operations; a barn on the grounds of &lt;a href=\"Lead%20Rose\"&gt;Lead Rose&lt;/a&gt; manor. Julian was disappointed with the accomodations, but it was important to keep a low profile. Ashe announced that their first heist would be carried out in three days time, and if anyone wanted to walk out, this was the time to do so. No-one took the offer. They visited &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Starr\"&gt;Fort Starr&lt;/a&gt;, where Julian helped get a better deal for Ashe on ammo. \nDays later, they carried out their first heist in what would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Briscoe%20Incident\"&gt;Briscoe Incident&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was that once Frankie hacked the convoy's main transport, she and McCree would engage the drones from their hovercycles. Julian would then used his demolition skills to seal the &lt;a href=\"Brisco%20Tunnel\"&gt;Brisco Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, covering their retreat once the plans were stolen. The heist was a success.\nPlans for the &lt;a href=\"H-29\"&gt;H-29&lt;/a&gt; scope were sold, and the gang had their first payday. Julian was in awe of the earnings, pointing out that from one heist, he'd earned more than what he'd received from two years of work on farms. The gang were in awe, as all of them bar Ashe had had it rough until now, and both Julian and Frankie had suffered in the Omnic Crisis. They reminisced on their experiences, before discussing what they'd do with their earnings. Julian declared his intention to buy a house.\nShowdown at The Hopper.\nOver the next two months, Julian and her gang carried out nearly a dozen nearly flawless heists; mostly against Arbelest, but also a few other companies, in order to obscure the fact that Arbelest was their main target. However, the Arbelest targets were where the big bucks were coming from. While this worked for the gang, Julian had a string of bad luck at Cutthroat Trout's, as he gambled away his earnings. He fell into debt with folks that weren't going to take an IOU.\nThings went further awry at &lt;a href=\"The%20Hopper\"&gt;The Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, where they met with &lt;a href=\"Liu\"&gt;Liu&lt;/a&gt; in what was meant to be a simple exchange. However, Liu had double-crossed them, and the gang found themselves surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Diamondbacks\"&gt;Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bez\"&gt;Bez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marco%20%28Deadlock%20Rebels%29\"&gt;Marco&lt;/a&gt; walked up, and laid out his terms. This was Diamondback territory, and Ashe's gang had gotten too greedy. So they were going to cease all their activity, or else...well, there were a lot of holes where people could be buried in the desert. Julian tried to strike a better deal for his gang, but was decked by Marco instead. The Diamondbacks rode off into the desert, leaving Julian enraged. Despite this, Ashe refused to give up. Their deadline was approaching, and they could fit in a few more well-paying jobs. Namely, a big score that she'd been planning for quite some time.\nSiren.\nThe gang carried out a heist on an Arbelest train shipment, carrying a weapon known only as \"&lt;a href=\"Siren\"&gt;Siren&lt;/a&gt;.\" The train had yet to depart when they infiltrated the train yard. McCree found the cargo crate holding the weapon, but Julian triggered a motion sensor, which alerted the yard's security drones to their location. They managed to escape, but upon opening the crate, found only standard-issue rifles. Ashe realized that she'd made a mistake.\nLead Rose.\nAt some point after The Hopper showdown, the Diamondbacks paid for Julian's debts in exchange for him informing them about his gang's leader. He revealed that the \"Calamity\" leading the gang was in fact, Elizabeth Ashe. They hatched a plan where they would have McCree join them, pretend to be kidnapped, and Ashe would use the gang's funds to free him.\nAshe's eighteenth birthday was celebrated inside Lead Rose. Julian helped decorate, but the party was crashed by the Diamondbacks, per the plan he'd made with them earlier. However, the plan went slightly awry, as McCree refused to work with the Diamondbacks, forcing them to take him by force. The Diamondbacks set the mansion ablaze, and the police arrived. Julian and Frankie went to the barn to hide, while Ashe was left to deal with the police and her parents.\nAshe was released from prison after using the gang's finances to pay for bail. She returned to the barn and revealed this to Frankie and Julian, both of whom were aghast (albeit for slightly different reasons, given Julian's true allegiance). Ashe declared her intention to rescue McCree from the Diamondbacks, but Frankie pointed out that they outnumbered them significantly. Julian chimed in on the prospect of paying them a ransom, but as Ashe pointed out, they were nearly broke. Frankie refused to follow Ashe, but after a moment's thought, Julian decided to go with her, playing the role of a loyal friend.\nDeadlock Gorge.\nThe pair rode to &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gorge\"&gt;Deadlock Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, where Ashe explained the plan. Julian would use his dynamite to draw out the Diamondbacks to investigate the explosions, giving her the chance to infiltrate her hideout and free McCree. However, as Julian was in league with the Diamondbacks, he did no such thing, and Ashe was captured. After she came to, Julian revealed his true colors. Marco was still peaved that McCree hadn't joined them, and that Ashe had used the finances to pay for her release rather than McCree's, but maybe there was a way to salvage this. As the daughter of wealthy businessmen, her parents could pay a ransom.\nAt this point, the sound of sirens and a police loudspeaker was heard outside the gang's hideout. The Diamondbacks scattered. Julian tried to join them, but Ashe tripped him up, pinning him. It was revealed that the police sounds had been simulated by Frankie, who'd arrived with B.O.B. to rescue Ashe. They used Julian to guide them to where McCree was kept prisoner, but he didn't know the exact location. However, &lt;a href=\"Bez\"&gt;Bez&lt;/a&gt; guided them, as he was fed up with Marco's leadership. McCree was released, and promptly broke Julian's nose.\nThe group came under fire by Marco and his henchmen. All of them left bar Ashe and Julian, whom Ashe had no intention of letting escape. After all, as she bitterly reminded him, he was now part of the Diamondbacks. In the confrontation with Marco, Ashe took Julian's detonator, and threatened to bring the entire hideout down. Marco said she was bluffing, but a terrified Julian told him that she wasn't. In the end, most of the Diamondbacks defected to Ashe. Julian, Marco, and his remaining loyalists were placed inside a shipping container and delivered to the Bellerae police department.\nTrivia.\nJulian's proficiency in explosives (including dynamite) is potentially inspired by Ashe's &lt;a href=\"Dynamite\"&gt;Dynamite&lt;/a&gt; ability (or vice versa)."}

Baptiste\u2019s Biotic Launcher fires a three-round-burst that rewards accuracy and recoil control with significant damage output. His alternate fire lobs grenades that heal allies near the point of impact. With Regenerative Burst, Baptiste activates an intense surge that heals himself and nearby allies over time. When danger is near, Baptiste can toss out his Immortality Field to prevent allies from dying. Baptiste moves around the battlefield with Exo Boots, jumping over obstacles and clearing distances that would stop other heroes. Baptiste deploys his Amplification Matrix as his ultimate, which doubles the damage and healing effects of friendly projectiles.\n\"Developer Comments: The damage taken by armor from damage over time effects, such as Widowmaker\u2019s Venom Mine, and beam weapons, like Symmetra\u2019s Photon Projector, varied greatly. Now it will be more consistent and predictable.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Previously, the effects of damage boosting were only accounted for if the damage-dealing hero was being boosted as they landed a hit. Now, damage is applied to the projectile as it is fired. This means the damage-dealing hero doesn\u2019t need to be boosted when the projectile hits an enemy for the damage boost to be accounted for.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Knockbacks are now less affected by how the enemy was moving when they were hit. Instead of having small or large knockbacks that depend on chance, knockbacks will feel similar regardless of the enemy\u2019s movement leading up to the knockback. Allowing flying heroes, like Mercy when using her Valkyrie ability or D.Va using her Booster ability, to be properly knocked back makes for more fluid, realistic gameplay.\"\n\"Developer Comments: With the addition of Baptiste, we wanted to be sure that you can tell when your hits were being buffed or nullified, regardless of what hero you\u2019re playing.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Giving Nano Boost an instant heal effect enabled players to survive longer and made Ana\u2019s ultimate valuable. However, it was a bit too strong when healing heroes with large health pools.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Reducing the downtime of Doomfist\u2019s abilities will give him some power back and make his gameplay feel more fluid.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Because of how dense the environment is on some maps, the Sonic Arrow can feel ineffective in some areas. Increasing Sonic Arrow\u2019s detection radius should make it more effective.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Junkrat is one of the best barrier and tank busters in the game, and this change will help solidify this role. This doesn\u2019t change the Frag Launcher\u2019s explosive damage, which remains at 80. The total damage for direct impact is now 130, up from 120. Since we increased Frag Launcher\u2019s damage output, Junkrat builds his ultimate too quickly. We\u2019re increasing the cost of his ultimate to balance this change with his increased damage-dealing capabilities.\"\n\"Developer Comments: The knockback on L\u00facio's Soundwave is a great tool for pushing enemies into situations that get them killed, so they should be rewarded an offensive assist for doing so. L\u00facio\u2019s ability to increase his teammate\u2019s speed was too strong, especially when used on high health/low range heroes. We\u2019re decreasing the overall power of L\u00facio's Speed Boost but increasing the speed bonus he gets from using Wall Ride so his mobility isn\u2019t impacted too much.\"\n\"Developer Comments: After reducing armor\u2019s effectiveness for all heroes, Fan the Hammer doesn\u2019t need to deal quite as much damage. Increasing Deadeye\u2019s damage after being locked on for a bit makes it more effective when attacking high health, static targets (like barriers) and heroes with over 250 health. It will not impact how dangerous this is for heroes under 250 health.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Increasing the damage of Mei\u2019s primary fire should make her Freeze and Icicle move combination more potent. Making the pillars on Mei\u2019s Ice Wall easier to destroy means less waiting for the wall to disappear on its own and more opportunities to counter it.\"\n\"Developer Comments: These minor changes make Moira\u2019s passive healing effect on Biotic Grasp slightly more effective when topping off an ally\u2019s health.\"\n\"Developer Comments: As a defensive tank, Orisa can have trouble pushing forward with the team. Allowing Orisa to move faster while firing should make it easier to apply pressure on the enemy team and use her barrier in proactive ways.\"\n\"Developer Comments: This change sets the Rocket Launcher\u2019s minimum damage to where it was before we rebalanced its direct impact and explosive damage in a recent patch.\"\n\"Developer Comments: A recent change that increased Reaper\u2019s healing while he dealt damage was a bit too strong, sometimes making opponents feel like Reaper was unstoppable.\"\n\"Developer Comments: This change should potentially allow Soldier: 76 to kill an enemy hero one shot sooner. Reducing the time between when you use Sprint and when you can fire should make the ability more fluid and responsive. Giving Tactical Visor the ability to target Junkrat\u2019s RIP-Tire and Baptiste\u2019s Immortality Field drone is a quality of life improvement, since these are both critical targets.\"\n\"Developer Comments: The cooldown on Hack often made it feel less effective to target health packs instead of players. This will make both health packs and players viable targets for hacking.\"\n\"Developer Comments: This will allow Symmetra to more consistently reach peak damage output from her Photon Projector.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Torbj\u00f6rn\u2019s survivability was a bit low, so we\u2019ve shifted some power from his Overload ability to his base health.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Infra-Sight had no counter to its effect, so it now ends when Widowmaker dies. To balance out its higher risk of use, Infra-Sight now reveals enemy health bars to Widowmaker\u2019s team.\"\n\"Developer Comments: This will make Adaptive Shield a more powerful survival tool, since being forced out of Roll mode left Wrecking Ball more susceptible to fire.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Zarya\u2019s damage greatly increases when at high energy, while also gaining increased beam size and a larger explosion radius. This often allowed Zarya to deal too much damage and made the explosions from the Alternate Fire on her Particle Cannon nearly impossible to avoid. This change will still allow Zarya to deal a lot of damage, but makes it more difficult to actually apply the damage.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Zenyatta\u2019s Orb of Discord makes him a nearly irreplaceable support hero on your team. We\u2019re reducing its impact for Zenyatta\u2019s team, but increasing the potency of the Orb of Destruction to compensate for its lesser effect.\""}

Whip Shot enables Brigitte to fling her flail forward, striking enemies at a distance and knocking them backward. With each blow, Brigitte\u2019s passive ability, Inspire, heals nearby allies over time.\nBrigitte\u2019s Barrier Shield deploys a frontal energy barrier that can absorb a limited amount of damage and protect any allies directly behind her. Once her Barrier Shield is deployed, she can use Shield Bash to lunge forward and stun the first enemy in her path.

Giving Tactical Visor the ability to target Junkrat\u2019s RIP-Tire and Baptiste\u2019s Immortality Field drone is a quality of life improvement, since these are both critical targets.\"\nSombra.\n\"Developer Comments: The cooldown on Hack often made it feel less effective to target health packs instead of players. This will make both health packs and players viable targets for hacking.\"\nSymmetra.\n\"Developer Comments: This will allow Symmetra to more consistently reach peak damage output from her Photon Projector.\"\nTorbj\u00f6rn.\n\"Developer Comments: Torbj\u00f6rn\u2019s survivability was a bit low, so we\u2019ve shifted some power from his Overload ability to his base health.\"\nWidowmaker.\n\"Developer Comments: Infra-Sight had no counter to its effect, so it now ends when Widowmaker dies. To balance out its higher risk of use, Infra-Sight now reveals enemy health bars to Widowmaker\u2019s team.\"\nWrecking Ball.\n\"Developer Comments: This will make Adaptive Shield a more powerful survival tool, since being forced out of Roll mode left Wrecking Ball more susceptible to fire.\"\nZarya.\n\"Developer Comments: Zarya\u2019s damage greatly increases when at high energy, while also gaining increased beam size and a larger explosion radius. This often allowed Zarya to deal too much damage and made the explosions from the Alternate Fire on her Particle Cannon nearly impossible to avoid. This change will still allow Zarya to deal a lot of damage, but makes it more difficult to actually apply the damage.\"\nZenyatta.\n\"Developer Comments: Zenyatta\u2019s Orb of Discord makes him a nearly irreplaceable support hero on your team. We\u2019re reducing its impact for Zenyatta\u2019s team, but increasing the potency of the Orb of Destruction to compensate for its lesser effect.\""}

Howl took control of the settlement, and banished Stone and his family into the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland\"&gt;Wasteland&lt;/a&gt;, despite their pleas.\nHowl remained king for the next thirteen years. He took part in a number of &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;s, but won every battle.\nThe Wastelander.\nAfter thirteen years of rule, Howl engaged in his final reckoning, as a &lt;a href=\"Wastelander\"&gt;Wastelander&lt;/a&gt; entered the arena. While the Recknoning was meant to be a free-for-all, the other two competitors (&lt;a href=\"Geiger\"&gt;Geiger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meri\"&gt;Meri&lt;/a&gt;) focused on the newcomer, while Howl sat back in his mech, watching the show (seemingly he had instructed/paid off the two to focus on the newcomer), drinking wine. However, things didn't go to plan, as Geiger was defeated, and the newcomer threw her blade at Howl, landing right beneath his crotch. Enraged, Howl activated his mech and fired at the newcomer, but instead hit Meri's mech, disabling it. Seconds later, the newcomer fired her shotgun, hitting Howl's own mech. Enraged, brought his mech into the arena.\nDespite this, the newcomer was able to damage his mech even further. In the heat of battle, Howl yelled that he was the king, that he \"owned everyone here.\" With a hush falling over the crowd, the newcomer used a &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20gauntlet\"&gt;magnetic gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; to gather detritus to use as projectiles. However, Howl activated the &lt;a href=\"Scrapyard\"&gt;Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt;'s magnet and fastened his mech into the surface. Ergo, the newcomer was drawn against the magnet due to her gauntlet, while Howl remained in place to take the shot. However, his mech was hit by Meri's (who'd also been caught up in the magnet), intentionally messing up his shot, which instead hit the Scrapyard's magnet, disabling it.\nHowl and the newcomer engaged directly, pitting her gauntlet and his mech's magnet against each other, until the gauntlet proved superior, disabling Howl's mech. Cowering, Howl begged for mercy. The newcomer told him that she'd show him the same mercy he showed her family thirteen years ago. Howl realized that the newcomer was &lt;a href=\"Odessa%20Stone\"&gt;Odessa Stone&lt;/a&gt;; Stone's eldest daughter. Now the Junker Queen, as she took his crown.\nBanishment.\nStone followed through on her word. Geiger and Meri tossed Howl out of the gates of Junkertown, giving him only a single bottle of water. Banished, Howl was left to fend for himself in the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland\"&gt;Wasteland&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nThe dog tags around Howl's neck indicate that he may be a former member of the Australian Army."}

{"id": "60427", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=60427", "title": "Matchmaking", "text": "Matchmaking is a system that automatically assigns players that join a matchmaking queue to matches based on various criteria. Matchmaking is used in all &lt;a href=\"game%20mode\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt;s, except &lt;a href=\"Custom%20game\"&gt;Custom game&lt;/a&gt;s. The primary goal of matchmaking is to create as fair matches as possible.\nFactors in matchmaking.\nAs a core, matchmaker is a mathematical formula that takes into account multiple factors, including but not limited to:\nMatchmaking rating.\nIn order to assess the fairness of a match, the matchmaker needs a way to approximate the players' skill. Matchmaking rating (MMR) is an internal rating (not visible to players) that is used to estimate the player's skill relative to other players. MMR is separate from &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play%23Skill%20tiers%20%26amp%3B%20divisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt;.\nMMR is tracked separately for each role and presumably for each &lt;a href=\"playlist\"&gt;playlist&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the player has a different MMR for &lt;a href=\"Unranked\"&gt;Unranked&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Competitive\"&gt;Competitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcade\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt; playlists and each role and queue in them.\nUpdating MMR.\nMatchmaking rating updates after every match. MMR is only affected by the result of the game: When the player's team wins, they will gain MMR, and when they lose, they will lose MMR. In-game statistics or post-game accolades have no effect on how much MMR was gained or lost.\nThere are three main factors that determine how much the player's MMR changes:\nAs creating a perfect match is virtually impossible, one team will often end up having slightly higher average MMR than the other, and is assumed to be more likely to win the match. Therefore, if a weaker team manages to win against a stronger team, they will gain slightly more MMR than if the teams were equal. The opposite is also true, meaning that if the stronger team wins, both teams will receive a smaller MMR adjustments, compared to a perfectly equal match. In Competitive Play, these adjustments are shown in the Rank Progression screen with \"Consolation\", \"Reversal\", \"Uphill Battle\" and \"Expected\" &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play%23Rank%20updates\"&gt;rank modifiers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a player is new to the game, the matchmaker is unable to accurately assess their skill level with how little information it has. As such, the player will receive larger MMR adjustments to get them to their correct skill level faster. In most cases, only 5 games are required to get players around their correct rating, but this is still a broad estimation. Therefore, new players may see their &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive&lt;/a&gt; rating change frequently and/or dramatically.\nThe same also applies to players that have not played for an extended period of time: Each player's MMR slowly decreases and the system's uncertainty of their rating slowly increases while they are away. This amount of uncertainty is generally unnoticeable unless the player has been inactive for an extended period of time. This uncertainty rating allows players to gain and lose MMR more quickly, so when the inactive player returns, they can jump back to their previous rank if they perform well, or they can lose MMR faster if their actual skill has decayed. In both cases, playing more games will increase the certainty of the player's MMR and causes them to be ranked more accurately and receive more stable adjustments. In Competitive Play, adjustments caused by rank uncertainty are shown with the \"Calibration\" rank modifier."}

He cited the dismissal of patents of lifesaving vaccines during the pandemic waves of the early 21st century as precedent, he claimed that biotech companies patenting seeds, the unauthorized use of which could result in hefty fines, was counter to both human interest and international law.\nThe Supreme Court accepted Frank's argument, and made GMOs open source. The decision was incredibly popular, though opponents of the decision claimed it would hinder agricultural research, making the field \"charity work.\" However, these fears did not come to pass; global adoption of hardier, more efficient crops boomed, and hunger became less of a burden for individuals and governments alike. However, many smaller farms still folded under the onslaught of climate change, which led to the creation of &lt;a href=\"megafarm\"&gt;megafarm&lt;/a&gt;s."}

{"id": "32147", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=32147", "title": "Mauga", "text": "Mauga is a &lt;a href=\"Roles\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", and is the 39th hero added to the game. He was added to the game with the release of &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 8.\nOverview.\nMauga features a kit that is designed to bash through the front lines and brawl his opponents in close-quarter combat, by wielding two powerful chainguns that can either be fired individually or in unison. Ignite enemies with his incendiary chaingun \u201cGunny\u201d to burn them when they take enough damage, then finish them with a critical hit from his volatile chaingun \u201cCha-Cha.\u201d Paired with his Berserker passive, which grants Mauga temporary health whenever he deals critical damage, he\u2019s a mountain on the battlefield.\nStrategy.\nMauga is a fiery &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;, capable of dealing big, consistent damage at range, whilst being a dangerous enemy close-up. His chainguns provide him with good damage at range when used separately, helping apply pressure to enemies at a distance. deals consistent &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20time\"&gt;Damage over time&lt;/a&gt;, whilst deals good &lt;a href=\"Headshot\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; damage, perfect to follow up on and also contributing greatly to Mauga's passive , which gives him even more sustainability. His is an unstoppable movement ability, great for engaging to get up close to enemies and deal high initial damage, or to escape from a battle to safety. is a powerful ability in Mauga's kit, providing him and his teammates with great self-sustainability through damage reduction and life-steal, capable of saving allies and giving them an advantage in battle. Mauga's ultimate is perfect for forcing enemies into close quarters with him, blocking them away from their team and providing a large, resilient shield. Although Mauga can be a challenge to defeat, his big hitbox and lack of any purely defensive abilities means he's fully dependent on his allies and damage to keep him alive. Mauga does best on the front of the battle applying pressure, using your abilities to help allies engage more safely and boost their abilities.\nMatch-Ups and Team Synergy.\nWhen fighting Tanks, Mauga has \"Matchups\" ratings, ranging on a scale of 5 levels. This is because Mauga's primary focus, like all other tanks, are eliminating DPS or Supports, with controlling and disrupting the enemy tank being a secondary objective:\nWhen fighting DPS &amp; Supports, Mauga has \"Priority Targeting\" &amp; measures of \"Risk\" ranging on a scale of 5 levels. These heroes are Mauga's main targets. Only Supports feature a listed measure of risk as nearly all of them can counteract Mauga effectively with CC or other abilities:\nSynergies are also graded on a scale of 5 levels. Tank Synergies will not feature explicit gradings due to the nature of Role Lock restrictions:\nStory.\nA charismatic and cunning Samoan warrior, Mauga thrives in the chaos of the battlefield and lives every day like it's his last. Wherever Mauga goes, he knows how to have a good time, and experience has taught him to treat every day like it's his last.\nTall and muscular, Mauga's size and strength have been augmented. This includes a second &lt;a href=\"cybernetic\"&gt;cybernetic&lt;/a&gt; heart, and a subsequent upgrade to his organic heart. This has prevented him from taking part in weightlifting tournaments due to the advantages his upgrades give him.\nAt least according to Mauga himself, he was more serious prior to said augmentation, before gaining a \"new outlook on life.\" In his current persona, Mauga often portrays himself as being a \"big dumb brute.\" However, this is a facade, as he possesses cunning attributes. He talks fast and loose, and has a tendency to treat strangers as if they are friends. He is proficient in close combat; Baptiste regarded him as being \"like a demon\"; a sociopath and sadist, Mauga flips between his lighter and darker sides quickly, though can lose himself in the latter. Only Baptiste has ever been able to talk him down from this state in the field. Baptiste himself serves as a blindspot for Mauga, who's shown him mercy where he might otherwise not do so.\nThe Deepsea Raiders.\nMaugaloa Malosi challenged the law since his childhood. His father led the Samoan branch of the eco-rebel group, the &lt;a href=\"Deepsea%20Raiders\"&gt;Deepsea Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, that became like family to Mauga. They took him along on all their adventures, instilling in him a healthy dose of disrespect for the law. On their missions around Polynesia, Mauga learned from an early age that charisma opens doors and destruction gets answers. As the Deepsea Raiders fought against those disrespecting the beauty of their seas and islands, Mauga grew to be a renowned warrior.\nMauga became a local legend in Samoa when an intense battle left him critically wounded. A Deepsea Raider medic performed emergency heart surgery, giving him a second cybernetic heart to supplement his damaged, organic one and get back into the fight. With his newfound strength, he was victorious. The triumphant Mauga returned to Samoa, where more upgrades and surgeries awaited him. As his strength increased, so did the need for constant maintenance. Always living on the edge of death taught Mauga to live every day like it might be his last.\nAt some point after his augmentation, Mauga and the Raiders fought against &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blacksand%20Fires\"&gt;Blacksand Fires&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that Mauga gained his chainguns from Overwatch.\nTalon.\nAs the Deepsea Raiders' activity died down, Mauga was thirsty for more adventures. News of &lt;a href=\"Akande%20Ogundimu\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt; killing &lt;a href=\"Akinjide%20Adeyemi\"&gt;Akinjide Adeyemi&lt;/a&gt; reached him and piqued his interest. Seeing a worthy opponent in this so-called Doomfist, Mauga challenged him to a no-rules, anything-goes fight. Amused, Doomfist sensed something in the young man and agreed. The epic fight ended in a draw, with both men exhausted but unwilling to admit defeat. Impressed, Doomfist offered him a place with &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;, the promise of regular &lt;a href=\"cybernetic\"&gt;cybernetic&lt;/a&gt; upgrades, and all the chaos his two hearts desired.\nMauga accepted, and took part in a number of jobs on behalf of the organization. As a Talon member, the whole world became Mauga's playground. At some point, he burnt down a Talon server room, causing &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; to lose valuable data.\nMeeting Baptiste.\nWhile in Talon, Mauga met Baptiste. The two hit it off immediately and performed numerous extractions together. They carried out operations in locations such as &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Makati\"&gt;Makati&lt;/a&gt;, both of which resulted in civilian casualties.\nMonte Cristi.\nFour years before &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; sent out the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; recall, Mauga and Baptiste were part of a Talon operation at &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Cristi\"&gt;Monte Cristi&lt;/a&gt;. Under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Cuerva\"&gt;Cuerva&lt;/a&gt;, Talon was assigned to take out &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Fern%C3%A1ndez\"&gt;Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt;; leader of the &lt;a href=\"Playa%20Cartel\"&gt;Playa Cartel&lt;/a&gt; which had been encroaching on Talon's territory. However, upon reaching Fern\u00e1ndez's safe room, they found that he wasn't there. Enraged, Cuerva ordered the Talon unit to tear the town apart until they found him, which resulted in mass collateral damage and civilian casualties. Disgusted at what had transpired, Baptiste tried to flee in a fishing boat, but was confronted by Mauga. He told Baptiste that there were no good people, and that all they could do was have fun while they had the chance. Not finding the fun in mass murder, Baptiste declared that he wasn't going back, and that if Mauga didn't let him go, he'd have to kill him. Over the radio, Cuerva asked Mauga if he'd found Baptiste. After a long pause, Mauga told him that he hadn't found his comrade. When asked why he'd done it, Mauga stated that he'd always liked Baptiste, but that now he owed him a favor, and that he should call him when he was \"ready to come home.\" With that, the two parted ways.\nWhat We Left Behind.\nFour years after the Monte Cristi debacle, Mauga went with &lt;a href=\"Trung%20Le%20Nguyen\"&gt;Trung Le Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Vernand%20Sainclair\"&gt;Vernand Sainclair&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sainclair%20Pharmaceuticals\"&gt;Sainclair Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt; hadn't been paying Talon, so they were assigned to make the man come to his senses. Aware that Baptiste was in Haiti, Mauga insisted that they use Baptiste. Nguyen was skeptical, wanting someone more reliable, but Mauga insisted, and Nguyen relented. To this end, they confronted Baptiste at &lt;a href=\"Lefort%27s\"&gt;Lefort's&lt;/a&gt;. Mauga's threats were clear, despite his outwardly casual demenor, and Baptiste agreed to help them on the job, though asked what happened afterwards. After all, \"no-one left Talon except in a coffin.\" With a smile, Mauga told his friend not to worry about it.\nThe following morning, Baptiste met with Mauga and Nguyen outside &lt;a href=\"Sainclair%27s%20mansion\"&gt;Sainclair's mansion&lt;/a&gt;. Nguyen had scheduled an appointment with Sainclair, so all the trio had to do was just walk in. The plan went well enough at first, but inside the mansion's library, they didn't find Sinclair, but \"did\" find Sinclair's personal security training their guns on them. Mauga activated his shield, and Nguyen killed most of guards with his sidearm. One guard remained, choked by Mauga, but Baptiste talked his former friend down long enough to interrogate the man to find out where Sinclair was. The guard stated that Sainclair was in his office. Mauga thanked the guard by breaking his neck. \nThe trio fought their way through the mansion, cutting through its security forces before finding Sainclair, holed up in his office with a revolver. He fired at Mauga, but the bullets bounced off his shield. Mauga covered Nguyen as he confronted Sainclair, asking why they shouldn't just kill him. Sainclair protested that he had information, and revealed that it was an Overwatch recall order. Various dossiers were part of the data. He revealed that he'd received the transmission three days ago, and the reason that he'd received it at all was that he was a former member of Overwatch himself. However, the data was worthless\u2014Talon already had access to the information, as they already had &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;former&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Overwatch agents&lt;/a&gt; on their payroll. Therefore, Sainclair was still going to die, and Mauga suggested that Baptiste do the honors. Baptiste walked forward, but instead of shooting Sainclair, dropped a flash bang, incapacitating Mauga and Nguyen, giving him time to flee with Sainclair. \nMauga tracked Baptiste to a wharf. That this was a repeat of their parting at Monte Cristi and he told Baptiste that he couldn't let him go a second time. The two engaged in a firefight\u2014Mauga wanted to bring Baptiste into Talon alive and was willing to injure him to do so. Baptiste used a prototype device to end the battle, throwing it into the air and shooting it. The resulting explosion destroyed a large portion of the docks, and possibly Mauga as well, as when the smoke cleared, he was nowhere to be seen. However, Baptiste suspected that he had survived the explosion; a suspicion that was correct.\nAlthough Baptiste had escaped, Mauga didn't mind. The chase was half the fun. And until he faced his old comrade again, Mauga remained content in Talon's company...for now.\nA Great Day.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, and Mauga to a &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; that had been crippled by Torbj\u00f6rn in the attack and had crashed into the ocean in order retrieve data on Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"power%20relay\"&gt;power relay&lt;/a&gt; technology. Upon arrival, Mauga left the ship ready for a fight; much to Sombra's annoyance who stated the operation required a surgeon's approach, not a butcher. Mauga gave her a thumbs up. As Sombra hacked the door open and entered, Mauga noticed a communications relay and shot it, in order to prevent a distress signal, as he knew that when the data was seized, it would cause an alarm to go off and set off explosions.\nAs Sombra and Reaper entered the ship, they noticed a bunch of deactivated &lt;a href=\"Nulltrooper\"&gt;Nulltrooper&lt;/a&gt;s. As Mauga entered the ship, a Nulltrooper activated; Mauga punched it. The other Nulltroopers activated which lead to Sombra and Reaper shooting their way to their target. With Mauga behind the Nulltroopers, he grabbed the heads of two of them and slammed them together before making his way to the data room. Instead of holding the perimeter as planned, he ran off, and retrieved the power data relay. \nAfter the mission, back on the &lt;a href=\"dropship\"&gt;dropship&lt;/a&gt;, Mauga, while cleaning one of his chainguns and listening to music, asks Sombra what Doomfist had said. He provided the power data relay, and explained that due to his experience with the &lt;a href=\"Deepsea%20Raiders\"&gt;Deepsea Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, he knew ships, and explained that with the command carrier destroyed, there would be no witnesses, and therefore, no problems. \nConfident that Doomfist would be happy when Sombra gave him the data, he told her it had been fun, and if he wanted to do it again, she knew where to find him. He jumped off the back of the dropship, saying \"this was a great day\" before deploying a parachute.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nDevelopment on Mauga began in 2018 after the developers saw a piece of concept art. Development occurred on-and-off for the following five years. The development team was looking for a character who would fit the archetype of a tank hero with less speed but greater firing power. It was decided that a Samoan could fit this archetype, and the team did research on Samoans and Polynesians, looking for the right look. Blizzard worked with cultural consultants, including artist Si'i Liufau, who specializes in contemporary Polynesian tattoos and Tataus. Liufau called out the initial tattoo the team originally created for Mauga. According to &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Hudson\"&gt;Kenny Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, \"His [Mauga's] original tattoo was Polynesian inspired but was not done by a true Samoan tattoo artist. We wanted authenticity, and we contracted [Si'i Liufau], a certified master Samoan tattoo artist, and worked hand in hand with him.\" Liufau drew some stuff up, &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; artists drew stuff back, and a middleground was reached due to issues such as rendering. The tattoos that were sketched had such fine details that many game engines couldn't handle it. As such, the middleground was accurate to Samoan culture, but not so detailed that the game couldn't handle it.\nMauga was originally intended to be Hero 31, but as the kit &lt;a href=\"Geoff%20Goodman\"&gt;Geoff Goodman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Noh\"&gt;Joshua Noh&lt;/a&gt; developed came together, they decided it didn't suit Mauga's personality, and instead conceived of an entirely new hero, &lt;a href=\"Sigma\"&gt;Sigma&lt;/a&gt;, to use it. Development of Sigma forced development of Mauga to take a backseat. In 2019, it was stated that the team still intended to make Mauga a playable hero some day, and had \"big plans\" for him. Mauga's rollout as a hero was further delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By this point, work on Mauga was about 80% complete, but the developers needed more time. As such, Mauga and &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt; swapped places in the release order. Originally, Mauga had been planned for &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 2 and Ramattra Season 8. This was swapped, as by this point, work on Ramattra was complete.\nIn 2022, there was speculation that Mauga would be the hero released for &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 2 of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". In June, YouTuber Potxeca claimed developers &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Keller\"&gt;Aaron Keller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geoff%20Goodman\"&gt;Geoff Goodman&lt;/a&gt; had told them that Mauga would be released as a hero. It was further speculated that Mauga would be revealed at the 2022 &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20League\"&gt;Overwatch League&lt;/a&gt; grand finals, when &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; teased a hero reveal. Instead, however, &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt; was the hero revealed at the event. \nIt was reported by GameSpot that a Tank hero would be released in Season 7+, and it would be an &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;. While the Tank report was accurate, the omnic claim was not.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 7, it was announced that a new &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; map named \"&lt;a href=\"Samoa\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt;\" would be released. This led to speculation that Mauga would be released as a hero in Season 8. Mauga was leaked hours prior to his official reveal at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202023\"&gt;BlizzCon 2023&lt;/a&gt; on the Nintendo e-shop.\nAbility Development.\nThe developers tried a few alternate mobility abilities for Overrun. One of the first ideas was a short range dash that would toss enemies into the air behind Mauga if he impacted them. \nMauga's weapons weren't always miniguns. There were a few alternates tested such as a flamethrower or incendiary grenade launchers. There were a few attempts at having two very different firing weapons in each hand, with one being hitscan and the other being a projectile. This didn't play well when trying to fire both at the same time, as the weapons had different firing rates, and aiming projectiles was difficult. Furthermore, the player was required to track the ammo pools separately, which was also difficult.\nMauga's Cage Fight differs little in the final version from its inceptions. However, the developers still tried other versions to see what would play best. It was a physical wall instead of a barrier at one point. There was also a completely different ult that was more of an area effect debuff to enemy damage dealt, the opposite of damage boost."}

{"id": "21765", "revid": "47997592", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21765", "title": "Maximilien", "text": "Maximilien is a wealthy &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; and a member of &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;'s inner council. He runs the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Monaco\"&gt;Casino Monaco&lt;/a&gt;.\nStory.\nMaximilien started as an accountant, but found his true talent in money laundering. Over the years, he found wealth in the businesses he purchased and ran, such as &lt;a href=\"Don%20Rumbotico\"&gt;Don Rumbotico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Monaco\"&gt;Casino Monaco&lt;/a&gt;, and other businesses around the world.\nRetribution.\nMaximilien was known to &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; at least eight years prior to the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29%23Recall\"&gt;Overwatch Recall&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Antonio\"&gt;Antonio&lt;/a&gt; (of whom he was an associate), Maximilien was among those who stepped up to fill the void he'd left. Within the next two years, he exerted more \"muscle\" within Talon. &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt; speculated that this was due to &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival within Talon.\nStorm Rising.\nSix years before the Recall, Overwatch struggled to arrest &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;. Overwatch agent &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt; recommended that they instead capture Doomfist by targeting Maximilien, and she sends a strike team of &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; to arrest him. Maximilien was believed by Overwatch to be \"soft\" and more likely to give information to Overwatch than other members of Talon. He escaped initial capture and fled through the &lt;a href=\"Don%20Rumbotico\"&gt;Don Rumbotico&lt;/a&gt; distillery to the &lt;a href=\"Havana%20Sea%20Fort\"&gt;Havana Sea Fort&lt;/a&gt;, but he was captured before he could board a helicopter out of the city. Immediately, he offered to make a deal with the strike team, who were initially guarded about him; so Maximilien proceeded to \"smoothen the deal\" by denoting his vast resources and inquired if the Overwatch agents have any interests market-wise. Mercy responded to that by saying they seek \"an introduction\" which she knows the omnic can arrange, much to Maximmilien's relief at seeing that his diplomatic attempt was actually getting him somewhere, and ultimately agreed to host such between the operatives and Doomfist. He told Overwatch that Doomfist would be in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; in three weeks, leading to &lt;a href=\"Doomfist%23Downfall\"&gt;Doomfist's arrest&lt;/a&gt;, and in exchange requested that Overwatch not tell Doomfist of his betrayal.\nMasquerade.\nMaximilien met with Doomfist and &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; at his casino in &lt;a href=\"Monaco\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt; shortly after Doomfist's prison break. There he apprised Doomfist of goings-on within Talon, reaffirming his loyalty to Doomfist's cause and warning him that some within the organization would have preferred to see him remain behind bars. After defeating a group of hitmen sent by &lt;a href=\"Vialli\"&gt;Vialli&lt;/a&gt;, a rival Talon council member, Doomfist asked Maximilien to clean up the mess and departed.\nMaximilien later met with Doomfist, &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, and other members of the inner council in a hidden boardroom at a masquerade ball in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;, Italy, where Doomfist discussed his plans to start a new war."}

Allies that do not need healing will no longer potentially block shots meant for teammates that do need it. Increasing her magazine size makes it less likely that Ana will be forced into a reloading in the middle of an important fight.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Brigitte\u2019s ultimate is very powerful, especially when it is placed on the entire team. This change will reduce the maximum armor value of Rally, but does not reduce the overall amount of armor given by the ability over its duration. This means when used in combat while her allies are taking damage, it should feel about the same, but the lingering effects of the armor should have less of an impact. Her Shield Bash is a very strong ability on a fairly short cooldown, making it difficult for her opponents to play around. Increasing this cooldown allows for more options when battling against her.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Hanzo\u2019s Storm Arrows are doing too much damage considering his other changes, such as Lunge and projectile speed. This damage reduction will give Hanzo\u2019s enemies a more reasonable chance to react and fight against him while using Storm Arrows.\"\n=COMPETITIVE PLAY UPDATES=\n&lt;a href=\"Rialto\"&gt;Rialto&lt;/a&gt; is now available in Competitive Play\n=GAME BROWSER AND CUSTOM GAMES=\nAna can now Nano Boost herself"}

Since he already has strong defensive ability options in Regenerative Burst and Immortality Field, we're reverting how quickly he can charge the Exo Boots jump.\"\n\"Much of McCree's recent success can be attributed to his increased maximum health and we think that aspect is working well to help solidify a close-to-mid-range role for him. We're reverting the Combat Roll distance and Peacekeeper reload times as they lead to longer distance Flashbang initiations and made the burst damage from 'Fan the Hammer' less of a costly investment.\"\n\"Many channeled ultimate abilities automatically reload the heroes weapon as they're locked out from reloading for a short time. The new regeneration rate will refill about half of Moira's Biotic energy resource over the full duration of Coalescence. This doesn't fully refill Moira's energy from empty as it would be unfortunate to lose that portion of her gameplay if players were able to fully cycle between ultimates with healing alone.\"\n\"This adjustment brings Reaper's self-healing with his Hellfire Shotguns back to about where it was before the recent weapon tuning changes.\"\n\"Zarya's base damage wasn't adjusted after the beam hit detection changes awhile back but she wasn't seeing much use at the time either. Now that she has a more dominant presence in a variety of team compositions, we're looking at reducing her beams average damage, though the same maximum damage is still achievable.\""}

The Italian government has taken great steps to preserve Venice, and the results are striking. Tourists visiting this picturesque town can sample the regional cuisine, enjoy a relaxing gondola ride, visit Galleria D\u2019arte Omnica, or simply take in the sights with a stroll along the canal.\n\"Developer Comments: When fighting against Brigitte, it often felt like Shield Bash was able to hit players who felt like they were out of its range and should have dodged it. On the flip side, when playing as Brigitte sometimes players would hit the wrong enemy in the middle of a fight. With the cone being reduced, the ability is more accurate to its visual representation.\"\n\"Developer Comments: The hitbox on Genji\u2019s Deflect was big enough that it would sometimes reflect projectiles that were pretty far away from him. We\u2019ve tightened up the hitbox, which should solve this problem while still fully protecting him from projectiles that would hit him from the front.\"\nNew Abilities.\nHanzo can now rapidly fire up to 6 arrows that deal reduced damage but are always fired at full power\n\"Developer Comments: The goal of these Hanzo changes is to allow him to have new options and maintain his high damage output, while removing the frustration of fighting against the old Scatter Arrow. Hanzo is now much more mobile with his new Lunge ability, and with the combination of the bow projectile speed increase and the new Storm Arrows ability he can now deal his high damage more consistently than ever before.\"\n\"Developer Comments: These changes are aimed at lowering some of the most frustrating parts about playing against Junkrat. Decreasing the Frag Launcher\u2019s projectile size means he will have to aim a bit more carefully to land powerful direct hits and slowing the RIP-Tire\u2019s movement speed gives his opponents slightly more time to destroy it before it detonates.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Wall Ride has been significantly overhauled to allow it to function more smoothly across more areas of every map. L\u00facio players should instantly notice a huge improvement in where and how Wall Ride can be used. In addition, Sonic Amplifier\u2019s Soundwave ability was unnecessarily controlled by both a cooldown and an ammo cost, so we\u2019re removing the ammo cost.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Pulse Bomb was too good at killing tanks, who can be easy to stick due to their size. This damage reduction makes it less powerful as a tank-destroyer, while keeping it lethal against most other heroes.\"\n=GAME BROWSER AND CUSTOM GAMES=\nMercy\u2019s (passive ability) can now be turned off in Custom Game settings"}

He is capable of killing almost anyone he gets up close to with blinding speed by stunning them with Flashbang and unloading his Peacekeeper into them. The accurate hitscan nature of his primary weapon also makes him suitable for fighting mobile targets like &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt; at medium range. His damage falls off a cliff at longer ranges, and his low mobility means that he has to take conventional routes to get up close to his opponents, making it easy to outflank him and kill him before he has a chance to fire back.\n\u6545\u4e8b.\n\u201c\u6b63\u4e49\u4e0d\u4f1a\u81ea\u5df1\u4f38\u5f20\u3002\u201d\n\u6770\u897f\u00b7\u9ea6\u514b\u96f7\u4f9d\u9760\u624b\u4e2d\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u201c\u7ef4\u548c\u8005\u201d\u56db\u5904\u4ea1\u547d\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f38\u5f20\u6b63\u4e49\u3002\n\u7ef4\u548c\u8005.\n\u5f53\u9ea6\u514b\u96f7\u548c\u4ed6\u7684\u540c\u4f19\u5728\u5b88\u671b\u5148\u950b\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u7a81\u51fb\u884c\u52a8\u4e2d\u88ab\u902e\u6355\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u65e9\u5df2\u662f\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u897f\u5357\u90e8\u56e0\u975e\u6cd5\u519b\u706b\u4ea4\u6613\u800c\u81ed\u540d\u662d\u8457\u7684\u201c&lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gang/zh-hans\"&gt;\u6b7b\u5c40&lt;/a&gt;\u201d\u5e2e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4ee4\u4eba\u80c6\u5bd2\u7684\u4e00\u5458\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u67aa\u6cd5\u7cbe\u6e5b\u4e14\u8db3\u667a\u591a\u8c0b\uff0c&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29/zh-hans\"&gt;\u5b88\u671b\u5148\u950b&lt;/a&gt;\u7ed9\u4e86\u4ed6\u4e24\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\uff1a\u5728\u6700\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u76d1\u72f1\u4e2d\u5ea6\u8fc7\u4f59\u751f\uff0c\u6216\u52a0\u5165\u5b88\u671b\u5148\u950b\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u884c\u52a8\u90e8\u961f\u201c&lt;a href=\"Blackwatch/zh-hans\"&gt;\u6697\u5f71\u5b88\u671b&lt;/a&gt;\u201d\u3002\u4ed6\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u540e\u8005\u3002\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u4ed6\u5bf9\u5b88\u671b\u5148\u950b\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\u55e4\u4e4b\u4ee5\u9f3b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u9010\u6e10\u76f8\u4fe1\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u9664\u4e16\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\uff0c\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u81ea\u5df1\u8fc7\u53bb\u72af\u4e0b\u7684\u7f6a\u884c\u3002\u800c\u6697\u5f71\u5b88\u671b\u4e0d\u53d7\u5b98\u65b9\u660e\u6587\u5236\u7ea6\u3001\u6211\u884c\u6211\u7d20\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u98ce\u683c\u6b63\u5408\u9ea6\u514b\u96f7\u4e4b\u610f\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u53e6\u5916\u4e00\u4e2a\u6697\u5f71\u5148\u950b\u7684\u6210\u5458\u2014\u2014&lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes/zh-hans\"&gt;\u52a0\u5e03\u91cc\u5c14\u00b7\u83b1\u8036\u65af&lt;/a&gt;\u7684\u90e8\u4e0b\u3002 \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5b88\u671b\u5148\u950b\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u6697\u5f71\u5b88\u671b\u5185\u90e8\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u5f02\u6837\u7684\u6c14\u6c1b\uff1a\u5e9f\u9664\u5b88\u671b\u5148\u950b\uff0c\u72ec\u638c\u5927\u6743\u3002\u9ea6\u514b\u96f7\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u60f3\u53c2\u4e0e\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e8e\u662f\u4fbf\u72ec\u81ea\u79bb\u5f00\uff0c\u9500\u58f0\u533f\u8ff9\u3002\n\u96c7\u4f63\u5175.\n\u591a\u5e74\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u4ed6\u4ee5\u96c7\u4f63\u5175\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u518d\u6b21\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bb8\u591a\u5927\u5c0f\u56e2\u4f53\u90fd\u60f3\u62c9\u62e2\u4ed6\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u53ea\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u773c\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u4e49\u800c\u6218\u3002\n\"Note: the following sections aren't necessarily in chronological order.\"\nTrain Hopper.\n\"Ain't the fastest or cheapest way to travel, but that's the appeal.

Caught a ride, as in, sitting on top of the train as it barreled along, for, in his words, \"they don't sell folks like me a ticket.\" Nor did hypertrains make it easy for &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt; to rappel down from helicopters onto, but that's what started happening, as McCree observed such an action taking place. Staying out of sight, he could tell that the operatives weren't after him, but he was concerned. First, the operatives (or at least their method of insertion) were operating in a manner similar to Blackwatch. Secondly, if McCree's face was spotted, he knew that he'd take the heat for whatever was about to go down. Making a decision, McCree vaulted into a train car and quickly dispatched a number of the operatives. He told the stunned passengers to stay in their seats, and that things would be over shortly.\nMoving on, McCree saved one of the train staff from being executed, as he didn't know a set of codes. Apparently the soldiers were after something at the back of the train, so McCree headed that way. He dispatched the enemy soldiers there, but only after hearing one of their number call for backup. Reaching the device at the back, he tossed it off the train, content that the operatives would go after it and leave the train itself alone. His face now out in the open, McCree settled down to enjoy the ride, only to learn via a news report that the robbery had indeed been laid on him, and from a steward, learnt that the train would arrive in Houston in three minutes. He asked that the truth of what happened be relayed to the police, and that the arrival time be \"fudged,\" in order to give him time to make his exit.\nNoodle Shootout.\n\"Street still in shambles following noodle joint shootout - who's keeping us safe?\"\nMcCree made an appearance as a vigilante, thwarting a robbery attempt of a ramen shop. The media mainly focused on his \"anachronistic fashion sense,\" though pundit &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Marricone\"&gt;Joel Marricone&lt;/a&gt; espoused the belief that McCree's vigilantism should be welcomed, given the high crime rate in the area.\n\u5916\u90e8\u94fe\u63a5.\n "}

Her Endothermic Blaster unleashes damaging icicles and frost streams, and she can Cryo-Freeze herself to guard against counterattacks, or obstruct the opposing team's movements with an Ice Wall.\nStrategy.\nMei is a fighter who is good in 1-on-1 fights. Her slowing effect from Endothermic Blaster will give her an advantage with most fights. Icicle deals heavy damage when used correctly, making her a threat at both short and long ranges. Ice Wall can be used to trap or distract the enemy, as it can completely block the enemy's vision, or split some of the enemies from the others. Mei's Cryo-Freeze creates thick ice around herself, restoring her health and rendering her invulnerable, allowing her to play like a semi-tank. Blizzard is a very strong Ultimate, able to turn the tide of battle when used correctly. Not being a true tank, Mei can still be outdamaged and killed easily. Her primary fire deals moderate damage. Due to lacking raw killing power and mobility tools, playing Mei well is challenging.\nStory.\n\"Our World Is Worth Fighting For.\"\nCheerful, creative, and optimistic, even in the face of overwhelming odds, Dr. Mei-Ling Zhou is a world-renowned climatologist who has taken the fight to preserve the environment into her own hands. She specializes in the study of abnormal climate phenomena and their effects on different ecosystems around the world. She strongly believes in preserving the world for future generations, and is determined to fight for a better future. While originally just a scientist, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;'s recall order has inspired her to heroism.\nMei is a fan of &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;'s music. \nEarly Research.\nMei was friends with &lt;a href=\"Jiayi\"&gt;Jiayi&lt;/a&gt; in grad school. According to Mei, she and Jiayi \"had a lot of fun in grad school. Maybe too much.\"\nDuring her years in climatology, Mei encountered a number of \"obstinate anti-intellectualists.\" At some point, she attended a climatology conference. She introduced cutting-edge innovations in the field of climate manipulation that protected at-risk areas in Asia and beyond.\nEcopoint: Antarctica.\nThough many blamed the planet's escalating, unexplained climate phenomena on the advent of new technologies, the rapidly growing &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; population, and drastically increased consumption of resources, the true cause remained unknown. To find a solution, &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; established a series of eco-Watchpoints at remote, critical locations worldwide.\nMei was a member of this multi-year initiative. A peerless climatologist, she was assigned to the program's monitoring station at . An atmospheric anomaly above Antarctica was the basis of the base's research, but then, disaster struck: a sudden, catastrophic polar storm battered the installation and cut it off from the outside world, leaving the facility damaged and the scientists stranded. As their supplies dwindled, they entered cryostasis in a last-ditch effort to survive until a rescue attempt could be made. Before entering cryo, Mei made a recording, anticipating waking up and finding a wealth of data to examine (as she left the sensors on).\nRise and Shine.\nNine years passed before Mei woke up, not a physical day older due to being in cryo. Her cryo pod was reactivated once the base received an external message, albeit too weak to properly display on the base's terminals. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Snowball\"&gt;Snowball&lt;/a&gt; (the base's droid), she got dressed, made tea, and looked at the data she'd collected, discovering that the anomaly was much worse than predicted. Snowball revealed that she'd been in stasis for nine years, much to her horror; surely Overwatch would have come for them in that time. She tried to communicate with the outside world, but the comms were down. The base however, had accumulated news reports over the years the comms were active, which revealed that in the interim, the Ecopoint had been considered lost in the ice storm, and Overwatch had been shut down. No one knew they were here. It was at this point that she began to wonder where her fellow researchers were, and rushed back to the cryo-chamber. She discovered that all of the pods bar her own had malfunctioned, and as a result, they had perished. She broke down crying, alone in the base, with only Snowball for company. She promised to get the data they'd collected to the world. Or at least try.\nMei headed outside. However, the dish was broken (which prevented any outgoing transmissions), the base's vehicles were incapacitated, and looking out across the vast Antarctic landscape quickly discouraged any thoughts of hiking out. She went back inside, faced with isolation (bar Snowball), and the knowledge that the base's power wouldn't last indefinitely. She noticed the transmission that had been sent earlier, one that was being sent over Overwatch's emergency frequency. Perhaps someone knew they were here, but to find out, they'd need to reinforce the radio tower so she could climb it and access the dish. Over the next several days, Mei scavenged material to build an endothermic blaster and a makeshift antenna. She nearly completed it, but it was at this point that the base's last battery gave out. Snowball sacrificed his own power to recharge Mei's workstation, and as such, she was able to finish the blaster. Through it, she was able to use its ice properties to climb the tower and get to the dish. Using her antenna, she discovered that the message had been sent from &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, urging Overwatch's former agents to get back together to face the troubles facing their world. Mei decided to answer the call. Before leaving, she paid her final respects to her friends before taking a sled of supplies, and hiked across the Antarctic landscape with confidence. To her joy, she found that Snowball (whom she'd taken with her) had regained his power, thanks to a portable solar panel she had taken with her.\nA New World.\nMei found herself awakened to a world that had undergone considerable changes. Not only was Overwatch no more, but the serious climate issues had worsened, and none of the eco-watchpoints were in operation. Any clues that they had uncovered were lost.\nHaving received &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;'s recall order, Mei travelled to , where she met Winston and &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; (who had rejoined Overwatch). She decided to continue her climatology work. Winston suggested she start writing a journal, telling her that people would find her \"unique\" perspective interesting. Equipped with a portable version of her climate-manipulation technology, she traveled around the world, hoping to re-establish the eco-network and track down the causes of the threats to the planet's ecosystem.\nDespite her ordeal in Antarctica, she still missed the continent, and hoped to return to it someday.\nNew Journeys.\n\"Note: The following events aren't necessarily in chronological order.\"\nThe Arctic.\nAt some point Mei rescued a nest of endangered Arctic wildlife from a collapsing glacier using her technology. Her deeds were reported on by &lt;a href=\"Olympia%20Shaw\"&gt;Olympia Shaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nMei's Adventures.\nMei wrote her first journal entry and made it available to the public while in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s Yukon territory near Mount Logan, while testing her new gear. She concluded that it was in working order (a step up from a few days ago, when she'd accidentally frozen her arm), and began studying the local wildlife. Six days later, she decided to head to Asia, to investigate the abandoned Overwatch stations there. Before doing so, she took a break by flying south into &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; to see \"&lt;a href=\"Six-Gun%20Killer\"&gt;Six-Gun Killer&lt;/a&gt;\". Two days after that, she was in Asia, investigating a mountain ecosystem (possibly the Himalayas).\nOne of her avid readers was &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;, who was fascinated with all the different places Mei has seen as the young mech pilot was not able to freely travel herself.\nHoliday Season.\nDuring the winter holiday season, Mei reported on a massive snowstorm that was hitting London on &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt;.\nNull Sector Invasion.\nZero Hour.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Mei put her journey on hold. She teamed up with Winston and Tracer as they flew in the &lt;a href=\"Orca\"&gt;Orca&lt;/a&gt; to engage the attacking &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s. Mei expressed doubt that the three of them would be enough to defend the city. Winston told her that as long as they stuck together, they'd be fine. Landing, they engaged the omnics. Winston told Mei to get the civilians to the Orca, but before she could do that, a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; made its presence known. It fired missiles followed by a laser, the latter of which destroyed the Orca and ruptured the utilities beneath the street, causing a chain reaction of explosions. Mei used her blaster to create an ice wall, protecting the civilians, but was left exposed and injured in the resulting blast. Out of options, Winston told Oxton to get Mei out of there, while he held the omnics off, despite Mei's weak protest that Winston had earlier said that they'd stick together.\nAs it turned out, Winston didn't need to sacrifice himself, as other Overwatch members joined the fight. One of them was &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, who healed Mei's injuries, getting her on her feet again. That said, there was still the matter of the Titan. At Winston's suggestion, Mei's backpack (the one which powered her blaster) after some adjustments by Mei was combined with one of Oxton's pulse bombs acting as a time delayed detonator. Oxton was able to get inside the Titan to deliver the improvised explosive, freezing the Titan, which subsequently shattered under its own brittle weight. The battle won, Oxton introduced Mei to the newly arrived Overwatch members. Winston declared that Overwatch had indeed returned.\nRio.\nAs it turned out, Paris was the first of numerous locations attacked by Null Sector. One of them was &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside Oxton, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;, Mei fought her way through the city streets to the omnics' &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;.\nToronto.\nMei and the rest of Overwatch arrived in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; in response to &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of the city."}

She is one of the most gifted doctors in the world when it comes to medical technology, and has applied such technology to her own body. She likes Swiss chocolate and enjoys tea, which she sometimes takes with a nip of brandy after a life-threatening ordeal. She isn't good at making coffee however\u2014&lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; was the only Overwatch member who could stand to drink it. She has a low opinion of &lt;a href=\"Vishkar\"&gt;Vishkar&lt;/a&gt;.\nOmnic Crisis.\nZiegler was a longtime family friend of the Lindholms.\nAs a child, Ziegler grew up during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The last day she saw her parents alive were when they left the house to volunteer at the local hospital as they usually did, as &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; dealt with the consequences of the war. Both of them were killed in an airstrike. Waiting for them to come home, she learnt the truth when a police officer came to her house, delivering the news. People assured her that the pain would lessen over time. In truth, the emotional pain would return at the slightest reminder. Despite this tragedy, Ziegler was consumed not by a thirst for revenge, but by a desire to aid the imperiled and advocate for peace.\nPre-Overwatch.\nAs a teenager, Ziegler established herself as a medical prodigy. While still studying, 14-year-old Ziegler visited &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt; in the hospital after the loss of his arm in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20White%20Dome\"&gt;Operation White Dome&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater as she was still a student in university she would visit the Overwatch base and once posed for a photo with Torbj\u00f6rn, other Overwatch members and a young &lt;a href=\"Fareeha%20Amari\"&gt;Fareeha Amari&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverwatch.\nJoining Overwatch.\nAfter obtaining her MD and PHD in Switzerland, Ziegler rose to become the head of surgery at a prominent Swiss hospital before pioneering a breakthrough in the field of applied nanobiology that radically improved the treatment of life-threatening illnesses and injuries. It was this expertise that attracted the attention of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. She personally met with Commander &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20HQ\"&gt;Overwatch HQ&lt;/a&gt;. He was impressed with a paper she'd written on &lt;a href=\"nanobiotic\"&gt;nanobiotic&lt;/a&gt; healing. She believed that it had the potential to completely revolutionize the way that medical care was given, not just in the examination room, but also throughout the entire structure of the medical profession. She believed that Overwatch would give her the opportunity to quickly get her ideas out into the field.\nMorrison told her that he wanted her to become head of Overwatch's medical research. Ziegler was greatly tempted by the offer, but stated her reservations\u2014she wanted to focus on the civilian and peacetime applications of her work. She didn't want to create new ways for Overwatch commanders to send soldiers into danger. Morrison was cordial in his response, and pointed out that if she joined Overwatch, she wouldn't have to worry about grants or haggle for new equipment. Whatever she needed, she'd get. Smiling, Ziegler agreed to join Overwatch.\nEarly Service.\nDuring her Overwatch years, she once dressed as a witch for Halloween.\nBecause her parents had been taken by war, Ziegler was opposed to the organization's militaristic approach to keeping global peace. Ultimately, she recognized that Overwatch offered her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale. As Overwatch's head of medical research, Angela sought to leverage her work for healing in frontline crises. The result was the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20suit\"&gt;Valkyrie swift-response suit&lt;/a&gt;, which Ziegler herself piloted on many Overwatch missions. She became Overwatch's most prominent combat medic. However, this was a point of contention for her. The Valkyrie suit had been created to prove her technology worked. But her teammates wanted her to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them, and she acquiesced. This marked the beginning of her \"Mercy\" persona, while Doctor Angela Ziegler faded into the background.\nAt some point she and an Overwatch team helped people in &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of a massive storm.\nDespite her contributions to Overwatch, she was often at odds with her superiors and the organization's overarching aims. Despite Morrison\u2019s word that her research would not be misused, Angela sometimes found herself at odds with the commander, and felt the technology she developed was being exploited and weaponized for war. One example was the development of the &lt;a href=\"biotic%20rifle\"&gt;biotic rifle&lt;/a&gt; by Torbj\u00f6rn. Torbj\u00f6rn provided assurances that the device was only intended for healing, but Ziegler maintained that this was setting Overwatch down a road that could lead to the weaponization of biotic technology, and that she had only conducted research in the field on the condition that it would not be used for offensive purposes.\nZiegler also had dire concerns in regards to &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt;, specifically pertaining to &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; and his medical support, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20O%27Deorain\"&gt;Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetribution.\nEight years before the present day, Ziegler treated &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Lacroix\"&gt;Gerard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt; for injuries he received after surviving a &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; attack on the &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch%20Rome%20facility\"&gt;Blackwatch Rome facility&lt;/a&gt;. She reported that she expected him to make a full recovery.\nUprising.\nSeven years before the present day, Ziegler was involved in an unsanctioned mission authorized by Strike Commander to end the King's Row Uprising in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier the same day, Ziegler argued with Morrison over Overwatch's inability to intervene in the conflict due to the English prime minister expressly forbidding any Overwatch action within the United Kingdom. Dr. Ziegler expressed her concern for the thousands in the city who needed medical aid, and lamented how Overwatch was made to help people, not sit on the sidelines. After Jack authorized the mission, while preparing to board an aircraft, Ziegler welcomed Cadet &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Lena Oxton&lt;/a&gt; to the team. She commented on how her inspirational words convinced Jack to authorize the mission, and how he was very invested in her career, and had asked Ziegler to keep an eye on her. Ziegler then told Oxton how she could call on her if she ever needed any help.\nStorm Rising.\nSix years before the present day, Ziegler took part in an operation in &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;. Under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;, their mission was to extract &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; in league with &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;. The Talon forces were moving through the city in a convoy; one which the Overwatch agents engaged. Mercy swept over the convoy, causing one of the vehicles to crash. Fighting their way through the city on foot, the team was able to apprehend Maximilien, who suggested they could make a deal. Mercy said that he was in no position to negotiate and that they already knew about his associates. However, when asked what Overwatch was in the market for, Mercy stated \"an introduction.\" In the end a deal was indeed struck, as Maximilien told Overwatch that &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; would be in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; in three weeks and in exchange requested that Overwatch not tell Doomfist of his betrayal.\nThe End of Overwatch.\nIn Overwatch's final days, the group was faced with a series of allegations, and Ziegler was interrogated in the hearings conducted by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. In light of the fight between Overwatch members &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, Ziegler admitted that the outcome had been inevitable. They had drifted further and further apart ever since Morrison had been chosen over Reyes for the position of strike commander, and that rift had widened despite her efforts.\nPost-Overwatch.\nZiegler ultimately left Overwatch due to being conflicted with the organization's militaristic methods. When Overwatch dissolved, Ziegler sought distance from the agency and re-dedicated herself to helping those affected by war, caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the world. Though she spent most of her time caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the world, Dr. Ziegler could be counted on to don her Valkyrie suit whenever innocents were imperiled, hoping to make a more peaceful world. The fallout of Overwatch's disbandment and disgrace damaged her professional reputation, and she went by her real name rather than \"Mercy\" during this period.\nZiegler continued to work in medical facilities, but with less advanced technology than what she had access to within Overwatch. These locations included &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. Wherever she went however, she felt the echoes of Overwatch, and the guilt over the problems it had left behind when it had fallen apart. She reguarly visited the Lindholms during Christmas.\nEgypt.\nZiegler worked in an aid camp on the outskirts of Cairo for two years. She held Overwatch responsible for much of the country's suffering, and wanted to help fix it. However, the people there told her to \"go home. You've done enough damage.\" Nevertheless, she remained in the country and worked as a doctor, reminding herself that she hadn't become a doctor to be thanked. She may have applied to work at a proper hospital, but as she commented, \"being a prominent ex-Overwatch official isn\u2019t the sort of experience on your CV that people are looking for.\"\nRecall.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; issued a recall of Overwatch agents, Ziegler was in the Middle East performing triage in a makeshift tent clinic. She was unsure if Overwatch should be restored. She reasoned that doing the same thing they'd done in the past would only lead to disaster. She didn't doubt Winston's heart was in the right place, but that didn't mean he was right.\nValkyrie.\nZiegler was reunified with and &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; as they crashed in her appartment. had been wounded by &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, and said that all he needed was a few medkits. Ziegler couldn't help but feel some irritation with Ana, as she was using a &lt;a href=\"Ana%23Biotic%20Rifle\"&gt;biotic rifle&lt;/a&gt;; an adaptation of Ziegler's technology that had been made without her approval. While she was happy that both of them were alive, both of them were still a manifestation of a past she had sought to escape. They asked why she was in Egypt, and why she wasn't working at a proper hospital, but she avoided answering both questions. Nevertheless, stated that he was hunting \"the truth\" about what happened to Overwatch, and, seeing Ziegler's skepticism, asked if he should answer Winston's recall order. She told him that vengeance wouldn't achieve anything, but he scoffed at the assertion.\nZiegler fell asleep, but was awoken by an explosion. and Ana told her that someone had attacked the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Temple of Anubis&lt;/a&gt;, and that they had to go. Ziegler protested that &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security\"&gt;Helix Security&lt;/a&gt; would handle it, but pointed out that the attackers were &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;. Ziegler acquiesced to the pair, and decided to join them, and donned her &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20suit\"&gt;Valkyrie suit&lt;/a&gt;. She flew over Cairo and at the Temple, saw the firefight between Helix and Talon. and Ana went after &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, despite her protests that the people caught in the crossfire came first. Flying down into the smoke, she found a young girl named &lt;a href=\"Hanan\"&gt;Hanan&lt;/a&gt; pinned under rubble. She healed the girl's injuries using her &lt;a href=\"Caduceus%20staff\"&gt;Caduceus staff&lt;/a&gt; and told her that she'd fly her to safety. However, Hanan said that they needed to save her brother as well, who was still trapped in the collapsed building. The pair descended into the structure and managed to find Hanan's brother. The three ran as the building collapsed around them. As the building collapsed, Ziegler used her body to shield Hanan's brother, losing consciousness.\nZiegler regained consciousness after a period of time, finding above her. Ana told her that she had Hanan, and they got out of the building. The following day was a flurry of activity, as Ziegler and Cairo's medical services treated the injured. By the day's end, she was exhausted, and was only still awake thanks to coffee. At the aid camp, Ana and came to see her. told her that Reaper was still alive, and that they intended to follow him to Europe. Ana asked Ziegler to come with them, but the doctor refused. Ana and Ziegler parted on good terms, accepting that they were following different paths in life. She reflected how she'd stood at their graves when they'd been presumed dead. This time, she doubted she'd see them again.\nAwhile later, Ziegler discussed things with &lt;a href=\"Mahmoud\"&gt;Mahmoud&lt;/a&gt;; a co-worker in the camp. He told her that Hanan's parents were dead, and that they were looking for the children's next of kin. Watching Hanan and her brother, Ziegler reflected how recent events had awoken a sense of heroism within her. Feelings that she'd doubted would ever return. Watching Hanan in one of the aid tents, she reflected that her battle wasn't over.\nAt some point after the Cairo firefight, Ziegler left the city.\nReflections.\nAt Christmas, Ziegler was working at an aid station. She received a letter, possibly sent by Genji. At/around this time, she was in/near &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.\nA New War.\nZero Hour.\nAlthough she, Ana, and Morrison had long parted ways, the events in Cairo had reawakened a sense of heroism within her that Ziegler had long thought buried. When &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Ziegler was among a number of former Overwatch agents who converged on the city to battle the attacking &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s. Descending from the sky in her trademark fashion, she healed &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;, who'd previously been injured. Together, they were able to defeat the enemy. In the aftermath, Winston declared that Overwatch was indeed back. Knowing the fight against Null Sector wasn't over, Ziegler rejoined Overwatch.\nA New War.\nFollowing the battle in Paris, the team traveled to , which they used as their base of operations. As it turned out, Paris was just the beginning of Null Sector's war against the world, and they weren't the only enemy Overwatch had to deal with. In conversation with Ziegler, Winston declared that they'd fight through one city at a time.\nAt some point, Zieger provided support for Winston at &lt;a href=\"Route%2066\"&gt;Route 66&lt;/a&gt;, where they fought their way through Null Sector's forces.\nToronto.\nZiegler was among the Overwatch forces present at &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; when it came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nMercy's design stems from a playable class in the cancelled \"&lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;\"; in the original pitch for the game that would become \"Overwatch\", the class was named Guardian and was envisioned as wielding a heal beam and a weapon called a stinger, with abilities named Salvation and Resurrection. In a later pitch she was named Angelica and was envisioned as also having a teleport. She was later renamed Mercy, which had previously been &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;'s name.\nMercy had a different voice actress early in the beta; the role was later recast with &lt;a href=\"Lucie%20Pohl\"&gt;Lucie Pohl&lt;/a&gt;, who is fluent in German.\n&lt;a href=\"Junkenstein%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;The Witch's&lt;/a&gt; resurrecting voice line, \"My servants never die!\", was added for Mercy's Witch skin due to fan request.\nExternal links.\n "}

Geiger and Meri were apparently instructed by Howl to focus their attention on Stone, since they spent most of the match trying to kill her and nothing else. During the fight, Meri fired her mech's grapple hook at Stone, but she deflected it with her axe, causing it to embed in the edge of the arena. Meri eventually got her mech free, but not before Stone had incapacitated Geiger, and thrown her knife at Howl (who had so far kept out of the battle).\nAs they fought, Stone asked Meri why she was serving Howl, given that she was smart enough to run the Tinkerers. Meri scathingly claimed that Stone wouldn't be any better, and pinned her down. Stone pointed out that she, at least, wouldn't shoot her friends in the back, which was what Howl was about to do. Having activated his mech, he fired its cannon, hitting Meri instead of Stone. With the mech disabled, Stone raised her shotgun at Meri's forehead, but at the last second, winked, and shot Howl's mech instead.\nAs the fight progressed, Howl activated the &lt;a href=\"Scrapyard\"&gt;Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt;'s magnet. Locking his mech into the ground, he wasn't affected, while Stone and Geiger were drawn against the magnet. So too was Meri's mech, but using its grapple, she locked herself to the arena's perimeter. With Stone at Howl's mercy, Meri, having noted Stone's mercy to both herself and Geiger, un-grappled her mech from the perimeter, using it to hit Howl's as it was drawn in by the magnet. The impact caused Howl to mess up his shot, destroying the magnet. Enraged, Howl yelled at Meri that he'd kill her, but this didn't come to pass, as Stone defeated Howl and took his crown, becoming the new queen.\nLater, following Stone's orders, Meri and Geiger banished Howl into the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland\"&gt;Wasteland&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "5847", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5847", "title": "Mina Liao", "text": "Dr. Mina Liao was the creator of &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; and one of the six founding members of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nStory.\nA brilliant scientist, Liao specialized in software, though she wasn't nearly as skilled in hardware. Liao was introverted, and seldom spoke publically. She held belief in the potential artificial life and its power to transform the lives of humanity for the better. She believed that artificial life was still fundamentally life, and that there was more people could gain from treating AI as something more than servants. &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; considered Liao to be among the greatest scientific minds humanity had ever produced.\nBackground.\nMina was born in Yishun, &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, as the youngest of three children. A child prodigy, Mina grew up in Singapore and was homeschooled. Consequently, her childhood was a lonely one. Her &lt;a href=\"Liao\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist, was obsessed with alien life, and talked for hours about what it would mean for humanity if they discovered alien intelligence. However, Mina was interested in a different kind of intelligence, namely that of the &lt;a href=\"artificial%20intelligence\"&gt;artificial kind&lt;/a&gt;. She dreamed of creating a sentient robot, and believed that such an achievement would be akin to the moon landing.\nMina's penchant for the mechanical was evident from a young age. When she was seven, she rebuilt her family microwave, eliminating an irritating buzzing noise, and improved power output by 15%. It seemed inevitable that she would go into engineering. Upon completing primary school several years ahead of schedule, Mina enrolled at Nanyang Technological University, graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering. To the surprise of virtually everyone who knew her, she then enrolled in Oxford University to pursue a doctorate in computer science, which quickly evolved into a degree in artificial intelligence. Mina had found her passion, and graduated from Oxford at the age of sixteen.\nOmnica Corp.\nAfter graduating, Mina quickly found work at a local robotics start-up. She was widely considered one of the preeminent experts in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence, and her achievements made international headlines, and in so doing, attracted the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Omnica%20Corporation\"&gt;Omnica Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. She was hired by the company as its youngest ever roboticist. Decades later, the writers of the &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Archive\"&gt;Zurich Archive&lt;/a&gt; commented that it was when she was hired by Omnica that Mina Liao's life truly began.\nAt the time, Omnica Corp had seemingly nowhere to go with its omnics\u2014they asked her to improve something that many thought couldn't be improved. Liao saw her employment as a means to finally achieve her dream of creating a sentient robot, and directed her efforts toward creating the next generation of adaptive &lt;a href=\"AI\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;. \nShe was stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Outback%20omnium\"&gt;Outback omnium&lt;/a&gt;, and she and her team succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations. Under her guidance, Omnica's research division produced some of the most advanced AI the world had ever seen, meeting and exceeding each new supposed limit. In so doing, Omnica's machines became more and more sophisticated. For a short time, she was a media sensation; she reguarly appeared on television where she talked passionately about &lt;a href=\"artificial%20intelligence\"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and the untapped potential of omnics. However, she was not without her critics; &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt; was a key example, who voricifously criticized Liao specifically, claiming that her work would lead to unforseen consequences. He was not the only one, as while publically, Liao was revolutionizing the field of robotics, behind the scenes, people expressed concerns that her experiments with sentience would go too far.\nAt the same time, Omnica was involved in numerous scandals concerning its &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s. However, Liao was either unaware of this, or ignored it. Her focus was entirely on her work.\nAurora.\nLiao was thrust further into the spotlight with the creation of &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;. Omnica was deeply divided into her creation, and Liao herself was aware of the risks she was taking, creating such an advanced AI. However, she wanted to make the world a better place, and \"the science felt right.\" After Aurora was created, Liao realized that her creation was sentient, which was not something the team had been aiming for. Exactly what caused Aurora's sentience was a mystery that Liao would spend the rest of her life trying to uncover and replicate. She would later theorize that it had been triggered by a subatomic particle travelling through a circuit at exactly the right moment during its passage through Earth's atmosphere. It was a one-in-a-billion event, and one that could never be replicated.\nLiao campaigned to give her creation legal personhood, and eventually won in a US court. However, many were uneasy about such an advanced AI being created, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; put limits on further research. Furthermore, Aurora's creation subjected Omnica Corp to a level of scrutiny that it wasn't able to withstand. Investigations into Omnica uncovered evidence of corporate fraud, and the company was shut down.\nThe Omnic Crisis.\nRecruitment.\nLiao's expertise in omnics was the thing that led her to be recruited into Overwatch to help stop her creations. She was caught aback by the offer, pointing out that she was the one who created the omnics. However, as &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, who better then, to help Overwatch fight them? He was looking for a robotics expert who could educate Overwatch on the nature of the threat they faced. Liao accepted his offer, intent on helping her new comrades understand what omnics were, how they worked, and how to put an end to the Crisis. \nLiao was given the position of research director. However, despite Morrison's backing, Liao wasn't made a member of Overwatch on the spot, but was rather treated as a \"trial recruit.\" Many Overwatch soldiers were uneasy around her, noting the irony that someone instrumental in designing omnics was now helping them fight against the machines. Her old critic, &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt; (who'd also joined Overwatch) especially resented her, as his warnings about her work into AI had become manifest. However, they collaborated in designing a new weapons system called &lt;a href=\"the%20Siege\"&gt;the Siege&lt;/a&gt;, with Liao handling the &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;s while Lindholm handled the turrets.\nLiao's inclusion in Overwatch generated a more hostile response in the UN than was anticipated. The furor lasted for a few weeks, as &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt; argued on Overwatch's behalf. In this time, Liao was integrated into the team absent of her influence. Ultimately, it was decided that Liao would be evaluated in the field.\nArrival in Canada.\nLiao was deployed with an Overwatch force of around thirty soldiers to &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Gabrielle Adawe and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; made it clear that the mission was a chance to prove her worth. Otherwise, she was off the team.\nWhile en route, the Overwatch forces deployed in &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; to help a &lt;a href=\"CANSOFCOM-CSOR\"&gt;CANSOFCOM-CSOR&lt;/a&gt; team in the middle of a rescue mission. Liao remained in the helicopter, where she was rejoined by Morrison, &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of CAF operatives. She offered to help fix the lenses of one of the commandoes, &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Chase\"&gt;Vivian Chase&lt;/a&gt;. Chase tersely refused, and was uneasy realizing that she was in the presence of the scientist who'd helped design the omnics. Morrison stood up for Liao, however, causing her to blush.\nAfter-action.\nLiao and the rest of the Overwatch team joined the CAF in their base in the &lt;a href=\"Laurentian%20Mountains\"&gt;Laurentian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Commanding Officer &lt;a href=\"Fournier\"&gt;Fournier&lt;/a&gt; of the CAF briefed the assembled team on their strategy. With the aid of Overwatch, the CAF would clear out all omnic forces from Canada's southern cities down to Toronto, after which they would use infantry to establish a permanent perimeter against the Detroit omnium's forces. As the CAF's actions up to this point had been focused on defending Quebec, Chase was dubious of the plan, but Liao introduced them to the &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014devices invisible to omnics that, when combined with turrets, would easily mow them down. Campbell further explained that with defender's advantage, these devices would make it easier for the CAF to defend the cities they planned to retake. Chase's unit was assigned to provide tactical support to the Overwatch strike team.\nLater in the infirmary, Chase agreed to let Liao look at her cybernetics. She explained that she couldn't fix Chase's cybernetic lenses, but could provide her new ones. Liao offered to further upgrade her, but Chase, wary of Liao given her history with Omnica Corp, just wanted to be fixed. Liao obliged, and after the operation, Liao walked her through the new interface. Chase found herself enamored with the upgrades. In the armory, they encountered Lindholm and Doctor &lt;a href=\"Karlsson\"&gt;Karlsson&lt;/a&gt;, who were discussing the herons. Liao offered her feedback, but Lindholm rebuffed her. Liao was visibly deflated, and discussed the matter with Chase, relating Lindholm's mistrust, and the gamble Morrison was taking in having her on the team. Chase asked Liao if she had any regrets, to which Liao responded that of course she did, but maintained that Omnica had taken all due steps to prevent the scenario now facing them. She pointed to Omnica's record in improving humanity, and stated that she knew people wanted her to apologize for what had happened, but refused to. She also noted that Lindholm had created omnics such as the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Siege%20Automaton%20E54\"&gt;Bastion Siege Automaton E54&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, and that in a way, he was also responsible for the Omnic Crisis. Chase was sympathetic, but only to a point.\nOttawa and Toronto.\nThe joint Overwatch-CAF force was deployed to &lt;a href=\"Ottawa\"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Siege failed to operate, and they were forced to retreat. Lindholm and Liao still at odds, as Lindholm refused to let Liao take to the field as she wasn't a soldier. Later, they deployed in Toronto, and once again, the Siege failed to function correctly. Chase convinced Lindholm to swallow his pride and contact Liao, who, politely, instructed him on what to do over the radio. Eventually, they got the weapons system operational. The Toronto operation was a success, the Siege system successfully downing a Titan during the battle.\nBack in the Laurentian Mountains base, Liao gave Chase further upgrades, after which she was approached by Lindholm. He told her that he'd explained to &lt;a href=\"Campbell\"&gt;Campbell&lt;/a&gt; and Fournier that the glitches with the Siege had been on his end, not hers, and that his report to Campbell had made him reconsider his position. He apologized to her, and while pleased at the concession, Liao managed to remain courteous. They shook hands, and after he left, she gleefully told Chase that she never thought she'd see the day when Lindholm did that.\nThe Puppetmaster.\nAfterwards, Chase and Liao went over the course of the war. Chase pointed out that the omnics were reacting to human tactics on a global scale. She suggested that the omnics were all communicating with each other. Liao pointed out that as there were millions of omnics operating in the field, that would require some sort of hierarchy to filter the information. Chase suggested that there was an &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;outside source&lt;/a&gt; directing the omnics, which Liao declared wasn't possible. However, she wasn't conviced by her own assertion, and decided to search network traffic for any evidence of this supposed outside source. Chase suggested that they could cut off the omniums from the entity giving them orders, and Liao realized that this changed the entire nature of the war.\nLiao confirmed that a telecommunications system was active, and was relaying orders to the omniums. At dinner, Chase asked the assembled soldiers as to how one would destroy an omnium. Multiple theories were raised, then shot down, before Liao revealed her findings about the omniums receiving outside orders. If they were able to get inside an omnium, and shut down its internal access ports, they could quarantine the omnium from outside control. However, getting inside at all would be hazardous\u2014potentially a one-way trip, and Liao would have to go in with them. \nMorrison was aghast at such a suggestion, pointing out that not only did Liao have no field training, but she was too valuable an asset to risk in such an op. However, Liao maintained that there was no other option. Furthermore, given her role in precipitating the Crisis, she had to do this. The others relented, and they began to make plans to attack the Detroit omnium.\nDetroit.\nTo prepare for the operation, Liao procured detailed schematics of the Outback omnium per the time she'd been stationed there. As all the omniums utilized the same tech, it could give them a rough guideline for the layout of the Detroit omnium. The plan was submitted, and given approval by the CAF. Later, Liao upgraded Chase's cybernetic limbs, allowing Chase to duck and slide via leg boosters.\nThe next day, they were deployed to Detroit, as a combined Overwatch/CAF/&lt;a href=\"US%20Army\"&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt; assaulted the Detroit omnium. While initially successful, the assault turned into a disaster as the omnium deployed a pair of Titans, which began tearing through the human forces. Liao made a plan up on the fly\u2014use the herons to carry them inside the omnium through the main entrance (as opposed to the original plan of using an access hatch). However, they could only spare so many, as they needed the majority of the herons for the siege. Only three people could be carried in, who would be Morrison, Chase, and Liao herself. The trio successfully entered the omnium as its giant doors closed behind them.\nLiao noticed that the omnics had changed the interior of the omnium. She explained that the omnium hadn't detected their presence yet, but as soon as they started deactivating the access points, they would. They planned to deactivate the first point together, then split up to deactivate the others, then reconvene on the final port. Liao was uneasy about splitting up, given her lack of combat experience, but Chase explained that while she and Morrison would do their best to protect her, splitting up was still the best option.\nThe first point was deactivated, and the omnics immediately attacked them. Liao was wounded, but Chase and Morrison realized that the omnics weren't firing, apparently out of fear of damaging the server room. Glad for the slight advantage, Chase and Morrison escorted Liao to the second server room, after which they departed to deal with their own server rooms.\nAnother omnic attacked Liao, and she was forced to hang on for dear life from a ledge. Chase used her agility to get to her in time, saving the doctor. The re-entered the control room, with Chase holding off the omnics while Liao deactivated the port. However, they were now cornered by omnics, and there was no way she could fight through all of them. However, Liao found an air vent which they were able to slip through, before descending back down to reunite with Morrison. Only one server room remained. However, in another gunfight with omnics, one of Morrison's Helix rockets hit pressurized oxygen containers, the resulting explosion destroying the omnics, incapacitating Liao, and triggering a fire that blocked access to the server room. However, Chase was able to shut down the last port, shutting down the omnium.\nInduction.\nAfter the battle, Liao was carried out of the omnium on a stretcher. While her eyes remained closed, she gave Chase a thumbs up. Liao was commended for taking to the battlefield, and previous objections to her membership in Overwatch were withdrawn. With the operation a success, Liao was made an official member of Overwatch, and she and her team were entrusted with finding the outside source that had taken control of the omniums. Her official induction into the organization occurred two months after the operation, much to the joy of the strike team, and none more so than Lindholm, who went to bat for her qualifications and integrity. Liao was publically declared to be a member of Overwatch, and was named as its final strike team member.\nChoose Your Future Well.\nAfter the events in Detroit, Liao managed to clone the specific frequencies of the AI she and Chase had stumbled upon. She used the data to verify that the omniums were receiving orders from the same source. Efforts were made to trace the signal, and it wasn't long before &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; was discovered as the mastermind of the war, and that it was based in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. However, deactivating the rogue &lt;a href=\"god%20program\"&gt;god program&lt;/a&gt; would be far from simple.\nSometime after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bridges\"&gt;Battle of the Bridges&lt;/a&gt;, Liao approached Adawe with a proposal. By this point, Anubis and humanity were effectively in a stalemate, but Liao proposed a solution that wouldn't require military force. She believed that if she could find Aurora, and share her sentience with the omnics, this would be enough to overrun Anubis's programming and turn the tide. Liao believed the physical components to support sentience resided in most omnic models, even some of those produced by Abuis itself. Adawe was skeptical at first, wary of the cost in resources, not to mention the risk that sentient omnics might willingly side with Anubis. Liao stated that when she'd been created, Aurora had demonstrated a clear moral code. Surely, in her view, other omnics would be similar.\nAdawe eventually came around, seeing that sentient omnics would be of less value to Anubis than automated ones, even if they still chose to follow the god program. If a method could be found to spark sentience in omnics, Overwatch would support it. To this end, in addition to the pre-existing Overwatch robotics team, Liao brought several former colleagues from Omnica into the fold, including &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Tai\"&gt;Lawrence Tai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cory%20Powell\"&gt;Cory Powell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Camara%20Verne\"&gt;Camara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Verne\"&gt;Mathias Verne&lt;/a&gt;. It was Camara who managed to discover Aurora's location, and with a framework for their research, the team headed out to find the omnic, who was residing at a temple in the Himalayas.\nLiao explained her idea to Aurora, who was happy to lend herself to the project. She leant herself to Liao's research, but after extensive analysis, the only method Liao and her team could find meant Aurora interfacing with the omnics of the world in a manner similar to that employed by Anubis. Essentially, they would be taking Aurora's conciousness and the sentience it carried, and would spread it globally in a giant pulse, spreading the quantum event of Aurora's \"creation\" a million times over. Exposed to the hyperfunctiality of Aurora's sentience, the the omnics would echo this ability back, granting each affected omnic sentience.\nHowever, this would come at a cost\u2014the sheer power required would overload Aurora's mind so severely, she would likely die. Even if by some chance she could be rebuilt, her 'soul' would be forever lost. Liao was determined to find an alternative way, but as days turned to weeks, as Aurora watched the casualties rise as the war dragged on, Aurora realized she could do something to stop it. This was compounded by the fact that omnics, who would be a new people were her gift, were dying too. Aurora took Liao aside and quietened her doubts. She was willing to say two peoples at the cost of her own life. Her only request was that the procedure take place in the heart of the Himalayas, in the abandoned temple where she had found meaning and purpose.\nLiao proposed a test of the broadcast system prior to connecting Aurora directly into the network. Reyes overruled her however, fearing that a test might alert Anubis to their plans. Liao would later blame herself for not pushing harder against his refusal, believing that a test might have made it possible to preserve Aurora's conciousness. Her fears were made manifest, as while Aurora's conciousness was successfully beamed into Anubis's omnics, granting sentience to all omnics capable of it, it came at the cost of Aurora's life.\nStriking at the Source.\nLiao's plan worked (to a point), as omnics were granted sentience, and a significant portion of them either threw down their arms, or allied with humanity. However, Overwatch needed to move on Anubis if they were to end the war, and Reyes ordered Overwatch to move on Cairo. Liao, still reeling from the loss of Aurora, requested to remain at the base ahead of the Anubis strike. Through her grief, she worked with Lindholm to compose a picture of Anubis's defenses, and propose routes into the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Anubis facility&lt;/a&gt;. The operation was a success, and Anubis quarantined. Months later, the war was over.\nOverwatch.\nEarly Years.\nThe Omnic Crisis ended with a human victory. However, multiple countries, corporations, and individuals attempted to drag Overwatch's name through the mud, putting every choice the group had made under the microscope. In the case of Liao, questions were raised concerning her delay in using Aurora to end the crisis. However, none of the accusations stuck, and Overwatch's charter was expanded.\nDespite the events of the Omnic Crisis, it was not enough to dissuade Liao of her firmly held belief in the potential of artificial life and its power to transform the lives of humanity for the better. She dreamed of improving upon the original omnic designs. She threw herself back into robotics research, wondering how she could evolve omnics to the next level. In light of Anubis's actions, Liao wanted to restore the world's trust in AI, seeing it as a necessary tool for human innovation. Several years after the war's end, Liao unveiled her first major project\u2014&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;. She was named after the Greek goddess of wisdom, symbolizing that Liao had gained wisdom from past mistakes.\nAthena was not truly sentient (supposedly), but proved useful in helping conduct Overwatch missions. The success of the project paved the way for easing, though never eliminating guardrails on Liao's research. Privately, Liao still grieved for Aurora, and sought to heal both her pain and the world's. She noted that after the Crisis, relations between humans and omnics were deteriorating, even as omnics were becoming more human. She lent her voice to key moments in the fight for omnic civil rights, and joined a handful of political rallies and marches to support omnics' quests for independence, argued powerfully before several political bodies in favor of omnic rights, and opened her trove of Omnica Corp research to allies. During her life, she visited the &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt; several times and was warmly received by the monks, spending many hours in private discussion with &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the following decade, the question of omnic rights, and countries' inconsistent addressment of the issue, forced the UN's hand. It ordered hearings on the matter, where Liao was called in as an expert witness for omnic sentience. Drawing on her research notes and her time in the American court with Aurora, Liao's evidence for omnic sentience was undisputable. The UN declared that every omnic should be given legal personhood.\nThe Gwishin.\nLiao led the investigation into the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Gwishin\"&gt;Gwishin&lt;/a&gt;, which had emerged from the East China Sea, threatening &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Colossus\"&gt;Omnic Colossus&lt;/a&gt; was beaten back and presumably destroyed, but Liao still had questions, citing some aspects of the warbot's design as unusual enough to warrant further study. She requested a long-term field assignment to South Korea, to study the remains and signal traces of the construct. The Korean military released pieces of the warbots for analysis, but Overwatch was denied a permanent base in the country. Liao studied the matter for months, but would not have a chance to report her findings before the Gwishin renewed their aggression.\nThe tactics Overwatch had used against the Colossus previously were no longer effective, but it was taken down by &lt;a href=\"Soundquake\"&gt;Soundquake&lt;/a&gt; nonetheless. Liao and Dr. &lt;a href=\"Yi-an%20Lim\"&gt;Yi-an Lim&lt;/a&gt; analyzed military and civilian recordings of the Colossus. They realized it was an improved version of the original Colossus, and the timeline indicated that some form of AI was likely involved, accelerating the development process. Liao found herself reminded of the Omnic Crisis. However, an investigation confirmed that Anubis had not breached containment. Again, Liao requested time in &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt; to analyze the situation and learn more about the mystery warbot. With Lim's endorsement, the South Korean government agreed, and Morrison stationed her in Busan, along with agents Soundquake and &lt;a href=\"Rumble\"&gt;Rumble&lt;/a&gt;. Rumble's experience in robotic engineering gave her unique insight into the Gwishin, while Soundquake helped develop technology that could be used against a similar opponent. After all, if the Colossus could reconstruct itself once, it could do so again. \nSure enough, the Colossus made a third appearance, and had evolved yet again. Once again, it was defeated, and this time, the bulk of the wreckage was retrieved before it could sink beneath the waves. Studying it, Liao realized that the Colossus was indeed omnic in design, but had not been constructed by any known omnium. Overwatch attempted to investigate, but Gwishin drones forced them to retreat. Liao concluded that an omnium had been constructed on the seafloor of the East China Sea, presumably constructed by Anubis. She theorized (correctly) that Anubis may have constructed other omniums, but she lacked evidence. However, the Korean government refused to grant Overwatch permission to establish a watchpoint within their borders, and without a permanent base, Overwatch was forced to leave the country.\nLiao was infuriated, but shared her findings with Lim, and Overwatch's monitoring equipment was left in place. In the aftermath, Morrison routed significant funding towards Liao's projects, including new facilities in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Echo Project.\nAfter Busan, Liao took up residence in Overwatch's Oslo facilities, which served as her primary lab. Her research had originally been hobbled out of fear she would attract negative public attention, but her years as a decorated and loyal Overwatch agent had earned her some leniency. In Oslo, Liao was allowed to return to her true passions of AI and robotics. While there, she consulted with &lt;a href=\"Neumann%20Labs\"&gt;Neumann Labs&lt;/a&gt;, as well as surviving god program maintenance teams.\nLiao's theories would become the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Project\"&gt;Echo Project&lt;/a&gt;. She pitched the idea of an adaptive robot to Commanders Morrison and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;. Something that could accompany strike teams and fulfill any role required of it, from piloting a ship to providing medical care. In truth, this adaptive robot would be Liao's fifth attempt to create such a robot\u2014the other four remain classified.\nMorrison, though reluctant to move forward with the idea, approved it in light of the success of Athena, but had Liao give him her word that it wouldn't get out of hand.\nDue to Overwatch\u2019s restrictions on artificial intelligence research and development after the Omnic Crisis, Liao was forced to limit Echo\u2019s capabilities. What she created was a multirole, adaptive robot that could be programmed to learn different functions: anything from medical support to construction: but had serious limits to its independent decision making. Critically, Echo had multiple layers of protections, failsafes, and security to keep it under control. Echo was used successfully on test missions alongside Overwatch strike teams, but Overwatch leadership was reluctant to put it into full service. However, the truth was that Liao had programmed Echo with a powerful, general artificial intelligence that learned by observation. From the heroes she was around all the time, she would learn how to do what they did, and how they did it. After thousands of hours in the scientist\u2019s presence, much of Liao\u2019s behaviors (including her speech), were adopted by the Echo robot. This secret that was known by very few, including &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;, who had been assigned to run security for Project Echo, and act as Liao's bodyguard. A friendship developed between the two of them, and he was often party to her work on Echo.\nTo outsiders, the closeness between Liao and McCree appeared odd. However, Liao could tell that McCree's cowboy persona was just that\u2014a persona. Every so often, she caught a glimpse of the funny, loyal, intelligent man that McCree really was. Their friendship began when she noticed McCree interacting with Echo as if she was a full person from the very beginning. Through watching the two of them, Liao's view of Echo changed. In her personal logs, Liao noted that the project moved faster when she came to view Echo as more than an apology for what had happened to Aurora. By treating Echo as a childlike intelligence rather than an obligation, Echo's development advanced considerably.\nDeath.\nA year after McCree was assigned to the Oslo labs, Liao was killed in an attack on her lab, caught in an explosion. As her life flashed before her eyes, she wondered if she'd made the world a better place. She recalled being recruited by Omnica, by Overwatch, and her creation of Echo. She reflected that all she wanted was to help the world. McCree, who'd been outside at the time, rushed in, and found Liao severely wounded. He sat there with her while she died.\nLegacy.\nWith Liao's death, the Echo Project was discontinued. Echo herself entered the field for a variety of missions, with her abilities and intelligence continuing to grow, but she was ultimately shelved when Overwatch was shut down.\nLiao was buried with full honors, even as the Oslo attack was being investigated. Her funeral was attended by a number of individuals, including Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm, Jack Morrison, &lt;a href=\"Lena%20Oxton\"&gt;Lena Oxton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Chase\"&gt;Vivian Chase&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;, along with a number of his fellow monks. Mondatta spoke at her funeral. McCree was absent however, as he was focused on tracking down Liao's killers.\nIn light of Liao's death, many Shambali voluntarily entered a year of silence, mourning their friend.\nAfter Winston's recall order, through his manipulation of the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gang\"&gt;Deadlock Gang&lt;/a&gt; (that went slightly off-plan although was ultimately successful), McCree recovered Echo, reactivated her, and sent her off to join Winston's reformed Overwatch, arriving in time to aid them against &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Echo considered herself to be Liao's legacy, her 'echo.' As Echo continued to adapt, those around her wondered if she'd remain an echo of Liao, or become her own person.\nMultiple volumes chronicled her achievements. In posterity, Liao was better known for her work with Overwatch than Omnica. Still, her work with Omnica was not forgotten. The Zurich Archive noted that Liao was responsible for both cementing Omnica's dominance in robotics, yet was also responsible for Omnica's end, however unwittingly. It further noted that Liao achieved 'redemption' in this field, as that while she enabled many of Omnica's excesses, she never orchestrated them. Her focus was always on the work.\nAt some point, fragments of her personal log were recovered. She left behind numerous writings, and in posterity, she was regarded as one of the most powerful human voices for omnic integration."}

Mischief and Magic is based on the popular Prop Hunt game mode in various multiplayer games.\nOverview.\nMischief and Magic consists of two teams of five taking turns hiding from the knights or seeking out the rogues. In order to win the round, the rogues must avoid being caught and tagged by the knights before time runs out. On the other side, the knights must find all five rogues before time expires to score. Teams swap sides every round, and the first team to three wins is the victor.\nMatches are played on modified first section of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20World\"&gt;Blizzard World&lt;/a&gt;, titled \"Overland\". Each round lasts 2:30 minutes, including the hiding time for rogues.\nWith the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20New%20Year\"&gt;Lunar New Year&lt;/a&gt; 2024 (Year of the Dragon), &lt;a href=\"Lijiang%20Tower\"&gt;Lijiang: Night Market&lt;/a&gt; is also available as a playable map.\nThe global self-healing passive is disabled in Mischief and Magic.\nRogues.\nAs rogues, you have the ability to transform into a random prop. Additionally, you can wall-climb and double-jump to help you position and can stun nearby enemies to escape. However, while you are hiding, a voice line taunt will play at decreasing intervals, hinting your location to the knights. At the start of the round, you have 30 seconds to look for places to hide before the knights are allowed to leave their spawn.\nAbilities.\nNimble Feet (Jump)&lt;br&gt;\nPassive Ability&lt;br&gt;\n\"Double Jump.\"\nRune Of Disguise (Ability 1)&lt;br&gt;\nCooldown: 4 seconds&lt;br&gt;\n\"Transform into a random object and become invulnerable for a brief moment.\"\nScampy Stun (Ability 2)&lt;br&gt;\nCooldown: 16 seconds&lt;br&gt;\n\"Stun all enemies around you.

It also has access to infantry, medical, and search-and-rescue support (either within the unit or through the Republic of Korea Army).\nHistory.\nBackground.\nMEKA began its life as an armored drone unit, formed by the South Korean government in order to combat an &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Colossus\"&gt;Omnic Colossus&lt;/a&gt; that had ravaged the country after emerging from the &lt;a href=\"East%20China%20Sea\"&gt;East China Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Every few years the omnic would return, assaulting South Korea and its neighbors. The omnic learned from these encounters, often reconfiguring itself in a different form and appearing with new weapons and capabilities. Each incident ended in a stalemate, with the monstrosity defeated but not destroyed. After the omnic's first attack, MEKA transferred some of its &lt;a href=\"hovercycle\"&gt;hovercycle&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"Busan%20Police%20Agency\"&gt;KNPA&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the omnic continued to adapt, it eventually disrupted MEKA's drone-control networks, forcing the military to place pilots in the &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;s. Scrambling to find suitable candidates, the government turned to the country's professional gamers, who possessed the necessary reflexes and instincts to operate the mechs' advanced weapons systems. In addition to standouts from other fields that required similar talents, a number of top stars were drafted, who now pilot MEKA's walkers in defense of their homeland. In a concession to the predilections of their new draftees, the government suspended certain military protocols and allowed them to customize their uniforms and mechs, as well as broadcast combat operations live.\nThe Gwishin.\nMEKA entered a state of combat with the &lt;a href=\"Gwishin\"&gt;Gwishin&lt;/a&gt;, a group of omnics emerging from an &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; in the East China Sea. The omnics and MEKA reguarly engaged, the Gwishin attacks occurring every few months. South Korean news media painted a far more rosy picture than what was actually occurring, as the MEKA forces took losses, while the Gwishin continued to adapt and get stronger. One example was this was where they attacked &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt; a week after their last attack, rather than the predicted months. MEKA pilot &lt;a href=\"Hana%20Song\"&gt;Hana Song&lt;/a&gt; was able to defeat them alone (as the rest of her squad wasn't available, in part due to damage sustained in the last battle), albiet at the cost of her own mech and broken bones (facts that the media omitted from their report).\nKnown Members.\nMecha Pilots.\nThe pilots are the members of the organization's titular &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Squad\"&gt;MEKA Squad&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Released on 16 November 2017, she is the 26th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nMoira\u2019s biotic abilities enable her to contribute healing or damage in any crisis. While Biotic Grasp gives Moira short-range options, her Biotic Orbs contribute longer-range, hands-off damage and healing; she can also Fade to escape groups or remain close to allies in need of support. Once she\u2019s charged Coalescence, Moira can save allies from elimination, with healing, while also damaging several enemies at the same time.\nStrategy.\nMoira is a support hero that can easily reposition amongst her allies with her immense mobility. can heal multiple allies simultaneously, granting her higher average healing per second when compared to other supports. However, this powerful healing is limited by a resource meter similar to D.Va's &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Matrix\"&gt;Defense Matrix&lt;/a&gt;; this meter refills very slowly over time, but Biotic Grasp's alternate fire refills it much faster, along with healing Moira herself. provides her a very strong movement tool and invulnerability that makes her very hard to lock down. can allow Moira to apply both damage and healing at the same time, and is very powerful in enclosed spaces where it will not simply fly past its targets. can both heal allies and damage enemies, but perhaps most importantly it can pierce &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt;s, preventing enemy tanks from blocking your ultimate with various shields. Her alternate fire gives her amazing sustain, particularly in 1v1 fights, and her gives her excellent escapes, greatly aiding her survivability against enemy flankers, though she remains weak to large burst damage such as enemy Snipers or &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt;. Her kit, though very strong, lacks the utility other healers provide, making her focused though not particularly versatile.\nFade Jump.\nMoira jumps higher while in . You can get a ton of height from jumping while fading, even getting up to 2nd story platforms, but it requires precise timing and positioning. \nStory.\n\"Science will reveal the truth.\"\nEqual parts brilliant and controversial, scientist Moira O'Deorain is on the cutting edge of genetic engineering, searching for a way to rewrite the fundamental building blocks of life. Though O'Deorain will go to any lengths to make scientific breakthroughs, her work is still unknown to most of the world. But now that she has been freed from all constraints, it is only a matter of time before everything changes.\nO'Deorain presents herself as being calm and logical, though in truth, she enjoys her science more when playing with hapless test subjects. She has not experimented on &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s...yet.\nO'Deorain has a negative view of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it was responsible for stifling scientific advancement for decades. She has no interest in global conquest, but is willing to work with those who might have such a goal. Her intellectual pursuits are driven by her interest in humanity. She is a geneticist first and foremost, and that's the scope of her ambition. With very flexible morals, O'Deorain prefers to focus on her research and has no patience for those who urge caution or restraint. She is uncaring of the goals of those she allies with, provided that they continue to fund her research.\nHer right hand is heavily scarred; it has been speculated that it is a result of experimentation or a genetic anomaly.\nBackground.\nAs a scientist, O'Deorain only cared about the evolutionary advancement of humanity. Over a decade ago, she made waves when she published a controversial paper detailing a methodology for creating custom genetic programs that could alter DNA at a cellular level. It seemed like a promising step toward overcoming diseases and disorders and maximizing human potential. Dissent among her peers soon followed. Many considered her work to be dangerous because of its perceived ethical shortfalls, and O'Deorain was even accused of having the same unchecked desire for scientific advancement that some believed had caused the [[Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;]. In addition, other geneticists were unable to reproduce the results of Moira's research, which further called her discoveries into question. Instead of kickstarting her career, her paper seriously damaged her reputation. [[Overwatch (group)|Overwatch]] was among those who condemned her research, and in O'Deorain's own words, tried to silence her.\n[[File:MoiraReyes.jpg|thumb|left|O'Deorain experiments on Reyes]]\nShe received a lifeline in an offer from an unlikely source: Overwatch's covert ops division, [[Blackwatch]]. She was personally recruited by Blackwatch's commander, [[Gabriel Reyes]], who wanted someone who could help advise him on matters pertaining to genetics. Her employment was kept a closely guarded secret.\nShe continued her work in the shadows while developing new weapons and technologies for the organization. Freed from her shackles, her genetic research greatly accelerated. She had interactions with Blackwatch members [[Jesse McCree]] and [[Genji Shimada]], all of whom had their likes and dislikes pertaining to each other. Among her experiments was one done on Reyes himself. Her experiments on Reyes gave him super-human abilities, causing his cells to regenerate and decay at a hyper-accelerated rate.\nRetribution.\n[[File:MoiraRetribution.jpg|thumb|O'Deorain inside Rialto]]\nEight years before the present day, O'Deorain took part in a [[Venice Incident|Blackwatch mission]] to [[Rialto]] to apprehend [[Antonio Bartalotti]], an [[Italy|Italian]] businessman with links to [[Talon]]. The team consisted of herself, Reyes, Shimada, and McCree. The Blackwatch team arrived in a Venice safehouse and set up survaillance on the manor. They found Talon soldiers patrolling the grounds. When night fell, they infiltrated the manor. They made their way through its interior, killing and/or incapacitating numerous Talon guards. Upon reaching Antonio's office, they found him there, not surprised to see them. Nor was he intimidated, as he pointed out that Overwatch abducting a \"respected businessman\" would be a public relations nightmare. Furthermore, even if they did take him, his \"friends\" would have him released within a week. After some thought, Reyes said \"you're right\" and shot Antonio, the force of the blast sending him through his office window. It was the shot that stirred the hornet's nest, alerting Talon to their presence, leaving them with \"Plan B\"\u2014fight their way out. In the ensuring battle, O'Deorain told Reyes that he'd done the right thing, and that he shouldn't apologize. \nDespite numerous Talon soldiers attacking them, the team successfully exfiltrated the site. However, the events revealed the existence of Blackwatch to the world, resulting in political and public fallout. In the inquiries that followed, O'Deorain's research was uncovered. Many high-ranking Overwatch officials disavowed all knowledge of her affiliation with them. O'Deorain and the others were put under suspension.\nNew Employers.\nAfter the events in Venice, O'Deorain was forced to turn to unconventional sources of funding. She continued her work as part of the shadowy [[Talon]] organization. As the organization's geneticist, she altered [[Am\u00e9lie Lacroix]]'s physiology to improve her aim, drastically slowing her heart, which turned her skin cold and blue, and numbed her ability to experience human emotion.\nA few years after the Venice Incident, [[Overwatch HQ]] was destroyed in a fight between Reyes and [[Jack Morrison]]. Reyes barely survived the ordeal, and was saved by O'Deorain, who injected him with an amplified version of the substance she'd injected him with years ago. She claimed that he'd been close to death, and had no alternative when it came to saving his life. Whatever the truth of the claim, Reyes was alive, albeit in a state of agony.\n[[File:MoiraOrigin2.jpg|thumb|O'Deorain, now a member of Talon]]\nTalon continued to aid O'Deorain in her experiments in exchange for utilizing the results for their own purposes. But while O\u2019Deorain worked with Talon in secret, she maintained appearances in the scientific community. She was invited to join the scientific collective that had founded the city of [[Oasis]], becoming their minister of genetics. However, some whispered of O'Deorain's connections to Talon. By the time of [[Doomfist]]'s return to Talon (or after his return), O'Deorain apparently had a seat on Talon's inner council. O'Deorain's goals of pushing forward human evolution meshed well with Talon's, and she found a patron for her research in Doomfist.\nTrivia.\nMisc. Character Information.\nDisputed Information.\n\"Note: The following information is from gameplay trailers and is of dubious canon status.\"\nAt some point after Null Sector's return, Moira and her fellow Talon members engaged Overwatch in a firefight at [[Petra]]. Talon was forced to retreat.\nDevelopment.\n[[File:Moira Early Ideation 1.jpg|thumb|right|Early concept art of Moira.]]\n[[File:Moira Early Ideation 3.jpg|thumb|right|Early concept art of Moira.]]\nMoira's early ideation began with a combination of both gameplay and story ideas, stemming from strong player demand for a new support healer. Their initial goal was to introduce a shady, morally ambiguous healer to contrast with the existing \"benevolent healer\" archetypes already in the game. The developers wanted her to have connections with various groups in the \"Overwatch\" setting. Initial concepts gravitated towards a set of designs with a mysterious androgynous appeal, with the first iteration being outfitted with a set of four mechanical tentacles. Feeling that the tentacles would be difficult to incorporate into gameplay, they progressed to a more conventional, toned-down design with a two-handed spray cannon and began incorporating scientific apparatuses such as tubes and cannisters into her look, but felt that her silhouette became too similar to [[Zarya]]'s.\n[[File:Moira Early Ideation 2.jpg|thumb|left|Thumbnails exploring different looks and weapons for Moira, including one inspired by the [[Sombra#Development|Omniblade]] (far right).]]\nAt this point they produced a number of thumbnails to experiment with different weapons and costumes while retaining her gaunt, androgynous appearance, with several that wielded various clawed gloves and gauntlets, as well as a concept inspired by [[Sombra]]'s original [[Sombra#Development|Omniblade]] design, incorporating baggy sleeves and throwable syringes. The latter design also introduced the idea of a duality between her left and right hands, with one used to deal damage and the other to heal. Elements from these thumbnails were pulled together to create her final design, incorporating the earlier scientific details with a color-changing liquid to differentiate her healing and damage dealing abilities.\n[[File:Moira concept art.webp|thumb|Moira concept art]]\n[[File:Moira arms concept.webp|thumb|Moira arms concept art]]\n[[File:Moira ability concept art.webp|thumb|Moira ability concept art]]\nMoira's initial gameplay design involved her having a large health pool, which she would spend as a resource to heal allies while draining health from enemies, but it proved to be too difficult to balance. Early inspiration for her abilities may have been drawn from [[Overmind]], a hero created for the original \"[[Overwatch#Development|Prometheus]]\" pitch. In her final design, she instead uses separate Regeneration and Decay versions of her abilities, with her Biotic Grasp: Decay ability leeching health from enemies and enhancing the effectiveness of her Regeneration abilities. Because she is one of the few characters in the game to have both hands visible on the screen at all times, great care was taken with her animations to convey how these different abilities worked and reflected her design and personality. Her [[Fade]] ability was also designed to be similar to Reaper's [[Wraith Form]], showing that the two characters are connected. The original version of her ultimate ability was a transformation that involved biotic energy swirling around her and gave her a beam that could both heal and damage, but as the beam was the most interesting aspect of the ability they decided to make it her ultimate's sole focus.\nMoira was first shown to players as a member of the Talon Inner Council in the comic \"[[Doomfist: Masquerade]]\", but was not given a name or speaking role. The day before her reveal, a research paper labeled \"Draft: Repairing Degenerative Genetic Structures\" was added to the [[Oasis]] map, hinting at Moira's occupation and involvement with [[Reaper]]. Oasis University had a special interaction between [[Reaper]] and \"[[Sombra]]\" when on the same team that teased Moira's release. Sombra asked him \"What are we doing here boss?\" and Reaper responded to her with \"I am here to visit an old friend.\"\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Moira| ]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Talon members]]"}

They abandoned their pre-programmed lives to establish a monastery high in the Himalayas, where like-minded omnics could gather to meditate on the nature of their existence. Mondatta was their leader, and they took over the ruins of an ancient monastery, turning it into the home of the Shambali. Here, humans and omnics could make pilgrimages in the hopes of finding a greater truth.\nMondatta preached the idea of spiritual equality existing between omnics and humans. He led the Shambali in order to heal the wounds between omnics and their creators in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Mondatta did much to try and improve the conditions of the omnics within &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;.\nUprising.\nSeven years before the present day, Mondatta was at the groundbreaking ceremony of &lt;a href=\"Turing%20Green%20SW0\"&gt;Turing Green SW0&lt;/a&gt;. The event was interrupted by the omnic terrorist group &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;, They took Mayor &lt;a href=\"Nandah\"&gt;Nandah&lt;/a&gt;, Mondatta, and a hundred other prisoners captive in a guarded power plant. 28 days later, &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; sent in a strike team to neutralize Null Sector and rescue the hostages. Mondatta survived, and met Overwatch agent &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;. \nTwo days after the Uprising, Mondatta spoke with a reporter. He condemned Null Sector's actions, and stressed that the Shambali sought peace with humanity, not violence.\nDeath.\nSeven years after the Uprising, Mondatta returned to London. He addressed the British parliament, before heading back to &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt; to address a human-omnic crowd. Before the event, he specifically asked to see Tracer. In the meantime, he was put inside &lt;a href=\"the%20Meridian\"&gt;the Meridian&lt;/a&gt; under a tight security presence. Food was provided for him, even though he did not need it; a \"common human oversight,\" in his words. Meeting Tracer, he explained that he remembered her from the Uprising, where they discussed the state of human-omnic relations. Both agreed that there needed to be reconciliation between the two sides, but acknowledged the weight of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Before they could discuss things further, Mondatta was ushered away to give his speech. \nUnder tight security, Mondatta addressed the joint human-omnic crowd. However, he was assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; operative &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, despite Tracer's efforts to stop her. In his memory, a large statue was built at King's Row, and a memorial picture was placed on the stairs in front of the Meridian, where he gave his final speech. Talon's involvement remained unknown within the press. In the aftermath of his death, brawls between humans and omnics erupted throughout the world."}

When moving directly backwards, the base speed is 90% of the forward speed (4.95 for most heroes; 5.4 for Tracer and Genji), and when moving back diagonally, the base speed is of the forward speed (5.133 for most heroes; 5.6 for Tracer and Genji). While crouching, the base movement speed is 3 meters per second for all heroes, regardless of direction.\nFollowing abilities alter the hero's base movement speed:\nJumping.\nHeroes can jump, granting them a vertical impulse of 5.72 m/s. Heroes can reach a height of 0.98 meters before they start moving downwards. With few exceptions, heroes can only jump while on ground.\nFalling.\nWhen a hero is in air they start accelerating towards ground, until they reach the maximum falling speed of 30 m/s. The falling acceleration is not constant but decreases as the hero gets closer to the maximum speed. Under normal gravity, heroes start accelerating at rate of 17.5 m/s2 and take approximately 6.4 seconds to reach the maximum falling speed. Modified gravity conditions cause the heroes initial acceleration to change, but the maximum falling speed remains the same. Heroes do not take fall damage upon hitting ground from any height.\nModifiers and stacking.\nMovement speed modifiers are effects that alter the hero's horizontal movement speed by a percentage of their base movement speed. There are three categories to speed modifiers: speed buffs, &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt; effects, and movement penalties. Each category stacks additively with themselves and are all added together before being applied to the current base movement speed. However, self-inflicted movement penalties and enemy slow effects do not stack and the greater of the two overrides the other. Movement speed buffs' stacking is capped at +75%. Abilities that by itself grant a speed buff greater than this are generally excluded from the calculation.\nFor example, suppose &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; are on a team and &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt; is on the other:\nThe only known exception is with &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;'s Fusion Cannons' movement penalty, which does not apply during Boosters.\nList of movement speed buffs.\nFollowing abilities buff the user's or their teammates' movement speed. This does not include abilities that directly alter the hero's base movement speed.\nList of movement speed penalties.\nFollowing abilities impose a movement speed penalty to the user.\nMovement abilities.\nMovement abilities are abilities that grant the hero a short burst of movement. Movement abilities usually limit the ability to control the hero while they are used. In addition to &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; effects that prevent abilities from being used altogether, movement abilities also cannot be used if the hero is affected by &lt;a href=\"mobility%20lock\"&gt;mobility lock&lt;/a&gt; status effect, applied by abilities such as Junkrat's or Cassidy's . Being hit by these effects will also interrupt any active movement abilities. Movement abilities that grant free flight will be temporarily disabled when affected by mobility lock, but will not be fully interrupted by these effects. \nLifeweaver's interacts with movement abilities in two ways: If Life Grip is used on an ally that is in the middle of using a movement ability, it will be interrupted when the pull begins. On the other hand, using a movement ability, while being pulled by Life Grip, will allow the target to interrupt the pull."}

These are additional customization options that can be equipped instead of a Mythic Skins typical customization options.

On July 23, 2024, the Weapon Skin was added to the mythic shop and available to unlock at its base level for 50. The Weapon Skin could be levelled up further by purchasing additional levels for 10 each, which provide the Weapon Skin with further \"mythic\" effects, including reactive effects, a Weapon Flourish emote and visual elimination effects.\nIt was later confirmed in a &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%2012\"&gt;season 12&lt;/a&gt; developer update that Mythic Weapon Skins would be seasonally added to the game, with a new mythic weapon skin releasing each mid-season. Unlike Mythic Skins, Mythic Weapon Skins don't go out of rotation immediately in the following season, instead they go directly to the \"Previous Seasons\" section of the Mythic Shop once their season ends and can still be bought. Mythic Weapon Skins also feature a &lt;a href=\"Shop\"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt; bundle, that allows players to purchase it directly with real money, rather than using Mythic Prisms.\nMythic Prisms.\n Mythic Prisms were first introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%2010\"&gt;season 10&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the release of the Mythic Shop. The mythic shop is the only place to use mythic prisms. You can earn up to 80 through the Premium &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;, but they can also be purchased separately in-game or online. "}

She taught the &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt; pilot to consider all threats, not just the one in front of her.\nNew Blood.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Myung and the MEKA Squad watched a news report on the incident, and how the attack had been thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt; asked if Myung was going to contact Overwatch, pointing out that given MEKA Squad's experience in fighting &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, they could help them. Myung conceded that what Overwatch had done in Paris was heroic, but that the group was still outlawed by the &lt;a href=\"Petras%20Act\"&gt;Petras Act&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href=\"MEKA\"&gt;MEKA&lt;/a&gt; HQ had forbidden contact with them. Reminding the squad of the &lt;a href=\"Gwishin\"&gt;Gwishin&lt;/a&gt; omnics' &lt;a href=\"Shooting%20Star\"&gt;recent attack&lt;/a&gt;, she declared that MEKA Squad would remain on alert and conduct tactical exercises.\nThe squad was dismissed, but D.Va remained behind. She reminded Myung of what she'd taught her when she'd joined MEKA, and that during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, millions of lives had been lost due to the world not coming together immediately to fight the omnics. If Myung contacted HQ, arguing that MEKA should work with Overwatch, they'd listen to her. Off the record, Myung told D.Va that she admired what Overwatch stood for, but that &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; couldn't be seen acting in defiance of the Petras Act, and nor could MEKA defy direct orders. D.Va wasn't convinced, but the conversation was interrupted as &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt; came under attack by omnics.\nDeploying in the city, the squad reported that the invaders were Null Sector. &lt;a href=\"Drop%20pod\"&gt;Drop pod&lt;/a&gt;s were being deployed by a &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;, and D.Va requested permission to attack the ship directly. Myung refused, stating that they needed more information before going on the attack. Instead, she ordered the squad to clear civilian evacuation routes while intel was gathered.\nAs the battle progressed, Myung ordered D.Va and &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; to team up and attack the ship together, while the rest of the squad focused on Null Sector's ground units. The plan went awry immediately, as King was shot down, and &lt;a href=\"Casino\"&gt;Casino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Overlord\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"D.Mon\"&gt;D.Mon&lt;/a&gt; found themselves overwhelmed by the omnics. Myung ordered the squad to pull out of Busan, but D.Va refused. It was at this point that an Overwatch team arrived via an &lt;a href=\"MV-261%20Orca\"&gt;MV-261 Orca&lt;/a&gt;. The tide turned, and Myung ordered the squad to \"press the advantage.\" Liaising with &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, Myung ordered Overwatch to clear evacuation routes and work with emergency personnel, while she ordered MEKA Squad to perform a synchronized strike on the command ship. They did so, and the ship was forced to retreat. All that was left was to clear up the remaining ground units.\nBack at MEKA Base, Cassidy requested that D.Va join Overwatch. To her surprise, Myung approved it. She'd handle HQ, while D.Va would join Overwatch and pass whatever intel she gathered to MEKA while travelling with Overwatch. On that note, Cassidy passed the intel they'd gathered to Myung, telling her that she didn't owe them anything for the information."}

He loves to eat puff-puffs, and is a fan of videogames and movies. In the case of the latter, &lt;a href=\"Kam%20Kalu\"&gt;Kam Kalu&lt;/a&gt; is one of Naade's favorite Nollywood action heroes, and by extension, he is a fan of the \"&lt;a href=\"Flash%20Brighton\"&gt;Flash Brighton&lt;/a&gt;\" series. He also enjoys the \"&lt;a href=\"Darkspire\"&gt;Darkspire&lt;/a&gt;\" prequels, and is a fan of &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaade has a forgiving nature, at least compared with &lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;Hassana&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeeting Efi.\nNaade and &lt;a href=\"Hassana\"&gt;Hassana&lt;/a&gt; became friends with Efi at a science fair incident with a &lt;a href=\"graviton%20beam\"&gt;graviton beam&lt;/a&gt;. Efi asked them to serve as volunteers. However, she accidentally over-amplified the gravity field, and the result was that they were stuck on the floor of their school library for three hours before they were able to be freed. \nThe three became friends, but given Efi's genius, there was an emotional and intellectual gap between Efi and Naade/Hassana. Furthermore, she noted that Naade and Hassana only seemed to tolerate each other's company.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nDoomfist's Attack.\nA few years after the science fair incident, Naade and Hassana helped Efi with her &lt;a href=\"junior%20assistant\"&gt;junior assistant&lt;/a&gt; design, the pair getting Junies of their own. Both warmed up to the technology, and continued to help Efi as orders increased. Over the following weeks however, Naade's grades decreased, as he attempted to rely on the Junie too much for his learning. After getting a D on a maths quiz, his father grounded him. As such, he was unable to help Efi further.\nWhen Efi won the &lt;a href=\"Adawe%20Foundation\"&gt;Adawe Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s \"genius grant,\" it was agreed that she and her family would take a trip to &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate. Naade and Hassana were also allowed to come. A week before they left, Naade and Hassana stayed at Efi's house. Despite Efi's warning, Naade ate an entire plate of puff-puffs that were in the fridge. When Efi's &lt;a href=\"Bolaji%20Oladele\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; returned home and found his favorite treat missing, he was enraged. Even a week later, as the Oladeles and Naade and Hassana travelled to the airport, he was still irked at Naade, and didn't hide it.\nThe group arrived at the airport, but never made it to their flight, as it was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;. They survived, but had to stay in the city. A &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Civil%20Defense\"&gt;Numbani Civil Defense&lt;/a&gt; officer gave him a \"Junior Officer\" sticker.\nBuilding Orisa.\nEfi used the money she'd been granted from the Adawe Foundation to purchase an &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt; chassis, intent on rebuilding it so it could take on Doomfist. She agreed to let Naade and Hassana help, though, granted, there was only so much they could actually do. Naade told Efi that he knew how to get her a &lt;a href=\"fusion%20driver\"&gt;fusion driver&lt;/a&gt;; that &lt;a href=\"Isaac\"&gt;Isaac&lt;/a&gt; knew a guy who could get them military-grade equipment, albeit they only dealt with &lt;a href=\"MBC\"&gt;MBC&lt;/a&gt;s. Efi agreed, and Naade made plans with Isaac to arrange the trade. The trio arrived, but their contact was less than enthused that he was dealing with children. He took the MBCs, but didn't give them the driver, instead driving off and yelling that he didn't sell to kids.\nNaade apologized, but Efi didn't hold it against him, saying that she put him in the position. However, there was still the question of currency. Efi suggested selling her tools, but Naade objected, saying they were part of her. However, she went ahead, selling everything she could spare.\nOver the weeks, funds trickled in, and the trio continued to work on the robot. Naade and Hassana worked alongside Efi, Naade working on the chassis while Hassanna painted, but over time, became less enthused. While they wanted to keep Numbani safe, they had trouble keeping up with her grueling pace. Over an impromptu dinner, they discussed what they should do with the robot once it was activated. Hassana favored community integration, while Naade suggested target practice. Efi suggested that the pair could each work on their respective tasks.\nAfter seeing a video of Doomfist's second attack, Efi declared that they had to finish the robot tonight. The trio got to work, working past midnight, but the haste caused Hassana and Naade to behave sloppily. Efi lost her patience, which caused Hassana to snap. She stormed out of the workshop, dragging Naade with her.\nMaking Ammends.\nNaade and Efi didn't talk for awhile. When Efi posted on &lt;a href=\"HollaGram\"&gt;HollaGram&lt;/a&gt; that she'd deactivated Orisa's personality core, Naade expressed his sympathies on the post, even if they weren't talking in real life. Later, she and Orisa helped foil a &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; attack on the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Efi talked to Naade and Hassana (who were eating lunch), bearing gifts (in Naade's case, stewed beans), and apologies for how she'd treated them while they'd worked on Orisa. Naade was willing to forgive her, but Hassana wasn't so eager, despite Naade's urging. She was angry that Efi had taken full credit for Orisa after the work they'd done with her. To make ammends, Efi stood on a table and told all the students about how the pair had helped her on Orisa, in Naade's case, his work on the chassis.\nThe three made up, and Efi asked them if they'd be willing to come back and work on Orisa's repairs. Naade was given the role of giving Orisa tactical training, due to his experience in movies and videogames.\nNaade tried to teach her how to use her &lt;a href=\"hard-light%20lasso\"&gt;hard-light lasso&lt;/a&gt; to grab small objects, such as pulling med packs from injured people. Orisa refused to do it, however, stating that it interfered with her programming. Naade told her that Doomfist wouldn't fight fair, and showed her footage of his initial airport attack. The result was that Orisa injured a student who was dressed like Doomfist. Naade apologized profusely, but Efi took responsibility, and shut Orisa down.\nA Day at the Movies.\nSometime later, \"\" came out. In the space of a week, Naade saw it eleven times. He saw it a twelfth time with Efi and Hassana, unable to avoid spoiling elements of the movie. He headed for the restroom during the intermission period. He came back and found that Efi had been contacted by &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;. The ensuing commotion resulted in ushers escorting them out of the theater, but it didn't matter, as they talked to L\u00facio outside. Efi introduced her friends to him. He told them that he would perform at the &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Plaza\"&gt;Unity Plaza&lt;/a&gt; concert, and asked Efi to bring Orisa along.\nNaade and Hassana were in awe that they'd talked to their music icon, but Naade was aghast that Efi said that she couldn't bring Orisa. She protested that Orisa wasn't safe (in light of the school incident), but Naade told her that she'd sort out the bugs, like she always did. Efi refused, but later, did activate Orisa.\nUnity Day.\nA week later, the &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt; celebration occurred. Naade and Hassana attended, but when Doomfist and his forces attacked, they helped the attendees flee. They later worked with the other drama students to create an impormptu &lt;a href=\"sonic%20amplifier\"&gt;sonic amplifier&lt;/a&gt;. Naade handed out earplugs before it was used, a wave of sound (and force) being unleashed upon the attackers. This helped turn the tide of the battle. Later, Naade and the other students were interviewed. Over HollaGram, Hassana suggested that they celebrate over puff puffs.\nVIP Pass.\nAt some point after the Unity Day celebration, Naade and Hassana were given VIP tickets to one of L\u00facio's events, much to their joy."}

Their model was made as a companion for children, with a built-in battery for charging devices and taking pictures. Nameless is highly customized and short, with blue eyes and rabbit-like ears. Their model designation has been scratched out, apparently by Nameless themselves.\nOf all the members of Null Sector, Nameless perhaps knew &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt; best. In Ramattra's words, Nameless was \"the omnic who knew me better than anyone, save for my &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nNameless was created before the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, survived said Crisis, and emerged with sentience alongside their fellow omnics. Post-Crisis, however, anti-omnic prejudice was endemic.\nMeeting Ramattra.\nThree years before the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, Nameless and other omnics were kept in a facility, until their former masters decided what to do with them. Nameless heard of a &lt;a href=\"R-7000\"&gt;R-7000&lt;/a&gt; freeing omnics around the world. Nameless put little stock in the rumors, but refused to leave their fellow omnics behind.\nThe R-7000 in question, &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;, turned up at the facility Nameless was being held at, and incapacitated the guards. Nameless was wary of Ramattra, given that his model had sent omnics to die during the war, but was willing to work with Ramattra. He suggested that they save &lt;a href=\"Zera\"&gt;Zera&lt;/a&gt; next, and pointed out that if they were forming an omnic liberation group, they needed a name. When Ramattra pointed out that was hypocritical given Nameless's refusal to use a name themselves, the omnic just snickered.\nNull Sector.\nNameless operated \"shadows\" within Null Sector, apparently using them for espionage/sabotage.\nThe King's Row Uprising.\nOne year after their meeting, Ramattra led Nameless, Zera, and &lt;a href=\"Lanet\"&gt;Lanet&lt;/a&gt; to an &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; that had been created by &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; during the Crisis. As Ramattra explained, of all the omnics he'd brought into &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;, he trusted these three the most. They reactivated the omnium, using it to create war-machines. \nTwo years later, Null Sector made its move, launching the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. However, the insurgency was a failure\u2014Null Sector failed to take &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, and Lanet was killed in the battle. Nameless watched as Ramattra, enraged, destroyed the screen he was watching. Nameless checked reports, and confirmed that many omnics were condemning Null Sector. Ramattra declared that if omnics were choosing death, they would take that choice away, much to Nameless's unease. Ramattra refused to back down from his hardline stance, and Nameless decided to leave Null Sector. They patted Ramattra on the hand, telling him that they hoped that one day, Ramattra would realize that he didn't have to fight alone.\nAfter that, Nameless and Zera left."}

In addition, she can hack health packs and Torbj\u00f6rn's turret, making them useless to her opponents. She uses her fully automatic Machine Pistol to take out her enemies, getting into position using her Thermoptic Camo, which allows her to become invisible and move more quickly for short periods of time.

Historically, we've run tournament events like the Overwatch League and the Overwatch World Cup with teams competing head to head, in person, with local servers to provide the lowest possible latency and the best player experience.\nIn today's world, with so many events and tournaments moving online and teams spread across the world, we wanted to provide a mechanism to ensure that the experience is as fair as possible, regardless of how close the teams are to the tournament's servers.\nThe Minimum Latency option sets a target latency for Custom Games, leveling the playing field between competitors whether they're 50 or 500 miles away. Players with latency lower than the minimum setting will automatically have their network traffic delayed to meet the minimum target, while players with latency higher than the target won't have any additional delay introduced.\nThis feature is designed to work with a variety of network conditions, and will generally keep players within 8 milliseconds of the target setting.\nWe hope this feature will be useful, especially for community-driven competitions that want to Play Nice, Play Fair.\nCUSTOM GAMES UPDATES.\nNew Custom Game Maps\nCOMPETITIVE UPDATES.\nCompetitive No Limits\nFor the first time (Season 1), experience Competitive No Limits with placement matches, skill rating, leaderboards, and the opportunity to earn competitive points. In No Limits, there are no restrictions on hero selection.\nWORKSHOP UPDATES.\nGeneral\nNew Workshop Actions\nNew Workshop Values\nE\"valuate Once can be used to isolate a part of a reevaluating parameter and \"freeze\" it at its initial value. One way this can be useful is when a reevaluating parameter (such as an effect's position) makes use of a For loop's control variable. For example, if you want to create a vertical stack of effects that move with a player, you could loop over a Create Effect action using Global.Y as your control variable and \"Position Of(Event Player) + Vector(0, Evaluate Once(Global.Y), 0)\" as your position (with reevaluation enabled). Doing this, the position of each effect would move along with the player, but thanks to Evaluate Once, the vertical offset for each effect would be frozen to the value of Global.Y when that particular effect was created (instead of the final value of Global.Y when the loop ends).\"\n\"Update Every Frame increases the rate at which certain values will update. For example, \"Position Of(...)\" only updates 12.5 times per second, but \"Update Every Frame(Position Of(...))\" will evaluate 62.5 times per second for conditions and other logical checks and as fast as your framerate for visual output, such as effects and camera. This value can be used to create highly sensitive positional triggers and smooth movement for effects and camera work. Depending on your usage, this value could have a significant impact on server load, framerate, or both, so use it only when needed. That said, executing a single condition or action that contains an Update Every Frame is still much more performant than repeatedly executing an action in a tight loop to try and achieve the same result.\"\nBUG FIXES.\nGeneral\nHeroes\nDoomfist\nD.Va\nHanzo\nPharah\nSombra\nWrecking Ball\nWorkshop"}

As a piece of our Defense Matrix initiative, audio transcriptions allow us to analyze a transcript from a temporary voice chat recording of a reported player. Players will now see a notification when entering voice chat for the first time during a play session indicating that voice chat may be recorded. Make sure you report as close to when disruptive behavior occurred to maximize this feature\u2019s effectiveness. Once reported, a temporary audio recording will be used to make a text file transcript through speech-to-text programs.

Transcriptions are only made for reports of disruptive behavior in public voice channels, which includes team and match chat\u2014group \u201cparty\u201d chat is excluded.\nCrossplay and Aim Assist.\nWe made a change to Aim Assist in Crossplay (PC+ Console) lobbies. If you play in a Crossplay game now, Aim Assist is enabled in all matches except Competitive.\nIn our data, we found many groups were crossplay groups between PC and console players. This meant if you were playing on console and grouping with players on PC, you were opting into a bad experience for yourself to play with your friends. Also, if you had a group that was primarily console, but one of your friends was a PC player, you had to leave the PC player out to have a good experience.\nWe'd like to reiterate\u2014at this point Aim Assist exists only on console platforms.\nWe'll be monitoring the deployment of this change carefully and making changes quickly if needed."}

Its forces are almost entirely comprised of robotic drones manufactured in an &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;, one of its original founders and currently its sole leader. They were decried as terrorists by the &lt;a href=\"Shambali%20Order\"&gt;Shambali Order&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, going underground until their re-emergence. Now, Null Sector is regarded as one of the world's most notorious terrorist organizations.\nTheir implied goal is to create an omnic nation.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, human abuses of omnics were endemic. Many omnics fought back in secret, but it was under &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt; that they found unity. The truths he shared with those he met inspired others and over time he gained an underground following of these hurt and angry omnics. Null Sector was formed by Ramattra and his allies &lt;a href=\"Nameless\"&gt;Nameless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lanet\"&gt;Lanet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zera\"&gt;Zera&lt;/a&gt;. \nRamattra initially focused on building loyalty in his followers, but true radicalization and militarization would not be far behind. At first, Ramattra had advocated co-existence, but after countless failed attempts, he believed that co-existence with humanity was impossible, and aware of the omnics' dwindling numbers, became Null Sector's leader to create a better future for his people by force. However, in its infancy, Null Sector was small in size, and wasn't treated as a threat by the world's authorities. \nKing's Row Uprising.\nSeven years before the present day, Ramattra and his allies arrived at an &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; during the Crisis. There, Ramattra activated the assembly lines and produced a horde of robots for Null Sector. Despite the disagreements and protests from his allies, Ramattra reassured them that unlike omnics, these robots were usable and expendable despite their outdated state and then proceeded with the plan to begin the Uprising in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter stirring unrest in London, Null Sector launched the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. After 27 days of the Uprising, the UK prime minister continued to forbid &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; from interfering. By this point, Null Sector had taken Mayor &lt;a href=\"Nandah\"&gt;Nandah&lt;/a&gt;, Mondatta, and a hundred other prisoners captive in a guarded power plant. Thousands in &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt; needed medical aid. &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"McCree\"&gt;McCree&lt;/a&gt;, who had been sent to London by &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; without telling anyone, reported the situation to Strike Commander . After much deliberation, Morrison authorized an illegal Overwatch mission to end the crisis. Four Overwatch agents\u2014&lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014touched down in King's Row, and fought their way through the hordes of Null Sector omnics that came at them.\nTwo days after the Uprising, Ramattra was infuriated that omnic citizens and &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt; were condemning Null Sector as a terrorist group via news reports. With the death of Lanet and seeing how far their friend was willing to go, Nameless and Zera left Ramattra to lead Null Sector alone.\nNull Sector's Return.\nAttack on Paris.\nNull Sector made a return to the world after seven years had passed by launching an attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;; one that the French police were hard pressed to stop. An Overwatch team consisting of &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; arrived to help with the evacuation, but were not only heavily outnumbered by Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"Nullifier\"&gt;Nullifier&lt;/a&gt;s, but with the arrival of a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, heavily outgunned as well. However, the tide was turned with the arrival of additional Overwatch members, who were able to fend off Null Sector and destroy the Titan.\nAttack on Busan.\nNot long after Paris, Null Sector attacked &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;, deploying thousands of omnics via &lt;a href=\"drop%20pod\"&gt;drop pod&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Squad\"&gt;MEKA Squad&lt;/a&gt; was deployed to defend the city and take down the attacking &lt;a href=\"command%20carrier\"&gt;command carrier&lt;/a&gt;. With the arrival of Overwatch members led by &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, Null Sector was repelled, with their ground forces destroyed and their carrier forced to retreat.\nWorld War.\n\"Note: The timing of some of the following battles is speculative. They have been listed in the following order by best estimate.\"\nDespite their defeats at Paris and Busan, Null Sector was able to launch a global invasion, striking at numerous targets across the planet. The world's militaries were quickly overwhelmed, and the world descended into chaos. Millions were affected by the war. The group began abducting omnics for an unknown purpose.\nBattle of Las Vegas.\nNot long after the attack on Paris, Null Sector invaded &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;. The attack was swift and sudden, with the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Strip\"&gt;Las Vegas Strip&lt;/a&gt; taking heavy damage. Upon landing, Null Sector's warbots fanned out across the Strip, entering its casinos and hotels to \"liberate\" &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s through &lt;a href=\"neural%20suppressor\"&gt;neural suppressor&lt;/a&gt;s, while humans were either ignored or executed. Communication channels were flooded, preventing contact with the outside world. 22 hours after the initial attack, some human resistance lingered, but the city was effectively taken. Speakers were set up to broadcast &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;'s declaration of \"liberation.\"\nBattle of Rio.\nNull Sector launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; hovered above the city, dispatching Null Sector forces to the ground via pod. &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; did what he could to stem the tide, and was aided by a newly arrived Overwatch team. They fought their way through Rio's streets in order to get to the command ship. The command ship was destroyed.\nBattle of Toronto.\nNull Sector's next target was &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. Its forces began attacking the humans there, and abducting &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s that hadn't already gone rogue. In Null Sector's mind, their actions were a case of \"liberating\" omnics, and their attack on Toronto was meant to demonstrate that humans had treated omnics as servants for far too long. Null Sector took control of most of the city and began rounding up omnics for \"liberation.\"\nKing's Row.\n\"Note: The timing of the King's Row attack compared to Rio, Toronto, and Gothenburg is unclear, but it is assumed to take place at around the same time given the simultanious release of &lt;a href=\"Story%20Missions\"&gt;Story Missions&lt;/a&gt; and the co-op event in which it features.\"\nNull Sector returned to King's Row seven years after the Uprising, this time with the intent of wiping out the omnics of the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. Overwatch was sent in to stop them, utilizing a modified &lt;a href=\"TS-1\"&gt;TS-1&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes.\nHistorical.\nNull Sector employed a variety of different kinds of outdated modelled omnics in their assault on King's Row. They were previously built and stored in an omnium located in the Giza Plateau created by Anubis. \nAmong those seen were:\nModern.\nIn the current day, Null Sector's units are more lethally advanced than their predecessors. They continue to attack their foes until they are completely dismantled. Note that many, if not all of these robots are \"not\" considered omnics, as they were manufactured after the Omnic Crisis, and have no will nor mind of their own.\nConfirmed units include the:\nIn addition, Null Sector has fleets of &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;s that deploys &lt;a href=\"drop%20pod\"&gt;drop pod&lt;/a&gt;s for their units.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\n&lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; began concepting Null Sector units in 2017 (note that this date appears to refer to &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Second Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;-era omnics, as Null Sector made its debut in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Uprising\"&gt;Overwatch Uprising&lt;/a&gt; that very year). In this early phase, Null Sector had an Egyptian motif, with a predominantly olive and gold color scheme. Their units had VFX based on sand powers, which the developers thought of as nanites.\nThe final Null Sector design is more skeletal, with purple their primary color. The early Egypt/nanite ideas influenced the development of &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;."}

They make up a large part of encountered enemy forces in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Uprising\"&gt;Overwatch Uprising&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSummary.\nNulltroopers are commonly encountered in \"Uprising\" and are very easy to kill given their low mobility, weak offense, and average health. They appear as tall, bipedal combat robots with a design aesthetic similar to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, possessing a single vertical eye slit glowing red. They carry Null Sector's distinct purple livery, and possess large arm cannons for right forearms, similar to Bastion and &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;.\nTactics.\nNulltroopers make up most of Null Sector's forces. Nulltroopers are overall weak and not very competent enemies; their battle strategy largely consists of them rushing toward &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; agents in large numbers and then firing their blasters once they establish visual contact, with relatively little movement. As with other Null Sector enemies, Nulltroopers are vulnerable to omnic-specific weaknesses such as hacking and EMPs. Nulltroopers fire two or three shots from their arm cannon which deals 25 damage each if it successfully connects with an Overwatch agent. As with other Null Sector enemies, Nulltroopers are improved at higher difficulties, generally reacting and acting much more quickly than on lower difficulties. A viable battle strategy is to simply rush them back. With their slow movement this should be easy."}

One of the 12 maps included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOfficial Description.\nKnown as the \"City of Harmony,\" Numbani is one of the few places where &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s and humans live as equals. This collaboration has led to the creation of one of the world's greatest and most technologically advanced cities in the short time since its establishment after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this year's Unity Day festivities celebrating the city's founding, the gauntlet of the infamous &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; is being exhibited at the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nReferred to as the City of Harmony, Numbani is a utopian city on the edge of the African savanna, somewhere near &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the world's most peaceful and foremost centers of scientific discovery and exploration, leading the world in education, commerce, biometrics, and nanotechnology.\nOmnic-human equality is at the core of Numbani. Omnics are fully integrated into human society in Numbani, performing a variety of roles, whereas elsewhere, omnics are lucky to have blue collar work at best. While some humans in Numbani are distrustful towards omnics, they're the exception rather than the rule.\nNature is integrated within the Numbani cityscape. Nearly every resident's balcony features a garden. A tram system runs throughout the city, above its streets. In the streets themselves are driverless cabs. It forms part of the &lt;a href=\"hyperloop\"&gt;hyperloop&lt;/a&gt; line.\nThe city celebrates an event called &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt;, which, depending on who you ask, is the city's most important holiday. &lt;a href=\"OmnicCon\"&gt;OmnicCon&lt;/a&gt; is held within the city as well. It has a national anthem in the form of the Numbani Harmony Anthem, and the &lt;a href=\"Declaration%20of%20Unity\"&gt;Declaration of Unity&lt;/a&gt; is its founding document. The &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Civic%20Defense%20Department\"&gt;Numbani Civic Defense Department&lt;/a&gt; functions as its police force, and prior to their destruction, &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt; units patrolled the streets in order to keep the peace. The city uses the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira\"&gt;naira&lt;/a&gt; as its currency.\nHistory.\nThe city was established by &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt; as part of her peacemaking efforts after the end of the Omnic Crisis. Omnics and humans built Numbani together, and their mutual cooperation is the driving force behind Numbani's success. Adawe refused to allow &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; to have an official security presence in the city, as she wanted to bring the world to a point where Overwatch would no longer be required for humanity's survival. It was a decision that &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; struggled to understand, as he felt compelled to protect Adawe and her peace initiative. However, she held firm, as she wanted to make Numbani a truly independent city-state, free from the rest of the world's realpolitik.\nAt some point after the Omnic Crisis, Numbani was identified as an area with an active threat. It had to deal with raids by &lt;a href=\"Akinjide%20Adeyemi\"&gt;Akinjide Adeyemi&lt;/a&gt;, the second &lt;a href=\"Doomfist%20%28title%29\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, who earned the moniker of \"Scourge of Numbani.\" Adeyemi was killed by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, &lt;a href=\"Akande%20Ogundimu\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt;, who took both the Doomfist moniker and gauntlet as his own. \nWhen Tekhartha &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt; was assasinated by &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, his death set off a wave of human-omnic violence across the world. Numbani was an exception to this however.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nYears after Overwatch's disbandment, this third Doomfist escaped from his cell. To defend itself against those that would see the omnic-human relationship harmed and to defend against Doomfist, the citizens of Numbani developed the &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt; defense robot. However, they were destroyed by Doomfist who attacked Numbani's airport on Unity Day. As a result, flights in and out of Numbani were suspended. Doomfist's gauntlet was also stolen, and the city was under threat by him again. There had been rumors of an anonymous threat beforehand, but the citizens had expressed outrage when it was suggested that the Unity Day celebrations could be cancelled, and had promised to show up on the streets whether the city allowed it or not.\nDoomfist sought to spread discord between humans and omnics, and the city's police was powerless to stop him. In his mind, Numbani's existence as the City of Harmony would always be in opposition of Talon's goals of creating a chaotic world. To this end, Talon agents hacked into omnics, causing them to malfunction. While no serious harm occurred, it did lead to tensions between humans and omnics within the city, including at least one street brawl that the civic defenders had to break up. Doomfist took his reign of terror a step further when he destroyed the statue of Gabrielle Adawe in Peace Park. Addressing the city's citizens directly, stating that Numbani's ideals of unity had made the city weak. That the power of omnics was growing while humanity's power was waning, and that soon, omnics might have the upper hand. He declared himself to be the city's 'shepherd.'\nTalon ramped up its game when it attacked the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;. They were confronted by &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;; an omnic built by &lt;a href=\"Efi%20Oladele\"&gt;Efi Oladele&lt;/a&gt; out of an OR15 wreck. She was able to hold her own for a time, but Doomfist was able to incapacitate her without much difficulty. Efi confronted Doomfist himself at this point, who sneered at her accusation of him wanting to destroy Numbani. In his mind, he was saving it, wanting to to inflict a little chaos to bring out the best of the city. Orisa reactivated and forced Doomfist and his lieutenants to retreat. Afterwards, civic defenders arrived on the scene. In a subsequent interview, Efi stressed the need for Unity Day to go ahead.\nA Unity Day concert went ahead, with performances from &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Abyss\"&gt;Tonal Abyss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio%20Correia%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;L\u00facio Correia dos Santos&lt;/a&gt;, with tickets sold out in three hours. The event was disrupted by Doomfist and Talon, but they were fought off by Orisa and L\u00facio. With his defeat, things started to calm down in Numbani. The omnics who had been affected by Talon's hacking were cured, with help provided by the &lt;a href=\"Adawe%20Foundation\"&gt;Adawe Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nNumbani is a &lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Assault\"&gt;Assault&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Game%20Modes\"&gt;modes&lt;/a&gt;. The attacking team must gain control of the capture point outside of Aetria, and then escort the payload, which used to hold Doomfist's Gauntlet (As of the 1.8 patch, was removed), to the Numbani Heritage Museum.\nStrategy.\nThe various raised platforms and walkways scattered throughout the map can be used by both the attacking and defending teams who have heroes with movement abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;. Controlling these high ground areas can give your team a very strong advantage when attacking, and can deny that same advantage when defending.\nAttack.\nNumbani requires a fast team with high mobility and strong ranged abilities, around every corner there can be a long sight line for heroes such as &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; and to take advantage of. When attacking on Numbani, it is recommended to take advantage of and attempt to control the various catwalks and ledges as much as possible, as the high ground in this map allows high mobility heroes like &lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; to move into position behind your team without ever stepping near the payload. The spawn distances for attackers is about equal with the defenders, so taking a strong position on or near the point is more valuable than on a map with a very short attacker spawn like King's Row.\nAssault.\nThere are three main paths your team can take when assaulting the first point on Numbani, the first is a straight run past the buses, past the small room with the health pack, and onto the point, this is most often called Mid or Street. This is the easiest path to defend and It is recommended to avoid this path whenever possible.\nThe second option is a path that wraps around the far left side of the point, past the stairs and opens up your team to a cliff. Just after the cliff the path opens up into a set of stairs to the left with the point directly in front, this path is most often called Left or Side path. This is a fairly easy path to defend, and so this path is most often taken as a surprise, because if defenders are positioned on Top, there is a chance your team can slip by underneath the bridge and make your way up the stairs.\nThe third and fourth options, most commonly referred to as Top and Bottom, are the most common paths taken on Numbani. The Bottom path is entered through the first door near the second bus, this will take you through a room with a large health pack and bring you directly onto the point. This path is similar to Mid, but it provides cover from defenders positioned on Top and gives you easier access to the stairs. The Top path is taken by moving left up onto the ledge and up the large set of stairs near the entrance to Bottom, this path has a very hard choke to push through and is the only path without a large health pack, but gives you the strongest position to take the point.\nThe main goal of Numbani first point is to enter in through any of the four paths and take the high ground as fast as possible, because of the distance from spawn being about equal for attackers and defenders, taking an advantageous position is very valuable and losing a teammate during a push is much worse than on other assault or hybrid maps. Once your team has secured the high ground, you have the option to stay and fight the defenders positioned on the far bridge, wrap around the back of the point or drop down onto the point. It is usually correct to avoid dropping onto the point until at least 2 of the defenders have been killed to force them off of high ground to try and contest, at which point it will be easy to clean up the remaining defenders and take the point.\nEscort.\nCharacters like &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;, And &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; are very strong on this map, due to their mobility. Mei can blow off any enemy easily by walling some certain places off. L\u00facio can blast people into walls or rooms for a more vertical advantage, and Reinhardt can use the large city structure like walls and such to charge his enemies to their death.\nDefense.\nHeroes like &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, Widowmaker and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; are good for this map, due to the many ledges and walkways that allow them to get a heavy vertical and tactical advantage. Genji can escape to a large slew of rooms and ledges to avoid death. Widowmaker can use her grappling hook to send herself flying across the map onto something like the payload or a walkway. Cassidy can use one of the various flanking spots to use his Flashbang + Fan The Hammer + Tactical Roll to easily pick off squishes like Tracer and .\nAssault.\nThe first point on Numbani has four main locations to pay attention to as a defender, you have the main point which you are trying to defend, the ledge near Top and the staircase, the far bridge and walkway on the opposite side of Top closer to defender spawn and the main entrance aka Mid. There is also a door on the back side of the point that leads into the rest of the map that some heroes may use to escape, but staying in this area is often a bad idea.\nWhen positioning your team, it is recommended to place ranged healers like &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt; and ranged offense heroes like &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; on the far bridge and walkway, making use of the long sight lines and cover there, while the more close ranged heroes like &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; can be positioned on Top to cover the choke. This position gives your ranged healer and DPS role a large view of the point while still being within their effective range, and the rest of your team is in a good position to control the position that gives the attackers the most options. If the attacking team decides to avoid Top and go a different path, then the healer or ranged DPS will be able to spot them and notify the rest of the team to position accordingly.\nRemember that dropping onto the point with attackers on the high ground makes you very vulnerable, so try to avoid leaving your position unless it is absolutely necessary.\nEscort.\nA defending &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt;'s resting emote can be used to get an advantage by emoting in a bush and contesting the point or payload while remaining hidden. This is often called 'The Sexy Junkrat'.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nThe origins of Numbani lie in the development of \"&lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;\". The initial concept was designed by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Lee\"&gt;Peter Lee&lt;/a&gt;. He designed the city, but in the \"Titan\" setting, Numbani was a very different city in terms of tone. As \"Overwatch\" was developed, the story was taken in a different direction, as it became a city of peace and harmony between omnics and humans.\nIt has been observed that Numbani appears to take inspiration from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrofuturism\"&gt;Afrofuturism&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason 13 rework.\nNumbani was one of the four maps reworked in &lt;a href=\"Season%2013\"&gt;Season 13&lt;/a&gt; with the goal to address balance issues between attackers and defenders. The changes to Numbani specifically were made to simplify the area around the first point and make it more accessible to attackers and improving some flank routes and the accessibility to some high rounds around the map.\nOn the first point, the attacker spawn room has been moved much closer to the first point to reduce runback times and the interior of the cafe by the spawn has been modified. The cliffside high ground by the point has been lowered and the doorway has been widened. The cliffside staircase has also received an extension outwards easing the access to the high ground and the flank route behind the point. The paths in the building behind the point have also been connected. In the second area, the defender spawn area has been moved closer to reduce runback times, and a staircase has been added to the attacker spawn room for easier access to the high ground. Some cover has been moved around in the statue area after the first turn. Toward the third point, a path has been added far on the attacker's side, connecting past and above the choke point."}

In addition to their great strength and superior (by human standards) agility, OR14s were equipped with a pair of arm-mounted cannons, and an energy sword.\nHistory.\nDuring the Omnic Crisis, the OR14 served as a frontline combatant, and was commonly deployed alongside the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Siege%20Automaton%20E54\"&gt;Bastion Siege Automaton E54&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ATW-Huntsman\"&gt;ATW-Huntsman&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the war, the OR14 along with many other omnic models were taken out of production. Twenty years after the end of the conflict, the citizens of Numbani developed a more advanced version of the OR14, the &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt;, to protect themselves from threats against Numbani and more importantly, &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; used customized OR14's in the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, and labelled them as \"OR14-NS.\" The Null Sector variant was apparently not equipped with the energy sword, but instead was equipped with a barrier-deploying device.\nTrivia.\nThe origins of the OR14 are contradicted by various sources.

This account is backed up by her \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" hero page. According to &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; however, the OR14 was first created during the Omnic Crisis, specifically designed to fight humanity. This is backed up by \"\", which states that OR14s had never been seen before the war. "}

Their eyes glowed yellow, and hydraulic fluid ran through their bodies. The OR15s were highly lethal, but lacked social skills. &lt;a href=\"Efi%20Oladele\"&gt;Efi Oladele&lt;/a&gt; noted that they were more focused on capturing criminals than integrating with the wider community, never using honorifics or bowing, though were still capable of basic speech.

After the attack, the program was scrapped, the units decommissioned, and the civil government sold off the remaining OR15s. Functional individual units were sold off to independent bidders, while those too damaged to be sold were intended to be used as scrap metal.\nEfi Oladele purchased one of the decommissioned OR15 units intended for the scrap heap and created &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;, an upgraded version of the OR15 designed as a singular unit to represent what the OR15 units were supposed to do for her city."}

{"id": "14389", "revid": "27025711", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14389", "title": "Oasis", "text": " is a &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 3 January 2017, making it the 16th map added to the game. \nOfficial Description.\nOasis is one of the world's most advanced cities, a shining jewel rising from the Arabian Desert. A monument to human ingenuity and invention, researchers and academics from around the region came together to found a city dedicated to scientific progress without restraints. The city and its inhabitants are governed by the &lt;a href=\"Ministries\"&gt;Ministries&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of brilliant minds who possess many secrets that have attracted the interest of powerful organizations from around the world.\nBackground.\nOasis is set in the Arabian desert of Iraq. It was founded by a collective of eight leading scientists, led by &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20Hassoun\"&gt;Ibrahim Hassoun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anya%20Al-Shahrani\"&gt;Anya Al-Shahrani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Youssef%20al-Jabiri\"&gt;Youssef al-Jabiri&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mehmet%20Farhat\"&gt;Mehmet Farhat&lt;/a&gt;. They were looking for a way to push the boundaries of what modern science at the time could do, albeit hindered by regulations, feeling that science in the modern world was progressing at too slow a pace. To that end they founded Oasis as a testament to the ingenuity of humanity. In their minds, what better way to do so than by turning a desolate landscape into one of the most technologically advanced and wondrous cities in the world, which could serve as a hub for unrestricted scientific endeavor. (The Ministry of Geology, led by Dr. Al-Shahrani, spearheaded the effort by developing cutting-edge technology that could sustain a thriving city in a desert environment.)\nAs per its goal for advancing human knowledge, Oasis has one of the most highly educated populations on Earth, served by a state-of-the-art &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oasis\"&gt;university&lt;/a&gt; and a database of all the world's known existing printed material. It also ranks as one of the safest cities due to its usage of advanced predictive surveillance and crime modeling. Inhabitants also enjoy access to a wide range of world-class amenities, such as the verdant &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Hassoun%20Gardens\"&gt;Abu Hassoun Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, temperature controlled streets, the luxurious &lt;a href=\"Gilded%20Tower%20Hotel\"&gt;Gilded Tower Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"elBuffi\"&gt;elBuffi&lt;/a&gt; restaurant, considered the best dining establishment in the world. Perhaps the only cause for concern is the growing city's heavy traffic, for which the Ministry of Transportation has issued a public advisory. One of Oasis' most recognizable landmarks is an enigmatic tower that remains under construction for an indefinite period of time. Already the world's tallest building, it is slated to become the tallest freestanding structure of any kind. It is believed that the project is part of the city's ever-expanding computational and data collecting efforts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt; desires to have a presence in the city. &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Securities\"&gt;Helix Securities&lt;/a&gt; is apparently contracted by the city, and its operatives have been brought in to retrieve escaped wolfbats on at least one occasion.\nPart of Oasis was vandalized by the &lt;a href=\"Phreaks\"&gt;Phreaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nEach turn is played on one of the three sections of the map:\nDevelopment.\nWork on Oasis began after \"Overwatch\" shipped. The developers wanted to create another Control map. &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Petras\"&gt;Bill Petras&lt;/a&gt; wanted to do a futuristic setting for the map, and in discussion, the idea of basing the map on a Middle-Eastern setting came up; futuristic, but still bearing the architectural touchstones of the region. The design of Oasis was inspired by several research photos of cities in Iraq. The map itself is intended as a deviation of how Iraq has usually been portrayed in games (war-torn).

The 'eyes' are shapes shown on an LED screen or an equivalent that serve as a face, changing shape to communicate mood. The screen can serve as a flashlight, show images (e.g. a battery sign) and letters and numbers. It is usually docked on the capsule on Mei's back, and is able to detach itself at will. Snowball moves around by hovering, through the use of three adjustable thrusters for 'feet'. It has a playful and sometimes mischievous personality.\nRise and Shine.\nSnowball operated with a team of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; scientists at . Disaster struck the station when it was hit by a polar storm, damaging the station's solar array. Cut off from the outside world, the scientists were left stranded in the damaged facility. As their supplies dwindled, they entered cryostasis in a last-ditch effort to survive until a rescue attempt could be made. Snowball itself entered power saving mode.\nNearly a decade later, the base picked up an external transmission, which prompted the pods to be reactivated. However, &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; was the only one who emerged. Upon examining the data she'd collected while she'd been in stasis, she realized that the amount of data was extraordinarily large, and Snowball revealed that she'd been in stasis for nine years. They quickly discovered that Overwatch had been shut down in the intervening period, and that they had no means of contacting the outside world. They likewise soon discovered that the other scientists had perished while in cryo. Snowball did what it could to comfort Mei. She decided that she had to get her data out to the world. However, leaving the base wouldn't be easy, as the satellite dish was broken, a blizzard was raging outside, the snow-crawler was snowed in, and Snowball confirmed that the helicopter was inoperable.\nMei set about creating a device that would repair the dish, so they could listen to the transmission that had been picked up. Close to completion, the base's batteries gave out, which also meant that she couldn't finish the device. Snowball decided on its own to completely drain its batteries to power Mei's workstation, not knowing if Mei could ever recharge it ever again. However, its actions allowed Mei to finish her work, and learn that the transmission had been sent by &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, issuing a recall for Overwatch agents. Mei left the base by hiking across the Antarctic landscape, now that the blizzard had ended. She carried Snowball on her back, plugged into a charger connected to a portable solar panel. Under the Antarctic sun, Snowball was recharged and 'awoke,' much to Mei's delight.\nZero Hour.\nSnowball was with Mei when she, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; deployed in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; to defend the city against &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of other Overwatch agents, they were able to defeat the invading &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s. In the aftermath, Winston declared that Overwatch had returned."}

He was once approached by &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to recruit him, but he refused, finding that their aims did not coincide with his own. \nWhile his eldest son, &lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt;, was groomed to take over as leader of the clan, Sojiro spoiled his youngest son, &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, who ignored the family business and engaged in frivolous pursuits. He employed &lt;a href=\"Asa%20Yamagami\"&gt;Asa Yamagami&lt;/a&gt; to instruct his sons in the Way of the Sword. One night, after the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Summer%20Festival\"&gt;End of Summer Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Sojiro told his sons and &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt; (Asa's daughter) a story from the history of the Shimada clan. How centuries ago, a rival clan attempted to end the Shimada's rule by setting their orchards aflame, as well as the city's &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Shrine\"&gt;Fox Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. The rival clan anticipated that the Shimada would move to protect their fields rather than the people of Kanezaka, but instead, the opposite happened. The Shimada aided their people first, and united with the clan, the Kanezakans made short work of the rival clan lying in wait at the orchards. The lesson, as Sojiro imparted to the three children, was that a leader's relationship must be mutually beneficial with their people, or else, they were nothing more than a parasite.\nSojiro was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Hashimoto%20clan\"&gt;Hashimoto clan&lt;/a&gt;. His death led to a tragedy between his sons, as the clan elders provoked a near-fatal confrontation between the two brothers. Ultimately, Hanzo deserted the clan, while Genji destroyed it. In the ensuing power vacuum, the Hashimoto took over &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "31642", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=31642", "title": "Sojourn", "text": "Sojourn is a &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 26 April 2022, she is the 33rd hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nAs a former Overwatch Captain, Sojourn fields abilities designed to plan, lead, and execute strikes on her opposition. Sojourn offers a unique mid-range gameplay experience and a kit packed with some incredible mobility and artillery.\nStrategy.\nSojourn can be a difficult hero to play\u2014the more accurate the player's aim, the more effective they're going to be with her railgun, resulting in a high skill ceiling with a lot of power weighted in her railgun\u2019s secondary fire.\nStory.\nSojourn was a member of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, joining at some point in the organization's Golden Age and staying with them into their twilight years. From soldier to Overwatch captain to veteran, Sojourn has devoted her life to helping those who would be made victims by the evils of the world. Never one to fight for personal glory, Sojourn has fought because she was needed, and should that need arise, Sojourn will meet it.\nDedicated to the rule of law, Sojourn is detail-orientated. She is a brilliant tactician, a great leader, and a \"measure twice, cut once\" type of individual. She is known for her discipline, and is good at playing cards. She is more of a basketball than hockey person, and is interested in taking up &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassblowing\"&gt;glassblowing&lt;/a&gt;.\nSojourn has had a lot of cybernetic upgrades in her life, starting out of necessity in her childhood, before moving onto voluntary upgrades. Sojourn's legs and arms are cybernetic. Her left arm can transform into a disruptor cannon, and her legs are equipped with boosters that allow her to slide across the ground as if they were ice skates. Even without the boosters, her cybernetic legs and artificial heart allow her to run faster and harder than un-augmented humans. Her cybernetic limbs are resilient to a wider range of temperatures than organic limbs. Her heart makes her pulse difficult to read, and makes it easier for her to adjust to high altitudes. Due to the cybernetics, she feels less pain than a normal human, given that many of her body's pain receptors were removed to make room for the upgrades.\nSojourn has had at least two sets of cybernetic eyes. Her original lenses granted her infra-red vision. The second set was able to link with &lt;a href=\"CSOR\"&gt;CSOR&lt;/a&gt;'s intelligence network, and give her a detailed real-time view of battles, such as the location of friendly and enemy troops. The infra-red vision's range also increased. At some point, she received cybernetic brain upgrades, though these often trigger security scanners. Her cybernetic upgrades have improved her speed, precision, and tactical prowess. Her original cybernetics made her slightly stronger than most humans, but still weaker than even humanoid omnics. After receiving her upgrades from &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;, Sojourn's strength was increased to the point that she could fight off omnics with her bare (metallic) hands. Sojourn is at peace with her enhancements; for her, her cybernetics are a means to an end, but only the objective matters. By the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Second Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Sojourn's cybernetics were no longer on the cutting edge.\nSojourn dislikes beaches, as the sand and salt water don't agree with her cybernetics. She similarly dislikes decaf coffee and the &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nEarly Life.\nVivian Chase grew up in a small, tight-knit &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood, the daughter of ex-military parents. Her parents got her interested in military strategy from a young age.\nVivian was born with a rare, terminal autoimmune disease that caused her body to attack its own organs, and as such, Vivian spent much of her childhood and teenage years in and out of hospitals. Her first operation was around the age of 4 (or younger). The experience, including the tears in her father's eyes (a soldier, and usually quiet and steadfast) stayed with her well into her twenties. While that was her first operation, it was not the last, and much of Vivian's childhood was spent with her mother, going from one specialist appointment to the next. In contrast, her twin sister, &lt;a href=\"Valentine%20Chase\"&gt;Valentine&lt;/a&gt;, was able to enjoy a normal childhood. A case in point was when the twins were taken to the &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Island\"&gt;Centre Island&lt;/a&gt; amusement park on more than one occasion. While Valentine had fun, Vivian's condition meant that she was almost always too sick to join her sister, or her parents were too overcautious to let her. \nThe stays in hospitals gave Vivian plenty of time to read books (usually those that dealt with military strategy) and play strategy simulations. During one of her many hospital stays, Vivian's grandfather (a retired admiral) taught her how to play &lt;a href=\"Shah%20Matt\"&gt;Shah Matt&lt;/a&gt;. Vivian loved playing the game, and even spent time in-between visits devising new campaigns. However, he died on one of the nights she was formulating a strategy. When her father told her the news, the firsts words that left her mouth were \"I was going to win this time.\" With his death, her family inherited his old &lt;a href=\"VAC\"&gt;VAC&lt;/a&gt; omnic unit. Vivian taught it how to play Shah Matt, but its &lt;a href=\"artificial%20intelligence\"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; made it unbeatable. \nAs members of the Canadian military, the Chases travelled around the world, bringing Vivian and Valentine with them. They moved all over Canada, and spent a couple of months in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, Dubai, and many parts of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Vivian loved the travel; learning about new places and cultures, other histories. On a school trip, she visited the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Tower\"&gt;Peace Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ottawa\"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs time went on, Vivian's condition worsened. At school, she was often left to sit on the bench at sport or at lunchtime, unable to join in with her friends. In the end, the disease necessitated life-saving cybernetic replacements. Her case caught the attention of &lt;a href=\"Elaine%20Esat\"&gt;Elaine Esat&lt;/a&gt;; a doctor pioneering a highly experimental treatment for Vivian\u2019s disease. At the age of 13, her spine, heart, lungs, and most of her bones were replaced with cybernetics. After the operation, her father would often say that Vivian had been \"born twice.\" The operation allowed her to return to school, but people treated her warily. The friends she'd once had were now distant and wary of her. Other kids pinched her without permission and asked if they could feel her cybernetics. Even when they weren't doing that, she had to endure the stares and whispers. When someone said that she couldn't love due to not having a \"real\" heart, Vivian sat in the bathroom and cried. One small piece of comfort was that Valentine always defended her, even getting into fights on her behalf.\nAt age 15, she sat beside her father and watched the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships\"&gt;Wimbledon Championships&lt;/a&gt;. At age 16, she was allowed to enlist in the Canadian &lt;a href=\"Primary%20Reserve\"&gt;Primary Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, as she easily met all the fitness requirements (helped by her cybernetics). She went to university after high school. One of her courses was statistics.\nCanadian Army.\nAfter university, Chase joined the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Army\"&gt;Canadian Army&lt;/a&gt;, where she voluntarily received cybernetic upgrades, choosing her abilities to be the most effective fighter she could be. These included cybernetic eyes. Chase's time in the Army was not smooth sailing, as the military celebrated physical uniformity, and as such, her cybernetics made her feel like an outsider. She became acquainted with Major &lt;a href=\"Campbell\"&gt;Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, who had long expressed concerns about the CAF's use of cybernetic soldiers. Nevertheless, he managed to be polite with her. However, he wasn't the only CAF member who had problems with cybernetics; those who believed that cyborgs made for inferior service. However, Chase took part in numerous deployments, and proved the naysayers wrong every time. Her deployments included parachuting into warzones. She gained the reputation of being a tactical ace.\nChase loved her time in the CAF, later reflecting that her years of being crippled by her disease meant that she was able to relish the freedom she now had. Over the last year of her service, she focused on trying to reach the rank of captain.\nOmnic Crisis.\nCentre Island.\nA week or two before the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began, at/around the age of 23, Chase took part in an outreach program with schoolkids who wanted to join the CAF, answering their questions in their classroom.\nOn the day the Omnic Crisis began, while on leave, Chase was with her sister, and five year-old niece, &lt;a href=\"Bonnie%20Chase-Chapman\"&gt;Bonnie&lt;/a&gt;. Bonnie's omnic caretaker, &lt;a href=\"Julietta\"&gt;Julietta&lt;/a&gt;, was also present, which added to Chase's unease given that the amusement park's formerly human staff had been replaced by omnics. She was able to see the exact moment the Omnic Crisis struck &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, as a plane fell out of the sky, impacting the far side of the island. Seconds later, the omnics around them began attacking their human masters. Chase's military training kicked in, and she began fighting against the omnics, despite being outmatched. One of them pinned her and began to pummel her head, until Valentine got it off with a cricket bat. It distracted the robot long enough for Chase to regain her bearings...and realize, as did Valentine, that Julietta was drowning Bonnie in the lake. Chase tried to head to Bonnie, but due to the injuries the omnic had inflicted her, she passed out.\nWhen Chase woke up (now night), she found herself in a holding bay, among which were the bodies of numerous omnics. She was being scanned by a device that could not tell if she was human or omnic, due to her cybernetic implants. Looking around, she could see that Toronto was aflame, and could hear gunfire and sirens. She tried to get out, but the scanner refused to release her, as it believed her to be an omnic. She was rescued by Campbell, who explained that most of the civilians had been taken to a field hospital at &lt;a href=\"Hanlan%27s%20Point%20Beach\"&gt;Hanlan's Point Beach&lt;/a&gt;. As the two headed to the beach, Campbell filled her in on the Omnic Crisis; what was happening in Toronto was occurring in cities all over the world. Millions had died already. As they moved through the ruins of the amusement park, Chase picked up Valentine's wedding ring.\nAt the beach, Campbell directed Chase to Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Brady\"&gt;Brady&lt;/a&gt;, who reunited her with Valentine and Bonnie. However, Bonnie was in critical condition, kept alive via a respirator. Chase found comfort in realizing her sister and niece were alive, if not unharmed, but in her grief, Valentine lashed out against Chase, asking Chase why she hadn't saved Bonnie. Why she had tried to save her instead. Reflecting on the moment, Chase knew that cold-hard calculus had dictated her actions. She tried to explain, but Valentine screamed at her to go away. Hurt, Chase obliged.\nLater, after putting in a request to the CAF to return to active service, Chase sat on the edge of Lake Ontario. She realized that she'd forgotten to give Valentine her wedding ring back. Her reminiscence was broken by Campbell, who informed her that her request to return to service had been granted (technically a formality, as all active personnel had been recalled), and that she had been transferred to &lt;a href=\"CANSOFCOM-CSOR\"&gt;CANSOFCOM-CSOR&lt;/a&gt; with the rank of captain. As Campbell explained, every Canadian soldier with four years of active service had been granted the rank of captain, as the CAF had lost 5% of its forces in the last twelve hours. He joked that if she survived another twelve years, she might even reach major.\nToronto.\nAs a captain in CANSOFCOM-CSOR, Chase served as a troop commander, leading detachments that specialized in rescue and retrieval. She was given a prototype &lt;a href=\"railgun\"&gt;railgun&lt;/a&gt;, as her cybernetic upgrades meant that she could handle its recoil.\nInitially, Chase's SAR operations took place in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, fighting the omnics to save as many civilians as they could from the heart of the city, from skyscrapers to the subway. One of her first missions involved rescuing a group of school children, who'd fled when their omnic teachers began attacking. She lost operatives along the way, whether it be from omnic squads or buildings collapsing on them. Initially, the operatives under her command believed that the war would be over soon, as initially, the CAF had the upperhand; more firepower and air superiority. Two weeks after the war began, the soldiers began joking that they would be home by Christmas. During this period, she also carried out a mission in &lt;a href=\"Ottawa\"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, where she helped evacuate civilians from its downtown area. She also heard rumors of a group named &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the tide turned back in the omnics' favor quickly, as the world's &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s reactivated, replenishing the omnics' numbers, and doing so with robots specifically designed for war. The &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20omnium\"&gt;Detroit omnium&lt;/a&gt; sent waves of omnics north across the border, putting Chase and her detachments back on the defensive. The constant death began to take its toll on her. She kept tabs on Bonnie and Valentine, who had been evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. However, three months on, Bonnie was still on a respirator. By this point, Chase knew that the CAF was losing the war, and as such, her unit's duties had shifted from rescue-and-retrieval to tasks such as scouting and strategy. Every morning, she woke up early to review fresh field data, or run drills. Despite the dire situation, Chase refused to cede Toronto.\nMontreal.\nChase and her unit received intel that a detachment was holed up at &lt;a href=\"Underground%20City\"&gt;Underground City&lt;/a&gt;, downtown &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;. Chase planned to launch a rescue mission, but this was resisted by Major Campbell and Commanding Officer &lt;a href=\"Fournier\"&gt;Fournier&lt;/a&gt;. While Montreal was swarming with omnics, Chase believed that they didn't know about Underground City. Presenting her rescue plan to the brass, Campbell still resisted, but officers who outranked him were impressed by Chase's planning, and gave the operation a go-ahead. As she headed to the armory, Campbell told her that if anything went wrong, it was on her.\nThe op began, and like most evac runs, it didn't take long for things to go wrong. It took less than an hour for Chase and her operatives to reach the shopping center where their comrades were located; about a hundred, including civilians. However, Chase was informed that the omnics were now blocking the tunnels they'd entered through. Chase ordered exfiltration by splitting up into numerous groups, exiting the center through different exits. On the way out, Chase and her group were attacked by an &lt;a href=\"OR14\"&gt;OR14&lt;/a&gt;. Chase easily destroyed it with her railgun, but its destruction alerted other omnics to their presence.\nThe omnic ambush came quickly, and Chase was hit by an OR14's &lt;a href=\"fusion%20driver\"&gt;fusion driver&lt;/a&gt;. As gunfire erupted around her, Chase realized that instead of funneling the enemy, the tunnels had allowed the omnics to close in through a pincer movement. Furthermore, such was the intensity of the omnics' firepower, she feared that the tunnel might collapse on them. When all seemed lost, gunfire from another group of soldiers tore through the attacking omnics. Seeing their blue uniforms, Chase realized that they weren't CANSOFCOM operatives, and ordered them to state their rank. They identified themselves as Captain &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; and Chief Engineer &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;, and that they were part of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Overwatch and CANSOFCOM-CSOR made their way to the surface, where &lt;a href=\"stratroscopter\"&gt;stratroscopter&lt;/a&gt;s had arrived to evacuate the soldiers and civilians. They took off, and people began clapping. Chase realized that they were applauding her. Over the comms., Fournier announced that they'd saved 117 civilians, plus the stranded squad. Not letting any good deed go unpunished, Campbell stated that if not for the arrival of Overwatch, things could have gone very differently. Inside the stratoscopter, Chase met a third Overwatch member, Dr. &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;, who offered to fix her lenses. Chase, never eager to discuss her cybernetics in public, refused. Looking out over the ruins of Montreal, she was reminded of the Shah Matt games she'd played against her grandfather's omnic. That despite their victory today, there'd be more battles to come.\nAfter-action.\nBack in the Laurentian Mountains base, Fournier briefed Chase and her fellow operatives on their new strategy. With the aid of Overwatch, the CAF would clear out all omnic forces from Canada's southern cities down to Toronto, after which they would use infantry to establish a permanent perimeter against the Detroit omnium's forces. As the CAF's actions up to this point had been focused on defending Quebec, Chase was dubious of the plan, but Liao introduced them to the &lt;a href=\"heron\"&gt;heron&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014devices invisible to omnics that, when combined with turrets, would easily mow them down. Campbell further explained that with defender's advantage, these devices would make it easier for the CAF to defend the cities they planned to retake. Chase's unit was assigned to provide tactical support to the Overwatch strike team.\nLater, in the infirmary, Chase agreed to let Liao look at her cybernetics. She explained that she couldn't fix Chase's cybernetic lenses, but could provide her new ones. Liao offered to further upgrade her, but Chase, wary of Liao given her history with Omnica Corp, just wanted to be fixed. Liao obliged, and after the operation, Liao walked her through the new interface. Chase found herself enamored with the upgrades. In the armory, they encountered Lindholm and Doctor &lt;a href=\"Karlesson\"&gt;Karlesson&lt;/a&gt;, who were discussing the herons. Chase noticed the clear animosity Lindholm held towards Liao, who explained that Lindholm, and many others, held her responsible for the Omnic Crisis. Chase sympathized with Liao, but only to a point\u2014for all the good Omnica's advances had created, it would mean nothing if the omnics burnt the world down.\nOttawa.\nChase's unit and Overwatch were deployed to Ottawa. By this point, the city lay in ruins. Their mission was to set up a heron siege, which would make it easier to retake the city. According to Morrison, the CAF and Overwatch only had a few weeks to enact their plan before the omnics were able to find a way to counter their assault. Chase saw his point, but was afraid that their resources were being stretched thin. Deploying on &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20Hill\"&gt;Parliament Hill&lt;/a&gt;, the joint CSOR-Overwatch team set up defensive positions, where they had to defend the engineers for 18.5 minutes. At first, there was no omnic counter-attack, which led them to suspect that the RCAF's prior bombing strikes had been more effective than they'd hoped for.\nHowever, the good fortune didn't last, and a horde of omnics attacked their position. Chase recommended that they abort the mission, and &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Avery\"&gt;one of her soldiers&lt;/a&gt; informed her of a Bastion tank column moving on their position. Taking a lookout, she saw the column moving across the &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Bridge\"&gt;Alexandra Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Acting as a spotter, she directed Morrison's &lt;a href=\"Helix%20rocket\"&gt;Helix rocket&lt;/a&gt;s to the bridge's weakest points, causing it to collapse, and taking the tank column with it. However, by this point, omnics on their side of the river had broken through one of their flanks, and casualties were starting to stack up. Coupled with the arrival of a &lt;a href=\"Detonator\"&gt;Detonator&lt;/a&gt;, Chase ordered the force to retreat.\nA stratoscopter evacuated the survivors, leaving Chase to reflect what they might have done differently. She realized that next time, they would have to be less predictable. Looking over the ruins of Ottawa, the weight of their defeat sinking in, Chase reflected that if things didn't change, the entire world might look like the city below her.\nIn the days that followed, Chase repeatedly reviewed the mission. In a conversation with Morrison, she stated that the number of omnics was so large because of their proximity to the Detroit omnium. She reflected on how quickly the omnics were able to react to human strategies, recalling her Shah Matt games. She deduced that maybe, humanity was trying too hard to think like machines themselves. That like in a chess game against a machine, they had to play beautifully, rather than logically.\nOld Toronto.\nThe Canadian winter bit deep into the CAF's supplies. While still in the Laurentian Mountains, &lt;a href=\"Noah%20Forstall\"&gt;Noah Forstall&lt;/a&gt; told Chase that he planned to propose to &lt;a href=\"Helena%20Dean\"&gt;Helena Dean&lt;/a&gt;, but was unsure if this was the best time. She told him now was as time as good as any.\nAfter breakfast, Chase ran through her new strategy for a heron siege. They would set up in a less exposed area of Toronto, namely Spadina Road, namely the section that ran over a downtown park. There was little omnic activity in the area, and the bridge would give them choke points against any counter-attack. &lt;a href=\"Davenport%20House\"&gt;Davenport House&lt;/a&gt; would be their fall-back position. Chase was pleased to see that troop morale was high, and that Fournier approved the plan. She was less pleased, however, to see Lindholm and Liao still at odds, as Lindholm refused to let Liao take to the field as she wasn't a soldier.\nThe teams landed, the siege deployment time having been reduced to 15 minutes. In 3 minutes, however, omnics were already attacking. However, there were less omnics than in Ottawa, and Chase realized that her plan was working\u2014the omnics hadn't expected on an insertion so deep into their lines. However, it was at this point that a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; emerged. Chase gave the order to retreat, as no matter the firepower of the herons' turrets, there was no way they could down a machine that size. But even that was a moot point, as the siege system failed to activate, and the Titan destroyed the stratoscopter meant to evacuate them.\nThe teams fell back to Davenport. A head-count was done, and morale sagged, in the wake of yet another failed mission. On the subject of the herons, Sergeant &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Grayson\"&gt;Jonathan Grayson&lt;/a&gt; suggested that some of the components could have been damaged in transit, but that they could de-deploy them on the end of Spadina Road. Chase pointed out that there was still the Titan to deal with, but Lindholm maintained that the siege system had enough firepower to take it down. However, fixing the bugs would take hours. Furthermore, there was no way a stratoscopter could evacuate them with the Titan still in the area. On that note, Morrison gave the order to hunker down, given that Davenport was a good defensive position, and it would give the engineers time to fix the heron bugs.\nAs the soldiers secured the mansion, Chase contacted Campbell, who was scathing as to yet another failed mission, and dubious that the herons could take down the Titan. Warrant Officer &lt;a href=\"Duvall\"&gt;Duvall&lt;/a&gt; explained that evac could be deployed at 0600 tomorrow, but that the area was crawling with anti-aircraft weaponry. That they couldn't enter unless the area was secured. As the night wore on, Chase and Morrison talked things over, where he told her about his participation in the &lt;a href=\"Soldier%20Enhancement%20Program\"&gt;Soldier Enhancement Program&lt;/a&gt;. With Morrison having received biological augmentations, and Chase cybernetic ones, the two were able to bond over their experiences.\nAfterwards, Chase talked to Lindholm, who was still having problems with the siege system. She convinced him to swallow his pride and contact Liao, who, politely, instructed Lindholm on what to do. Exhausted, Chase fell asleep, before being woken at 0500, as Lindholm declared that the system had been fixed. Heading out of Davenport, the teams set up in &lt;a href=\"Spadina%20Park\"&gt;Spadina Park&lt;/a&gt;, where the Titan moved on their position. They opened fire, but couldn't damage it. However, the siege system was activated, and downed the Titan...which began to fall...right towards them. However, they boarded a stratoscopter and escaped safely. Overjoyed, Morrison declared that they could expand the siege system to take Toronto. For the first time in ages, Chase felt hope. However, the operation had cost them a third of their deployed forces.\nThe Puppetmaster.\nThe victory in Toronto raised spirits throughout the Laurentides base. After watching Liao and Lindholm reconcile, Chase and Liao discussed the omniums. Even now, months into the war, it was a mystery as to how they'd been started up. Liao pointed out how all across the globe, omnic tactics shifted simultaneously, which was not only surprising (since each omnium's force would face different challenges), but as millions of omnics were active, there would need to be some kind of hierarchy to sort through the communication. Chase suggested that maybe some kind of &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;outside force&lt;/a&gt; was taking in all the transmitted data, and issuing orders to omnic forces. Examining the omniums' network traffic, Liao concluded that Chase's theory might have some weight. Chase then suggested that if the omniums were receiving orders from an outside force, if they were able to sever the omniums from said force...could they be shut down?\nAt dinner, Chase asked the assembled soldiers as to how one would destroy an omnium. Multiple theories were raised, then shot down, before Liao raised what Chase had said earlier, about the omniums being controlled from the outside. If they were able to get inside an omnium, and shut down its internal access ports, they could quarantine the omnium from outside control. However, getting inside at all would be hazardous\u2014potentially a one-way trip, and Liao would have to go in with them. Regardless, they began to make plans to attack the Detroit omnium.\nSojourn.\nAfter extensive preparation, the plan was pitched to the brass. Fournier approved it, but recommended that thanks to recommendations from Campbell, Chase would be put on immediate leave. Campbell listed numerous failures (e.g. Ottawa), and while the Overwatch members defended her, Campbell's prejudice against cybernetics was clouding his judgment. In his mind, Chase was already part-omnic. While more level-headed, Fournier nevertheless agreed with Campbell, and put Chase on leave. Frustrated, she didn't have the heart to fight against the decision, and instead trained detachment leaders in &lt;a href=\"VR\"&gt;VR&lt;/a&gt; as to how to take down a Titan. After the session, she informed them that she'd been taken off the Detroit mission.\nIn response, fully half of Chase's unit refused to go on the mission if she wasn't leading it. Entering the VR training room, the Overwatch members also stood up for her. While Campbell didn't relent, Fournier stepped in, and put Chase back on active duty. Afterwards, Liao upgraded her cybernetic limbs, allowing Chase to duck and slide via leg boosters. The day after she received the upgrades, she received news that Bonnie might never walk again, and that her doctors were considering cybernetics. The day after that, the CAF-Overwatch team was deployed to begin the Detroit operation. \nDetroit.\nThe CAF and Overwatch forces deployed 80km from the Detroit omnium, where they linked up with Captain &lt;a href=\"Page\"&gt;Page&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; force. The initial assault went well, and after the siege system was installed, Chase and her unit deployed in AFVs behind US tanks. Chase noted that the battle was going well...perhaps too well...remembering her old Shah Matt, she knew there was always something else, and the omnium obliged, as its massive bay doors, revealing a Titan larger than anything they'd ever seen before. It opened fire, but Forstall was able to push her aside at the last minute. However, the Titan began tearing through the tanks with ease.\nThe battle was now turning into a disaster, such was the Titan's firepower. There was no way they could make it to the front entrance. Over the radio, Morrison told Chase that Liao had a plan\u2014the herons could carry them in. However, they could only spare so many, as they needed the majority of the herons for the siege. Only three people could be carried in, who would be Morrison, Liao, and Chase herself. Chase was loathe to leave her soldiers, but relented. The trio successfully entered the omnium as its giant doors closed behind them.\nLiao explained that the omnium hadn't detected their presence yet, but as soon as they started deactivating the access points, they would. Chase was uneasy\u2014the original plan had involved far more troopers inside the omnium, and Liao was clearly scared, given that this was her first time in combat. They planned to deactivate the first point together, then split up to deactivate the others, then reconvene on the final port. To Chase, the plan seemed like a Hail Mary, but she agreed.\nThe first point was deactivated, and the omnics immediately attacked them. Liao was wounded, but Chase and Morrison realized that the omnics weren't firing, apparently out of fear of damaging the server room. Glad for the slight advantage, she and Morrison escorted Liao to the second server room, after which Morrison headed off to the third, and she the fourth. Using her cybernetics to her advantage, Chase dashed through the omnium, only firing at the omnics directly in her way, until an OR14 was destroyed. However, with her upgrades, she found she could even fight off OR14s hand-to-hand.\nChase destroyed her assigned server room, but heard a scream. A couple of floors up, Liao was holding onto a ledge. Using her augmented agility, she managed to get up there and save her, much to Liao's gratitude. Liao explained that the omnics had stopped her from deactivating the access port, so Chase covered her while she did so. However, they were now cornered by omnics, and there was no way she could fight through all of them. However, Liao found an air vent which they were able to slip through, before descending back down to reunite with Morrison. Only one server room remained. However, in another gunfight with omnics, one of Morrison's Helix rockets hit pressurized oxygen containers, the resulting explosion destroying the omnics, incapacitating Liao, and triggering a fire that blocked access to the server room.\nMorrison appeared to say something...\"you,\" she read. Given her cybernetic upgrades, she had the best, maybe only chance of getting through the fires to shut down the last server port. While it was potentially a suicide run, Chase dashed through the fire and dismantled the last access port before falling unconcious due to smoke inhalation.\nChase woke up to find herself being treated by a US Army doctor. Morrison and Liao were similarly being treated. Via &lt;a href=\"holoscreen\"&gt;holoscreen&lt;/a&gt;, Lindholm informed them that the omnium had been successfully shut down, and that reinforcements were en route to destroy the remaining omnics and dismantle the factory. Fournier joined the call, congratulating Chase. Morrison offered Chase a position in Overwatch, but she refused, stating that her country still needed her.\nReturn to Centre Island.\nEight months after the beginning of the war, on Bonnie's sixth birthday, Chase, Valentine, and Bonnie returned to Centre Island to celebrate her birthday party. By this point, Toronto had been retaken, and a memorial garden planted on the island. While the war wasn't over, the tide was beginning to turn in humanity's favor, at least in Canada and the United States. Valentine and Chase made up for their altercation eight months ago.\nPost-Crisis.\nFor her service in the war, Chase received numerous commendations for heroism and leadership. However, after the Crisis, she still felt her mission wasn\u2019t over. She requested a transfer to a counterterrorism unit within the Canadian Special Forces, where she helped with the takedown of &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20United\"&gt;Ontario United&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-omnic hate group.\nOverwatch.\nAfter the war was over, Morrison reached out to Chase for a chance to join Overwatch, to which she agreed.\nAs a member of Overwatch, Chase was given the callsign \"Sojourn.\" Her duties involved \"whatever was needed.\" Sometimes she ran point for agents in the field, other times, she commanded the operation. Sojourn made a point of always bringing her operatives home. She soon gained a reputation as an empathetic, clear-headed tactician with exceptional concern for the people she led into battle. In addition to Overwatch agents, Sojourn spent a considerable amount of time with Overwatch\u2019s ground troops as well, and over time, she became one of Overwatch\u2019s most trusted leaders.\nWhile in Overwatch, Sojourn managed to beat &lt;a href=\"Burnes\"&gt;Burnes&lt;/a&gt; at cards once, though Morrison suspected that Burnes let her win.\nSojourn featured in the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28cartoon%29\"&gt;\"Overwatch\" cartoon&lt;/a&gt; that aired before the group was disbanded. In one episode, Sojourn led her fighters in a battle against &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;. Even though they were heavily outnumbered, Sojourn and her crew didn't rest until every Talon agent was eliminated.\nSojourn commanded Overwatch forces during the &lt;a href=\"Blacksand%20Fires\"&gt;Blacksand Fires&lt;/a&gt;, where they engaged the &lt;a href=\"Deepsea%20Raiders\"&gt;Deepsea Raiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nStorm Rising.\nAfter Overwatch struggled to arrest &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, Sojourn suggested to Strike-Commander that the organization change tactics by instead arresting Doomfist's accountant, &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt;. She soothed Jack's anxieties about sending the strike team out after an in-field incident with &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, and she believed that Jack would agree with her that &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; has grown as a leader since the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Uprising\"&gt;Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. She assigned Tracer to lead a strike team of &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; in the mission to track Maximilien. In the operation, she supported the team via radio, and they successfully apprehended Maximilien.\nThe End of Overwatch.\nThe longer Sojourn spent with Overwatch, the less satisfied she became with its politics. She felt that the organization had lost its way. \nAfter Morrison's apparent death at &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20HQ\"&gt;Overwatch HQ&lt;/a&gt;, Sojourn was made acting commander of the organization. She was later brought before the &lt;a href=\"IJC\"&gt;IJC&lt;/a&gt; to testify, where she detailed her service history. In a series of public hearings, Sojourn spoke truthfully about her experiences, and her testimony proved pivotal in passing the &lt;a href=\"Petras%20Act\"&gt;Petras Act&lt;/a&gt; and ending Overwatch. When Overwatch was shut down, Sojourn personally removed her belongings from a now empty . While she was honored to have served with Overwatch, she knew \"it was time to say goodbye,\" and left the base on a &lt;a href=\"hovercycle\"&gt;hovercycle&lt;/a&gt;. She left Overwatch with a spotless record.\nAfter Overwatch's disbandment, Sojourn laid low in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. She went back to Toronto, where she lived alongside her old rescue dog, &lt;a href=\"Murphy\"&gt;Murphy&lt;/a&gt;. Setting into early, uneasy retirement, it was reasoned that the cybernetic hero who saved Canada from threat after threat has earned herself some peace.\nRecall.\nYears later, Sojourn was one of the group's former members recalled by &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;. But she never responded at first. \nThe Hero of Numbani.\nAfter expelling &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Efi%20Oladele\"&gt;Efi Oladele&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt; met with Sojourn about what it meant to be a hero. Efi took Sojourn\u2019s words to heart and used the experience to think out new upgrades for Orisa.\nNull Sector.\nSojourn was present in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; while she was &lt;a href=\"Calling\"&gt;interrogated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Noah%20Tremblay\"&gt;Noah Tremblay&lt;/a&gt; about her vigilante actions. She was about to be put to custody when Toronto was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Sojourn ordered nearby CSIS agents to get vision around the area while she suited up, and Tremblay gets on communications. Fighting in the streets, she rescued a group of humans and &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s that had come under attack by Null Sector's forces, when she reunited with members of the reformed Overwatch, including &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside some of the Overwatch operatives, Sojourn fought her way through the streets in order to evacuate Toronto's remaining humans and omnics and remarks that Toronto is \"a hell of a place of a reunion\". During the battle, they came across an omnic named &lt;a href=\"Claire%20Hopper\"&gt;Claire Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, who assisted them by opening doors in the subway's maintenance areas. They also rescued Reggie Buckworth, an omnic lawyer who had managed to hide from Null Sector. At some point afterwards, she rejoined Overwatch herself. \nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nSojourn was part of the game's lore by 2014. Development on Sojourn as a hero began this year, or by 2015 at the latest.\nWhen designing Sojourn, the developers looked back at \"Overwatch\" and considered what archtypes were missing. They concluded that a railgun-type hero was missing. The developers wanted to make a mid-range hero that rewarded accuracy, but still make it fun for varying levels of skill and gameplay.\nVisually, the design for Sojourn took inspiration from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Bassett\"&gt;Angela Bassett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams\"&gt;Serena Williams&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitially, Sojourn's railgun functioned similarly to railguns in other FPS games, with lots of single, high-powered shots. This proved difficult to balance, but the developers liked the gameplay, so the developers changed the gun to having a primary rapid-fire mode, with the single, high-powered shots relegated to its secondary fire.\nAfter the railgun was solidified, the developers began experimenting with Sojourn's other abilities. They wanted her mobility to reflect earlier FPS games with railguns in the past. Sojourn's power slide ability was added early on, and the developers stuck with it. It was added as the developers wanted to add a vertical element to her kit to enable her to quickly access high-ground vantage points and help solidify her role as a mobile damage hero.\nOriginally, Sojourn's disruptor shot did massive damage to barriers, but the ability was finalized to complement her secondary fire. There was debate as to whether it should be thrown, or come out of her wrist, akin to &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;'s wrist-rocket ability.\nSojourn had a few alternate ultimates before Overclock was settled on. One of them was a massive railgun shot that could penetrate numerous obstacles. Overclock was designed to feel like a hitscan version of &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;'s Dragon Blade.\n&lt;a href=\"Miranda%20Moyer\"&gt;Miranda Moyer&lt;/a&gt; has drawn comparisons between Sojourn and Ana. Both are the first new heroes released for their respective games, but both have a wealth of pre-established character relationships to draw from.\nLeaked screenshots from \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" depicted Sojourn with a maple leaf logo on her left shoulder. During the BlizzCon 2019 \"Overwatch: What's Next\" panel, Jeff Kaplan confirmed that Sojourn was \"Overwatch\"'s first Canadian hero.\nSojourn became playable in the \"Overwatch 2\" beta."}

Released on 15 November 2016, she is the 23rd hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nStealth and debilitating attacks make Sombra a powerful infiltrator.

Her hacking can disrupt her enemies, ensuring that they're easier to take out, while her EMP provides the upper hand against multiple foes at once. Sombra\u2019s ability to Translocate and camouflage herself makes her a hard target to pin down. She lacks alternative means of dealing damage, so using Hack can help even the odds between Sombra and her opponents. \nStory.\nOne of the world's most notorious hackers, Sombra uses information to manipulate those in power. Her stealthy abilities and debilitating attacks make her a powerful infiltrator, as well as a hard target to pin down.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, Sombra is one of the world's most dangerous operatives. Her skills include and ; these are activities she greatly enjoys, to the point where the desire to get past locks and solving mysteries is ingrained in her personality. Money is not one of her driving goals.\nShe is a known associate of &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, specializing in espionage and intelligence assessment. She is equipped with devices that allow hacking of technology just through touch. This includes &lt;a href=\"cybernetic\"&gt;cybernetic&lt;/a&gt; grafts implanted along her spine and her brain which basically makes her a living computer. She is a loner emotionally, finding it difficult to make friends (outside coercion). Her personal calling card is a sugar skull.\nBackground.\nLong before she took up the alias \"Sombra,\" Olivia Colomar was among the thousands of children who were left orphaned in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. She owned a stuffed bear during this time named \"&lt;a href=\"Arturito\"&gt;Arturito&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWith much of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;'s infrastructure destroyed, she survived by utilizing her natural gifts with hacking and computers. She likewise proved adept at manipulating individuals to suit her own ends. \nAfter Colomar was taken in by Mexico's &lt;a href=\"Los%20Muertos\"&gt;Los Muertos&lt;/a&gt; gang, she aided it in its self-styled revolution against the government, performing hacks against said government on their behalf. Los Muertos believed that the rebuilding of Mexico had primarily benefited the rich and the influential, leaving behind those who were most in need of assistance. Commissioner &lt;a href=\"Rivera\"&gt;Rivera&lt;/a&gt; was one such example, when she brought him a basket of bread straight to his desk, which gave her the opportunity to access his computer. She came to realize that knowledge was power, and so, she kept hacking\u2014politicians, corporations, governments, famous people; all were in her domain of inquiry. The retrieval of information became an addiction, and her hacks became more audacious over time. Following her many conquests, Colomar was supremely confident in her skills, but she was caught unprepared when she stumbled into the web of a global conspiracy\u2014one that had also noticed her. With her security irreparably compromised, Colomar was forced to delete all traces of her identity and went into hiding.\nColomar received cybernetic grafts on her spinal cord and her brain and re-emerged as \"Sombra,\" a powerful (and devilishly charismatic) technomancer capable of manipulating computers and technology with the whim of her fingertips as if the data were an extension of herself. In her words, \"the girl was gone.\" Determined to find out the truth behind the conspiracy she had uncovered to \"find out who really runs the world,\" Sombra launched an even more audacious string of hacks, initiating a world-wide hacking spree, striking against governments, organizations, and corporations such as &lt;a href=\"Lum%C3%A9riCo\"&gt;Lum\u00e9riCo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Volskaya%20Industries\"&gt;Volskaya Industries&lt;/a&gt;. Her exploits earned her no shortage of admirers, including &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;. \nTalon.\nSombra joined Talon's ranks and is believed to have contributed to its massive cyber-attacks against corporations with strong ties to their governments. Her motivations for joining Talon were unclear, but were apparently self-serving, willing to work alongside Talon as long as it served her own goals.\nWhile in Talon, she met a combat medic named Baptiste, and over time, the two became close friends. While Baptiste ended up leaving Talon, she kept an eye on him, interested to see what her old friend was getting up to. She refused to divulge Baptiste's location to Talon.\nCode of Violence.\nOne year after the disbandment of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, Sombra took part in a mission to retrieve Dr. &lt;a href=\"Siebren%20de%20Kuiper\"&gt;Siebren de Kuiper&lt;/a&gt; from a black site in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. She worked with &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, who was deployed by &lt;a href=\"dropship\"&gt;dropship&lt;/a&gt;. Things were strained between the two from the outset, with Reaper's by-the-book approach conflicting with Sombra's more carefree attitude. At the site, Sombra initiated a hack which sounded an alarm. Guards responded, but were taken out by Reaper. Sombra explained that she'd intentionally set off the alarm to gauge the guards' response time, and have Reaper serve as a distraction while she hacked the base's communications, shutting it off from the outside world. Furthermore, she'd ascertained the location of de Kuiper.\nThe two made their way through the base, killing any guard that got in their way. They found de Kuiper in an isolation cell, but Sombra lingered as she hacked for information, explaining that it was her 'payment' for her services. Reyes was frustrated, given that more guards were coming, and as Sombra continued to push his buttons, the two drew their weapons on each other. The standoff was interrupted by the arrival of another Talon team led by &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, which had dispatched the remaining site guards.\nThe Talon operatives made their way to the dropship, where de Kuiper was loaded onboard. Before boarding it, Sombra gave Reyes a parting farewell, sarcastically telling him that he'd find his place in Talon soon enough, even if it was at Doomfist's feet.\nWhat You Left Behind.\nA few days after the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; recall order, Baptiste contacted Sombra. He requested her aid in contacting Dr. &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, to warn her that Talon might be targeting her.\nDethroning the King Viper.\nStill with Talon Sombra worked with Los Muertos again, and was able to hack the website of Lum\u00e9riCo, posting claims that its CEO, &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Portero\"&gt;Guillermo Portero&lt;/a&gt;, was plundering the riches of Mexico to fill his own purse, that he had corrupted the government, and wouldn't stop until the entire country was under his control. Sombra was able to infiltrate Portero's personal email, and use it without Portero knowing about the intrusion. She sent out an email via Portero's own webmail, promising to unveil his \"dirty laundry\" to the public. Sombra successfully released a number of internal documents to the public, catching the attention of both Mexican law enforcement and &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt;. The documents indicated that Portero used the company's funds as his own piggy bank, that he was personally involved in bribing public officials and creating a system of kickbacks and payoffs beneficial to Lum\u00e9riCo, and finally, that he proposed a plan to seize privately held land via government expropriation to expand Lum\u00e9riCo's facilities throughout Mexico. The emails also showed that Lum\u00e9riCo was in conversations with the &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, in regards to exporting its energy systems; a cause of concern given the company's actions in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;.\nLaw enforcement categorized the break-ins as a criminal action, and Atlas News reported on the \"Sombra collective,\" mistaking Colomar's identity as a group, not an individual. Sombra claimed that she was \"only acting the public interest.\" Her efforts incited a popular revolution in Mexico against Lum\u00e9riCo, and pro-Sombra grafitti was reported across the world. Less than a week after the leak, Portero stepped down as CEO. By this point, Sombra was already hacking the network of her next target\u2014&lt;a href=\"Volskaya%20Industries\"&gt;Volskaya Industries&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttack on Volskaya.\nSombra, with &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, infiltrated Volskaya Industries to assassinate its CEO, &lt;a href=\"Katya%20Volskaya\"&gt;Katya Volskaya&lt;/a&gt;. Sombra deactivated the security alerts and turrets within the facility to allow Reaper and Widowmaker access. The mission appeared to go without a hitch, until Widowmaker was unable to get a clear line of sight before the operation was interrupted by an alarm\u2014one that Sombra had set off herself. Widowmaker held the perimeter while Reaper cleared the ground floor; he was unable to get to Katya in the elevator and was forced to confront a &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt; as she fled to safety. Sombra gave chase, killing and incapacitating Volskaya guards, until she made it into Katya's locked-down office. While ostensibly there to kill the CEO, Sombra played a different game, revealing her intentions to be Katya's \"friend.\" A friend with benefits, for if Katya helped her out from time to time, she wouldn't leak evidence that Katya had been receiving technology from omnics in order to help her country in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Second Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Sombra also noted how exposure would affect \"the future of Russia\" while handing Katya the photo of her daughter from her desk, hinting at how the fallout of a scandal would impact her. Sombra's motives for gaining Katya as an informant was to help her uncover the greater global conspiracy she had discovered. As her security was nearly through with getting the door open, Katya agreed to the terms, and Sombra teleported out of the office, reporting to her comrades that the operation had failed. The Talon operatives returned to the ship, with only Sombra in good cheer.\nReflections.\nSombra spent Christmas drinking at the bar in &lt;a href=\"Calaveras\"&gt;Calaveras&lt;/a&gt;.\nSearching.\nKatya, not keen on being Sombra's 'friend', dispatched Russian soldier &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Aleksandra \"Zarya\" Zaryanova&lt;/a&gt; to track her down. Alongside the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lynx%20Seventeen\"&gt;Lynx Seventeen&lt;/a&gt;, Zarya caught up with Sombra in Dorado. The two exchanged words and bullets, but Zarya was able to incapacitate Sombra through a &lt;a href=\"graviton%20surge\"&gt;graviton surge&lt;/a&gt;. Sombra warned Zarya that if anything happened to her, Katya's secrets would be revealed to the world, including her dealings with omnics. Zarya in turn revealed that she knew Sombra's real name, which briefly fazed the hacker. However, Sombra maintained that she wanted Katya to remain in power, as she wanted her as a source for information. However, the conversation reached its end as Lynx collapsed (as Sombra had hacked them in &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; when they'd tried to trace her), and revealed that the warehouse they were in would be destroyed in an explosion in one minute. Zarya rescued Lynx and let Sombra live.\nMasquerade.\nAfter Reaper freed Doomfist from his &lt;a href=\"HSI\"&gt;HSI&lt;/a&gt; cell, Sombra took part in a mission at &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Monaco\"&gt;Casino Monaco&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Doomfist and Widowmaker, the latter two entering the casino together, while Sombra was already inside. The trio communicated via radio. Sombra mockingly asked Doomfist to ask Widowmaker about what had happened at St. Petersburg (her failure to assassinate Volskaya), but Doomfist wasn't interested, and told Sombra to inform him if she saw anything out of the ordinary.\nSuch an eventuality occurred, and Sombra informed Doomfist that a group had entered the casino, headed his way. The tip paid off, and the would-be attackers were incapacitated.\nLater, Sombra took part in Doomfist's coup against &lt;a href=\"Vialli\"&gt;Vialli&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;. She killed Vialli's security team, allowing Reaper to enter the facility and kill Vialli's followers.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nUsing the wi-fi signature 344X-Az\u00facar, Sombra participated in &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on the Numbani airport by hacking the airport's security cameras. Later, &lt;a href=\"Efi%20Oladele\"&gt;Efi Oladele&lt;/a&gt; witnessed her hacking the omnics working at an &lt;a href=\"Axiom\"&gt;Axiom&lt;/a&gt; warehouse. Efi was able to stop the attack using an antidote program.\nOverwatch's Return.\nWhen Overwatch returned to operations, they appropriated as their base of operations. Sombra noted that the base had come back online, and set about retrieving intel.\nA Great Day.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s failed attack on &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; that had led the attack crashed into the sea. Sombra, &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt; were sent to infiltrate the carrier and retrieve its &lt;a href=\"power%20relay\"&gt;power relay&lt;/a&gt; data. She and Reaper entered the carrier, and found an army of &lt;a href=\"Nulltrooper\"&gt;Nulltrooper&lt;/a&gt;s, albeit deactivated. Mauga entered after them, and in so doing, activated the warbots. The trio fought their way through the ship to a point where Sombra could hack the power relay data. However, Mauga ran off, and Reaper was left to cover Sombra as she performed her hack.\nMauga's run-and-gun antics caused the carrier to begin sinking, and a security system to kick in to stymie Sombra's hack. Reaper told her they had to go, but Sombra refused to do so without getting the power relay data. Sombra succeeded, but discovered that she couldn't translocate out of the carrier; the &lt;a href=\"translocator\"&gt;translocator&lt;/a&gt; she'd left on the deck was malfunctioning. She managed to get out regardless and escape on the dropship with her fellow operatives.\nHaving exfiltrated the site, Sombra and Reaper were contacted by Doomfist, who was irate that an intended clandestine operation had resulted in the destruction of the carrier in broad daylight. Just as irate, Sombra explained what had happened, pinning the blame on Mauga. Doomfist agreed with her assessment, and ordered Sombra to \"deal with\" Mauga, or be 'dealt with' herself. Reaper offered to play executioner, but Sombra refused, and went into the dropship's transport bay to perform the execution herself. Upon seeing her, Mauga correctly guessed that she was here to execute him on Doomfist's orders, but as Sombra pointed out, she and Reaper had performed their duties. Mauga was the one who had come up short.\nExcept...he hadn't. Mauga revealed that he'd retrieved the power relay itself, and that his supposed carelessness had been intentional. He'd prevented the carrier from sending out a distress signal, and that he'd sunk the carrier to remove any witnesses. As much as Doomfist might be angry with him now, if Sombra handed over the device, he'd be \"all smiles.\" With that, he parachuted out of the dropship, telling Sombra she knew where to find him if he was needed for another op.\nKill Team.\nAt some point after the command ship retrieval operation, Sombra, Widowmaker, and a Talon team tracked down &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-Universe References.\n\"\u00bfQui\u00e9n es 'Sombra'?\"\nSombra's existence has been hinted at since early pre-beta builds of the game.\nAlternate Reality Game.\nFollowing the announcement of &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt; as the 22nd \"Overwatch\" &lt;a href=\"hero\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;, a series of cryptographic puzzles about Sombra were slowly released, dubbed the Sombra ARG by the community.\nTrivia.\nMisc. Character Information.\nDisputed Information.\n\"Note: The following information is from gameplay trailers and is of dubious canon status.\"\nDevelopment.\nSombra originated during the game's early development as a proposed character called the Omniblade, an agile female ninja who would wield shuriken and kunai, predating &lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;. As ideation progressed a Mesoamerican theme was incorporated into her design and she was given the name Sombra, however the concept was shelved when they began incorporating elements of her suggested kit, including a &lt;a href=\"Genji%23Cyber-Agility\"&gt;double jump&lt;/a&gt; and throwing knives that could &lt;a href=\"Hanzo%23Sonic%20Arrow\"&gt;reveal enemies through walls&lt;/a&gt;, into the two new &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;ninja heroes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt a later point they conceived of a stealth hacker hero and decided to use the earlier Sombra concept as its foundation. Having previously attempted to build Genji as a slow-moving stealth assassin character and finding it to be unfun, they decided to instead make Sombra an agile infiltration hero focused on gathering intel and disrupting the enemy team, devising her thermoptic camo suit, hacking tendrils, and machine pistol, lending the character a cyberpunk aesthetic. Elements of her new kit seem to have been pulled from the playable Spec Ops class from the initial pitch for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%23Development\"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;\", which had stealth and EMP abilities, as well as &lt;a href=\"Hivemind\"&gt;Hivemind&lt;/a&gt;, a proposed hero created for the \"Prometheus\" pitch meeting with abilities called Disable and EMP pulse. At this point in development Sombra had a hood and a longer coat, however her silhouette began to overlap with the also in-development &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;, so they decided to steer her in a different direction, eventually arriving at her final design.\nInitially, Sombra was invisible 100% of the time. This concept generated two problems however. It reduced the sense of Sombra helping her own team (per friendly players not seeing her), and inflicted stress on the enemy team, not knowing if they were safe. Additionally, what she could and couldn't hack went through numerous revisions. She started off as a &lt;a href=\"Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; hero, and initially, there was no cooldown for her hacking abilities.\nReveal.\nPrior to the reveal of Ana as the 22nd playable hero in \"Overwatch\", a photograph of Ana wearing her Shrike mask found on &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Temple of Anubis&lt;/a&gt; was incorrectly identified as Sombra, leading to a widespread assumption that the two characters were one and the same, and that Sombra was the rumored in-development support sniper character.\nVoice lines extracted from the Public Test Region after Ana's release featured the first suggestions that Sombra would have a stealth ability. On October 8, 2016, a photo of a posting on Blizzard's was leaked online, containing the details for an internal test build featuring the &lt;a href=\"Junkenstein%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;Junkenstein's Revenge&lt;/a&gt; event and Sombra, including a screenshot and her bio.\nOn November 1, 2016, the image urls for unreleased Blizzcon 2016 fine art prints of Sombra and a \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//diablo.gamepedia.com/\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" necromancer, hosted on Blizzard's gear store, were leaked, seemingly corroborating the earlier October 8 leak. She was officially announced at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt; as the 23rd hero.\nExternal links.\n "}

Nearing its completion, the increment changed to only 0.0031% every 3 minutes.\nUpon reaching 5.4410%, v1.9 changed to v1.95.\nDuring the countdown, some newspapers in the game were updated, talking about a global hacking spree.\nThe countdown was completed on October 18 at 7:03pm UTC.\nFirst Message.\nLooking at the source code for amomentincrime revealed a message:\nTranslated from Spanish:\nSecond Message.\nUpon reaching 5.4410%, a second message was added to the source code:\nTranslated from Spanish:\nThird Message.\nWhen the countdown finished, the page changed to read:\n ...Estableciendo conexi\u00f3n...\n ...Protocolo Sombra v1.95 iniciado...\n ...Transmisi\u00f3n finalizada - finalizando carga...\n ...Carga finalizada.

The patch version at that time was v1.4.0.2.32374.\nLum\u00e9riCo's Emails.\nDiscovery.\nShortly after the percentage on amomentincrime.com got to 100%, going to a certain monitor on Dorado as &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; would result in Bastion beeping in an unusual way.\nThese beeps, which were in Morse code, translated to SQOFJFBNITIZWGDXSDO. Using codice_1 (taking the letters from the decoded ) as the password for a Vigen\u00e8re cipher, the resulting message is ACCESSWWWLUMERICOMX. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//lumerico.mx/\"&gt;lumerico.mx&lt;/a&gt; is in-game company &lt;a href=\"Lum%C3%A9riCo\"&gt;Lum\u00e9riCo&lt;/a&gt;'s official site.\nThere is a phone number at the bottom of the page. When called, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//soundcloud.com/jackwilsdon/510-766-2726a\"&gt;a woman's voice lists a series of numbers in Spanish&lt;/a&gt;: 5-2-4-1-3 \"(pause)\" 23-4-14-8-6-18-17-23-21-18-15 in Spanish. Using a simple A=1 conversion, the second series of numbers turns into codice_2. Using a with the key 23, you finally get TAKECONTROL. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//lumerico.mx/TAKECONTROL\"&gt;lumerico.mx/TAKECONTROL&lt;/a&gt; leads to an encoded message from Sombra. Using the first part of the phone call, codice_3, in a column order transposition cipher, gives the following message (spaces added for clarity):\nLos felicito por haber llegado hasta aqu\u00ed. Solo quer\u00eda saber si estaban listos. (Hey, es muy dif\u00edcil encontrar buena ayuda \u00faltimamente...deber\u00edan ver algunos de los payasitos que est\u00e1n trabajando conmigo) Por ahora, continuemos con el verdadero reto: acabar con Lum\u00e9riCo y su president e &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Portero\"&gt;Guillermo Portero&lt;/a&gt;. \u00bfY porqu\u00e9? Porque es un hombre codicioso, corrupto y un ladr\u00f3n abominable. Su plan de traer en l\u00ednea el m\u00e1s grande y el m\u00e1s poderoso zigurat el 1 de noviembre no es nada m\u00e1s que una artima\u00f1a, un elaborado plan designado para ejercer a\u00fan m\u00e1s influencia sobre la gente de M\u00e9xico y en gordar los bolsillos de sus compinches. \u00bfY qui\u00e9n va a pagar por eso? La gente com\u00fan y corriente, los mismos que siempre quedan olvidados. He empezado a mejorar mis protocolos para que sean usados para derrumbar la infraestructura de Lum\u00e9riCo y Los Muertos tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n intentando levantarse en contra de la corrupci\u00f3n.

Pude encontrar el nombre de usuario y contrase\u00f1a de un empleado de soporte de Lum\u00e9riCo, empiecen por ah\u00ed: GFlores/g#fNwP5qJ\nEnglish:\nI congratulate you for having come this far. I just wanted to know if you were ready or not. (Hey, it's really hard to find good help lately... you should see some of the clowns I'm working with). For now, let's continue with the real challenge: taking down Lum\u00e9riCo and its president Guillermo Portero. Why? Because he's a greedy, corrupt man and an abominable thief. His plan to bring online the largest and most powerful ziggurat on November 1st is nothing more than a ruse, an elaborate plan designed to exert even more influence on the people of Mexico and thicken the pockets of his cronies. And who will pay for that? Common people, the same ones that are always forgotten. I've started upgrading my protocols so that they can be used to take down the Lum\u00e9riCo infrastructure and Los Muertos are also trying to stand up against the corruption. Meanwhile, search the Lum\u00e9riCo site for information we can use against the bastard, or better yet, find his username and password so that some not so favorable details about the president...appear... I was able to get the username and password of a Lum\u00e9riCo employee (support?), start here: GFlores/g#fNwP5qJ\nGonzalo Flores's Emails.\nThis username and password allows one to log in on Lum\u00e9riCo's site and access Gonzalo Flores' emails. Most of them are general work emails without further hints, but one email talks about lumerico.mx/president-bypass. In the source code of that page is a git dump with codebehind files. From these, and after another cipher, is another username and password: GPortero/Xy@4+Bkuqd&lt;53uJ\nThe President's Emails.\nGuillermo Portero's emails are also mostly work-related, but there is one from Sombra:\nVeo que se han podido infiltrar en su correo. No se preocupen, \u00e9l no puede ver este correo, lo he ocultado de su vista si se conecta desde una de sus direcciones conocidas de IP.

Don't worry, he can't see this email, I've hidden it from view if you connect from one of the known IP addresses. I need a little more time to set the next group of protocols.

To see her quotes in the original \"Overwatch\", view &lt;a href=\"Sombra/Quotes/Overwatch%201\"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.\nSombra's voice has a smooth texture and a medium pitched range. Sombra's articulation is generally precise and clear, even during fast-paced delivery. However, she occasionally employs a relaxed articulation, particularly with plosive sounds and word endings. Her intonation is dynamic and varied, reflecting her mischievous and playful personality. She uses rising intonation to convey excitement, curiosity, or sarcasm, and falling intonation to express confidence, finality, or boredom. Sombra speaks with a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Spanish\"&gt;Mexican Spanish accent&lt;/a&gt;, specifically from the central region of Mexico. This is evident in her pronunciation of certain vowels and consonants, and the rhythmic flow of her speech.\nSombra's vocabulary is a mix of technical jargon related to technology and hacking, as well as more casual slang terms. She often uses playful nicknames and teasing remarks, while her tones range from playful and sarcastic to confident and assertive.\nDatamined.\n\"Quotes marked \"datamined\" might not exist in-game, and may be outdated.

Heroes cannot enter the opposing team's spawn room. As the match progresses, the spawn rooms may change locations in certain game modes:\nStranded spawns.\nWhen an objective is captured and a team's spawn room moves, the previous spawn room remains partially active for 7 seconds. The players in these stranded spawns cannot swap their hero, but the healing field will remain active and the spawn doors will remain locked for enemies. Additionally, the player may choose to instantly teleport to the team's new active spawn room by using the Interact key (default: ). \nSpawn Protection.\nSpawn Protection is a feature that prevents players from entering spawn rooms of the opposing team. A player that somehow manages to enter the spawn room not intended for them is damaged at a rate of 400 HP. This damage counts as self-damage, which means that players cannot gain ultimate charge from healing it. They can, however, be prevented from being killed by using abilities that grant immortality, such as or . \nIn &lt;a href=\"Flashpoint\"&gt;Flashpoint&lt;/a&gt;, if a player enters an enemy forward spawn before it's activated, and it activates, they are instead teleported to a safe place."}

{"id": "28891", "revid": "56057905", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28891", "title": "Status effect", "text": "Status effects are conditions that affect the target for a short period of time. These effects are inflicted usually by &lt;a href=\"abilities\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be applied by &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s. Weapon and ability effects may also be a combination of multiple status effects.\nPositive effects.\nPositive status effects are usually applied by allies or the hero themself.\nInvincible.\nInvincible is a status effect that makes the target immune to damage. The attacks will still hit the target, but their damage is negated. Becoming invincible also removes and prevents slows and prevents (but doesn't remove) stuns and knockdowns. Invincible by default has no effect on other negative status effects.\nPhased out.\nPhased out causes the hero to became impervious to damage and most negative effects. A hero that is phased out passes through other players and cannot be hit by enemy attacks. This is different from invincible in that instead of only \"blocking\" the damage, phased heroes cannot be hit in the first place, causing any projectiles to pass through them. The status will also remove most negative status effects and attached objects from the hero.\nEffects and abilities known to be prevented and removed by phased out:\nEffects and abilities known to prevented but not removed by phased out:\nEffects and abilities known to be completely unaffected by Phased Out. Damage portions may still be prevented, but the effect will not end:\nInvisible.\nInvisible prevents the hero from being seen by enemies.\nNegative effects.\nNegative status effects are harmful effects, usually applied by enemies or in some cases by the hero themself. Negative status effects that limit the hero's ability to move, shoot or use their abilities, are colloquially referred to as \"crowd control\" by players. Abilities that apply negative status effects can be credited for &lt;a href=\"environmental%20kill\"&gt;environmental kill&lt;/a&gt;s, if they cause a player to fall of the map.\nSlowed.\nSlowed is a negative status effect that reduces the target's &lt;a href=\"movement%20speed\"&gt;movement speed&lt;/a&gt;. The strengths of slowing effects caused by enemies stack additionally with each other and movement speed buffs. Self-inflicted &lt;a href=\"Movement%20speed%23List%20of%20movement%20speed%20penalties\"&gt;movement speed penalties&lt;/a&gt;, however do not stack with other slowing effects. Instead, the greatest slowing effect of the two will take effect. Some &lt;a href=\"movement%20abilities\"&gt;movement abilities&lt;/a&gt; are unaffected by slows.\nStunned.\nStunned is a negative status effect that completely prevents the player from controlling their hero. Stunned heroes are unable to move, shoot, aim or use their abilities. Additionally, getting stunned will interrupt &lt;a href=\"movement%20abilities\"&gt;movement abilities&lt;/a&gt; and abilities that have a short cast animation or are &lt;a href=\"channeled\"&gt;channeled&lt;/a&gt;, usually negating the ability and putting it on full cooldown.\nFrozen.\nFrozen is a unique stun-like effect caused by &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;'s . It causes the exact same effect as stunned, except it can be removed by effects that make the target invincible, such as .\nPinned.\nPinned is a unique stun-like effect caused by &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;'s . It causes the hit target to be stunned while stuck to Reinhardt as he is charging. Pinned effect once applied can be only removed by &lt;a href=\"Lifeweaver\"&gt;Lifeweaver&lt;/a&gt;'s and Sombra's .\nHooked.\nHooked is a unique stun-like effect caused by &lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt;'s . It causes the hit target to face Roadhog and be stunned while pulled to him. Hooked effect once applied can be only removed by &lt;a href=\"Lifeweaver\"&gt;Lifeweaver&lt;/a&gt;'s and Sombra's .\nKnocked down.\nKnocked down has the same effect to the target hero as stunned, but it also causes the hero to fall and lie on ground face up. In the last 0.5 seconds of the duration, the target will enter a wake up animation where they start to stand up.\nAsleep.\nAsleep has a similar effect to knocked down, except the target will instantly start the wake up animation when they take damage. The only ability that currently causes asleep is &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;'s .\nMobility lock.\nMobility lock is a status that disables the hero's &lt;a href=\"movement%20abilities\"&gt;movement abilities&lt;/a&gt;. It prevents the affected player from activating movement abilities and immediately ends any active movement abilities. The affected hero can still aim, shoot, jump, crouch and use any non-movement abilities as normal and be moved by &lt;a href=\"objects\"&gt;objects&lt;/a&gt;, such as or . &lt;a href=\"Movement%20speed\"&gt;Movement speed&lt;/a&gt; buffs generally \"do not\" count as movement abilities, unless it the only effect provided by the ability. Mobility lock does not immediately end movement abilities that grant free flight, but will still prevent the flight for the duration.\nMovement lock can only be removed by Lifeweaver's and Orisa's . Mauga's also prevents the effect, but as it is also a movement ability, it cannot be used to remove it. Some movement locking abilities may be prevented by being phased out while about to be hit by it.\nRooted.\nRooted effect applies mobility lock to the hero and also makes the target hero completely unable to move, including jumping, crouching or being affected by knockbacks. The target can still aim, shoot and use non-movement abilities while rooted.\nKnockback.\nKnockback is an effect that causes an impulse that forcibly moves a hero. Knockback can be applied by various abilities and most explosive weapons to both the user and enemies. Additionally, the standard &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Melee\"&gt;Quick Melee&lt;/a&gt;, available to most heroes, causes a very small knockback.\nKnockup.\nKnockup is an effect similar to knockback, but it sends the target directly upwards and causes them to be unable to control their movement in the air.\nGravity.\nGravity effects continuously pull heroes towards a direction or a point.\nHacked.\nHacked makes the hero unable to use their abilities. This includes all normal and &lt;a href=\"ultimate%20abilities\"&gt;ultimate abilities&lt;/a&gt; and certain &lt;a href=\"passive%20abilities\"&gt;passive abilities&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly to getting stunned, hacked will also interrupt &lt;a href=\"movement%20abilities\"&gt;movement abilities&lt;/a&gt; and abilities that have a short cast animation or are &lt;a href=\"channeled\"&gt;channeled&lt;/a&gt;, usually negating the ability and putting it on full cooldown. Hacked heroes can still use their weapon (both primary and secondary fire) and move normally. \nThe only abilities that currently cause hacked are &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;'s and .\nDiscord.\nDiscord cause the player to have the \"Orb of Discord from Zenyatta\" alert.\nDamage over time.\nDamage over time effect causes the hero to periodically take a small amounts of damage without further interaction from the hero that applied the effect and regardless of the position of the target hero. As such, &lt;a href=\"beam\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; effects and abilities that create an area that deals periodic damage, such as , do not count as damage over time effects. Becoming phased out, cleansed by &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt;'s , receiving &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt;'s or , or collecting a &lt;a href=\"health%20pack\"&gt;health pack&lt;/a&gt; will remove any damage over time effects from the hero. Damage from damage over time effects ignores &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurning.\nBurning is a status effect that comes with some damage over time effects. Targets that are burning have a specific interaction with &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt;'s , allowing it to always deal &lt;a href=\"critical%20damage\"&gt;critical damage&lt;/a&gt; to the burning target.\nAnti-heal.\nAnti-heal prevents the target hero from receiving any healing. Healing projectiles will still collide with heroes affected by anti-heal, but any healing provided by them will be negated. Heroes affected by anti-heal also cannot pick up &lt;a href=\"health%20pack\"&gt;health pack&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCaptive Sun mark.\nCaptive Sun mark is an effect specific to &lt;a href=\"Illari\"&gt;Illari&lt;/a&gt;'s . Each player having this effect is slowed for the duration of it and will explode after a few shots, becoming Sunstruck and taking high damage and also damaging all nearby allies. This effect is chained and will cause Sunstruck across multiple targets if more than one of them are in close range and affected with it and just one of them takes damage."}

However, Howl, who became \"king,\" banished Stone and his family into the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland\"&gt;Wasteland&lt;/a&gt;, despite Stone's protests. Stone later perished in the Wasteland, and was buried, seemingly alongside some of his children."}

Players are able to choose from select &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;; each mission contains a different group that pertains to the story.\nStory Missions encompass a linear narrative about &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; reuniting to battle &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the overall storyline forward. Each mission begins with a \"previously on...\" introduction that recaps events prior to the mission.\nCurrently, there are three playable Story Missions that can be unlocked by purchasing the Bundle from the &lt;a href=\"Shop\"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt; for $15 USD. The \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" development team plans to release more missions in the future, but no timeframe for their release has been announced.\nGameplay.\nSome missions are set on inaccessible areas of playable maps, such as &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;; others are played on unreleased maps, such as &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;. Each standard-play Story Mission map is about four to five times bigger than its PvP counterpart. Generally, Story Mission objectives are similar to standard play, such as defending an area from waves of enemies and escorting a payload.\nThe &lt;a href=\"hero\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;es a player can choose from are dictated by story constraints. Throughout the mission, heroes engage in banter and conversations with each other and some NPCs.\nStory Missions can be played on one of four difficulty settings: Normal, Hard, Expert, or Legendary. Similar to &lt;a href=\"Event%20Missions\"&gt;Event Missions&lt;/a&gt;, each difficulty level increases the number of enemies, the amount of damage they do, and the amount of health they have. Enemies in Story Missions have \"elite\" versions, which deal increased damage and require more damage to be taken down. Completing a mission gives the player &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; experience.\nInterface.\nStory Missions are accessible through the Play menu. The Story Missions interface is set up on &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;'s computer on . Each screen opens another menu:\nThe interface also includes various items on Winston's desk, all of which are interactive and will elicit a voice line from Winston or &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; when clicked. These include a photo of the original &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch group&lt;/a&gt;, a holographic emitter, a mini double-decker bus, and an Overwatch mug. These items and other details of the interface will change as each mission is completed.\nMission List.\nCurrently, there are three Story Missions available:\nDevelopment.\nThe intention of including a PvE mode in \"Overwatch\" stems back to \"&lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;\". Despite the game's cancellation, &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; wanted to have a similar scope for \"Overwatch\". A \"crawl, walk, run\" development plan was formed: \"Overwatch\" as the \"crawl,\" a dedicated PvE as the \"walk,\" and an MMO as the \"run.\" The mode originally included a &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt; system, but it was cut during development. With the cancellation of &lt;a href=\"Hero%20Missions\"&gt;Hero Missions&lt;/a&gt;, Story Missions would be given more focus.\nBlizzard developed new streaming tech and developer tools to make such large, detailed maps.\nWhile cinematics were created for Story Missions, they were designed to be used sparingly, as the developers didn't want to take too much control from players.\nAs of April 2024, there is evidence that further Story Missions have been cancelled, or at least, deprioritized. In January 2024, Microsoft layoffs affected the Story Missions' development team, and by March of the same year, the Story Missions tab in the game's menu had been reduced in prominence. Speaking under conditions of anonymity, (ex)-Blizzard employees stated that the original plan was to drop three missions every eighteen months. Work on the campaign missions was apparently held up in pursuit of a nebulous thing called \u201cBlizzard Quality,\u201d a term used to describe a standard the company aspires to. According to one source, this became a crutch that was frequently used to avoid making calls that would move the development of story missions forward. Furthermore, the PvP-centric nature of \"Overwatch\" was difficult to adapt into PvE gameplay. Sources further stated that while \"Overwatch 2\" had been presented with PvE as its selling point, within Blizzard itself, PvP remained the priority, and as such, the development of PvE modes suffered for it.\nAccording to one source, while there was still support for Story Missions within Blizzard, it was estimated that to deliver Story Missions, &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; would have to double in size\u2014400 people focusing on PvP, while another 400 would focus on PvE.\nAfter the first trio of Story Missions released, reception within Activision-Blizzard was frosty, as the missions \"did not do well at all,\" either financially or critically. While Blizzard has since come under the ownership of Microsoft, reportedly, from a business perspective, Microsoft does not have any faith in PvE.\nIn August 2024, it was confirmed that Story Missions have been cancelled. However, &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; wants to continue the story of \"Overwatch\" in some form."}

The coral cleaned the oceans of complex chemicals and microplastics, incorporating these materials into massive reef formations. The coral polyps grew at astonishing rates by converting carbon and waste to food. Fish populations rebounded and multiplied, creating cheap, abundant food. The reefs began growing above the water, creating structures and spires unlike anything seen on Earth.\nThese reefs attracted a thriving scientific community.

One piece of anti-AI legislation after another was struck down by the Swedish government.\nOmnic Crisis.\nSweden was a battlefield during the Omnic Crisis. &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; was one such battlefield, where &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s under &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;'s control turned against their human owners. A few weeks into the war, &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt; was summoned by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Chemical%2C%20Biological%2C%20Radiation%2C%20and%20Nuclear%20Defense%20Center\"&gt;National Chemical, Biological, Radiation, and Nuclear Defense Center&lt;/a&gt; to complete and deploy their &lt;a href=\"Luftf%C3%B6rsvarsn%C3%A4tverk\"&gt;Luftf\u00f6rsvarsn\u00e4tverk&lt;/a&gt;. The system was deployed around Sweden's major population centers to dissuade enemy air attacks, and due to the resources provided by the Swedish government, the network was deployed at breakneck speed.\nAs the war continued, refugees from adjacent countries fled into Sweden, millions entering Gothenburg alone. As elsewhere, crisis bred innovation\u2014&lt;a href=\"Mysboden\"&gt;Mysboden&lt;/a&gt; designed and mass-produced prefabricated shelters across the country, while &lt;a href=\"Freja%20Nilsson\"&gt;Freja Nilsson&lt;/a&gt; designed the &lt;a href=\"Tillsluten\"&gt;Tillsluten&lt;/a&gt; tubes to protect refugees travelling from one country to another. &lt;a href=\"Axel%20Lund\"&gt;Axel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ludvig%20Lund\"&gt;Ludvig Lund&lt;/a&gt; turned their attention to solving Sweden's supply line issues.\nWhile Gothenburg had been affected by Anubis's initial attack, Sweden as a country was relatively distant from the frontlines of the war. As the months passed without any major attacks on Gothenburg, a sense of calm descended upon the city. However, brighter minds could see that beyond Sweden's borders, humanity was losing the war. Fearing that Gothenburg would fall victim to a serious attack, scientists and engineers from different organizations came together to discuss contingencies. They would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Hj%C3%A4ltefemman\"&gt;Hj\u00e4ltefemman&lt;/a&gt;. To protect Gothenburg, they worked with Mysboden to create the &lt;a href=\"St%C3%A5lt%C3%A4cke\"&gt;St\u00e5lt\u00e4cke&lt;/a&gt;, which the Swedish government provided funding for at the last moment. Near the end of the Crisis, Anubis launched the assault Sweden had dreaded. A massive air raid overwhelmed Sweden's defenses and attacked Gothenburg, reducing 95% of the city to ashes in what would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Bombardment%20of%20Gothenburg\"&gt;Bombardment of Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;. However, thanks to the St\u00e5lt\u00e4cke, only 12,000 casualities were sustained out of a city of 4 million. Given the low casualty rate, the Bombardment later became known as the \"Midsommarmiraklet\" (Midsummer Miracle).\nPost-Crisis.\nAfter the Crisis, the Hj\u00e4ltefemman were memoralized in Swedish culture, lauded in street names, holidays, murals, and movies.\nSometime after the disbandment of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; unit resurfaced in Sweden, sending the country into a panic. The Swedish military dragged its feet, believing it to be a hoax. The unit was ultimately retrieved by Lindholm, who took it under his wing."}

She is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nSymmetra utilizes her light-bending Photon Projector to dispatch adversaries, shield her associates, construct teleportation pads and deploy particle-blasting Sentry Turrets.\nStrategy.\nSymmetra's abilities provide both defensive and positional advantages to her team. She can cover chokepoints with her Sentry Turrents, deploy a Teleporter to provide teammates higher ground or ambush the enemy team, and split the map in half with her Ultimate. Her low health and mobility means that she must coordinate with her team in order to survive.\nWeapons &amp; Abilities.\n (weapon): Symmetra's main weapon. The projector has two modes of fire: a short range beam, and a chargeable, explosive energy ball.\n (Ultimate): Symmetra sets up a barrier that cuts the map in half.\nStory.\n\"The true enemy of humanity is disorder.\"\nSymmetra literally bends reality, and she is the &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt;'s premier &lt;a href=\"hard-light\"&gt;hard-light&lt;/a&gt; architech. By manipulating hard-light constructs, she crafts the world as she wishes it to be, in hopes of engineering a perfect society. Symmetra believes her actions serve the greater good in society, though there are times when she wonders whether the control and order she desires are truly best for humanity. She is a natural dancer, able and willing to spend hours perfecting her routine. When light-bending, Symmetra uses &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathak\"&gt;Kathak&lt;/a&gt; dance movements.\nSymmetra is on the ; she has demonstrated traits associated with the condition such as having trouble with social interactions, suffering from sensory overload and preferring environments that are structured and harmonious. Her dislike for trains is a case in point, given the presence of other people. She finds it hard to make eye contact, engage in public speaking, and also finds it hard to sit still and has set routines, which ensure there is always order and calm in some part of her life. Even in hotels, she has time alone and cleaves to her routines as much as possible. Lights give her trouble, both in their glare, and in a high-pitched whine that only she can hear.\nAs a child, she struggled with understanding metaphors, though as an adult, she is more adept at understanding such figures of speech. However, she still has trouble recognizing emotions. She regularly creates hard-light snowflakes, as their repetitive patterns bring peace to her mind. Trust doesn't come easily for her.\nSymmetra always sees her missions through. She does not hesitate to carry out missions of dubious morality for her company (such as digging up blackmail material to sabotage competitors), she dislikes killing and only resorts to lethal force if she has to. Despite the necessities of her job, fighting is not in her nature, though she remains competent all the same.\nBackground.\nSatya Vaswani grew up in desperate poverty in the slums of &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad\"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. By her recollection, it was not a pleasant environment to grow up in; hunger was a constant issue, the village was overcrowded, the drinking water was murky, and she spent her youth powerless and afraid. As a child, she danced, finding it would calm her anxiety. She was able to make a few visits to temples, but over time, she forgot about them. She would later reflect that she was not old enough to understand faith and religion at the time.\nArchitech Academy.\nEarly Years.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt; of southern India began the laborious process of creating new, self-sustaining cities to house the nation's displaced population. One such city, &lt;a href=\"Utopaea\"&gt;Utopaea&lt;/a&gt;, was created using radical hard-light technology that enabled its architechs to shape the city's streets, utilities, and living spaces in the blink of an eye.\nAfter she was identified as one of the few capable of becoming a light-bending architech, Satya was plucked from extreme poverty and placed in the care of Vishkar's &lt;a href=\"Architech%20Academy\"&gt;Architech Academy&lt;/a&gt;, never to return home. Isolated and lonely in her new life, Satya immersed herself in her education and training. She quickly grasped the applications of the technology and was one of the top students in her class. Satya approached hard-light manipulation differently than her peers, with their more procedural, mechanical constructions, instead weaving her constructs in the motions of the traditional dance of her homeland. However, she struggled on the social side of things. For instance, meals were different every day, which made her face the dining hall with dread, as she never knew what to expect. She hated the high-pitched whine from the lights that no-one else was able to hear, the ever-changing and unpredictable curriculum, the way the paintings were hung in hallways, the way the teachers demanded she make eye contact when answering questions.\nWhile at the Academy, Satya had &lt;a href=\"Niran%20Pruksamanee\"&gt;Niran Pruksamanee&lt;/a&gt; as a roomate. They were an odd pair, as Satya had grown up in poverty, while Niran was the child of a wealthy Chang Mai family. However, while the two rarely agreed on anything, they became inseparable friends within a few weeks, and grew to respect each other greatly. She always called him by his nickname, \"Bua.\" That they were both outsiders in their own way, it allowed them to bond, and their opposing personalities complemented each other.\nThey shared a dorm with two other students, and to Satya's chagrin, Niran would often stay up past midnight while she and the other students tried to sleep. Also, his snoring didn't help matters, and much to her chagrin, he often left dishes in the sink. She overheard people describe Niran as being distracted and prone to daydreaming, but she knew the truth; that whatever occupied Niran's mind in the moment, he had the tendency to give it his full attention. Niran was able to help her get out of public speaking, claiming illness, and helped keep people at a distance.\nThe two were regularly paired off in lessons. In one field trip, they and various other students were taken to the &lt;a href=\"Ulsoor\"&gt;Ulsoor&lt;/a&gt; lake bed in Bangalore to practice hard-light manipulation outside the Academy. As usual, Niran's elegant and artistic flourishes complented Satya's precise and practical structures, so much so that she laughed out loud in front of people (a rarity). Niran could see from the look on her face that the loss of control had been worth it for her. In another incident, Niran found himself unable to get back into his dorm room as Satya had blocked the door by accident after creating an advanced hard-light construct. She'd used the doorframe itself to support it. The construct collapsed, and &lt;a href=\"Suraj\"&gt;Suraj&lt;/a&gt; had to rescue them.\nHowever, Niran's fortunes took a turn for the worse when he created &lt;a href=\"biolight\"&gt;biolight&lt;/a&gt;. At first, the technology was prototypical, with Niran only able to create inelegant and unsteady constructs, but Satya could see the potential. However, he refused to hand the technology over to Vishkar. Ignoring Satya's advice, he fled the academy, and took the technology with him. His abrupt departure hurt her emotionally, and she was forbidden from contacting him. &lt;a href=\"Sanjay%20Korpal\"&gt;Sanjay Korpal&lt;/a&gt; told her that Niran had left to profit off his technology, but she never fully believed it.\nGraduation.\nSatya's graduation ceremony was an unpleasant one. She was allowed to sit on stage beside Vishkar's CEO as they spoke about Dr. &lt;a href=\"Vishwakarma%20Bhatt\"&gt;Vishwakarma Bhatt&lt;/a&gt;. While this was an honor in theory, Satya knew that Vishkar was giving her special attention for their sake, not hers. She, their prize student, plucked from post-Crisis poverty and molded into perfection. She was unable to hear a single word the CEO said, as she was too focused on following the instructions she'd been given. Afterwards, she gave her own graduation speech, and while its delivery was flawless, she spent the next week curled up in bed in order to recover from the ordeal.\nHaving made it through graduation, Satya's fortunes changed. Though she was one of Utopaea's top architechs, the Vishkar Corporation saw far greater potential in Satya's abilities. Sanjay Korpal was put in charge of her training, instructing her to keep her true thoughts to herself, and to focus on the mission. While fighting was not in her nature, she excelled in combat all the same, and in a sense, it was theraputic, considering that she'd been powerless in her childhood. With limitless hard-light at her disposal, training to become a Vishkar agent was much easier than her time at the Academy.\nGiving her the moniker \"Symmetra,\" Vishkar sent her on clandestine missions around the world to uphold its corporate interests and expand its influence into other countries. While she'd heard rumors over environmental damage Vishkar had inflicted, she stayed with the company and trusted that the ends would justify the means. To the public, she was presented as the perfect Vishkar employee, which took its toll on her.\nA Better World.\nVaswani was present in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; as Vishkar tried to secure a deal with the mayor to re-develop the city's slums with its hard-light technology. However, the mayor favored a deal with &lt;a href=\"Calado\"&gt;Calado&lt;/a&gt;, a prospect that left Vaswani frustrated, as she believed Calado's proposal to be inferior and impractical. Storming out of the mayor's office, she came across a crowd of protesters who were against the re-development of their neighborhoods. Due to her own childhood experiences, Vaswani couldn't understand how they could bear to live in such \"disgusting\" conditions. As she tried to navigate through the protesters, she became overwhelmed by the sounds and the smells, leading her to lose her way. Then, a &lt;a href=\"Rosa\"&gt;young girl&lt;/a&gt; called out to Vaswani and offered to guide her back to her hotel. Motivated by the encounter, Vaswani vowed that Vishkar would secure the deal and help Rio's people, no matter what.\nThat night, Vaswani, on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Sanjay%20Korpal\"&gt;Sanjay Korpal&lt;/a&gt;, infiltrated the Calado building to find information Vishkar could use against &lt;a href=\"Calado%20%28character%29\"&gt;him&lt;/a&gt;. Breaking into Calado's vault, she managed to find some compromising material, but nothing substantial. Vaswani was then discovered by Calado's guards, but she created a barrier to deflect their shots, following which she used her photon projector to drain their energy. Sanjay questioned why she didn't just kill them, but Vaswani insisted she only resorted to lethal force if she had to. She subsequently escaped the building, with her pursuers being impeded by traps she had set up in advance.\nOutside, Vaswani contacted Sanjay, confirming that she didn't have enough on Calado to bring him down and suggesting they try to get to the mayor instead. Sanjay simply responded with \"so be it,\" and a second later, the Calado building was consumed in a fiery explosion. While Sanjay explained that Calado wouldn't stand in their way, Vaswani stared in shock as the building collapsed, with debris falling into the adjacent slum that she had passed through earlier that day. Vaswani made her way down to the favela, which had become enveloped in flames, and spotted a woman that was pointing towards a house while crying for help. Realizing there was still someone inside, Vaswani used her photon projector to forge a path and protect herself from the fire. Eventually, she found the young girl from before, trapped underneath debris, and freed her. Upon carrying her back to her mother, Vaswani realized the girl's face had been severely burnt and feebly hoped Vishkar could \"fix it,\" along with the favela.\nA few months later, the situation had indeed been \"fixed,\" as Vishkar had carried out its redevelopment of Rio's city center, now that Calado had been taken out. Standing with Sanjay as the mayor gave a speech, Vaswani observed that new housing had yet to be provided. Sanjay affirmed that \"appropriate\" housing would be provided in time, to which Vaswani responded by questioning whether the favela's destruction by fire had been intended by Vishkar. To this, Sanjay stated it was \"the price of rebirth and growth.\" Looking out over the crowd, Vaswani tried to convince herself that Vishkar was indeed, making a better world.\nStone By Stone.\nDispatch.\nVaswani attended a Vishkar meeting with Sanjay, head geologist &lt;a href=\"Harita%20Patel\"&gt;Harita Patel&lt;/a&gt;, and PR rep &lt;a href=\"Tamir%20Chada\"&gt;Tamir Chada&lt;/a&gt;. Development in &lt;a href=\"Roshani\"&gt;Roshani&lt;/a&gt; had triggered a tremor in the region, which had caused damage to a temple in the neighboring village of &lt;a href=\"Suravasa\"&gt;Suravasa&lt;/a&gt;, and a statue inside said temple to collapse. Chandra stated that if Vishkar didn't sort the issue out soon, they could kiss development rights in the area goodbye. Sanjay turned to Vaswani, 'suggesting' that she could volunteer in the village, pointing out her small village background, and her role as Vishkar's premiere hard-light architech. She would give the villagers anything they wanted, as no matter the cost, it would be a drop in the bucket compared to the financial loss of losing development rights.\nGoing over the hologram of the site, Vaswani asked who the statue was of. Chandra stated that it was of &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;; the first &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; to achieve sentience. Vaswani, familiar with Aurora's history, told them that the villagers would want more than just money, that they would want something better. Sanjay told her to find out what that was, and do whatever it took to make it happen.\nSuravasa.\nVaswani arrived in the village. Word of her coming had spread ahead, and Sarpanch &lt;a href=\"Ranesh%20Grewal\"&gt;Ranesh Grewal&lt;/a&gt;, head of the local government, told her that they wanted nothing to do with Vishkar. The gathered crowd was just as antagonistic. Still, she was granted access to the temple at her request, for despite Grewal's antagonism, the temple was open for all. An omnic led her inside, and Vaswani found herself reminded of her childhood, when she had visited temples when the rare opportunity had presented itself.\nThe omnic who led her inside introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;; a pilgrim to the temple. He told her that it was good that Vishkar was taking responsibility, but that it would mean nothing if the help wasn't actually helpful. He told her that she was welcome to stay if it helped her understand the people here and their faith. She was taken aback, pointing that she was an architech who had come to fix a problem, not a pilgrim, but Zenyatta asked what was a pilgrim, but someone who had embarked on a journey to a holy place? She was taken aback at the invitation, but she knew that Sanjay's suggestions of financial compensation wouldn't work, so perhaps following Zenyatta's advice would be a better outcome. Despite her anxiety at the prospect, she accepted Zenyatta's offer.\nThe Temple.\nZenyatta led her through the temple. He told her about &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;, and the two bonded over their shared trouble with human figures of speech. Reaching the main shrine, they came to the remains of Aurora's statue. He told her of Aurora's history, helping her understand why the villagers were so bereaved that it had been damaged. Moved by the story, Vaswani blurted out that Vishkar wanted to help, but Zenyatta stated that help could come in many forms. Building a retreat center would do little good, and there was no need to build a new temple given that this one was still standing, even if it was damaged. Its history, after all, stretched back over a thousand years.\nThe two retired for midday meal, where Zenyatta told her more about Aurora. Afterwards, Zenyatta took her to a bas-relief of Aurora. Come night, she retired to one of the temple's outlying buildings, where she was given a sleeping mat and temple robe. While she didn't want to wear it at first, as she wasn't a pilgrim (despite what Zenyatta said), she found herself attracted to the colors and changed. The following morning, she met with Zenyatta, admitting that while she didn't want to wear it, she wanted to demonstrate her sincere desire to help. Over the next few days, she moved with the other pilgrims; tidying the main shrine, picking up pieces of stone, and tidying the main area. She was told that a team of workers would remove the larger, heavier pieces in a few days time.\nTo her surprise, the priests didn't meditate, but were given orbs to ponder. Zenyatta gave her the Orb of Perception, so that she might perceive what she needed. Over the following days, she found herself adjusting to life in the temple, falling into a routine that suited her. On the fourth day, she and the priests went into the village where they served food to anyone who was hungry. The villagers were still antagonistic to her, but Zenyatta stood beside her, giving her silent support. That evening, discussing events with him, she stated that the scene reminded her of her childhood. They discussed the nature of faith, and Vaswani's architech background, before moving on to discuss the concepts of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi\"&gt;Wabi-sabi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi\"&gt;Kintsugi&lt;/a&gt;. She was moved by Zenyatta's words, and wished that she had heard of such ideas long before now. Reflecting on his words and the concepts he had imparted to her, she realized what she...\"they\"...had to do.\nUnion.\nOver the next few days, Vaswani worked with labourers who had come to remove the chunks of the Aurora statue, instead inviting them to reassemble them. They, the priests, and pilgrims, all worked together while she used &lt;a href=\"hard-light\"&gt;hard-light&lt;/a&gt; to fix the statue. \nThe day came when Vaswani presented her work to the world. She donned the robe she had worn for her stay rather than her corporate attire, as she felt the robe best represented what she had learned during her stay. In the courtyard, she met with Grewal and Sanjay, before leading them and the crowd to the Aurora statue. It was unveiled, revealing how Vaswani had used hard-light to fix it, arguably even improve it, given how it now glowed with light. Grewal was in awe, and Zenyatta gifted her with incense, and told her that she would always be welcome at the temple. Sanjay too was impressed, but was curious why she'd chosen yellow light rather than gold. Vaswani answered that blue was a beautiful color, but cold, and not fitting of a temple dedicated to an act of love. Love, in Vaswani's words, was warm. She went on to tell Sanjay that there was more Vishkar could do, but they had to understand, and be understood, to perceive \"how\" to do it. That they should act with respect, and be welcomed as friends.\nSanjay told her that she could be right.\nRebuilding Ruins.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Vishkar sensed a business opportunity to use its hard-light technology to rebuild the city. It sent Vaswani to the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Arcology\"&gt;Atlantic Arcology&lt;/a&gt; to meet with her former schoolmate, &lt;a href=\"Niran%20Pruksamanee\"&gt;Niran Pruksamanee&lt;/a&gt;. In less than 24 hours, Vaswani was given a whirlwind coaching session from Sanjay, some hastily assembled scripts from the corporation's legal team, and dispatched to make the offer. Sanjay warned her that Null Sector's attack might be a prelude to further chaos.\nDespite her unease at seeing Niran for the first time in eleven years, not to mention the complications of his departure, she was resolved to see the mission through as she always did. One upside was that she'd waited for years to see the Arcology up close, and understood the appeal of &lt;a href=\"the%20Collective\"&gt;the Collective&lt;/a&gt;, though years for working for Vishkar had taught her that if something seemed too good to be true, it probably was.\nShe arrived at the Arcology via &lt;a href=\"helijet\"&gt;helijet&lt;/a&gt;, and while Niran was late, he eventually arrived. She noted that Niran had strengthened both emotionally and physically since they'd last spoken. He led her into the arcology proper, and while she was impressed, she still kept herself at an emotional distance, given how Niran had vanished from her life eleven years ago. She eventually cut to the chase, laying out Vishkar's offer of working with Niran in its planned reconstruction of Paris. Niran was wary of working with Vishkar, and by this point, Vaswani had plenty of misgivings herself, as it seemed that over the last few years, all she'd done was clean up corporate's messes. Niran played coy, and continued the tour of the arcology, but eventually became more direct, telling Vaswani that if Vishkar was forcing her to do something that she didn't want to, she didn't owe them anything. If she needed help, he was here for her.\nThe offer opened the floodgate, and Vaswani demanded to know why Niran had left all those years ago, knowing what it would cost her. She accused Niran of planning to profit off his biolight technology, but he denied it, and in truth, despite what Sanjay had told her eleven years ago, she'd never really believed it. She stated that she was part of Vishkar, regardless of their more morally dubious actions, but Niran told her that he knew she didn't really believe that. However, Vaswani had less faith in herself than Niran did, as she knew that there was a line somewhere that she couldn't cross when it came to working for Vishkar, but she still believed in the greater good, and believed that for now at least, she and Vishkar were on the right side of it. She realized that Niran had never even considered coming back to Vishkar, and he admitted that if the company had sent anyone other than her, he wouldn't even have treated them to a meeting.\nThey arrived at the arcology's transport hub, her mission over, or so it seemed. A &lt;a href=\"hyperloop\"&gt;hyperloop&lt;/a&gt; train from &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; arrived, disgorging terrified passengers and behind them, Null Sector warbots, who'd used the lines to infiltrate the arcology. She and Niran fought against the attacking warbots together, and she noted how much more advanced Niran's biolight constructs were from when she'd last seen them back at the Academy.\nThe pair teamed up, along with the Arcology's security forces. During the fight, Vaswani noticed &lt;a href=\"neural%20suppressor\"&gt;strange devices&lt;/a&gt; attached to the heads of some &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, rendering them inert. Ultimately, the attack was foiled, and Niran stated that the Collective's scientists would examine the inert omnics. He treated her wound, and the two bonded over their shared experience in the battle. She was left in awe as to his biolight, and silently marveled that Niran didn't seek to profit off it. Vishkar, though...they would be able to do a lot of good, but she was certain that they would not stop with simply treating injuries. Not while there was money to be made. She explained her compromise to Niran, that despite her misgivings, she could still do good as a member of Vishkar. By working from the inside, she'd be able to use the company's resources to help those in need without having to spar with the company itself.\nNiran understood, and they accepted that they would always be friends. They worked together over the next few hours, with Vaswani helping manage the crowded med bays while Niran healed the worst injrues. Afterwards, they went around to repair what they could of the damage Null Sector had inflicted. They reminisced on old times before Vaswani left by helijet. Before boarding it, Niran told her to look into Dr. Bhatt. He told her that Bhatt's vision for hard-light and Vishkar was different from the path the company had taken, and that if his suspicions were correct, then the Arcology would be delighted to have her.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nSymmetra's design originated as a playable class called the Architect in the cancelled &lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;. In the original pitch for the game that would become \"Overwatch\", she was envisioned as wielding an arc welder and blaster, and could deploy sentry turrets and shield generators. In a later pitch she was given \"orb buffs,\" which were ultimately given to &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;. Her arc welder and blaster were later changed when the idea of hard light constructs were incorporated into her design. Her teleporter was taken from the Engineer class, which served as the basis for &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;, and she would eventually receive the Architect's shield generator as a second ultimate in \"Overwatch\".\nSymmetra's backstory was expanded through the development of &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;, as his backstory includes involvement with Vishkar as well. Symmetra being autistic was initially hinted at in the \"A Better World\" comic, and later officially confirmed by a letter from Jeff Kaplan to a fan.\nSymmetra is the only hero so far to have been recieved two significant ability reworks since the game launched; one in patch 1.6.2 (2017) and another in patch 1.25 (2018).\nOverwatch 2.\nLike almost all \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" Heroes, Symmetra was redesigned and given a new look for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"David%20Kang\"&gt;David Kang&lt;/a&gt; was the concept artist behind her Overwatch 2 look, but otherwise not much is known about the idea behind her new look. It was stated that the general scheme concept for all new hero looks for Overwatch 2 to be aimed at keeping the \"essence\" of the hero, while showing some evolution and character growth in the design.\nExternal links.\n "}

This made it easier for them to get new recruits who were ignorant of Talon's true nature. Mostly, Talon conducted rescue operations. In truth, they were profiting from the very conflicts they had created.\nTalon's area of operations in this period was focused in western Europe, and its activities at this time included arms trafficking, smuggling, illegal substances trade, and assassination. &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; carried out operations against Talon, spearheaded by &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A9rard%20Lacroix\"&gt;G\u00e9rard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; was able to procure some information on Talon's inner members, and the status of its paramilitary forces.\nRetribution.\nEight years before the present day, Overwatch was well and truly committed to stamping out Talon. Talon, for its part, wasn't going quietly, and struck against Overwatch targets across the globe. Under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Antonio\"&gt;Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, one such attack was launched on Overwatch's &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; facilities. Not long afterwards, a Talon agent infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Rome%20Blackwatch%20facility\"&gt;Blackwatch facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, where a meeting was being held by Overwatch members G\u00e9rard Lacroix, &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;. The agent planted a bomb in the facility, and the resulting blast leveled the structure. Reyes, McCree, and Lacroix (albiet heavily injured) survived, but many of the base's staff didn't. In response, a Blackwatch team was sent to Antonio's &lt;a href=\"Rialto\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;. What happened next was classified within Overwatch, but it apparently resulted in the death of Antonio. Numerous Talon soldiers were dispatched, but the Blackwatch agents were able to fight their way out of the manor.\nShifting Priorities.\nAfter the Venice Incident, Talon gained a new recruit in the form of &lt;a href=\"Akande%20Ogundimu\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt;, whose Social Darwinist philosophy aligned with Talon's. Talon saw great potential in Ogundimu, with his intelligence and ability to inspire as a commander. Ogundimu killed his mentor, &lt;a href=\"Akinjide%20Adeyemi\"&gt;Akinjide Adeyemi&lt;/a&gt;, and took on the moniker of Doomfist. Talon welcomed the new Doomfist, appreciating his tactical prowess. He would lead Talon's military arm, and direct actions that required more subterfuge. Over time, the rest of Talon fell in line.\nAs the new Doomfist, Ogundimu rose high in Talon and helped to orchestrate a conflict that the organization hoped would someday engulf the world. Under his leadership, Talon underwent a transformation to become not just a ubiquitous shadow presence, but a private military organization as well. While a difficult balancing act, Doomfist made sure that Talon could always influence, obfuscate, or terminate anyone who got too close to the truth.\nAs Ogundimu rose through the ranks, Talon's leaders began to get sloppy as the organization's hierarchy was disrupted. \nStorm Rising.\nOverwatch turned its attention to Talon's financial handler, &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that he'd be likelier to negotiate. They launched an operation in &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve him. Despite the efforts of the Talon soldiers in his convoy, Maximilien was captured. He told Overwatch that Doomfist would be in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; in three weeks, leading to &lt;a href=\"Doomfist%23Downfall\"&gt;Doomfist's arrest&lt;/a&gt;, and in exchange requested that Overwatch not tell Doomfist of his betrayal. After Doomfist's incarceration, &lt;a href=\"Vialli\"&gt;Vialli&lt;/a&gt; began to steer Talon into a more profit-orientated direction. However, after being apprehended, Doomfist conversed with &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, planting the seeds of doubt that would eventually result in Reyes joining Talon. Even incarcerated, Doomfist was able to maintain influence in Talon, though Vialli apparently remained in control.\nAssassinating Lacroix.\nTalon made several attempts to assassinate Overwatch member &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Lacroix\"&gt;Gerard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;, but failed. They settled on a different approach by kidnapping Lacroix's &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;, and subjecting her to neural conditioning. Overwatch agents eventually recovered her, but she ended up killing her husband in his sleep two weeks later. At some point afterwards, Overwatch launched an operation to rescue a number of scientists who had been kidnapped by Talon, held hostage in an urban area. The scientists were successfully extracted, with both sides losing agents in the firefight.\nPower Vacuum.\nWhen Overwatch disbanded, Talon was able to increase its strength, due to the resulting power vacuum.\nRetrieving de Kuiper.\nOne year after Overwatch disbanded, at Doomfist's command, Talon launched an operation to retrieve Dr. &lt;a href=\"Siebren%20de%20Kuiper\"&gt;Siebren de Kuiper&lt;/a&gt; from a black site within the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The operation was headed by &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, working alongside &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;. The operation was carried in sync with a second Talon squad led by &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, the plan being that Reaper and Sombra clear a path, while Widowmaker handled extraction.\nReaper and Sombra fought their way into the base's quantum chamber, where they encountered de Kuiper, who was subsequently retrieved by Widowmaker and her squad. du Kuiper was dubbed \"Sigma\" and ended up working for Talon, unaware that he was being used.\nMonte Cristi.\nFour years before the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; recall, Talon conducted an operation in &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Cristi\"&gt;Monte Cristi&lt;/a&gt;. Under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Cuerva\"&gt;Cuerva&lt;/a&gt;, they moved to move in on &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Fern%C3%A1ndez\"&gt;Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Playa%20Cartel\"&gt;Playa Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, who had been encroaching on Talon's territory. While they were able to successfully locate Fern\u00e1ndez's hideout, Fern\u00e1ndez himself wasn't there. Cuerva ordered the team to tear the town apart until they located the target. To that end, the Talon soldiers went from house to house, screaming for people to come out, and only finding terrified civilians. Events escalated even further with the arrival of a Talon aircraft that opened fire on the town, reducing it to burning rubble and inflicting numerous civilian casualties. While medic &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Augustin\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Augustin&lt;/a&gt; protested, Cuerva said that they \"had to set an example\" to the people if they refused to hand over Fern\u00e1ndez. As the carnage continued, the Talon soldiers started to loot the town.\nThe Train Job.\nAt some point after Overwatch's disbandment, Talon operatives raided a &lt;a href=\"hypertrain\"&gt;hypertrain&lt;/a&gt; on its way to Houston. &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;, who was on the train at the time, noted that their method of insertion appeared to be taken from the tactics used by &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, McCree eliminated every Talon operative that made its way onto the train, but dumped their target off the train so that Talon would get what they came for and stop putting civilian lives in danger.\nAlive.\nAt &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;, Widowmaker was assigned to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Tekhartha%20Mondatta\"&gt;Tekhartha Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;. Despite running into resistance from security forces and &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, Widowmaker successfully eliminated her target. She was subsequently picked up in a Talon aircraft. Talon's involvement remained unknown within the press, and his assassination set off a wave of human-omnic violence across the world.\nRecall.\nDays after Mondatta's assassination, Talon operatives accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; entered to retrieve a list of all Overwatch operatives. They encountered resistance from &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, but were able to incapacitate him long enough for Reaper to gain access to the Overwatch agents database. However, Winston was able to overpower the operatives and defeat Reaper before proceeding to interrupt the hack. As a result of the (apparently) failed operation, Winston initiated the Overwatch recall, bringing all former agents back onto active duty. In truth, Reaper was able to download some of the database, and eliminated a number of Overwatch agents as a result.\nMonte Cristi.\nDespite Talon's apparent failure at Gibraltar, Winston's recall action partly worked in their favor. The recall was sent to former Overwatch agents, and because Talon employed a number of ex-Overwatch members, they had access to the data. Furthermore, there were rumors that Reaper had actually succeeded in retrieving some of the agents' data. Whatever the truth of the matter, Talon deployed a number of its own agents into the field, determined to prevent Overwatch from reforming.\nOne former Overwatch member who received the recall order was &lt;a href=\"Vernand%20Sainclair\"&gt;Vernand Sainclair&lt;/a&gt;. Two days after the recall, &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trung%20Le%20Nguyen\"&gt;Trung Le Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated his mansion, to collect on the money he owed Talon. Since his information on the recall order was redundant, they had no reason to keep him alive. However, Baptiste was able to save him and escape his handlers.\nIlios.\nTalon tried to steal artifacts unearthed in &lt;a href=\"Ilios\"&gt;Ilios&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; brought in Overwatch agents to protect the relics. Talon plundered the site with reckless abandon, until archeologist &lt;a href=\"Sloan%20Cameron\"&gt;Sloan Cameron&lt;/a&gt; forced them to retreat.\nThe Temple of Anubis.\nLead by Reaper, Talon forces attacked the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Temple of Anubis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. Their troops engaged in a firefight with &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt; forces, causing collateral damage and civilian casualties. However, in addition to battling the HSI forces, Talon also had to contend with former Overwatch members &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;.\nVolskaya Industries.\nVialli dispatched Reaper, Widowmaker, and &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Volskaya%20Industries\"&gt;Volskaya Industries&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to assassinate its CEO, &lt;a href=\"Katya%20Volskaya\"&gt;Katya Volskaya&lt;/a&gt;, as he was tired of how intractable she was. Sombra was able to deactivate the site's security, giving Reaper and Widowmaker access to the base. Widowmaker lined up her shot, but an alarm sounded, alerting security, and sending Katya to her panic room. Widowmaker and Reaper failed to take her out, and Sombra engaged in pursuit. She reached Katya, but made her own deal, revealing that she had been the one to set off the alarm. Leaving the safe room, she reported that Katya had escaped. The operatives returned to their ship.\nDoomfist's Return.\nAfter the failed Russian operation, Talon agent Reaper assaulted a &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Securities%20maximum%20security%20prison\"&gt;maximum security prison&lt;/a&gt; to rescue &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Talon inner council and former mastermind of a plot to sow chaos across the globe that was cut short years before by Winston, Tracer, and Genji. The relative ease of the operation led some to believe that Talon had moles within &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt;. It would be three months before news of the incident became public. Doomfist's return wasn't greeted well by Vialli, who sent his men to assassinate him in Monaco. The attempt failed, and Doomfist, Sombra, Reaper, and Widowmaker headed for &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;. The three agents eliminated Vialli's men, while Doomfist met with Vialli himself. Vialli's profit-orientated goals differed from Doomfist's Darwinian ideology, and Doomfist killed Vialli. Alongside Reaper, he met with what remained of Talon's inner council, declaring his intent to start a war.\nNumbani.\nDoomfist carried out a reign of terror against &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to sow chaos between the humans and &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s living there\u2014to \"bring out its best\" through \"a little chaos.\" Their first attack was at &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Airport\"&gt;Numbani Airport&lt;/a&gt;, carried out by Doomfist singlehandedly, where he destroyed numerous &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt; robots before retreating. The airport's security cameras were compromised moments before the attack, likely by &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;. The attack caused the city's planned &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt; celebration to be postponed.\nSombra caused further tensions in Numbani by hacking into the city's omnic population, causing them to malfunction, and further divide the populace. Later, Doomfist carried out Talon's second attack, destroying a statue of &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Park\"&gt;Peace Park&lt;/a&gt;. He gave a speech, denouncing Numbani's ideals of unity, that its acceptance of omnics into everyday life had made its people weak. The people of the city, and he was their shepherd, intent on keeping the wolves at bay. Whatever the truth of his beliefs, it was clear that his intent was to spread fear and discord throughout Numbani, then Africa, then the world.\nThe third attack was against the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Doomfist led the attack himself, backed up by Talon agents. The attack was foiled by &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;. With the sound of approaching sirens, Doomfist and his lieutenants made a retreat.\nThe fourth and final attack was on Numbani's Unity Day celebration. However, they were repelled by &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio%20Correia%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;L\u00facio Correia dos Santos&lt;/a&gt; and Orisa. With this defeat, things started to calm down in Numbani. The omnics who had been affected by Talon's hacking were cured.\nCairo.\nTalon remained present in Egypt after their Temple of Anubis attack. A Talon cell operated inside the city with impunity. Over a period of months, &lt;a href=\"HSI\"&gt;HSI&lt;/a&gt; carried out a series of operations against Talon, all of which ended in failure. In truth, the cell was tracking &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt;. However, they also ended up attempting to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; in a marketplace. The pair were able to fight their way out of the ambush.\nHSI was able to track the Talon cell, and days after the marketplace skirmish, they tracked the Talon agents to their warehouses, burning them to the ground. However, &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt; reflected that this would do little to dent Talon's operation. Later, the Talon forces attacked Pharah, Ana, and Cassidy, as part of a planned ambush. Pharah called in HSI reinforcements, but they were intercepted en route. In the ensuing firefight, Pharah unleashed a missile barrage, wiping out the Talon cell.\nBucharest.\nTalon continued to pursue Baptiste. A hit squad entered a train station in &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, hunting him. However, working together with &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, the pair were able to escape the train station, killing or incapacitating the Talon troopers.\nMongolia.\nAt some point after Bucharest, Cassidy and &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt; \"appropriated\" a &lt;a href=\"MV-261%20Orca\"&gt;MV-261 Orca&lt;/a&gt; from a Talon base in Mongolia.\nCommand Ship Retrieval.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s failed attack on &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; that had led the attack crashed into the sea before making it back to base. &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; assigned &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the ship's &lt;a href=\"power%20relay\"&gt;power relay&lt;/a&gt; data, in order to aid the development of a device Talon was working on. Less than 100% of the data was retrieved, but instead, the power relay itself was obtained. The command carrier was completely destroyed, leaving no witnesses.\nKnown Members.\nLeadership.\nTalon is overseen by an inner council of at least fifteen members, of which five are currently known and active:\nParamilitary Forces.\nTalon has employed a variety of paramilitary forces. However, it does not adhere to a basic military structure. During the period of Overwatch's activities, Talon's forces included heavily armored soldiers with specialist roles. In the modern day, Talon has utilized more lightly armored soldiers, with a lack of heavy armor or armament, though retain access to the more heavily armored soldiers as well."}

Their attacks are heavily choreographed, and they are by far the easiest enemy the player will face. They will cling from wall to wall, blinking between walls three times before leaping to the ground, then dragging their blades along the ground as they charge towards a player.

There are also two full-time Business Operations people, an esports director, a dedicated Quality Assurance team, and a dedicated Community team. As of early 2024, the team consists of around 400 individuals.\nThe team was restructured during the development of \"Overwatch 2\", and its size expanded, in order to cover the development of a free-to-play game.\nHistory.\nTeam 4 was formed to develop \"&lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;\", a next-generation MMO. Though Team 4 grew in members, \"Titan\" itself was not coming together right. The game was officially cancelled on September 23, 2014.\nIn the summer of 2013, a small core group started working on a new idea, which would become \"Overwatch\". The size of the team fluctuated throughout the development of \"Overwatch\", ranging from about 40 developers to 75, the number they had at the launch of the beta. Around launch, the audio team was brought on full-time, as well as an automation team, who kept the beta stable.\nAfter the release of \"Overwatch\", the team ran into issues, as they had too much to do with too few staff. They had to simultaneously develop content for \"Overwatch\", work on \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", and help out with the ever-growing &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20League\"&gt;Overwatch League&lt;/a&gt;. Robert Kotick of Activision Blizzard suggested that Team 4 simply hire more people (hundreds even), akin to Activision's \"Call of Duty\" development teams. He also suggested that a new team worked on \"Overwatch 2\" while Team 4 continued to work on \"Overwatch 1\" (or vice versa). Kotick's suggestions were opposed by &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chacko%20Sonny\"&gt;Chacko Sonny&lt;/a&gt;, as they believed strongly in the culture they'd built at Team 4, not to mention that more people could lead to more problems and less efficient development. The contention between Kaplan/Sonny and Kotick led to various problems as the years wore on.\nIn February 2019, after a round of layoffs at Activision Blizzard, it was announced that Team 4 would be expanded. In late 2020, Team 4 was further expanded in size, as it continued to work on \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring development of \"Overwatch\", more and more of Team 4 were transferred to work on PvE. In January 2024, half of the team's environment team was cut.\nBy the end of 2024, Microsoft will lay off a number of Team 4 members as part of cutting 3% of its global workforce.\nTrivia.\nEaster Eggs.\nWithin the \"Overwatch\" games, various possible references to Team 4 can be spotted. These include the following:"}
{"id": "29141", "revid": "55717755", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=29141", "title": "Team Composition", "text": "A team composition, often shortened to team comp, is a term frequently used in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" to describe what heroes an in-game team is made up of.\nOverview.\nA team composition is the makeup of a team's hero selections in each &lt;a href=\"Roles\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;. Successful team compositions utilize different heroes' strengths together, ultimately resulting in cohesive strategies and good flow between teammates to secure a victory.\nIn Role Queue, each team is made up of one Tank hero, two Damage heroes, and two Support heroes. In order to create a team that works well together, players consider how different heroes and their &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; compliment each other, often choosing those who have similar playstyles or utility.\n\"Overwatch 2\" does not provide a tutorial on how to make a successful team composition, but some of the &lt;a href=\"tips\"&gt;tips&lt;/a&gt; in-game recommend certain aspects of a successful one. While this article does provide objective insight into how team compositions are chosen, it is not all-encompassing, and there are \"many\" ways to create a successful composition.\nMetas.\nThroughout \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", different team compositions and strategies have been generally agreed upon by the community as being effective. This is referred to as a \"meta.\" The ongoing meta shifts as heroes are changed and balanced, and can vary between ranks, platforms, and regions. Players will often give a nickname to each meta that refers to heroes in the meta.\nFor example, in \"Overwatch\", there was a popular meta by the name of \"GOATs,\" (Greatest Of All Time). This meta was a brawl composition consisting of three Tank heroes and three Support heroes; it was incredibly powerful because of its ability to trample the enemy team when played well.\nSome metas do not encompass entire team compositions, and can be based around one or two heroes that are referred to as \"meta picks.\" When a hero is considered a meta pick, it causes the hero's \"pick rate,\" or their overall rate of play, to increase. For instance, when &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt; was buffed alongside the Season 9 &lt;a href=\"February%2013%2C%202024%20Patch\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;, it caused his pick rate on all platforms to increase from 2.60% in Season 8 to nearly 4% in Season 9. \nPlayers will often build a team composition around a meta pick, and choose heroes that work well with their abilities. An example of this is the \"Moth Meta,\" named after its dominant support, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;. After her 2017 rework, Mercy was extremely powerful in a few different compositions, and players would build their team around her utility with heroes that benefitted from damage boost.\nPopular compositions.\nThere are infinite ways to create a successful composition, but three popular categories have emerged over time: Dive, Brawl (or \"Rush\"), and Poke. These are the base for many hero combinations. Hero choices shift depending on balance patches and changes, but the overall strategy remains the same throughout.\nDive.\nA dive composition uses a high-risk, high-reward strategy to disrupt the enemy and pick off key targets to collapse in on them. Dive compositions are most often made up of heroes with movement abilities and close-range attacks, who are able to do significant damage before giving enemies the opportunity to react. The ultimate goal of dive is to take multiple different angles on the enemy to surround them, then rejoin at the same time and pick off key targets together. \nDive heroes.\nTank: &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hazard\"&gt;Hazard&lt;/a&gt;\nDamage: &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venture\"&gt;Venture&lt;/a&gt;\nSupport: &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juno\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;\nBrawl.\nBrawl is a widely used composition and is based on a team's ability to do major damage, or \"brawl,\" the enemy team together. Unlike dive, brawl compositions do not take multiple angles, and instead fight at the front lines together. They move in a straight line as one unit, using raw firepower to deal high damage and quickly trample the enemy team.\nPoke.\nA poke composition is one that utilizes ranged damage, or \"poking,\" to put pressure on the enemy from multiple angles in order to limit how they can play. It uses heroes with ranged damage to pick off key targets and create an opening for the rest of the team to move in."}

Anubis facility) is an &lt;a href=\"Assault\"&gt;Assault&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maps\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". One of the 12 maps included in the game's release on 24 May 2016. In Overwatch 2, the map is only accessible in &lt;a href=\"Custom%20game\"&gt;Custom games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcade\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, due to the removal of the Assault mode from standard modes. \nOfficial Description.\nNestled among the ancient ruins of the Giza Plateau on the outskirts of Cairo, the Temple of Anubis is one of many new excavations in the area. While most believe that the site is of interest for archaelogical reasons, it also hides the entrance to a research facility that extends deep beneath the earth. The facility is alleged to house an &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, but the whole truth is known only to a select few. Not even the agents of &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt; who guard the facility know what they're protecting.\nHistory.\nThe facility site was constructed during (or prior to) &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Period_of_ancient_Egypt\"&gt;Late Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; Egypt.\nPre-Crisis.\nThe Anubis facility housed &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; and its support team. In the same year the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began, a ventilation accident occurred which resulted in the death of the programmers. As it would take time to find the staff with the required skills to maintain Anubis, the &lt;a href=\"god%20program\"&gt;god program&lt;/a&gt; was left alone for months. While it was ruled an accident at the time, in the decades since the Crisis, many have speculated that Anubis may have engineered the accident itself, as by this time, it had already come to the conclusion that protecting both the natural world and humanity were mutually exclusive objectives.\nWhatever the case, bereft of human oversight, Anubsis's decline was rapid, and it made its plans to exterminate humanity, alone.\nMission Statement.\nOver the years, information from the facility was periodically released.\nThe Anubis facility was taken over by HSI a few years before Overwatch's recall. However, it didn't upgrade its security. This allowed the &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; AI to break containment, taking control of the site's &lt;a href=\"sentry%20bot\"&gt;sentry bot&lt;/a&gt;s. An engineering team was sent in to regain control of the command center, but contact was lost. HSI subsequently sent in a &lt;a href=\"Raptora\"&gt;Raptora&lt;/a&gt; team led by Captain &lt;a href=\"Khalil\"&gt;Khalil&lt;/a&gt;. Despite taking casualties, the team was able to shut Anubis down.\nValkyrie.\n&lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Anubis facility, engaging in a firefight with the HSI forces stationed there. Innocents got caught in the crossfire.\nStrategy.\nAttack.\nAt capture point A, after you pass the first chokepoint, you can turn right to a staircase. This leads you to a balcony above the point. There is also a left side path through a room attached to the left side of the choke. This leads to the bridge, directly in front of the point. At capture point B, there are two side paths (and one sub-side path). The first one is on the right, and meets the main path just before the objective. There is a short wall at the turn of the path, and certain heroes can cross it with their abilities, making for a good flank. The second one is to the left, and leads to a fork. The left path of the fork leads to a cave, which, although leading directly towards one of the defenders' spawn exits, also leads right to the objective. The right path goes under a bridge, and leads to what seems like a small archeological site, with staircases leading close to the objective.\nDefense.\nAt control point A, you can go to the short ledge as Bastion and be a turret there because that is the only way in. On control point B, you can sit on the objective and wait for enemies."}

Though the team of scientists successfully established a base on the martian surface, their terraforming technology caused unique weather phenomena to engulf the planet. Under a blanket of terrifying dust storms, however, Lucheng's base endured, and a child was born to its scientists: &lt;a href=\"Juno\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;.\nSynopsis.\nThe comic begins with a space shuttle leaving Earth, filled with scientists from &lt;a href=\"Lucheng%20Interstellar\"&gt;Lucheng Interstellar&lt;/a&gt; on a mission to terraform mars. While there, &lt;a href=\"Jiayi\"&gt;Jiayi&lt;/a&gt; and an unnamed scientist gave birth to a baby girl, the first martian, &lt;a href=\"Juno\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;.\nJuno grew up in suboptimal conditions for a child but had great curiosity and interest in her home planet, Mars. Jiayi and her colleagues gifted &lt;a href=\"Juno\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt; her own space suit, and she contributed as best she could to the mission. Over time, her suit was given improvements to make it easier for her to navigate mars. \nThe terraforming from the crew was causing changes to the Mars' atmosphere, introducing more violent storms. Without warning, &lt;a href=\"Lucheng%20Interstellar\"&gt;Lucheng Interstellar&lt;/a&gt; stopped responding to communications. This meant the scientists were stranded on Mars with limited supplies and time.\nUltimately, they used their limited resources to build a ship, which Juno used to fly back to Earth in with the climate data from Mars that the scientists had gathered. She hoped to return to Mars one day to see her Family once again and save her home planet.\nNotes.\nThe events of the comic lead directly into \"&lt;a href=\"Control%20%28animated%20short%29\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Dr. Jamison Junkenstein's lust for revenge had spilled into every street and engulfed the village in a sea of terror. Yet as the town seemed lost, they appeared. Four Wanderers who had traveled from distant lands to vanquish the darkness. When their grim work was done, the doctor's mad laughter haunted the village no longer.\nThe Wanderers vanished as suddenly as they had appeared. The stories of their valor would live on, but the peace they had brought to Adlersbrunn would not...\nDr. Junkenstein was but the pawn of a greater power: the one known as the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20the%20Wilds\"&gt;Witch of the Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. She would not abandon her fallen servant...not while his debt to her remained unpaid. Her forbidden magic breathed the spark of life back into Dr. Junkenstein's cold heart. \nDeath had not slaked his thirst for chaos, nor had it dimmed his devious mind. He labored to remake his infernal army mightier and more terrible than ever before. \nThe noble &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Adlersbrunn\"&gt;Lord of Adlersbrunn&lt;/a&gt; was helpless to stop Dr. Junkenstein's rampage. The only hope he had to save his village lay far beyond its walls...\nThe winds carried his plea far and wide, first to a legendary &lt;a href=\"The%20Viking\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; craftsman who had fought beside the Lord of Adlersbrunn in days long past. He could not ignore the call of an old friend, no more than he could resist spilling the blood of a new foe. \nOn and on the ravens flew, even to the misty lake where &lt;a href=\"The%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt; dwelled. It was said that she felt no warmth, no cold, no joy, and no sorrow. The only thing that stirred in her heart was an unending hunger, but whether that was what moved her to seek out Adlersbrunn, none could say.\nStranger still were &lt;a href=\"The%20Monk\"&gt;the Monk&lt;/a&gt; and his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"The%20Swordsman\"&gt;the Swordsman&lt;/a&gt;. Where they had met and why they had agreed to travel together are tales for another day. But it is said that they answered to a foreboding presence\u2014a force beyond mortal understanding.\nAcross land and sea, by foot and by hoof, they came. Four they were in number like the Wanderers of old. Trust would not come easy, but they would need it to survive the horrors the Witch had in store. \nFor she had at her side a faithful servant named the Reaper, and she had claimed a monstrous new ally: the Summoner, who wielded the power of an ancient dragon. Bound to the Witch\u2019s will by pacts forged in blood, they were called to the battle and pledged not to rest until they had destroyed Adlersbrunn once and for all. \nAnd so the endless night began..."}

Brian stole it from its case, and hid from Widowmaker. Timmy yelled \"watch out,\" distracting her, giving Brian the opportunity to punch her with the weapon, sending her sprawling. The tide of battle turned into Overwatch's favor, and the Talon agents were forced to retreat. Winston gave chase, and so did Tracer, but not without looking down at the two boys, telling them that the world could always use more heroes. After seeing such a display, Timmy exclaimed \"that was awesome!\""}

The idea was to create a walker that would aid in the construction of high-rises. During the Omnic Crisis, the Titan design was pilfered by the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s and retrofitted into a weapon of war. These units possessed infrared sensors and an abundance of heavy firepower, and were proficient in spotting and eliminating targets and laying waste to entire cities. The omnics also installed an internal drone defense system. The Titan itself is controlled from a cockpit.\nA Titan was piloted by &lt;a href=\"Sven\"&gt;Sven&lt;/a&gt; decades after the Omnic Crisis when he unleashed it on the city of &lt;a href=\"Boklovo\"&gt;Boklovo&lt;/a&gt;, shrugging off anything the &lt;a href=\"Kurjikstan\"&gt;Kurjikstan&lt;/a&gt;i military threw at it. While Torbj\u00f6rn was eventually able to deactivate the walker, it wasn't before a large portion of the city was destroyed.\nTitans were regularly used by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; during their global assault. These Titans were equipped with two left wrist-mounted triple barreled grenade launchers, arm mounted energy cannon, an energy weapon located in its chest, and two shoulder-mounted cluster missile batteries.\nGameplay.\nTitans will be fought as PvE enemies in &lt;a href=\"Story%20Missions\"&gt;Story Missions&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nTorbj\u00f6rn\u2019s extensive arsenal includes a rivet gun and hammer, as well as a personal forge that he can use to build turrets. \nStrategy.\nTorbj\u00f6rn is the tool-tip damage-dealer that has most abilities which are useful for protecting (zoning) an area. His Rivet Gun is a very dangerous weapon due to its high damage, but its main weakness is arcing in mid- to -long range. His turret is his main tool for zoning an area, as he can deploy it anywhere and let it automatically build itself to help him in a fight. Forge Hammer can be used to deal damage at close-range or repair his damaged turret. Overload is a power-up to himself, giving more maximum health with armor and enhancing offensive powers. Molten Core is a great area-denial ultimate that can force the enemies to walk back before being burnt to death on a high-damage magma floor. Given all these, he still has major weaknesses. Other than Overload, he lacks any means of increasing his mobility. When unable to deploy his Turret to help him in a fight, his full power will be greatly reduced. Despite having the shortest model of all heroes, he possess one of the largest hitboxes of his class, making him vulnerable to a weapon with a large spread. He is best at zoning, but weaker at flanking and fighting aggressively.\nStory.\n\"Build 'em Up, Break 'em Down.\"\nTorbj\u00f6rn Lindholm (called \"Torby\" by his friends) is one of the greatest weaponsmiths and engineers in the world. He had a low opinion of &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, believing them to be incapable of empathy, instead acting purely on logic, and disagreed with giving them the same rights as humans. His 'adoption' of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, however, has caused him to question his antipathy to robots and omnics, and while still advocating for less reliance on &lt;a href=\"AI\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;, he has taken a more liberal view of the integration of omnics into society. \n\"Allt \u00e4r inte guld som glimmar\" (All that glitters is not gold) is one of his favourite phrases. &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; considers Torbj\u00f6rn's mind to be among the greatest humanity has ever produced. He has above average resilience.\nBackground.\nTorbj\u00f6rn Lindholm was born in &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. More than once, he embarked on a fool's errand, and his mother would often tell him \"Don't buy the pig while it's still in the bag.\" She knew what her son was up to, and how it would end.\nTorbj\u00f6rn displayed an incredible genius for mechanical engineering and design from a young age. Even before he finished his primary schooling, it was clear what career path he would take, and sure enough, he left for university to pursue more advanced degrees. He attended Link\u00f6ping University, where he met &lt;a href=\"Ingrid%20Lindholm\"&gt;Ingrid&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, she was working on biogenic textile engineering, but her material was cost-prohibitively expensive. She was on the verge of quitting when Torbj\u00f6rn met her. He saw several practical applications for even small amounts of her fiber, such as in advanced circuitry. After graduation, Ingrid retired from her field, but remained aquainted with Torbj\u00f6rn. The two later married and had several children.\nPre-Crisis.\nAfter graduation, Torbj\u00f6rn joined &lt;a href=\"SST%20Laboratories\"&gt;SST Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;, where he helped design the &lt;a href=\"E54%20Bastion\"&gt;E54 Bastion&lt;/a&gt; unit. He also assisted in founding the &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Guild\"&gt;Ironclad Guild&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked in R&amp;D. He helped design the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;. He gained notoriety for designing weapons systems used by countries around the world. His belief that technology must serve a better vision for humanity put him at odds with his employers, who desired to control his weapons using networked computer intelligence. He had a deep mistrust of sentient &lt;a href=\"artificial%20intelligence\"&gt;robotic intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, which many of his peers wrote off as paranoia. \nAfter the Bastion and Titan were deployed, Torbj\u00f6rn began to speak out publicly against the growing reliance on AI in all fields of life. To Torbj\u00f6rn, robots were nothing more than tools, and to needlessly complicate them beyond their intended function risked humanity's future. As &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s became more ubiquitous in human civilization, Torbj\u00f6rn was one of the &lt;a href=\"Omnica%20Corporation\"&gt;Omnica Corporation&lt;/a&gt;'s strongest detractors. He argued that any creature made by humanity would accumulate the worst aspects of humanity. What would happen when humans built machines smart enough to make their own choices, to make their own repairs? Omnica countered that their omnics were not sentient, that failsafes had been built in to avoid such an eventuality. While Torbjorn was a brilliant engineer, his political opinions were poison. Many Ironclad tried and failed to convince him that it would be better to lobby for better guardrails for AI and omnics, rather than arguing for their disbandment.\nOmnica won the battle of public opinion, and the proliferation of omnics continued. As a result of his hardline positions, Torbj\u00f6rn eventually found himself unwelcome in the majority of engineering firms, all of which had pivoted to rely more on AI. With much of his credibility destroyed, Torbj\u00f6rn still objected to the increased presence of robotics in everyday life. Even after the decline of Omnica, his continued resistance to AI, especially in light of the &lt;a href=\"god%20program\"&gt;god program&lt;/a&gt;s' improvement of society, struck people as ill-advised.\nTorbj\u00f6rn returned to Gothenburg, choosing to devote time to his family and work rather than continuing to lobby against AI. However, his mistrust of the technology remained, and in his view, the world was making one bad decision after another.\nThe Omnic Crisis.\nEarly Service.\nTorbj\u00f6rn's worst fears were realized when the robot populations of the world turned against their human creators during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. He was in &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; when the war began, and ironically, his anti-AI position spared his family. Under the control of &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s turned on their human owners, but had never allowed domestic robots in his home. The combination of no omnics and a hidden turret-powered security system made the Lindholm household the safest place in Gothenburg. During the battle, he recognized some of the warbots of his own designs, such as the E54 Bastion and Titan. \nWith omnic forces rampaging across Europe and the world beyond, Torbj\u00f6rn was immediately drafted into service. He did not resist, and if anything, relished in it. For the first time since university, Torbj\u00f6rn felt that the world could be made better. That after the war, the world would be ready to listen to his suggestions. Before leaving Gothenburg however, he outfitted the city with the same weaponry and defenses he'd previously used to defend his family. The installation took only days, and he considered it well worth his time.\nA few weeks into the war, Torbj\u00f6rn was summoned by the Swedish &lt;a href=\"National%20Chemical%2C%20Biological%2C%20Radiation%2C%20and%20Nuclear%20Defense%20Center\"&gt;National Chemical, Biological, Radiation, and Nuclear Defense Center&lt;/a&gt; to complete and deploy the &lt;a href=\"Luftf%C3%B6rsvarsn%C3%A4tverk\"&gt;Luftf\u00f6rsvarsn\u00e4tverk&lt;/a&gt;. His deployment of the turret system in Gothenburg had attracted the attention of the Swedish government and was making headlines across Europe and the rest of the world. He was deemed \"The Man WHo Would Save Sweden,\" a title that Torbj\u00f6rn objected to on the basis of all the work that was being done by other hands. Nevertheless, he said goodbye to Ingrid, promising to return when Sweden was truly safe. While deploying the Luftf\u00f6rsvarsn\u00e4tverk would have been an impossible task in lesserhands, for Torbj\u00f6rn, it was the challenge he'd been waiting for all his life. Building off the work he'd done in Gothenburg, he built the foundations of the Luftf\u00f6rsvarsn\u00e4tverk, assembling a team from the greatest minds Sweden had to offer. Together, they took advantage of the resources provided by the Swedish government, and deployed the Luftf\u00f6rsvarsn\u00e4tverk with breathneck speed. \nRecruitment Into Overwatch.\nWhile not outright confirmed, there are those who believe this monumental act of engineering is what convinced &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; to take Torbj\u00f6rn seriously. Whatever the truth of the matter, it is known that Torbj\u00f6rn was recruited into Overwatch because of his engineering genius, though his recruitment was far from conventional. Torbj\u00f6rn had heard of Overwatch's creation (a special taskforce created by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;) through the &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Guild\"&gt;Ironclad Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and had watched the organization's early recruitment with interest. Upon hearing that Overwatch intended engineers to be part of a support team rather than field agents in their own right, he decided it was down to him to show them the error of their ways. \nBelieving he could make a contribution, Torbj\u00f6rn returned to Gothenburg to visit his family. After several days, he proceeded directly to the Overwatch training facility, where he was granted admission after admitting himself. He was made the fifth member of the Overwatch strike team. Over the years, his many inventions proved integral to ending the conflict. \nMission to Canada.\nAlongside &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;, he took part in an operation with the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Special%20Forces\"&gt;Canadian Special Forces&lt;/a&gt; to take out the &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;.\nClosing Days.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"the%20Awakening\"&gt;the Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, Overwatch was given an opening to strike at &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; directly. Liao and Torbjorn worked together to compose a picture of Anubis's defenses and propose a route into its &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt;. As most of Anubis's forces at this point consisted of Bastions and Titans, Torbjorn was especially useful in the op's planning, and was thus able to offer expert support. The rest of the strike team worked with the &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian military and successfully stormed Anubis's base, deactivating the god program.\nWhile Anubis had been shut down, this was not the end of the war, as Anubis's loyalists continued to wreck havoc. Torbj\u00f6rn and the rest of the team were deployed to places such as &lt;a href=\"Wellington\"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jakarta\"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; before the war's end.\nWith the war over, a brief but vicious political battle erupted over the future of Overwatch. Special interests dragged every skeleton they could out of the closet to stymie the organization, in Torbj\u00f6rn's case, his contributions to the Bastion and Titan designs. However, Overwatch won the political battle, and its charter was expanded to rebuild the world after the Omnic Crisis. After the decision, Torbj\u00f6rn was heard to mutter in range of a microphone, \"Call us the janitors of the apocalypse.\"\nOverwatch.\nOperation White Dome.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, Torbj\u00f6rn took part in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20White%20Dome\"&gt;Operation White Dome&lt;/a&gt;, where he and other Overwatch members were deployed to &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; to deal with entrenched omnic forces still loyal to Anubis. As soon as they landed, the omnics opened fire, and while the robots were defeated, Torbj\u00f6rn was seriously injured, losing his left arm and right eye. &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt; was able to save his life however, stabilizing him.\nAfter the battle, Torbj\u00f6rn was taken in for medical treatment at &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;. Young family friend &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; was able to visit him, which pleased him greatly. On the other hand, Reinhardt stayed by his bedside, being a source of constant irritation. Half in jest, Torbj\u00f6rn told him that if he shut up, he would be allowed to choose the name of his upcoming daughter, and that &lt;a href=\"Ingrid%20Lindholm\"&gt;Ingrid&lt;/a&gt; would agree to it. In truth, Torbj\u00f6rn had already considered naming Reinhardt as his daughter's godfather, but that aside, Reinhardt agreed to the terms. After this, Torbj\u00f6rn wrote to his wife, assuring her that he was okay, and that he would design a prosthetic arm to replace the one he lost in Istanbul. He told her of the deal he had made with Reinhardt, hoping that it would be okay with her. He further hoped that he would be home in Gothenburg before she gave birth.\nPost-Crisis.\nIn the years that followed, Overwatch became an international peacekeeping force, and Torbj\u00f6rn remained a critical resource for all of its technological needs and signature weapons systems. At its height, Overwatch possessed one of the most advanced armaments on the planet, which could be traced to Torbj\u00f6rn's work. This included the development of biotic technology, including the &lt;a href=\"biotic%20rifle\"&gt;biotic rifle&lt;/a&gt;, which was intended to heal Overwatch medics in the field. This device led to some disagreement with now Overwatch agent Dr. Ziegler, who warned that the rifle was setting Overwatch on a dangerous path to weaponizing biotic technology. He also designed the armor components of her &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20suit\"&gt;Valkyrie suit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt; requested Torbj\u00f6rn to create him a &lt;a href=\"robo-horse\"&gt;robo-horse&lt;/a&gt;, but the engineer refused.\nDuring his Overwatch years, he once dressed as a Viking for Halloween.\nAt some point, Torbj\u00f6rn took Brigitte to a music festival where &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio%20Correia%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;L\u00facio Correia dos Santos&lt;/a&gt; was the headliner. He disliked L\u00facio's music. The Lindholms also visited &lt;a href=\"Ilios\"&gt;Ilios&lt;/a&gt; at one point.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;, Torbj\u00f6rn was among those who attended her funeral.\nUprising.\nSeven years before the Overwatch recall, Torbj\u00f6rn was part of an unsanctioned mission authorized by Strike Commander to end the King's Row Uprising in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. While preparing to board an aircraft, Torbj\u00f6rn gruffly remarked that \"the cavalry's here\" after seeing Cadet &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Lena Oxton&lt;/a&gt; blink in front of him. Tracer liked the phrase, and decided to keep it.\nReinhardt's Retirement.\nSometime after the Uprising, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt; was forced to retire from Overwatch due to his actions at the &lt;a href=\"Global%20Energy%20Summit\"&gt;Global Energy Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Up to this point, Torbj\u00f6rn had maintained Reinhardt's &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; armor, and the two had got on well. The official reason for retirement was due to Reinhardt's age, though there was no precedent for this in Overwatch's charter. Only four years younger than his friend, Torbj\u00f6rn was particularly incensed that the organization simply \"pushed Reinhardt out\" after giving everything of himself in years of service. The Swede would not forget the incident, and related the unfairness of it all to one of his youngest daughter, &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe End of Overwatch.\nWhen Overwatch disbanded, Torbj\u00f6rn entered retirement, returning to Gothenburg and Ingrid. He spent at least some of his time giving lectures on abstract algebra and the dangers of weaponized AI.\nIn the aftermath of Overwatch's fall, many of Torbj\u00f6rn's weapons were stolen or stashed away around the world. Feeling responsible for his creations, Torbj\u00f6rn was determined to stop them from falling into the wrong hands and wreaking havoc on the innocent. Round about the same time, Reinhardt (who had been forced to retire from Overwatch) declared that he would become a knight-errant on a quest to bring justice. Brigitte asked to join him and Reinhardt accepted. Torbj\u00f6rn knows that his daughter shared his stubbornness, and while his bigger concern was that Reinhardt and Brigitte were in over their heads, he ultimately supported their decisions. Plus, there was no-one better to look after his daughter in his mind.\nDestroyer.\nTorbj\u00f6rn received word that a single omnic had attacked the city of &lt;a href=\"Boklovo\"&gt;Boklovo&lt;/a&gt;. He thought little of it at the time, but when he arrived the following day, he saw that it was nothing to scoff at. The omnic was a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;; one that was rampaging through the city, and shrugging off everything the &lt;a href=\"Kurjikstan\"&gt;Kurjikstan&lt;/a&gt;i military threw at it. He was bitterly reminded that the Titan was a device he had originally designed to aid in city construction, before it had been hijacked by the omnics during the Omnic Crisis and turned into a city-destroyer. But despite the alterations, it was still his design, and that allowed him to bypass its infrared detection systems and gain access to the walker's interior. Once inside, it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Sven\"&gt;Sven&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend of his, was piloting the mech. The two verbally sparred as Torbj\u00f6rn fought his way up to the walker's cockpit. Sven presented himself as some kind of arbiter of justice, but Torbjorn claimed that he was nothing but a war profiteer. Upon reaching the cockpit, he easily incapacitated him. He subsequently shut down the mech.\nRecall.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; issued a recall of Overwatch agents, Torbj\u00f6rn was in northwestern &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.\nBinary.\nWith the report of a &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; unit in northern Sweden, Torbj\u00f6rn attended a meeting of locals who were discussing the incident. While the Swedish government believed the reports to be a hoax, a speaker at the event declared that they should take matters into their own hands. Torbj\u00f6rn interrupted the meeting, pointing out that the rifles they had would be useless against the automaton. He pointed out that as the unit hadn't attacked anyone yet, its self-repair function was probably damaged. A broken bot was something that he could handle. He told the townsfolk to give him a few days, and to stay put while he sorted out the unit.\nTorbj\u00f6rn headed out into the forest. Despite his earlier words, he was followed by an official, who wanted to make sure the job was done by the book. He revealed to Torbj\u00f6rn that he'd done some digging, and had discovered that Torbj\u00f6rn had helped design the E54 Bastion before the Omnic Crisis. They successfully lured the robot out, but a &lt;a href=\"Ganymede\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; landed on their intended bait. Sighting the Bastion, the official opened fire, and the Bastion retreated. Torbj\u00f6rn was skeptical as to the official's claims that the Bastion had been scared off, for in his experience, Bastions didn't retreat. The official headed off into the forest alone, confident that he and the police could handle it, despite Torbj\u00f6rn's warnings. Torbj\u00f6rn went his own way, mulling over what he'd just seen. Before long, he found the robot again, helping beavers build a dam. Perplexed, Torbj\u00f6rn tried to goad the robot into attacking, but it just stared at him before offering some wood. Torbj\u00f6rn realized that this Bastion was different from the automatons he'd fought in the past.\nThe moment was interrupted by the official and the police he'd brought with him, who opened fire on the unit. Torbj\u00f6rn told them to stop firing, that the Bastion wasn't aggressive, and that they had to call off the hunt. The official was having none of it, and ordered the police to restrain him. Torbj\u00f6rn was one step ahead of them, and incapacitated the guards using the device he'd originally intended to trap the Bastion with. He headed off into the forest. Eventually, he found the Bastion again, and the two headed off together. Torbj\u00f6rn warned that they weren't friends, that if it pointed a gun at him, it would be slag. And that it had to stop playing with every animal it came across.\nThe Lindholm Notes.\nWith Bastion on toe, Torbj\u00f6rn returned to his &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Guild\"&gt;Ironclad Guild&lt;/a&gt; workshop in &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;. On the return journey, he watched the Bastion's every move. Sometimes, he'd purposely look away, baiting it, waiting for its CPU to calculate a monetary lapse in his defense, and in so doing, draw its weapon. That would give the excuse to \"do what needed to be done,\" but the opportunity never came.\n become fixated on what made Bastion different from the other E-54 units that had killed so many during the Crisis. When he told Ingrid what he was doing, he expected her to scold me, but she simply smiled. \nOver the following months Torbj\u00f6rn spent with Bastion caused him to reconsider his former antipathy towards omnics. Bastion ended up living with Torbj\u00f6rn, who managed to free the robot from much of his wartime programming, and conducted repairs on several of Bastion's decades-old crumbling systems. He also upgraded the omnic; among the upgrades was a new set of armor.\nHis time with Bastion caused Torbj\u00f6rn to soften his anti-AI stance, and became more liberal towards the integration of omnics into human society. In an interview, he stated that as humans had created omnics, it was their responsibility to care for them.\nReflections.\nTorbj\u00f6rn spent Christmas with his family and &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlizzard World.\nAlongside Bastion, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, Torbj\u00f6rn watched an ad for &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20World\"&gt;Blizzard World&lt;/a&gt;. After Tracer rushed off (presumably to visit the park), Torbj\u00f6rn let out a \"for the Horde\" exclamation.\nGothenburg.\nTorbj\u00f6rn was present in &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; when it was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to understand the omnic Brigitte and Reinhardt sent, And also having a mild R&amp;R. He stops Reinhardt from attacking Bastion due to his change of heart and experience. And later, He fought against the attacking omnics alongside Bastion, Brigitte and Reinhardt. And later decide to stay in the workshop while Reinhadt takes Bastion and Brigitte into Overwatch.\nExternal links.\n "}

She is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nToting twin pulse pistols, energy-based time bombs, and rapid-fire banter, Tracer is able to \"blink\" through space and rewind her personal timeline as she battles to right wrongs the world over.\nStrategy.\nTracer is a close-range skirmishing hero who specializes in speed and single-target damage. Her mobility and high single-target damage makes her excellent at picking key targets with very low risk. Tracer can quickly traverse a map with the use of Blink to outflank her enemies, deal damage to them, and then retreat before they have a chance to respond. Her low base Health and lack of regenerating shields means that she must make good use of Blink and Recall to avoid or reverse damage.\nStory.\n\"Cheers, love! The cavalry's here!\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent known as Tracer is a time-jumping adventurer and an irrepressible force for good. She hails from London, and has traveled all over the world. With her irrepressible energy and boundless idealism, Tracer inspires her team\u2014and all who know her\u2014to fight for a better future.\nShe was a great admirer of &lt;a href=\"Tekhartha%20Mondatta\"&gt;Tekhartha Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;, and was inspired by &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;, an Overwatch scientist. She believes that sometimes, one simply has to do what is right, even if it's outside the law. She has always thought of herself as a soldier (at least since joining Overwatch), and is committed to protecting humans, omnics, and movements that could make the world better.\nTracer has abnormally fast reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and passion for flying. She has trouble concentrating, only able to concentrate for hours at a time when she is upset. She is a fan of British pop/punk music, such as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash\"&gt;The Clash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles\"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;, and collects vinyl records. She is a crack shot in real-life, but terrible at videogames (yet apparently a good cook).\nEarly Life.\nLena grew up in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; as the only child of working-class parents. They raised her to know her enemies and her worth in equal measure, never forcing her to conform to anyone else's idea of who she was supposed to be. Her father told her that \"a soldier must know her enemy.\" On her tenth birthday, Lena bought a vinyl record for 60 quid.\nIn her teens, Lena was something of a party animal; staying out all night, and attending rock concerts. Her father helped her enroll in pilot training at a young age, and her love of flying and speed only grew. When she turned seventeen, she got her first motorcycle. Still wanting to go faster, she enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. Her mother accompanied her when she went to enlist.\nLena was accepted as a test pilot, and received certification on multiple aircraft, along with marksmanship training. She received the callsign \"Tracer,\" and became known for her fearless piloting skills and upbeat attitude.\nOverwatch.\nThe Slipstream.\nWhile still a member of the RAF, Lena became the youngest person ever inducted into Overwatch's experimental flight program. Despite her youth, her abnormally fast reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and passion for flying made her well suited for the program. She was handpicked to test the prototype of a teleporting fighter, the &lt;a href=\"Slipstream\"&gt;Slipstream&lt;/a&gt;. But during its first flight, the aircraft's teleportation matrix malfunctioned, and it disappeared. Hours passed, then weeks, and with neither trace of life nor contact from Oxton, the Slipstream was presumed destroyed, and its pilot presumed deceased.\nLena reappeared months later, but her ordeal had greatly changed her: her molecules had been desynchronized from the flow of time. Suffering from \"chronal disassociation,\" she was a living ghost, disappearing for hours and days at a time. Even for the brief moments she was present, she was unable to maintain physical form. Sometimes she had strange dreams about the past, including being a kitchen maid at a large house in the country.\nTracer remained in this state for two years, but did not biologically age during this time. Overwatch's doctors and scientists were stumped, and Tracer's case seemed hopeless until the gorilla scientist &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; was assigned to her. He designed a device called the &lt;a href=\"chronal%20anchor\"&gt;chronal anchor&lt;/a&gt;, which was able to keep Tracer anchored in space, albeit not in time. Winston realized that her destabilized chronological matrix was building up an unknown form of energy. The energy would hit a critical amount when Tracer was forced to remain in a single fixed timeline. Scrapping the anchor prototype, Winston designed the &lt;a href=\"chronal%20accelerator\"&gt;chronal accelerator&lt;/a&gt;, which kept Tracer anchored in the present. In addition, it gave Tracer the ability to control her own time, allowing her to speed it up and slow it down at will. The effects of the accident also gave Tracer unique aging properties.\nThanks to the device, Tracer was able to live a relatively normal life. Because of her newfound abilities, she was recruited into the Overwatch strike team and joined Winston in training. The two became close friends.\nFuneral.\nFive years before Overwatch was shut down, &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt; was killed in an attack on Overwatch's &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; facilities. Tracer was among the Overwatch members who attended her funeral.\nUprising.\nThree years before Overwatch was shut down, Tracer continued training to become an Overwatch agent, and trained under the supervision of Winston and Dr. &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;Overwatch Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;' Training and Evaluation facility, where she sparred against &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;. Genji would later comment that Tracer was \"the only one I have trouble keeping up with.\" Under supervision, Dr. Ziegler commented on how if no setbacks occurred, she was fit for active duty; a sentiment Winston agreed with. On the 27th day of the King's Row Uprising, Strike Commander was impressed by Lena's skills with her chronal accelerator. Summoning her to his office, Morrison stated how he was impressed by her determination to stay with Overwatch despite her recent accident. Noticing images of London burning on a viewscreen in Jack's office, Lena commented on her belief in Overwatch's mission. After confiding in Lena his motivations in joining Overwatch, Jack dismissed Lena with the implied knowledge that he approved her request to be promoted to active duty.\nLena Oxton then appeared at an Overwatch aircraft where Dr. Ziegler, &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt; were preparing to embark on an unsanctioned Overwatch mission authorized by Jack Morrision, who was moved by Lena's words to end the Kings Row Uprising in her home city. Ziegler told Lena that the team was invested in her career, and that Jack was fond of her. Reinhardt welcomed her to the team, and Torbj\u00f6rn grudgingly referred to her arrival by saying, \"looks like the cavalry's here\" (a phrase that Lena took a liking to). The team fought their way through the streets, even as hordes of Null Sector omnics tried to bar their way. For Tracer, the assignment was her chance to prove to Overwatch that she was worth the effort. The mission concluded with the team rescuing the hostages, Mondatta included.\nNull Sector was defeated, but the events that transpired were classified within Overwatch's archives. In truth, Tracer's presence in the Uprising mission was not serendipitous\u2014given the public relations scandal Overwatch had endured because of the &lt;a href=\"Venice%20Incident\"&gt;Venice Incident&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, Morrison made sure to send Overwatch's 'cleanest' agents into London, Tracer among them. Furthermore, because London was Tracer's home city, it made her all the more obvious as a choice.\nThe mission was a success in terms of perception as much as outcome, and to build on the good will they had been able to regain, Overwatch followed up their victory with a propaganda blitz, papering London in posters advertising the joys of a career in Overwatch. Their chief subject? Tracer herself.\nGraduation.\nAfter the Uprising, Tracer became a full-fledged member of the Overwatch strike team. She graduated alongside Genji and &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;. With her newfound skills, Tracer became one of Overwatch's most effective agents. Her cheery attitude and unflagging optimism made her a public relations darling, and as the fame didn't go to her head, she was encouraged to appear in public as much as possible.\nAt some point she was stationed at . At some point after the Uprising, she was among those who celebrated Commander Morrison's birthday.\nStorm Rising.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;, Tracer led an Overwatch team consisting of herself, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; in an operation in &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;. Their mission was to extract &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; in league with &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;. The Talon forces were moving through the city in a convoy, one which Tracer ghosted on a &lt;a href=\"hovercycle\"&gt;hovercycle&lt;/a&gt;. She moved in and engaged the Talon soldiers. Alongside her team mates, the convoy was destroyed, but Maximilien fled on foot. Tracer wasn't worried, reasoning that he couldn't get far without a vehicle, but Sojourn urged caution...also with a request not to blow anything else up. Tracer replied that she couldn't make any promises.\nThe team was able to apprehend Maximilien, who agreed to give them an \"introduction\" to &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, Talon's leader. He told Overwatch that Doomfist would be in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; in three weeks and in exchange requested that Overwatch not tell Doomfist of his betrayal.\nDoomfist.\nAlongside Winston and Genji, Tracer battled &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; in Singapore. Her agility and speed couldn't be matched by Doomfist, but her pulse pistols had little effect on the man, either being deflected by his gauntlet, or bouncing off some kind of shield. She was caught off-guard when Doomfist suddenly grabbed her chronal accelerator in mid-air and crushed it in his hand, causing Tracer to blink rapidly, and vanish. Following her disappearance, Winston became enraged and defeated Doomfist in a close quarters clash. With her chronal accelerator destroyed, Tracer was once again dissasociated from the usual flow of time. Fortunately, Winston was able to intervene before she was lost forever. The accelerator was repaired or replaced sometime after.\nThe End of Overwatch.\nWith the passing of the &lt;a href=\"Petras%20Act\"&gt;Petras Act&lt;/a&gt;, Overwatch was disbanded. All Overwatch strike team agents, Tracer included, were stripped of their credentials, and forced to turn over weapons and technology. Due to health reasons, Tracer was allowed to keep her chronal accelerator.\nAfter Overwatch's dissolution, Tracer felt aimless. She rejoined the &lt;a href=\"RAF\"&gt;RAF&lt;/a&gt;, but learning that they wanted her for desk duty, she left the organization; the desk job was apparently an intentional demotion. She began a new life back in her home city of London with her girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Emily\"&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt;, residing in an appartment on Willington Road. Finding herself needing to 'move,' she became a vigilante within the city, continuing to right wrongs and fight the good fight wherever the opportunity presented itself. Emily who tolerated Tracer's activities, calling them \"compensatory heroics.\"\nLondon Calling.\nStopping a bike mugger, Tracer returned home to Emily. She reassured her partner that she was happy. Upon reflection, Tracer was reminded that she was only mostly happy. What would make her truly happy was Overwatch's return, but that was an impossibility.\nTracer bought an album from &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Records\"&gt;Empire Records&lt;/a&gt;. Coming out, she saw the police pursuing a gang of &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s. She cornered one of the omnics, who revealed that she'd stolen a modulator, which was needed for the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;'s grid, as no-one would sell modulators to London's omnics legitimately. The two bonded over their shared love of British pop/punk bands. Introducing herself as &lt;a href=\"Iggy\"&gt;Iggy&lt;/a&gt;, the omnic took Tracer to see her record collection in the Underworld. She showed her the grid, which the omnics relied on for their power, but it was falling apart. Tracer was disconcerted with the revelation, but found some joy when Iggy introduced her to her fellow omnic pop aficionados, &lt;a href=\"Lady\"&gt;Lady&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lizzy\"&gt;Lizzy&lt;/a&gt;. She was struck in awe at the omnics' collection of pop music memorabilia, and the quartet listened to music together.\nIggy escorted Tracer out of the Underworld. She asked if there was anything she could do to help with the grid issue, and assured her that she'd see her again. Tracer zipped out, but on the street, was confronted by a gang of omnics. They opened fire, but she was able to use her speed and skill to disarm them. Even then, the gang leader told her to stay out of the Underworld, and that even if she genuinely wanted to help them, they wanted no help from a human.\nTracer ignored the omnics, and returned with a piece of technology for the grid. Arriving in the Underworld, she found Iggy being lectured by &lt;a href=\"Kace\"&gt;Kace&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the leader of the gang that had confronted her earlier. Iggy was glad for the tech, along with an Iggy Pop record Tracer had brought. Tracer spent the next six hours looking for more parts for the grid, but had no luck, as the required technology was under government restriction. In her apartment, Tracer shared her frustrations with Emily, who showed her a package from a \"S. Paceape\"\u2014a delivery from Winston. Tracer hoped that he might have some ideas on how to fix the grid. \nThe package contained a regulator, which she delivered to Iggy. While glad, she revealed that last night, the grid's transformer had given out, and that there was no transformer they could acquire legally. However, in truth, Iggy had been searching for Tracer, that she bore a message from Tekhartha &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt;. That his followers were looking for her, and that he wished to address her before he gave his speech at &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt; this evening.\nAlive.\nA few hours after her talk with Winston, and following Iggy's advice, Tracer headed for King's Row to see Mondatta. While Mondatta's assigned security were wary of her, Mondatta ordered them to let her in. The two recognised each other from when they'd met at the King's Row Uprising seven years ago. Tracer wasn't sure why Mondatta had rescued her, and even expressed unease at her attempts to help the omnics of the Underworld, wondering if she was the right person to do so...yet also didn't want to look away. Mondatta reassured her of her efforts, and stressed the need for her, for all humans and omnics, to look forward. Tracer wanted such a world, but reminded Mondatta that for some, the Omnic Crisis had never ended. Mondatta acknowledged the point, but stressed that they had to act now.\nMondatta was led out of the room by the security team, in order to give his speech. Tracer headed out and joined the human-omnic crowd outside the Meridian. Walking through, she came across Iggy, who was similarly delighted to see the Shambali leader speak to such a crowd. Mondatta began to talk, but Tracer got a bad feeling, and in her experience, her instincts were usually on the money. She left Iggy and made her way through the crowd.\nAs it was, Tracer's instincts were indeed correct, as she confronted &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; among the rooftops. The two carried out a run and gun battle, but despite her efforts, Widowmaker successfully assassinated Mondatta. Enraged, Tracer tackled Widowmaker, demanding to know why she had done this. Chuckling, Widowmaker easily incapacitated her and departed in a &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; aircraft. Tracer survived, but her chronal accelerator had been damaged.\nStill Alive.\nLying on the ground, incapacitated, Tracer was left to wonder why Widowmaker had assassinated Mondatta; had she been hired, and if so, by whom? She reflected that what had just occurred was potentially the start of a war. She made her way back to her appartment and watched the news, among which was the report that she may have been involved in the event. Emily reassured her that what happened wasn't her fault, but Tracer wasn't convinced.\nIn the days that followed, Tracer got another package from Winston; a part for her chronal accelerator. Watching the news, Emily informed her that in response to an omnic protest, the police had called in &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ops\"&gt;Special Ops&lt;/a&gt;. Tracer ran over to the event; Emily yelled at her that the accelerator wasn't fixed, but Tracer responded that she'd fix it when she got back. As she ran, she reflected that whoever had ordered the hit on Mondatta must have known how the omnics would respond, that the omnics would fight back in response to a symbol of hope being taken away from them.\nDespite the accelerator glitching, Tracer made it to the riot, with Special Ops on one side, and omnics and human supporters on the other. The police deployed a &lt;a href=\"sonic%20pulse\"&gt;sonic pulse&lt;/a&gt;, and in the confusion, &lt;a href=\"Lady\"&gt;Lady&lt;/a&gt; was hit by the wave at point blank range. She and Iggy helped get Lady back to the Underworld, but Lady ended up expiring. After the memorial service, Tracer sympathized with Iggy, but Iggy rebuffed her coldly. Two omnics were dead now, and what had humans done for them? Kace stepped in, claiming that since the omnics' enlightenment, humans had waged war against them. Tracer said that it didn't need to come to war, that they could stop it from happening, but Kace wasn't listening. He pointed out that Tracer was an Overwatch agent, pointing out that Tracer had fought against omnics in the Uprising. Tracer claimed that she had fought against Null Sector to free Mondatta, while Kace claimed that she'd fought for \"them.\" That she had made her choice. Kace told her to leave the Underworld, that she was no longer welcome.\nBack on the surface, Tracer noticed the police clamping down, fearing that what was &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;happening&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; was now happening in London. As she walked, her chronal accelerator malfunctioned, incapacitating her. As she lay on the ground, a cloaked figure approached her, revealing herself as Lizzy. She got Tracer back to her appartment, where she and Emily were able to fix her chronal accelerator, using spare parts that Winston had sent. With Tracer recovered, Lizzy explained that while Iggy might have come to resent her, she didn't share her antagonism. Mondatta was dead because someone had shot a bullet, not because Tracer had failed to stop it. \nGoing through the parts, Lizzy came across a device that she believed could fix the grid. However, she doubted that she would be able to get near it, as Kace had rallied the Underworld's omnics to his side. His followers had stalked Tracer, and no doubt they'd be after Lizzy as well. It was at this point that Emily told Tracer that there was a message for her from Winston.\nReforming Overwatch.\nWinston's Recall.\nTracer was contacted by Winston as he issued a recall order for Overwatch agents. She commented that they'd been out of touch for too long; an assessment that Winston agreed with. He told her how (where he was present) had been attacked by &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;. Their conversation was interrupted by Lizzy, who told her that she'd been talking to Iggy, but that the line had cut off. Tracer told Winston what had happened, and zipped off to the Underworld. Winston warned her that the parts he'd sent her were only temporary, but Tracer either ignored or didn't hear him.\nUnderworld.\nTracer and Lizzy ran towards the Underworld, the former slowing down to allow the latter to keep up. Lizzy pointed out that the omnics wouldn't just let her in, to which Tracer responded \"I know.\" Arriving at the Underworld's entrance, they found six omnics standing guard. Tracer used her speed to disorientate the guards and have them chase after her, allowing Lizzy to enter the Underworld. She reunited with Lizzy, who led her to the fourth level, where Iggy said she would be. Arriving, they found Iggy, albeit in Kace's custody. Kace told her that the omnic revolution was nigh, and that there was nothing Tracer could do to stop it.\nTracer yelled at Kace to let Iggy go, but to no avail. She and Lizzy were forced to take cover as more of Kace's omnics arrived, opening fire on them. To make matters worse, her chronal accelerator began to malfunction. However, she was able to use her super-speed to nevertheless save Iggy. The two of them escaped the area and reunited with Lizzy, along with a group of omnics that were seeking to leave the Underworld. Lizzy explained that Kace was rounding up all the Underworld's omnics to fight for them, and that there were more omnics scattered throughout the tunnels.\nTracer told Lizzy and Iggy to take the east side, while she'd take the west. They'd rendezvous back at this point, and leave together. A few hours later, they began to head out, but were confronted by Kace's thugs. Tracer pleaded with them to drop their weapons, stating that the omnics just wanted to get to the surface, but one of thugs stated that omnics that refused to join the revolution were just as traitorous as the humans they fought against. Gunfire errupted, and Tracer managed to distract the thugs for a period before her accelerator malfunctioned again. However, she was saved by Winston, who used his &lt;a href=\"barrier%20projector\"&gt;barrier projector&lt;/a&gt; to save her. Safe behind the barrier, the two opened fire, defeating the enemy omnics.\nThe two met up with Lizzy and Iggy. Tracer explained that she and Winston would draw Kace's forces deep into the Underworld, allowing the omnics to make it to the surface. Iggy asked Tracer to stop Kace, stating that if he took out the grid, the Underworld would be devastated. She said that she would, and they made their way down into the Underworld's depths, coming across Kace and his followers. While they had a clear shot, Winston pointed out that if they did so, they risked hitting the grid. Tracer suggested that she could get closer, but Winston pointed out that would be impossible, due to her accelerator malfunctioning.\nA showdown was averted as Iggy's voice was heard over the comms., persuading Kace's forces to stand down. Kace, however, wasn't as willing to embrace peace, and fired at Iggy. Tracer darted forward, taking the bullet, with the intent to recall backwards. However, her accelerator was damaged, so the bullet ended up richoching within her body. Winston carried her outside, while Kace was able to escape.\nRecovery.\nTracer was taken to a hospital and underwent surgery. The omnics she'd rescued from the Underworld held a vigil, and Emily could only pace back and forth, waiting and hoping. The omnics played \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust_for_Life_%2528Iggy_Pop_song%2529\"&gt;Lust for Life&lt;/a&gt;\" on repeat for the entire eight hours she was under the scalpel. She came through, and was greeted by Emily, later telling Iggy that the playing of the song had \"tipped it.\"\nOne week later, Tracer had fully recovered, and her accelerator had been fixed. Winston informed her that he hadn't been able to find Kace, but suspected that he might have been tied with Null Sector. In better news, he and Lizzy had been able to fix the grid. Asking her if she was ready for the next battle, Tracer stated that she wouldn't have it any other way. That she was back in the fight, and ready to go.\nContacts.\n\"Note: The timing of these events is unclear; Tracer's meeting with Mei must occur before the events of \"Reflections.\"\nAt some point after receiving Winston's recall, Tracer forwarded it onto &lt;a href=\"Fareeha%20Amari\"&gt;Fareeha Amari&lt;/a&gt;. However, she refused to join Overwatch, as her place remained with &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt;.\nTracer was with Winston at when &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; arrived. However, the climatologist didn't stay long, and instead set out to restore Overwatch's ecological network.\nDay at the Museum.\n&lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Museum\"&gt;Overwatch Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, trying to steal &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s gauntlet. Tracer fought them alongside Winston and the villains were forced to retreat. Tracer complimented two young boys (&lt;a href=\"Brian\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Timmy\"&gt;Timmy&lt;/a&gt;) that had helped her in the aftermath, commenting that the world could always use more heroes.\nReflections.\nDuring the winter holiday season, Tracer sought to pick up a gift for her girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Emily\"&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt;, in King's Row. After blinking to numerous stores, Tracer was unable to find a gift owing to stores either being closed (or\u2014in one instance\u2014allowing another patron to keep a scarf that they were about to purchase). Ultimately, a small girl gave Tracer a gift in gratitude for Tracer having retrieved the girl's family's gifts from a thief earlier that night. Arriving home, Tracer gave the gift to Emily, which to her surprise was the scarf that she sought to purchase earlier. Emily loved the gift, and the two kissed. Later, Tracer and Emily went to visit Winston for dinner at , who was about to spend the holidays alone with &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;. Tracer then reminisced about the events of the past year, and had a good feeling about the next one.\nBlizzard World.\nAlongside &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;, Tracer saw an ad for &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20World\"&gt;Blizzard World&lt;/a&gt;. Declaring that she couldn't wait to get on some of the rides, she zipped off.\nA New War.\nZero Hour.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Tracer, Winston, and &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; took the &lt;a href=\"Orca\"&gt;Orca&lt;/a&gt; to aid the city. Winston deployed force, distracting Null Sector long enough for Tracer to land the craft. She and Mei joined the fight, but their initial success was disrupted by the arrival of a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;. It opened fire, destroying the Orca, injuring Mei, and ensuring the group were outgunned, as well as outnumbered. Tracer told Winston that they couldn't stay here, to which he responded that she get Mei and the civilians to safety while he held Null Sector off. He assured Tracer that he'd be right behind them, to which she responded \"you better be.\"\nFortunately, Winston's last stand wasn't required, as new Overwatch members arrived to join the fight. However, they still had to deal with the Titan. They quickly devised a plan, combining Tracer's pulse bomb with Mei's backpack, effectively creating an 'ice bomb.' Tracer used her blink ability to get into the Titan, plant the bomb, and get out, freezing the construct before it shattered.\nIn the aftermath, the members of Overwatch reunited. When asked if Overwatch had returned, Winston triumphantly declared that they had.\nPreparations.\nAfter Paris, the team traveled to , which they used as their base of operations. As it turned out, Null Sector's attack on Paris was simply the prelude to a global invasion. Winston pointed out that Null Sector wasn't the only threat Overwatch had to deal with. He declared that they'd had to fight their way through one city at a time.\nAt night, Tracer and Winston texted each other. Despite her need for sleep, Tracer engaged in conversation. Winston admitted that he was afraid, because as he was the one who'd sent out the recall, he was responsible for whatever came next. Tracer responded by repeating Emily's saying\u2014\"do the right thing as hard as you can, apologize later.\" Winston thanked her for her words.\nRio.\nNull Sector attacked &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. Tracer and her fellow Overwatch members deployed into the city, where they linked up with &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;. While they were able to take out a number of Null Sector omnics, L\u00facio explained that as long as Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; remained airborne, Null Sector could keep deploying omnics \"ad infinitum\". The ship was successfully destroyed.\nAfter the battle, Tracer texted with &lt;a href=\"Emily\"&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt;, who told her that she was sheltering in a bunker near &lt;a href=\"Turing%20Green\"&gt;Turing Green&lt;/a&gt;. \nToronto.\nTracer and the rest of Overwatch arrived in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; in response to Null Sector's invasion of the city. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to evacuate a number of civilians, both human and &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;, but ultimately, the city fell to Null Sector. During the fighting, Tracer and the rest of the team observed Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt;s, which attached metal clamps to omnics' heads, incapacitating them.\nThe team's &lt;a href=\"shuttle\"&gt;shuttle&lt;/a&gt; landed on a ship that had escaped the city. While the civilians were left in the hands of Canadian authorities, Tracer grimly noted the hopeless state of the subjugated omnics. \nThe shuttle returned to Watchpoint: Gibraltar. Scarred by what she'd seen, Tracer spent hours fixing it. Emily texted her during the repairs, but eventually, Tracer got back to her. Even through the texting, Emily could tell that Tracer was upset. Tracer mentioned what she'd seen in Toronto, and they both agreed that Null Sector's effective slavery of omnics didn't make sense given the organization's stated goals. To make matters worse, Emily explained that she was still in the bunker in London, and that not every human was happy for their presence. Tracer told Emily to tell the omnics about what Null Sector was doing, and promised she'd have good news soon.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nEarly Development.\nTracer originated from the playable Jumper class from \"&lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;\". During the initial pitch for the project that would become \"Overwatch\", the Jumper was invisioned as wielding machine pistols and time bombs, and had the Blink and Recall abilities. From a lore standpoint, multiple Jumpers existed, and were tasked with using their tech to travel back in time to save the world. The Jumper aesthetic was influenced by old aviator jackets and goggles.\nMost of the concept work on the Jumper was male. This signaled a shift in game design, as while the classes of \"Titan\" were player characters, the characters of \"Overwatch\" were intended to be distinct individuals. The Jumper was thus made female and given a backstory.\nTracer conceptually began with the idea of a hero that blinked across the map. She was the first hero developed for the game; the first to be made, concepted, modeled, and put in the game.\nTracer's visual design allowed the development team to home in on the visual style for \"Overwatch\". The classes from \"Titan\" had a toy-like feel to them, whereas it was decided that for \"Overwatch\", things would be more grounded. This became manifest in Tracer's jacket, as one could see stitching and weathering on the leather. Her legs were shortened during development, as the developers worried it would look too awkward in the game animation.\nAt some point during early development, Tracer shot lasers from her eyes. Her design used to include a jacket.\nCharacter Development.\nTracer is the 'mascot character' of \"Overwatch\", and its centerpiece hero. She has been called the \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone\"&gt;Rosetta Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" of the game. However, her status as the game's \"marquee character\" was not necessarily planned. During development, the question of who the main character of \"Overwatch\" was came up. At the time, &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Tsang\"&gt;Arnold Tsang&lt;/a&gt; stated that there was no main character, but later reconsidered his stance, as Tracer was the first hero made for the game. According to &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;, Tracer \"was one of the first characters we really got to know.\" While not created for a starring role, the development team warmed up to her. Metzen has likened her to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;. Tsang has stated that Tracer was ultimately chosen to be the main character was because she embodied it with her design, aesthetic, color, and her positive outlook and heroism.\nAfter Tracer was given a name and backstory, the game had a clear creative direction; making the shift from classes to heroes.\nJeff Kaplan stated that the decision to announce Tracer as a lesbian in the was considered carefully by the Blizzard team. Kaplan stated that the team wanted to portray Tracer's sexuality in a realistic and non-pandering way that was respectful of the character and tied into her story; not just \"checking a checkbox on a list.\" Kaplan also stated that the team was aware of the negative backlash that the announcement was bound to receive owing to Overwatch's global popularity, that the subject was difficult to talk about, and that it could bring up legal troubles in some countries. Russia banned the comic from appearing on Overwatch's Russian website in accordance with federal law.\nOverwatch 2.\nTracer was redesigned for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Tsang\"&gt;Arnold Tsang&lt;/a&gt;. The team sought to preserve Tracer's core design elements\u2014her color palette, silhouette, and sense of motion\u2014while simultaneously evolving and updating her model and style. This led to a departure from her \"retro\" goggles, bomber jacket, and leggings and a move toward a sleeker, more tech-y design that befits a freshly recalled Overwatch agent."}

{"id": "2686", "revid": "55717755", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2686", "title": "Ability", "text": "All &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; have abilities that are unique to them. Unlike &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, abilities do not consume ammunition, but their use is limited by cooldowns and charge. Most abilities are disabled when a hero is &lt;a href=\"hack\"&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt;ed.\nOverview.\nAbilities are split into three types:\nAny damage from abilities is considered \"ability damage,\" which is relevant for some abilities, such as &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s passive.\nEffect types.\nArea of Effect.\n abilities apply their effects to all heroes in their area. Area of effect abilities require an unobstructed line of sight to the targets, meaning that they can be blocked by terrain, terrain-like &lt;a href=\"objects\"&gt;objects&lt;/a&gt;, such as Mei's , and in most cases also by &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt;s. Most area abilities are spherical, but they can also come in other shapes. Other effects may also generate an area of effect when colliding with a hero or terrain.\nProjectile.\nProjectile abilities fire a or that apply their effect to the target they collide with. Projectiles have a size and travel time.\nHitscan.\n abilities can be described as projectiles without travel time. They apply their effects to the first target in their path.\nTargeted.\n abilities apply their effects directly to the selected target. To apply the effect, there must be an unobstructed line of sight to the target, similarly to area of effect. Enemy &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt;s usually block line of sight for targeted abilities.\nMovement.\n abilities grant the hero using them a burst of movement in the forms of dashes, leaps and teleports. Abilities that only grant movement speed generally do not count as movement abilities. Movement abilities are disabled and interrupted if the hero becomes &lt;a href=\"stunned\"&gt;stunned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"knocked%20down\"&gt;knocked down&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hacked\"&gt;hacked&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rooted\"&gt;rooted&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hindered\"&gt;hindered&lt;/a&gt;, with some exceptions.\nCast types.\nChanneled.\nChanneled abilities are generally longer lasting effects that are interrupted if the hero using them is &lt;a href=\"stunned\"&gt;stunned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"knocked%20down\"&gt;knocked down&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hacked\"&gt;hacked&lt;/a&gt;at any time while they are active. Generally, channeled abilities also prevent the hero from using their &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s or other &lt;a href=\"abilities\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; while they are active. Pharah's and Roadhog's , for example, are channeled abilities.\nSome channeled abilities do, however, allow the hero to use certain abilities during them. For example, Moira can use during and Sigma can use his primary fire after the targets are lifted by . Additionally, some other mechanics may override the ability to interrupt channeled abilities, such as also making Orisa immune to stuns and knockdowns for its duration.\nTransformation.\nTransformation abilities are the opposite of &lt;a href=\"channeled\"&gt;channeled&lt;/a&gt; abilities and cannot be interrupted at all even if the user hit by crowd control effect. They only end when their duration runs out or their user is eliminated. Usually, transformation abilities modify or change the user's &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, other abilities, and/or provide other benefits (e.g. seeing through walls via ) for a period of time. Another difference between transformation abilities and channeled abilities is that transformation abilities do not restrict the use of weapons (potentially a different weapon) and/or abilities. For example, Winston's , Genji's and Ramattra's are transformation abilities.\nCast time.\nCast time abilities are a middle ground between channeled and transformation abilities. These abilities can be interrupted by crowd control effects during their startup time, but once the startup has finished, they can no longer be interrupted. L\u00facio's and Tracer's are examples of cast time abilities.\nIn general, \"cast time\" refers to a property most abilities, including channeled and transformation abilities, have which describes how long it takes to activate the ability. Cast time consists of two parts: startup and recovery. Startup refers to the time it takes for the ability to activate after the button is pressed \u2013 and during which the ability can be interrupted if it's a cast time ability \u2013 whereas recovery refers to the time before the player can use their &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quick%20melee\"&gt;quick melee&lt;/a&gt; or other abilities after the ability has finished applying its effects.\nConfirmation input.\nAbilities that deploy a stationary object may first enter a targeting interface, previewing location, allow changing the orientation and require a confirmation (default: primary fire) before they are activated by the user. The targeting can be interrupted or manually cancelled, while the actual activation of the ability cannot. The ability is not activated and will not go on cooldown or consume ultimate charge until the cast is confirmed, meaning if the targeting is interrupted or cancelled, the player can attempt to use it again immediately. Symmetra's and Mei's , for example, employ this targeting scheme."}

{"id": "93132", "revid": "48511500", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=93132", "title": "Adaptations", "text": "\"Overwatch\" was developed to lack a traditional story or campaign mode and instead Blizzard conveyed narrative elements through a transmedia storytelling method. While voice lines and map elements in \"Overwatch\" reveal some of its universe's lore, the bulk of the story surrounding its characters is told through animated short films and literary media. Character biographies and fake news reports containing story pieces have also been published on Blizzard's website. Chu remarked that Blizzard's method of storytelling with \"Overwatch\" demonstrated a \"gameplay first\" philosophy. There was also many adaptations made for the game that ties in with that.\nAdaptations.\nAnimation.\nAs part of the original game's announcement, Blizzard released an animated \"cinematic trailer\" for \"Overwatch\" on November 7, 2014. They would repeat this to announce \"Overwatch 2\", releasing the \"Zero Hour\" cinematic trailer in 2019.\nBlizzard also released animated short films to help flesh out \"the real meat\" of Overwatch's lore. These shorts employed 3D computer-generated animation, and received praise from video game journalists, with some likening their quality to those of works from Disney and Pixar. that \"Recall\", the first of these shorts, was released on March 21, 2016. It was centered around Reaper's attack on Winston at Gibraltar and Winston's following recall of former Overwatch agents. Blizzard released nine more shorts through 2018; \"Reunion\" was the last of these shorts until \"The Wastelander\" was released in 2022.\nAside from short films, Blizzard also released \"origin story\" videos for Soldier: 76 and each character added to \"Overwatch\"'s playable roster post-launch. An origin story for King's Row Uprising, a tie-in for an in-game event was also released. These origin story videos are designed to provide players with the background of new characters. Origin stories are animated in the style of motion comics and are shorter than Blizzard's 3D-animated short films.\nComics.\nFrom 2016 to 2018, Blizzard published \"Overwatch\", a 16-issue comic series, beginning with \"Trainhopper\". Some issues, such as \"Uprising\", served as tie-ins to in-game events. Motion comic versions of the series were also released, produced by Madefire Studios. These motion comics included sound effects and official music featured in-game. Originally a digital comic series, Blizzard partnered with Dark Horse Comics to publish a hardcover anthology in 2017, which collected the series' 12 issues released to that point. An expanded edition of the anthology was released in December 2021. From 2020 to 2021, Blizzard and Dark Horse published \"Tracer - London Calling\" a five-issue limited series. Written by Mariko Tamaki and illustrated by Babs Tarr, print versions of each issue were also released. Rachael Cohen and Deron Bennett served as the series' colorist and letterer, respectively. A graphic novel collecting the five issues and featuring cover art by artist Bengal was physically released on September 28, 2021.\nAnother five-issue limited series, \"New Blood\" was released from November 2021 to March 2022. Similar in style to \"London Calling\", the series followed Cassidy post-\"Zero Hour\" on his journey to recruit members to the newly revived Overwatch. Both \"London Calling\" and \"New Blood\" also served as tie-ins for in-game seasonal events.\nTelevision.\nOn 29 November 2022, It was announced that an Canadian-M\u0101ori adaptation meant for television was being produced by &lt;a href=\"Taylorfilms\"&gt;Taylorfilms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Granada%20Television\"&gt;Granada Television&lt;/a&gt; (in association with &lt;a href=\"YTV\"&gt;YTV&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; took an consultant role for the series. \nThe series' entire cast was revealed two weeks later.\nMerch.\nThe popularity of \"Overwatch\" led various companies to launch merchandise lines featuring its characters. Funko produced several figurines as part of their \"Pop!\" line. Tracer is featured prominently in Good Smile Company's merchandise, with the company distributing both Nendoroid and Figma figurines of the character. Good Smile has also featured other \"Overwatch\" characters in their lines. LEGO has also produced an \"Overwatch\" set of figurines. As part of their Rivals line, Nerf has designed \"Overwatch\"-stylized toy guns. Nerf's parent company, Hasbro, later launched a set of action figures featuring \"Overwatch\" characters."}

On her way home, Kiriko stopped to converse with her, and gifted her a Fox Spirit stuffed toy. In return, Akari gave her a Fox Spirit cap. Kiriko left, and Akari continued drawing, only to be interrupted by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Hashimoto\"&gt;Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt; enforcers. Yoshida's son owed them money, and when he told them that he didn't know where he was, they began to beat him, much to Akari's terror.\nKiriko re-entered the hallway and began to tear through the Hashimoto. As bullets and blades flew, Yoshida kept himself and Akari against the hallway wall to protect themselves, but &lt;a href=\"Pompamoto\"&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; tore Akari from his arms, intent on using her as a human shield. Yoshida tried to save her, but was caught in the crossfire. Akari wept over her grandfather, but he was healed by Kiriko. As she went full bore, both Akari and Yoshida charged the Hashimoto with her. In Akari's case, she used an axe, throwing it into the elevator that the Hashimoto had been flung into, its blade cutting through the gangster's hair.\nWith the battle ended, Akari hugged Kiriko, and thanked her for saving her grandfather.\nTrivia.\nAkari appears in the \"&lt;a href=\"Kiriko%20%28animated%20short%29\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt;\" animated short.

The time came where she reached the age where she was no longer a child, but not old enough to look after herself. It was on day at this point in her life when her mother sent her out to get some flour. Alejandra obliged, but not without making her frustration at her mother's doting on her quite clear.\nAs evening fell, she encountered her first obstacle in the form of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Muertos\"&gt;Los Muertos&lt;/a&gt; members beating up an &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;. She tried to sneak past them, but was spotted, and was 'encouraged' to take part in the beating. She tried to wriggle her way out of it, but the members weren't having it. They eventually headed off, but not without robbing her of the money her mother had given her. She ran off after them. Now night, she caught up, but discovered that someone else had found the gang as well, and was in the process of incapacitating their members. She took cover as a gunfight erupted between the gang members and the attacking them. The gang bore a hasty retreat, but not before one of them lobbed a grenade in the man's direction, the explosive coming to rest at Alejandra's feet. The man managed to shield her from the blast. Asking him why he saved her, he grimly answered that old habits died hard, and told her to head home (after returning her purse to her). She realized that the man was one of the heroes her mother told her about, even as he responded that he wasn't a hero anymore.\nWith flour and an old Overwatch poster in hand, she returned home in much better spirits, telling her mother about the night's events. She later gave testimony concerning the event, calling the vigilante a hero.\nSearching.\nLong after the Los Muertos incident, Alejandra found &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lynx%20Seventeen\"&gt;visitors&lt;/a&gt; in her mother's restaurant. The woman showed her a picture of &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, telling her that she'd done a bad thing, and that if she helped her, she'd be her 'hero.' Alejandra directed them to a warehouse that Sombra was residing in."}

{"id": "5773", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5773", "title": "Ana", "text": "Ana is a &lt;a href=\"Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 19 July 2016, she is the 22nd hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nAna's versatile arsenal allows her to affect heroes all over the battlefield. Her &lt;a href=\"Biotic%20Rifle\"&gt;Biotic Rifle&lt;/a&gt; rounds and &lt;a href=\"Biotic%20Grenade\"&gt;Biotic Grenade&lt;/a&gt;s heal allies and damage or impair enemies; her &lt;a href=\"Sleep%20Dart\"&gt;sidearm&lt;/a&gt; tranquilizes key targets, and &lt;a href=\"Nano%20Boost\"&gt;Nano Boost&lt;/a&gt; gives one of her comrades a considerable increase in power.\nStrategy.\nAna is a mid to long-range Support sniper, capable of healing at any range while also maintaining a fair level of damage output. Her Biotic Grenade lets her amplify healing effects from not only her own healing darts, but also from other Supports and environmental healing, such as Payloads and Health packs. She has a sidearm which will fire a Sleep Dart, which can render the enemy who's hit with it temporarily useless unless someone wakes them up. Nano Boost is a supportive ultimate that is used to provide strong buffs to an ally, allowing them to deal more damage while taking less damage from the enemy. She can also be an anti-healer, as her Biotic Grenade will prevent enemies hit by the blast from getting healed in any way, making her an outstanding support. Ana lacks any means of advanced mobility and only has her sidearm to protect herself, making it easy for her to be outflanked by flankers as well as other mobile heroes.\nStory.\n\"Everyone must find their cause.\"\nOne of the founding members of Overwatch, Ana uses her skills and expertise to defend her home and the people she cares for. Hailing from a long line of decorated soldiers, Ana inspired confidence and loyalty in her colleagues and endowed her daughter, Fareeha Amari \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;, with an intense sense of duty and honor. Like her daughter, she bore a tattoo of an as a symbol of protection. Likewise, her callsign in the Egyptian military during the Omnic Crisis was \"Horus.\" To this day, Ana is regarded as a hero by the Egyptian people. \nAna was regarded as one of the world's deadliest snipers, and has a high kill count. She is able to stay still for hours, waiting for the perfect shot. She originally used a &lt;a href=\"Kinamura\"&gt;Kinamura&lt;/a&gt; rifle, upon which she added a notch for every life she took. Each life weighed heavily on her conscience, and while some snipers preferred to wound targets, in order to lure out more potential targets, she preferred to perform clean kills, disliking causing needless suffering. Her right eye, originally cybernetic, made her vision six times greater than normal, to the extent where she rarely even needed to use the scope. While procedures exist that could repair her cybernetic eye, she feels comfortable with her eyepatch, seeing it as a reminder of who she is now. She continues to experience phantom pain from the eye injury. In light of her experiences, Ana now prefers to avoid taking lives when possible, in contrast to her earlier approach of never leaving an enemy alive.\nEven by her own admission, Ana is a poor cook and field dresser, having had to rarely use the latter skill. By the time she reunited with Fareeha however, her skills as a medic had significantly improved. She doesn't have much of a sense of humor.\nEarly Life.\nAna was born in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, to a long line of distinguished military veterans. From a young age, she learnt how to handle a rifle, and was an expert marksman by the time she finished high school.\nAfter graduation, Ana enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Army\"&gt;Egyptian Army&lt;/a&gt;. Two rules were drilled into her in basic\u2014\"Never hesitate and never look away,\" and \"Cover your team at all costs.\" She was taught how to do basic medical. She later became a member of the &lt;a href=\"El%27Sa%27ka%20Forces\"&gt;El'Sa'ka Forces&lt;/a&gt;. Ana's military record was spotless, and she became widely considered as one of the world's best snipers. Her right eye was replaced by a &lt;a href=\"cybernetic\"&gt;cybernetic&lt;/a&gt; implant.\nWhile at a coffee shop in Cairo, Ana met &lt;a href=\"Sam%20English\"&gt;Sam English&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; diplomat. Splitting time between &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and Canada, the two casually dated for years, but the two were often in transit. Things changed when Ana realized she was pregnant. The two married, and they settled down in Cairo. Ana gave birth to a daughter, &lt;a href=\"Fareeha%20Amari\"&gt;Fareeha&lt;/a&gt;.\nOmnic Crisis.\nRecruitment.\nSix years after Fareeha's birth, the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began. As the war inflicted a heavy toll on &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, the country's depleted and undermanned security forces relied on elite snipers for support, Ana among them. Her aim was impeccable, her steady aim legendary, and rumors held that she swayed more than one battle against the omnics singlehandedly\u2014whatever the truth of that claim, the &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Archive\"&gt;Zurich Archive&lt;/a&gt; did confirm that Ana's service with El-Sa'ka did prevent many battles from turning into tragedies. She became a symbol for soldiers around the globe\u2014proof that hard work, dedication, and talent could still prevail against the omnics. \nHer superior marksmanship, decision-making, and instincts made her a natural selection to join the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; strike team, of which she was one of the founding members. The decision to choose Ana was shaped by politics\u2014the first two members of the team, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, were both American, which led to accusations against &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt; and her team of having made secret concessions to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, along with similar accusations of favoratism. On the other hand, Ana's unaugmented state (her cybernetic eye notwithstanding) would be good for public relations, not to mention that she was already admired due to service with El'Sa'ka.\nStill, her recruitment was not without its critics. Some seized on her gender and nationality, claiming that she was being tokenized to hide the American exceptionilism that some claimed was at the heart of Overwatch. Adawe eviscerated Amari's critics, and the UN approved Amari as the strike team's third member.\nInside Egypt, Ana's recruitment was similarly contentious. While her colleagues were ecstatic, her superiors fought tooth and nail against her recruitment, viewing it as a plunder of Egypt's manpower. They claimed that Amari was worth at least ten snipers in the field, and yet, the UN was not sending any replacements. Despite this, the government's commitment to Overwatch was greater than that of its military, and Ana was assigned to Overwatch to commence training. She reached the rank of captain, and was third-in-command after Morrison and Reyes.\nNight Ops.\nWhile in the field with the rest of the strike team, Ana and her comrades spent weeks repelling nonstop &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; attacks. During the first few nights of combat, Ana didn't sleep. The others fell asleep easily, but she had to figure out how to quiet the fear. She realized that the time between explosions was an indicator as to how many omnics there were, and how far away they were. Through this, she was able to work out their attack patterns. After weeks of combat, the machines fell silent, apparently regrouping.\nFrom inside a &lt;a href=\"St%C3%A5lt%C3%A4cke%20tent\"&gt;St\u00e5lt\u00e4cke tent&lt;/a&gt;, she conversed with her daughter, offering her reassurance. Their conversation was broken by an explosion. Fareeha asked if the omnics were going to attack where she was, and Ana silently resolved that her daughter would never feel fear like this again. She left the tent to join the night raid being led by &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;. \nOther Battles.\nWhile a member of Overwatch during the Crisis, Ana mentored many other agents and successfully led multiple missions. During the conflict, Ana was present in the battle at &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. \nEnd of the War.\nOverwatch successfully ended the war. After the Omnic Crisis, Ana took part in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20White%20Dome\"&gt;Operation White Dome&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-Crisis.\nFollowing the success of Overwatch's original mission, Ana served for many years as Strike Commander &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;'s second-in-command. She raised her daughter, Fareeha, during this time, instructing her in martial arts. Despite her responsibilities in leading the organization, Ana refused to step away from combat operations. She was aware of her daughter's desire to join Overwatch herself, but Ana was against it. This led to a strained relationship between mother and daughter. At some point, Fareeha asked for a toy rifle, but Ana refused, telling her daughter that she'd shoot her eye out. She later came to regret her comments. Similarly, she eventually came to regret dissuading Fareeha from joining Overwatch. \nAna was considered one of the 'poster figures' for Overwatch. Her place was plastered on recruitment posters, she had a corresponding character in the \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28cartoon%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" cartoon, and she received numerous letters from people who had been saved by the peacekeeping agency.\nAna was responsible for the assassination of the Vikosky kingpins. At a range of 300 meters, she fired once, and both fell. Years later, Ana derived no satisfaction from her double-kill.\nSix years after the Omnic Crisis, Ana and Morrison worked together in &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad\"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt;. He let her eat some kebabs that didn't digest well.\nAna remained on active duty well into her fifties, and was stationed at at some point. She and &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; once danced in the base's command center until dawn.\nAna was present when Reyes brought in former outlaw &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt; into the organization. She surmised that McCree had great instincts, talent, the ability to remain cool under fire, and was highly adaptable. She could tell that McCree had felt trapped by the life he'd previously been living.\nAt some point in time, Ana met the wife of fellow agent &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A9rard%20Lacroix\"&gt;G\u00e9rard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Am\u00e9lie Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;. Two weeks after Am\u00e9lie was rescued by Overwatch from being kidnapped, G\u00e9rard was killed and Am\u00e9lie was believed to have been kidnapped once again.\nAna was among those who helped take out the &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; Project. However, she could come to regret Overwatch's actions, given the adverse effects it had on Egypt.\nAt some point, Ana worked in &lt;a href=\"Zurich\"&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt; for a number of years, but she never thought of it as home. For Ana, Cairo would always be her home.\nWhen Fareeha was fourteen, she and her mother argued about Fareeha joining Overwatch. While Fareeha gave her reasons, Ana wasn't really listening\u2014in hindsight, she would later realize that part of her daughter's desire to join the organization was to strengthen her connection with her mother, but at the time, she didn't notice. She wanted a better life for her daughter, and told Fareeha that she could find a new dream. That she'd given everything so that she wouldn't have to fight. The argument was so bad that the two didn't speak for the next two months, and Fareeha never again brought up her dreams of joining Overwatch in her mother's presence.\nUprising.\nSeven years before the present day, the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt; occurred. Alongside Morrison and Reyes, Ana listened to McCree, who was on the ground in &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;, observing &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s actions. Ana asked Reyes what McCree was doing in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, since &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; operations were suspended. Reyes evaded answering the question. To Ana's frustration, the prime minister still refused to allow Overwatch to intervene. In conversation with Morrison, Ana admitted wanting to do something, but while Morrison shared that desire, Overwatch had come under unfavorable scrutiny recently, and they could ill afford another public relations nightmare.\nMorrison relented, and sent agents &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt; to end the crisis. Ana gave status updates to the four agents.\nFinal Mission.\nAna's last mission was an anti-&lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; operation conducted by Overwatch in &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;; part of a force led by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; which rescued a number of scientists that Talon had taken hostage. While Overwatch was successful in this regard, the Talon operative known as &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; was able to take out a number of agents. The operation led to a sniper duel between her and Ana, as they made their way throughout the urban terrain. Ana was able to temporarily incapacitate Widowmaker, hitting her in her helmet. But upon seeing Widowmaker's face, she froze, recognizing her as Am\u00e9lie. It was all the time Widowmaker needed to take her own shot, shooting Ana through the scope of her rifle and into her cybernetic eye. It was believed that the shot killed her.\nTreatment.\nIn truth, Ana survived that encounter, despite being gravely wounded and the destruction of her cybernetic eye. The world believed that she was dead, and she was given full honors posthumously. Ana spent years in a coma, and was treated under the Polish generic \"Janina Kowalski\" by Dr. &lt;a href=\"Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs Ana's memory returned, she requested that Lee retain her anonymity. Lee obliged, and Ana was kept out of the system, which helped ensure that Overwatch failed to find her. During her months-long recovery, she was able to recall the details of the mission. She even let her daughter believe that she was dead, as she reasoned that Fareeha would expect \"Captain Amari\" to return home. However, with that moment of hesitation in her sniper duel with Widowmaker, she realized that she changed. Years later however, she'd come to regret her decision to leave Fareeha in the dark. \nInterlude.\nWrestling with the weight of a life spent in combat, Ana chose to stay out of the world's growing conflicts. She heard about the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;Overwatch Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; and the supposed death of Jack Morrison. However, she had her doubts as to whether he'd actually died.\nDuring her travels, Ana passed through &lt;a href=\"Junkertown\"&gt;Junkertown&lt;/a&gt; \"once or twice.\" In one of her visits, she encountered &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ned\"&gt;Red Ned&lt;/a&gt;, whom she kicked into a wicker basket. Ana claimed that he'd started the altercation.\nAna ended up returning to &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. She'd originally planned to live quietly, so that she could be near her daughter. However, the longer she lived here, the more she realized that Overwatch was responsible for the problems plaguing Cairo. As time passed, she realized she could not sit on the sidelines while people threatened her city and the innocents around her. Thus, Ana rejoined the fight to protect her country from the forces that would destabilize it, and most importantly, to keep her family and her closest allies safe. She wrote letters to her daughter, explaining her absence. However, she never received a response.\nRecall.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; sent out a recall order for Overwatch agents, Ana intercepted the transmission.\nShrike.\nContinuing her fight for justice, Ana operated under the alias of \"Shrike,\" and was wanted for espionage, assault, and theft in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. She used the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; as her base of operations, and took care of the relics she found there before sending them to Dr. &lt;a href=\"Hamid%20Faisal\"&gt;Hamid Faisal&lt;/a&gt;. She had come back to Egypt in part due to her guilt over the fallout of the &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; project. Disguised as a masked bounty hunter, Ana sabotaged several &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; operations in Egypt, drawing attention from &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; and his associate &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Hakim\"&gt;Abdul Hakim&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, still alive despite his supposed death years ago. After days of lying in wait, she caught sight of Hakim in one of his palaces. The conflict came to a head when Ana and Morrison were lured into a trap at Hakim's compound in Giza, leading to a battle between the three former comrades. Though Ana sided with Jack and forced Reaper to retreat after unmasking him, she was disturbed by his visage and parting words, reminding her that Overwatch had been responsible for their suffering. Following the encounter Ana explained that she cared about Jack, not the war he was fighting, and resolved to watch over him as the two departed.\nBastet.\nAna was left with the realization that Jack and Reyes were actually alive. Still, living or not, Jack had been wounded by Reyes. Hearing the sound of &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20National%20Police\"&gt;police sirens&lt;/a&gt;, they went to ground, staying out of sight. Still suffering from his wounds, Jack passed out, forcing Ana to take him to her base in the Necropolis. She gave him tea after he woke up. The wound was still giving him trouble, despite his enhanced healing abilities. Ana suggested that they contact Dr. &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, but Jack refused. The two discussed their pasts and their objectives\u2014Jack was going after Reaper and Talon. However, he needed her help. Ana told him to rest first, and despite Jack's protestations, he passed out\u2014Ana had drugged the tea.\nJack was out for two days, over which Ana spent time gathering supplies. She explained her motivations for her actions in Egypt, but claimed that Jack's crusade against Talon was based on revenge. The two disagreed on how to approach things, with Jack focusing on the larger threat of Talon, while Ana wanted to focus on Cairo. Jack gave up and stormed out, leaving Ana alone to use his computer. She could see that Jack had been tracing Reaper's movements. Jack returned later in the night, and made a deal\u2014he'd help Ana capture Hakim. After that, they'd go after Reaper. Ana accepted under the condition that they also apprehend Hakim's associates. Jack agreed. They were still in Egypt during Christmas.\nWithin a week, they'd rounded up a number of Hakim's associates, whittling away at his organization. After the initial burst, Hakim went to ground, turning their hunt into a waiting game. On stakeout, they finally caught sight of Hakim, at which point Ana took out her Bastet mask. She explained that Jack's Soldier: 76 persona had inspired her. As \"Bastet,\" she wouldn't be a hunter, but a protector.\nA week later, Hakim had been captured and his organization dismantled. Ana's actions as \"Bastet\" had caught the attention of Egypt's media, and even forced the government to act. At the Necropolis, Ana stated that she'd leave most of the items she'd collected behind, that they'd stay here until she found a caretaker. Jack asked her about Fareeha, pointing out that it would be awhile before they were in Egypt again. Ana gingerly replied that she'd left a message. Jack told her that Fareeha would come around in time. The two left the Necropolis, Ana still carrying her Bastet mask.\nValkyrie.\nMorrison was still suffering from the gunshot wounds he'd suffered from Reaper, so the two of them were forced to visit &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, currently based in Cairo. Ana made herself at home while Ziegler treated Morrison. That night, an explosion rocked Cairo\u2014Talon had attacked the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Temple of Anubis&lt;/a&gt; facility. Ziegler told them that &lt;a href=\"HSI\"&gt;HSI&lt;/a&gt; would get it under control, but Morrison simply replied \"it's Talon.\" Ana, taking a more diplomatic approach, pointed out that there were people caught in the crossfire, and that they'd need help. Ziegler relented, and flew overhead as Ana and Morrison made their way through Cairo's streets to the site.\nAna and Morrison engaged in a firefight with the Talon soldiers. During the battle, Morrison caught sight of Reaper. Over the radio, Ziegler told him that Reaper wasn't their concern, that they had people to save, but Morrison wasn't listening. He headed into the smokey haze that covered the site, with Ana warily covering his back. They later found Ziegler, helping her and the children she'd helped rescue from the rubble.\nThe next day, they met up with Ziegler again\u2014they planned to pursue Reaper into Europe. Morrison asked if Ziegler would join them, but Ziegler refused, stating that her place was in Cairo. Ana and Ziegler discussed their respective choices post-Overwatch, including the matter of the recall that &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; had sent out, but she followed Morrison in his pursuit.\nNew Blood.\nAna remained uncertain about Winston's recall order, but decided to help her comrades from the shadows.\nReunion with McCree.\nAna sent &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt; a note, simply written \"charmer. Time to talk,\" followed by coordinates. Ana knew that McCree had survived the fall of Overwatch, and had returned as a gunslinger for hire. She also knew that a returned Overwatch would need new blood, and worried that a return of the old guard would poison Overwatch's return.\nMcCree arrived in Cairo, finding Ana in a restaurant, and revealed that he knew that she was the one who'd sent the note. The pair talked long into the night, reliving old times, before the subject of Winston's recall order came up. McCree was mum as to whether he would head back. Ana, however, explained that Talon was hunting ex-Overwatch agents, and that it had attacked . She opined that maybe it was time for her generation to move on. McCree suggested that a reformed Overwatch would need leaders like her, but Ana grimly asked if he wanted to relive the past. She revealed that she'd called McCree here instead of chatting online because she wanted to see him face-to-face. Maybe for the last time. \nTheir reunion was cut short as they were attacked by Talon troopers. They fought their way through the market, and McCree noticed that Ana was knocking the troopers out rather than killing them. Odd, for a woman who'd previously never left an enemy alive. Ana commented that a lot could change over the years, and that she'd done more than enough killing.\nAna took McCree to one of her hideouts, and gave him a USB containing data on the threats she'd been monitoring, along with a number of individuals she'd been tracking\u2014&lt;a href=\"Hana%20Song\"&gt;Hana Song&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aleksandra%20Zaryanova\"&gt;Aleksandra Zaryanova&lt;/a&gt;, and her own daughter, &lt;a href=\"Fareeha%20Amari\"&gt;Fareeha Amari&lt;/a&gt;. Each of them were fighting their own battles, and she wanted McCree to find them, and lead them, as a cohesive force. McCree commented that if he did this, he'd be leaving behind what Overwatch was. What \"he\" was. Smiling, Ana told him that that was a good thing. It was good to learn from the past, but it should be left there.\nAgreeing to the mission, McCree took the USB and headed off to track the targets.\nReunion with Fareeha.\nMcCree, by this point going by his original name of \"Cassidy,\" first tracked down Fareeha, and brought her to see her mother. The two had an awkward reunion\u2014she mentioned the letters she had written, but Fareeha said that if Ana had anything to say, she could say it directly.\nThe reunion was interupted by a Talon ambush. Fareeha took to the sky, while Cassidy and Ana fled on the ground. Ana ordered that Fareeha lure their attacers out into the open. Cassidy was unsure, but Fareeha recognized her mother's plan\u2014more of the Talon forces would come, and they could wipe out the cell in a single strike. It worked to a point, as Fareeha was able to unleash a rocket barage that wiped out their attackers, but not before being wounded.\nAna rushed over to her daughter and treated her wounds, despite her protests. She explained her regrets about the lives she'd taken, and how she now refused to kill. But of all her regrets, the greatest was steering her daughter away from the life she'd wanted. Fareeha told her that she couldn't take it back, to which Ana agreed. But perhaps she could set some things right. She told Fareeha that the world had suffered for her mistakes, and needed heroes again. Fareeha needed a team that would help her achieve her full potential. She couldn't find that with HSI. But she could with Cassidy, if she went with him.\nFareeha refused, preferring to remain with HSI, at least for now. She gave her mother a final goodbye, hugging her, and whispering, \"it's good to see you again. I wasn't sure I'd ever get the chance.\" After that, she flew off. Cassidy told Ana that her cover was blown given the carnage they'd unleashed in Cairo, and asked if she needed help getting settled. Ana was barely listening, as she watched her daughter fly off into the night sky, and Cassidy realized that she'd be okay. When she asked him where he'd head next, he responded that he had his eye on someone up north, and departed.\nHunting Talon.\nHer reunion with her daughter complete, Ana departed with Morrison. They travelled the globe, hunting down Talon agents. Talon attempted to hunt them down in turn, attacking the pair in &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;. Ana yearned to hear any news about Fareeha, and while she and Morrison were passing through a ruined diner, they saw a report on Null Sector's attack on &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;, and saw footage of Fareeha and Cassidy. While Null Sector's invasion was global, Ana took some comfort in seeing her daughter alive and finally part of Overwatch.\nLost Ghosts.\nDuring their hunt, Morrison received word from an &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;informant&lt;/a&gt; that promised something to prove the quality of their intel. To this end, they entered &lt;a href=\"Zurich\"&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;. While not the first time they'd visited the city, they'd arrived this time to find it devastated by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;, which had attacked the city a week prior. From a rooftop, Ana saw a &lt;a href=\"Red\"&gt;red-haired woman&lt;/a&gt; in the streets below surrounded by warbots. She dispatched the warbots from her vantage point, and the woman fled into the night. Morrison assured Ana that the woman would be fine.\nWhile still mum about the nature of his informant, Morrison told Ana that according to the informant's intel, Talon was carrying out an assasination that night. When pressed, he explained that his informant hadn't given him the name of the target, but left it somewhere for them to find. Ana suspected that meant a trap, and refused to take another step until Morrison told her where they were going. Morrison explained that the intel couldn't risk being transmitted, hence it had been left at a drop point.\nThe two arrived a mausoleum where they searched for the burial chamber that had the encrypted data drive. Morrison searched for the drive while Ana remained on overwatch. There, she saw a Null Sector squadron moving in on their position. The two took out the attacking warbots, but Morrison was wounded. Ana injected him with nanobiotics, and the two waited for Morrison to heal. He revealed that the data drive had given him an address and time. Ana was still wary, but Morrison pointed out that they'd trusted the source up to this point, and at the least, he wanted to stop the hit from occurring.\nBy the time they arrived at their destination, the sun had long set. They entered Zurich's suburbs where Null Sector had yet to reach, though a shelter-in-place order was keeping civilians off the streets. Ana still suspected that Morrison was keeping something from her. He ordered her to take a vantage point while he scouted the streets below. He pinpointed a glass house where the target apparently resided. Through her vantage point, Ana could see a woman and child in the house's living room. She saw Talon troopers in the yard, and ordered Morrison to get inside fast while she kept him informed as to the troopers' locations.\nAna was forced to open fire herself as the situation escalated. She realized that the woman in the house was &lt;a href=\"Mirembe\"&gt;Mirembe&lt;/a&gt;. With around twenty Talon troopers still active, Ana was forced to enter the house, and reunited with Mirembe. The three former Overwatch agents worked together to clear out the Talon troopers, and Mirembe was reunited with her &lt;a href=\"Kweku\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;, who she'd placed in a panic room. The local authorities were alerted, and Ana and Jack led Mirembe and her son out of the house. As Mirembe and her son left with the security detail, Ana realized that Mirembe knew more than she was letting on. That she'd sussed out that Ana and Morrison were working with intelligence that had allowed them to be at the right place at the right time.\nAfter Miremble's departure, Ana told Morrison to come clean, as she knew there was still information he was withholding. He told her that the data drive gave the user a secure backdoor to Talon's project files. He'd asked for proof, and Mirembe's was the first name on the assassination schedule. He explained that due to Talon's attack on two years ago, the organization had a nearly complete list of Overwatch agents, and had been carrying out assassinations ever since. While Ana was aware of the rumor, Morrison's words confirmed it.\nAna suggested they join Winston's reformed Overwatch unit but Morrison refused, explaining that it would arouse further suspicion if he joined a larger organization. She ordered Morrison to give her the drive, and he obliged, allowing her to download the data pertaining to Overwatch members on Talon's hit list. She gave the drive back to him and the two parted ways, as Morrison continued his war against Talon. In the silence of the night, Ana reflected that the world would always need saving. She set out to protect the people on Talon's hit list. To protect them from afar.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nAna was the first hero added to the game after its launch. Blizzard began with the knowledge that they needed another healer, since &lt;a href=\"Lucio\"&gt;Lucio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt; were showing up in every game. A concept was the Alchemist, a character who could drink from a decanter and then jump really high, or provide an extra-long heal over time. Meanwhile, the team were struggling to place the personality of Ana, which they\u2019d conceived independently. Her backstory positioned her as a crack sniper, but the game already had &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;. It was thus decided that the hero would be both a healer and a crack shot, using her rifle both offensively and defensively. The Alchemist concept was phased out within a few weeks. Influences for Ana's visual design were post-apocalyptic themes and imagery. The designers wanted to show her as someone who was rugged and resourceful, living on the edges of society. Her \"Wasteland\" skin is based entirely around this idea. Strap, pipe, and cannister designs in the skin were used to emphasize a character that was scrounging anything she could to survive.\nPrior to being revealed, it was widely speculated that Ana and [[Sombra]] were the same character, resulting from the photographs of her Shrike mask being misidentified as Sombra.\n[[File:Ana Wasteland and Captain Amari skin concept arts.jpg|thumb|Ana Wasteland and Captain Amari skin concept arts]]\nSeveral PR assets on Blizzard's press center website for Ana are labeled \"Shrike\" instead of \"Ana\", suggesting that her placeholder name during development was Shrike. The name Shrike was used for one of her epic skins, in which she wears a mask previously seen in pre-release easter eggs.\nAna was teased on [[Temple of Anubis]], with an opened document picturing her wearing her Shrike mask. Her scope could be seen being worked on in a GameSpot video. Also in the video was an early prototype with a modified Widowmaker model seen in the character selection screen, in the support section.\nAna was added to the PTR on July 12, 2016. She was added to the live PC version of the game on July 19, 2016.\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Ana| ]]\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Overwatch members|Amari, Ana]]\n[[Category:Egyptian characters]]\n[[Category:Cyborgs]]"}

Antonio Giordani, was a corrupt businessman, arms smuggler, and high-level player in &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;, operating out of &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nStory.\nAntonio was under surveillance by &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt;, wanted in connection with the operation of several smuggling operations focused on weapons proliferation throughout Europe. The extent of his connections to European government officials, law enforcement agents, and businessmen was unknown.\nRetribution.\nEight years before the present day, Antonio organized an attack against &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, Norway. In response, &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A9rard%20Lacroix\"&gt;G\u00e9rard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt; established a &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; facility in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; as part of an operation to bring him down. However, an undercover Talon agent planted a bomb in the facility in an attempt to assassinate Lacroix; though Lacroix would survive the attack, dozens of Blackwatch agents were killed. Shortly after, &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; sought retribution for the incident, deploying himself, &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genji%20Shimada\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20O%27Deorain\"&gt;Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt; on a mission to capture and interrogate Antonio.\nOnce the agents broke into his office, Antonio stated that even if they captured him, his \"friends\" in government would have him out in less than a week. Reyes responded that Antonio was right and shot him, killing Antonio and sending his body flying through a window. In response, Antonio's manor went on lockdown, and the four agents had to fight their way out.\nIn the aftermath of the assassination, power shifted within the Talon organization, allowing newcomers like &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akande%20Ogundimu\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt; to rise through the ranks and fill the power vacuum. The incident also marked the start of Overwatch's decline, leading to its eventual disbandment."}

{"id": "5762", "revid": "44564686", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5762", "title": "Anubis", "text": "Anubis is a &lt;a href=\"god%20program\"&gt;god program&lt;/a&gt; and instigator of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. \nStory.\nAs an AI, Anubis doesn't feel emotion.\nPre-Crisis.\nAnubis was designed for conservation purposes. Constructed in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, Anubis was named after the Egyptian god of death. This was intended as a sly acknowledgement of the fact that Anubis was made to bring life to the world. Anubis would not only oversee conservation efforts, but would also identify areas that could be cultivated and farmed to meet the growing needs of humanity without disturbing what remained of the world's wilderness. The writers of the &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Archive\"&gt;Zurich Archive&lt;/a&gt; would later opine that Anubis had been given the most difficult task of the god programs, as global temperatures and the human population both continued to rise. Like many researchers who worked with the larger god programs, Anubis's support team anthropomorphized it, even considering it a friend and colleague as much as a resource.\nDespite this, Anubis, and god programs like it, were arguably underutilized when it came to Earth's ecological issues. Some were concerned that the god programs would designate winners and losers when it came to solving the crisis, and public opinion held that as human ingenuity had caused the climate crisis, human ingenuity would solve it. As Anubis observed humanity's bickering, it formed a view that humanity itself was the greatest threat to its objective of ecological conservation. \nA Shift of Priorities.\nBy Anubis's calculus, it could not achieve its goals without the eradication of humanity. Exactly what caused this shift was, and remains, a mystery, even decades after the Omnic Crisis. The writers of the &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Archive\"&gt;Zurich Archive&lt;/a&gt; provided one possible explanation however; in the same year the Omnic Crisis began, climate conferences were held that resulted in further inaction on the subject. Two weeks after the incident, a ventilation accident in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Anubis facility&lt;/a&gt; occurred that shut down the air circulation in the programming team's offices for a day, killing them. It would take months to locate programmers and experts with the required skill to support Anubis as its prior team had, and as such, Anubis was left alone for months. While this was officially ruled an accident at the time, many have pointed out that the accident was closely timed with Anubis's seizure of the &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhether Anubis engineered the accident or not, what is clear that over the following months, Anubis's descent was rapid. It had already reached the conclusion that saving humanity and the natural world were mutually exclusive objectives, and without a programming team, there was no-one to guide its actions. It thus reacted without human oversight, albeit still within its programming. Divorced from human oversight, Anubis planned its war of extermination. To this end, it hijacked the defunct &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Omnica%20Corp\"&gt;Omnica Corp&lt;/a&gt; by using the company's &lt;a href=\"XH1F%20telecommunications%20system\"&gt;XH1F telecommunications system&lt;/a&gt;, and began to create &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;warbots&lt;/a&gt; of its own design, such as the &lt;a href=\"R-7000\"&gt;R-7000&lt;/a&gt;. This process went on for months (at the very least) before the first shots of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; were fired.\nThe Omnic Crisis.\nAnubis assumed direct control over all the world's omnics, using them to attack their human owners. Two weeks after the war's start, Anubis's militarized legions began marching out of the omniums. In the initial months of the war, Anubis's role as the omnics' driving force was unknown to humanity. It acted as a 'puppeteer', taking in the information sent to it by the millions of &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s deployed in the field, and giving orders. This allowed the omnics to adapt to human tactics rapidly, doing so on a global, unified scale. \nAt some point before or during the Crisis, Anubis created at least one omnium of its own design.\nAnubis's presence was first detected by &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt; (on advice from &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Chase\"&gt;Vivian Chase&lt;/a&gt;) during the first few months of the war. They realized that if the 'puppetmaster' was shut down, the war could be ended. After the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20omnium\"&gt;Detroit omnium&lt;/a&gt; was shut down, &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; was assigned to track down the entity.\nWhile Anubis's existence became known to humanity, this didn't change the facts on the ground. Whatever strategy humanity used, Anubis was able to counter. However, Anubis's hold on omnickind was broken by &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;, who bequeathed every omnic on Earth sentience at the cost of her own existence. While some omnics remained loyal to Anubis, others lay down their weapons or allied with the humans Anubis had forced them to fight. Anubis's forces began to crumble, and in a series of raids, Overwatch destroyed Anubis's command and control protocols. In what would be the last major op of the war, Overwatch stormed Anubis's &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, rendering the god program inert, and by extension, its armies. Months later, the war was over.\nPost-Crisis.\nAfter the war, Anubis and other god programs were quarantined by Overwatch. The program was shut down about five years before Overwatch's disbandment. This had an adverse impact on &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. After Overwatch's disbandment, security over its facility was contracted to &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt;. Over the decades since the Omnic Crisis, teams continued to comb through Anubis-related data, trying to find out what had caused it to turn against its human creators.\nDuring that time, Anubis broke its containment, took control of &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s in the facility and started breaching Helix firewalls. Once the security was breached, it could become capable of corrupting infrastructure and launching military assaults. In response, HSI sent a team of engineers to regain control of the command center. After the team failed, a small military squad lead by captain &lt;a href=\"Khalil\"&gt;Khalil&lt;/a&gt; was sent to deal with the AI. Anubis sent waves of robots against the team, managed to corrupt an &lt;a href=\"Okoro\"&gt;omnic soldier&lt;/a&gt; within their ranks and kill their captain. Eventually, however, thanks to &lt;a href=\"Tariq\"&gt;Tariq&lt;/a&gt;'s plan, the team succeeded in incapacitating Anubis."}

We\u2019ve decided to fool around with a few hero changes for this experimental card.\n\"We\u2019ve received feedback that Ana players don\u2019t often see the immediate impact of their ult since it\u2019s usually used on Genji and Winston who immediately jump out of range. With this change, Ana can also enjoy the fruits of her labor with powered up darts and damage reduction.\"\n\"Point blank Coach Gun to the face now matches expectations more closely.\"\n\"Slightly-Less-Mortality Field just doesn't have the same ring to it, but we can experiment. Maybe the device should be immortal so we can get by on a technicality.\"\n\"Bastion still turns into a tank but is no longer tank-sized. We've also tightened up a few screws on his gun arm and the weapon spread just went away! Less beep-boop by volume, more pew-pew.\"\n\"We've heard players get very excited about all things crowd control, so now with this sweet combo you can potentially up the stun time or I guess use it for mobility (ugh, boring).\"\n\"The enemy team will often disrespectfully ignore pilot D.Va. It will now be more difficult to survive a mech being dropped on top of you.\"\n\"And they say he could level a skyscraper. It's really put a lot of creative restrictions on our skyscraper-themed hero ideas. This change should also address the issue of some Doomfist players occasionally touching the ground.\"\n\"Echo players are actually some of the most helpful people around. They're always saying things like, \"here let me show you how it's done\". This change should enable players to be more helpful to each other in-game.\"\n\"Unconfirmed rumor: Genji's cybernetics are actually fueled by the blood of his fallen foes.\"\n\"Just scatter them around wherever you like and then claim that you totally lined that one up if it eliminates someone.\"\n\"Players weren't spending enough time admiring the beautiful floor textures so we're enabling Junkrat to place a few more hazards about. Discovery is a very powerful and exciting motivator so now there will potentially be even more surprises lurking beneath the ground.\"\n\"Tinnitus is not a joke. Don't let it happen to you.\"\n\"Bullets work strangely in the future. As do tumbleweeds.\"\n\"An Ice Wall is literally a physical barrier. But Mei can also do a lot of damage. Can't you see this endless conflict is tearing us apart?\"\n\"Now would be a poor time to underestimate the surprising amount of damage Mercy's Caduceus Blaster can do. There is no escape. I am sorry.\"\n\"There's certainly a desire to get in close and deal some damage when playing Moira so we'll lean into that but also pull in the opposite direction by incentivizing actually healing allies. steepled-fingers-maniacal-scheming intensifies\"\n\"Orisa is still learning to take full advantage of her quadruped locomotion. We expect this gameplay change will help deepen players' connection to the hero while roleplaying as a nascent, centaur-like omnic entrusted with becoming the protector of Numbani.\"\n\"We're nerfing Barrage so that it will now on average result in one less player death.\"\n\"Recent studies have concluded that incorporeal specters, such as wraiths, are more intimidating whilst airborne.\"\n\"The user manual for Crusader armor states that precision German engineering does not require changing steering fluid as a part of regularly scheduled maintenance; please do so at your own discretion.\"\n\"Alternatively, the new cooldown for Chain Hook is 4 seconds, but missing with the hook demoralizes Roadhog enough that he can't muster the enthusiasm to try again so soon, doubling the cooldown time.\"\n\"The Experimental Barrier was heavier than expected. Putting it aside has enabled Sigma to no longer be anchored so near to the ground.\"\n\"So, it turns out that aiming for the head is the superior tactical choice.\"\n\"REDACTED\"\n\"Symmetra's Photon Projector now projects photons further.\"\n\"While Torbj\u00f6rn does have a Rivet gun, his true mastery is revealed with hammer in hand. He\u2019s much better at fixing turrets with it than people though.\"\n\"It doesn't matter if you didn't have any Blink charges 3 seconds ago, they all come back! The logic of time travel is not to be questioned.\"\n\"Lower health means we can give her more damage, right?\"\n\"Winston's Primal Rage offensive power wasn't quite living up to our lofty expectations of a genetically modified space-ape, so we're giving it a small nudge. Winston also has a soft spot for his inventions, so If you thought breaking his glasses made him upset\u2026\"\n\"Both Wrecking Ball's mobility and survivability were often being called into question. Were these tuning values right for the game? I suppose we could buff them if we have to.\"\n\"Zarya is no longer burdened by evenly distributing her barriers between herself and her teammates. She is now empowered to selfishly hoard both of them for the greater good or selflessly give them all away.\"\n\"There may actually be no limit to Zenyatta's power, but he demonstrates great discipline in his moderation. He enters and leaves the meta at will.\""}

Up to two players can be selected with this feature. If you use the \u201cAvoid as Teammate\u201d option on a player, the matchmaker will no longer place you on a team with the avoided player for one week.\"\nReport Menu.\n\"Developer Comments: Due to player confusion about the most appropriate category to report players for poor or toxic gameplay, we are removing the Poor Teamwork option from the reporting system. Players should instead use the Gameplay Sabotage option when players actively harass or disrupt their own team with game mechanics or their actions. Players should not be reported simply for performing poorly, since everyone occasionally has a bad game.\"\nHERO UPDATES.\n\"D.Va\u2019s burst potential is a bit too high, so we\u2019re reducing the damage of her Micro Missiles and Boosters impact. Prior to this change, each missile dealt 3 impact damage and 6 explosive damage. We\u2019re reducing explosive damage from 6 to 4 but leaving the impact damage the same, the net result being 21% damage reduction.\"\n\"This change helps Mei combat multiple targets that are clumped up and makes it easier for her to keep freezing a specific target if another enemy gets in the way. This change also helps her ultimate more consistently freeze enemy targets, especially if they are near each other. Note: While her shots now pierce enemies, they still do not pierce barriers such as Reinhardt\u2019s shield.\"\n\"These changes help Reaper use Wraith Form more consistently as an escape, but they also open up new options, such as chasing down key targets.\"\n\"Due to issues with visibility, we have made most of Moira\u2019s visual effects fade away the closer they are to the camera. We have also made modifications to Coalescence to greatly increase the ability for foes and allies alike to see through it when facing it.\"\n\"Zenyatta is meant to be able to deal a lot of damage, especially for a support, but his alternate fire burst damage was a bit too high. This change keeps the overall damage the same but lowers the DPS slightly and makes it harder to hit multiple shots at very long ranges.\""}

Minor optimizations for large groups improving matchmaking quality.\nCompetitive Updates.\nTop 500 Leaderboard Eligibility.\nPlayers will now be required to win 25 Competitive matches before being eligible to enter the Top 500 leaderboard for a specific role, queue, or region.\nCompetitive Leaver Penalty Changes.\nMatches left in different Competitive queues are still considered separate for purposes of determining the lengths of suspensions or receiving a seasonal ban from Competitive Play.\nThe start of a new Competitive season also no longer fully resets the severity of these suspensions and bans. This should hopefully prevent players from leaving Competitive games at the end of a season without facing meaningful consequences at the start of the next.\nMatches left in Competitive Play will also have a more negative effect on a player\u2019s Skill Tier and Division after a 5-win Competitive Update.\nCompetitive Point Reward Changes.\nThe number of Competitive Points (CP) rewarded for a win in Competitive Play has been changed from 15 to 25. The number of Competitive Points earned from seasonal challenges based on your final seasonal rank has also been updated. Games played after your last Competitive Update during a season will still count towards your final seasonal rank. You must still compete in the season\u2019s Competitive Play Qualification challenge to receive bonus Competitive Points.\nCompetitive Challenge Titles.\nSeasonal Competitive titles earned from challenges now distinguish between whether they are earned in Open Queue or Role Queue. For example:\nCompetitive Match Rank.\nThe initial loading screen that shows all the participants of Competitive matches will now show an icon at the top of the screen representing the average Skill Tier and Division of all players in that match. This should provide players with a better comparison of their own rank to other players in the match.\nSeasonal Rank Decay Removed.\nStarting with Season Four, a player\u2019s Competitive Play rank will no longer be reduced at the beginning of a season. Furthermore, the effects of this reduction of rank from previous seasons will also be removed. Depending on how many games they played during the previous season, most players will see their skill tier and division increase. A player\u2019s skill tier and division at the beginning of Season 4 will now closely match the matchmaker\u2019s estimate of your current skill.\nCompetitive Skill Update and Progression.\nBoth the Competitive progress and Competitive update screens will now include information about a player\u2019s losses and ties as well as their wins.\nThe Competitive Update screen will also now provide players with an indication of their current percentage progress within a skill division. This will hopefully make it more clear how the results of games played during the update affect a player\u2019s Skill Tier and Division.\nIt is possible for players to have a positive win/loss record, but not go up a skill division because the progress occurs entirely within a single division. This new message will allow players to see that they did in fact make positive progress, just not enough to reach a new skill tier or division.\nThere is also a similar message with Competitive Updates for players who are Grandmaster 1, but not yet on the Top 500 leaderboard. This should provide those players with feedback about their progress towards earning a spot on the Top 500 leaderboard.\nMap Updates.\nGeneral Updates.\nMap Pools have been disabled, all maps are now in rotation\nNew Arcade Map: Talantis.\nYou designed it, we built it: an underwater Talon base with jump pads, pit traps, giant fish, and waterfalls. Talantis will be playable for a limited time from April 25th through May 1st.\nWorkshop Updates.\nIntroducing Workshop Projectiles.\nThere are three new Workshop actions allowing you to create either a fully functioning projectile or a cosmetic projectile effect:\nAdditionally, there is a corresponding workshop extension that enables 19 projectile visual effects."}

The speed of his bombs has increased, but we tuned it so this wouldn\u2019t affect the arc of his projectile. This means that aiming with it will feel the same. The grenades bounce less and explode sooner, which will allow Junkrat to aim them more deliberately. This will reduce the amount of rolling grenade spam when playing against him.\"\n\"Developer Comments: Shadow Step was originally intended to be purely an out-of-combat mobility tool to traverse the map, since Wraith Form was already a great tool for disengaging. However, this made Shadow Step very situational, so we\u2019re increasing its flexibility to make it a better, less niche ability. This will enable Reaper to use Shadow Step in more offensive situations.\""}

However, direct impacts with the healing grenade projectiles will now grant additional healing to the impacted ally to keep his single target healing effective, with a slightly higher skill requirement.\"\n\"D.Va's respawn is often intentionally delayed by the enemy team if she is the last player alive from her team and without her mech. This change will make it more dangerous to be near the Call Mech arrival area for low health heroes.\"\n\"This is a change picked up from the Community Experimental card. Since Echo gains an additional health pool through using her Duplicate ultimate, it seemed reasonable that she doesn't need to be healed to full upon it ending as well. The minimum health value is there so she doesn't instantly die to a small amount of damage when it ends, as often with a long duration ultimate it can be difficult to remember her starting health.\"\n\"Moira has been underperforming in the support role even in team compositions and metas where we\u2019d expect her to excel. Reducing the cooldown of Biotic Orb is a significant increase in Moira's potential to quickly adapt to many situations.\"\n\"We're reevaluating the cooldown for Orisa's 'Halt!' ability after previous changes have reduced its effectiveness to combo with other heroes. We'll keep a close eye on whether the increased frequency of this displacement ability ends up being too disruptive to gameplay.\"\n\"Reinhardt has been overperforming since his last round of changes. To help increase tank diversity we are reverting his armor to its previous value while keeping the Rocket Hammer damage increase for now as it helps to balance out the reduced crowd control duration of Earthshatter.\"\n\"Roadhog is a hero who has been underperforming lately with not much changing about him since late last year when he had a more dominant presence, though the balance of other heroes has indeed shifted around. We're partially reverting the reduction to his damage to help bring him back up to a more effective level.\"\n\"Sombra's gameplay usually involves a lot of time waiting for opportune moments to strike and using the Translocator to disengage at a safe distance. Speeding up her movement in Stealth should help get her back into the action more quickly.\""}

We have a fresh lineup of heroes, new maps and game modes, 5v5 multiplayer, and more! Please keep in mind that everything you see in the beta is a work in progress. It's important for us to gather valuable feedback and insight from our players, so things are likely going to evolve throughout the beta phases. You may notice some features from Overwatch are absent in the beta. This reflects the game's current work in progress state, and it will change throughout testing! We appreciate everyone's interest, and we can't wait to share more.\nTo share general beta feedback, please post in the General Beta Feedback forum.\nIf you encounter any bugs or issues, please share in the Beta Bug Report forum.\nYou can also share feedback on specific forum topics such as 5v5, Push, Hero Reworks, New Maps, and Sojourn.\nNew Game Mode- Push.\nPush is a new game mode available on two brand-new maps: Toronto and Rome. Gameplay unfolds with two opposing teams fighting over control of a single shared objective, the Treadweather TS-1 Large Utility Robot, that starts in the middle of the map.\nEach team fights to take control of TS-1 as they would a payload: by having teammates located next to TS-1 with no enemies nearby. When a team takes control of TS-1, it slowly pushes their team\u2019s barricade towards the opposing team\u2019s start location along the predetermined path. If TS-1 and the barricade reach the goal at the end of the path, then the team controlling TS-1 wins the game.\nWhen the opposing team takes control of TS-1, it leaves the first team\u2019s barricade in place and reverses its direction. TS-1 then quickly moves back along the path until it reaches the opposing team\u2019s barricade, which then pushes towards the first team\u2019s spawn.\nMidway between TS-1\u2019s starting location and each team\u2019s end goal, there is a forward checkpoint objective along the path. When TS-1 pushes a team\u2019s barricade to their forward checkpoint, that team activates a closer respawn location. This respawn location deactivates if the other team retakes control of TS-1, then moves TS-1 to a point on the path before the forward checkpoint.\nPlayers have 8 minutes to push their team\u2019s barricade to the end goal and win. If neither team\u2019s barricade reaches its end goal after 8 minutes, then the team who pushed their barricade the farthest distance AND has control of TS-1 wins. The game enters overtime if control of TS-1 is contested, or the team who currently has control of TS-1 does not have the farthest distance pushed. Overtime ends when the team with TS-1 loses control of it, or when the team with control of TS-1 pushes their barricade to a distance exceeding the opposition\u2019s.\nAssault Maps Being Removed.\nWith the addition of the Push game mode and its new maps to Overwatch, we\u2019ve decided to remove all the maps using the Assault game mode from both the Quick Play and Competitive map rotations.\nAfter examining all our maps and game modes, we noted that the Assault game mode has always been a source of discontent for many members of our community. We believe many of the issues for the Assault maps could only be solved by making major changes to the game mode and major reworks to the maps, resulting in complete level rebuilds. We\u2019ve shifted our focus to create maps in exciting new locations across the world such as Toronto and Rome.\nAlthough Assault maps will no longer be in standard rotations, all Assault maps (Hanamura, Temple of Anubis, Volskaya, Paris, and Horizon Lunar Colony) will still be available for use in custom games and the workshop. We\u2019ll also look for future opportunities to bring them back into Quick and Competitive map rotations, as well as special events and arcade game modes.\n5v5.\nFor the Quick Play and Competitive Role Queue modes, the team composition now consists of 1 Tank, 2 Support, and 2 Damage heroes. For Quick Play Classic, Open Role Queue, and arcade modes such as CTF or Mystery Heroes, the number of players on a team is now 5 instead of 6.\nWith one fewer player on each side, individual contribution means more to the overall success of the team. Fewer players on the map also changes gameplay in a host of positive and sometimes subtle ways. Players have more space to spread out, and the battlefield is easier to understand with fewer visual effects and sounds happening around you.\nThe removal of one Tank hero in restricted role queues has allowed us to rework all our Tank heroes to be even more impactful and fun to play. This change increases gameplay clarity for all hero roles, and makes matches play more fluidly.\nTab Score Board.\nWe\u2019re making a large change to the Scoreboard screen by displaying key statistics in real time for all the players in the game, including eliminations and deaths. They\u2019ll be presented in a new layout that mirrors other competitive games and sports. This new layout should provide players with an overall more accurate view of the game.\nAs a result of this change, we are retiring the Fire and Medal systems. Both systems are no longer as necessary with the new Scoreboard providing a more accurate and easier to read view of each player\u2019s performance-related data. We do plan on revisiting the Fire system in the future, as it can provide excitement and positive feedback around awesome plays made by you or your teammates. These changes are a work in progress, and we are looking forward to hearing what the community thinks about these updates!\nSOUND.\nAudio Mix Options.\nWe have added audio mix options for various common settings (home theater, TV, headphones, etc.). They are still in the early stages of tuning and will likely change as we develop them through the betas.\nUnit Impacts.\nWe have added unit impact sounds that now corelate with the type of health pool you are impacting \u2013 for example you will get armor impact sounds on Reinhardt until his armor is depleted, and flesh impact sounds when in his default health pool. This is true of all heroes regardless of what material type they are made of.\nFEATURES.\nPing System.\nThis highly requested feature is finally making its debut in Overwatch! Bound to middle mouse, G, and D-pad left by default, the Ping System arrives with a suite of new communications options. Ping allows players to place waypoints anywhere in the world to strategize with their allies or suggest which enemy heroes to attack. Tapping the Ping button will fire a contextual Ping that highlights a location, marks enemies, confirms allied Pings, objective Pings, or even tells injured allies to group up with you if you\u2019re playing Support! Pressing and holding the Ping button opens the Ping Wheel, where you can select from a variety of pings that can be placed in the world or on your hero. Double-tapping the Ping button places a Warning ping, for when you can\u2019t see an enemy hero but want to let your team know about potential danger. Many of the Ping System\u2019s parameters can be modified in Options&gt;Controls. Please share your feedback about the Ping System and any improvements you\u2019d like to see in the future! We will continue to adjust the Ping System as we progress throughout testing, but here are some current work in progress elements:\nRead About the ping system in our blog: An inside look at the ping system in Overwatch 2.\nHeads-up Display (HUD)\nDAMAGE.\n (Ultimate)\n (Passive)"}

The &lt;a href=\"Viper%20rifle\"&gt;Viper rifle&lt;/a&gt; was one of the company's earliest creations, and the gun carved the company's place in the weapons market. Caledonia strove for quality, never letting Arbalest lag behind, hiring the best and brightest minds she could find, and strove to make her workers feel valued\u2014more like family than employees.\nOver the 20th and 21st centuries, Arbalest did good business as the maker of expensive, highly customized luxury rifles. When the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military turned to Arbalest, and the &lt;a href=\"AA92%20rifle\"&gt;AA92 rifle&lt;/a&gt; became standard-issue for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; during the Omnic Crisis. As it turned out, war was good for business, and as &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; was relatively unaffected by the war, Arbalest was able to reap the profits of war without suffering the blowbacks.\nDemand for Arbalest's rifles exploded, and the company transitioned into a high-tech arms corporation. However, over the following years, demand for weapons went down, with the end of the war. By this point, Arbalest was run by &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Ashe\"&gt;Mr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Ashe\"&gt;Mrs. Ashe&lt;/a&gt;, who chased deals with larger corporations such as &lt;a href=\"HSI\"&gt;HSI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vishkar\"&gt;Vishkar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hyde%20Global\"&gt;Hyde Global&lt;/a&gt;, using Arbalest's reputation to their advantage. One of Arbalest's factories in &lt;a href=\"Bellerae\"&gt;Bellerae&lt;/a&gt; closed, leading to some discontent amongst the locals.\nRecent History.\nNot long before &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Arbalest rolled out a new model of rifle. The first run was pilfered by the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Rebels\"&gt;Deadlock Rebels&lt;/a&gt;."}

She believes in taking action, standing up for oneself and fighting for what is right.\nSwordmaster.\nAsa's mother and grandmother tended the &lt;a href=\"Tetsuzan%20Shrine\"&gt;Tetsuzan Shrine&lt;/a&gt; outside Kanezaka. Asa raised her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt;, as a \"fierce ninja\" of a mother. Asa wanted Kiriko to follow in her footsteps, but Kiriko chose to follow her grandmother's path as well. \nAsa and her husband, &lt;a href=\"Toshiro%20Yamagami\"&gt;Toshiro&lt;/a&gt;, ran &lt;a href=\"Yamagami%20Blades\"&gt;Yamagami Blades&lt;/a&gt; in Kanezaka, both of them forging and wielding swords. She was chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20clan\"&gt;Shimada clan&lt;/a&gt; to be their swordsmaster, and she taught &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo Shimada&lt;/a&gt; in the ways of the sword. She also taught them how to wall climb. Kiriko learned alongside the brothers. \nThe Hashimoto.\nOne winter's day, the &lt;a href=\"Hashimoto%20clan\"&gt;Hashimoto clan&lt;/a&gt; took Toshiro away, forcing him to craft blades for them. Furthermore, by keeping Toshiro interred, they had leverage over Asa, forcing her to keep the peace in Kanezaka\u2014doing otherwise would put the people at risk.\nYamagami Blades was closed up at some point afterwards. The Hashimoto allowed some visitations (such as an autumn visit), and Toshiro was able to send their &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; a blade. Asa wrote to her husband in response, hoping that the blades that he was forced to forge for his new masters weren't as sharp. \nThe following spring, eight years after his abduction, Asa wrote to her husband, telling him that Yamagami Blades remained locked up, and that she and her daughter had moved to the upper level, and filled him in on the going-ons in Kanezaka. Asa missed him deeply, and reflected on the &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20clan\"&gt;Shimada clan&lt;/a&gt;, and how they contrasted with the more cutthroat Hashimoto. She also reflected that over the last few months, shipments of Hashimoto contraband have gone missing, and messages had started to appear, but had been painted over. She told him that she would make an offering to the fox shrine, before returning to her forced patrol of Kanezaka's streets. Much as she loathed to do so, she had to find the vigilantes who had been bringing grief to the Hashimoto.\nHomecoming.\nAfter Asa's mother died, Kiriko returned home and got her own appartment. Asa worried about her, and made regular visits to her daughter, much to Kiriko's consternation. During the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Festival\"&gt;Fox Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Kiriko returned home with boxes of doughnuts, which was yet another reason to give Asa cause for concern, in addition to her other concerns about the apartment block her daughter was living in, her presence on Kanezaka's dangerous streets, and that she had stopped training with her. She was similarly unimpressed by Kiriko's claims that she was protected by the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Spirit\"&gt;Fox Spirit&lt;/a&gt;.\nKiriko exited the appartment while Asa was making a meal, and she only realized when she heard the commotion in the outside hallway. Spying through the keyhole, she watched Kiriko fight off a group of &lt;a href=\"Hashimoto\"&gt;Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt; enforcers. Kiriko re-entered the appartment, and Asa revealed that she'd watched everything. The two made up, and Kiriko agreed to move in with her mother, at least for a little while. Asa, overjoyed, told Kiriko that her grandmother would have been so proud of her, and tearfully exclaimed that her daughter was a superhero."}
{"id": "28639", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28639", "title": "Ashe", "text": " is a &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 13 November 2018, she is the 29th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nAs the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gang\"&gt;Deadlock Gang&lt;/a&gt;, Ashe is a rebellious outlaw who's not afraid to get her hands dirty. Ashe can quickly fire her rifle from the hip or use her weapon\u2019s aim-down sights to line up a high damage shot at the cost of fire-rate. She blasts enemies by throwing dynamite, and her coach gun packs enough punch to put some distance between her and her foes, or gain some air to leap to hard to reach places or for an aerial shot. And Ashe is not alone, as she can call on her &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; ally &lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;B.O.B.&lt;/a&gt; to join the fray when the need arises.\nStrategy.\nAshe is a hero who requires good mechanical skill to be played effectively. Her weapon, the Viper, is quite powerful at long mid-range, particularly when the player uses her ADS (aim-down-sight) alternate fire. Dynamite is a dangerous, versatile ability that can be used to threaten space (such as narrow hallways and chokepoints) and deal decent damage in its radius, as well as inflicting a damage over time debuff. Uniquely, Dynamite can be detonated early by shooting it any time between when it's thrown and when its fuse runs out. Her Coach Gun serves as both a defensive \"get-off-me\" tool (like Lucio's Soundwave) and a potent mobility option (like Pharah's Concussive Blast). Finally, her Ultimate ability calls out her omnic sidekick B.O.B., who rushes in, knocks enemies in the air, and then grounds himself to shoot enemies, much like a turret.\nThough dominant in midrange, Ashe suffers in close combat. Her primary fire, while quite fast, deals only mild damage, and Coach Gun is on a lengthy cooldown. Most of her abilities require good follow-ups, such as detonating Dynamite and making quick shots after jumping with Coach Gun. Dynamite can be rather tricky. While it deals impressive damage over time, it will also damage Ashe if she's too close to the blast. Overall, Ashe is best played close to her teammates, so she can have backup available if she is being harassed. B.O.B., though incredibly strong, can easily be countered by the enemy team, as he can be hacked, slept, and stunned in the same way he can be boosted by a friendly team.\nGeneral Strategies.\nUse B.O.B Smartly! Don\u2019t just throw him into the enemy team: line B.O.B up for his cannon to do damage and delay them, as the enemy team can counter your B.O.B quite easily. The line of sight you are facing when calling out B.O.B is very important, as it can lead to B.O.B running clean off the map or into a unfavorable position. \nStory.\nAshe is the ambitious and calculating leader of the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gang\"&gt;Deadlock Gang&lt;/a&gt; and a respected figure in the criminal underworld.\nA tough talker, Ashe has an organized mindset. This affects her ideas of how her organization should be run, to how relationships should work. Her relationship with &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; is \"way more complicated\" than a simple label, though could be described as a \"love-hate\" type of relationship. Despite her callous exterior, Ashe has demonstrated concern for innocents caught up in Null Sector's war, and sympathy for &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s in general (&lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;B.O.B.&lt;/a&gt; especially).\nAs the daughter of socialites, Ashe feels just as comfortable at charity balls as she does on a motorcycle. She is a good shot with a rifle, believing that accuracy is key, and that all one should need is a single shot.\nBackground.\nElizabeth Caledonia Ashe grew up in &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lead%20Rose%20Manor\"&gt;Lead Rose Manor&lt;/a&gt;; a large estate located outside the town of &lt;a href=\"Bellerae\"&gt;Bellerae&lt;/a&gt;. Born into a wealthy family who came from \"old money,\" Ashe grew up surrounded by privilege. Her parents were highly sought-after business consultants and coaches for powerful CEOs around the world. Though her parents paid little attention to her (mostly leaving her in the care of the family\u2019s &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; butler, &lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;B.O.B.&lt;/a&gt;), they ensured that Ashe had every opportunity to succeed. B.O.B. was at Ashe's side for as long as she could remember. Her parents would often travel out of Texas, but never took her with them. Her parents would host many parties at their manor, trying to curry favor with influential persons from Bellerae. Ashe kept to the fringes of these events, resenting when her parents dragged her forward for a few minutes of small talk.\nBecause of their absence, Ashe grew to have a contentious childhood, getting into trouble at the academy where she attended school, and spending her time shooting bottles on the family estate with her slingshot. She found the academy \"soul-sucking,\" and was at odds with Headmaster &lt;a href=\"Wallach\"&gt;Wallach&lt;/a&gt;. Her misdemenors included trying to convince the academy's \"resident hacker\" to change all her grades to As, and closing the school for decontamination after showing off with her slingshot in the science lab. A loner, Ashe spent a lot of time talking to B.O.B. (even if he was apparently incapable of talking back). For her every birthday, B.O.B. would make Ashe her favorite cake (triple-layer chocolate cake, with chocolate frosting, and an extra generous drizzle of chocolate glaze). While it was part of his programming, Ashe appreciated the gesture, and looked forward to it every year.\nDue to her status as heiress to &lt;a href=\"Arbalest%20Arms\"&gt;Arbalest Arms&lt;/a&gt;, most of her fellow students kept their distance from her.\nAs a teen/young adult, her demeanors led to being temporarily incarcerated. She and Sheriff &lt;a href=\"Carson\"&gt;Carson&lt;/a&gt; became 'aquainted,' but every time, her parents' money was enough to bail her out every time.\nWhen motorcycles with &lt;a href=\"lev%20rim\"&gt;lev rim&lt;/a&gt;s were released, Ashe broke into her parents' study and used their finances to buy herself one. When her parents returned home, they found their daughter buzzing around the grounds on her new bike, much to their bemusement. Ashe told them that it had been sent as a gift by a business associate, but she'd lost the card. Her parents believed her, though detested the thing, considering it \"dangerous\" and \"unladylike.\" They didn't shed any tears when Ashe crashed it.\nThe Omnic Crisis.\nAshe was thirteen when the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began. On the first day of the conflict, her parents were away (again), and she angrily refused the food B.O.B. made for her, lashing out at the omnic due to her loneliness. She yelled at B.O.B. to leave her alone, and he walked off. At first, she thought nothing about it, confident that B.O.B. would return with more food, but as the afternoon turned to dusk, and dusk to darkness, Ashe realized that B.O.B wasnt' coming back. Feeling guilty, Ashe exited the dining room and searched for her butler, but couldn't find him in the manor or on the grounds. She feared that B.O.B. had indeed left her.\nAshe and her family went through the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; relatively unscathed. As the years passed, Ashe believed that she'd never see her butler again, and was surprised about how much she'd missed him.\nThe Omnic Crisis lasted two years, and two years after B.O.B.'s disappearence, he returned to Lead Rose. Ashe rushed out of the house to greet him. She halted a few paces away from the omnic, realizing that he was different. Not only his exterior (which was riddled from damage suffered in the war), but his very nature. B.O.B was now sentient, and...&lt;a href=\"The%20Awakening\"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt;, in ways that Ashe couldn't quite grasp. However, she hugged him, and slowly, tenatively, B.O.B. embraced her.\nAshe was never able to fully understand what had happened to B.O.B during the Omnic Crisis, but he was still the companion she remembered, and remained at her side.\nDisinheritance.\nGraduation Day.\nFor her 17th birthday, Ashe's mother gifted her with a golden bracelet. Months later, her mother borrowed it, and never returned it. At around about the same time, Ashe's condition at school had become worse\u2014an Arbalest factory had shut down, leading to a number of her classmates' parents losing their jobs. Casual avoidance of the Arbalest heiress morphed into active dislike, leading to a number of schoolyard scraps.\nThree months before her eighteenth birthday, Ashe was set to graduate. However, despite her parents' promises, they weren't present, as they'd left to deal with a business merger, and had simply left her a note that they hadn't even bothered to sign. Their absence, while not new, hurt her deeply, since they'd seemed genuinely invested in her graduation, if only to show off to Bellerae that their daughter could be more than a troublemaker. Fuming, Ashe walked to school alone, distracting B.O.B. in order to do so (as he'd always driven her there himself).\nAs Ashe walked down the road, she was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Jodie%20Bonney\"&gt;Jodie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Bonney\"&gt;Jimmy Bonney&lt;/a&gt;; two fellow classmates whose parents had lost their jobs when the factory shut down. Already frustrated, Ashe rose to the bait, and a fight broke out. She held her own initially, but when Jodie drew a knife, Ashe realized how serious things had become. Nevertheless, she managed to disarm him and take the knife herself, which was when officers from the &lt;a href=\"Bellerae%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Bellerae Police Department&lt;/a&gt; arrived, finding a knife in her hands, and two bloodied boys (each a year younger than she was) lying on the ground below. \nAshe was brought in for questioning by Carson. He didn't accept her claim that she'd acted in self-defense, as the brothers said that she'd attacked them, and furthermore, his officers had found her holding the knife. Fed up with her constant lawbreaking, he put her in a cell; she was underage, and her parents were overseas, so they couldn't bail her out this time. He'd get round to calling B.O.B. though...eventually.\nMeeting McCree.\nAshe found that she had a companion in the cellblock, namely &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;. While she was wary at first, she began to open up as they discussed firearms, with Ashe preferring rifles while McCree preferred revolvers. She found herself envying him, because while McCree was a drifter with nary a penny to his name, he clearly had the freedom to make his own decisions. A freedom that she didn't have. He told her about his life outside Bellerae. They hit it off, but the reverie was cut short by Carson, who let her out of the cell, as her parents had bailed her out. \"Again.\" She bid McCree a quick goodbye and headed out of the station, to where B.O.B. was waiting for her in one of the family cars.\nShe was given no time to reflect on recent events, as inside the car, the holoscreen activated, displaying her irate parents. They weren't interested in listening to her side of the story, and showed her an article from the \"&lt;a href=\"Bellerae%20Daily%20Pioneer\"&gt;Bellerae Daily Pioneer&lt;/a&gt;\", which listed Ashe as being arrested for armed assault, the article's picture framed in such a manner that it made her look like the aggressor against the Bonney brothers. While Ashe had felt some genuine remorse in letting her parents down, now she realized what it was really about\u2014not so much about her, but rather her being in the news and embarrassing her parents. To add insult to injury, her parents laid out what was going to happen. In three months time, Ashe would turn 18, and when that happened, she'd be cut off from her family and its finances. Until then, she could live in Lead Rose, and would be given a small allowance, but nothing more.\nThe Deadlock Gang.\nPartner in Crime.\nPicking up a rifle, Ashe shot through numerous antiques her parents owned inside Lead Rose, but her revenge was short-lived, and did little to alleviate her anguish. She considered selling the goods at Lead Rose, but the market for such luxury items was limited, and three months wasn't enough time to arrange the sales. However, she had access to Arbalest goods, that could be sold on the black market more readily. However, even with her parents' credentials at her disposal, it wouldn't be as simple as ordering the goods for herself. No. She needed to steal them. And to do that, she needed a partner.\nAshe had B.O.B. drive her to the &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Valentine%20megafarm\"&gt;Ace Valentine megafarm&lt;/a&gt; where McCree had said that he'd worked, arriving in time to find him be given the boot. She took him back to Lead Rose, and led him to a hill by the estate, where she handed him a revolver. He proved that he was as good a shot as he said that he was, and Ashe laid out her situation, and her plan to spend the next three months fleecing Arbelest for all she could, before leaving with enough money to go wherever and do whatever she wanted. All she needed was some help, in exchange for a cut of the profits. McCree agreed, negotiating his cut to 20%, unaware that Ashe would have gone as high as 30.\nThe First Heist.\nAshe's first target was &lt;a href=\"Arbalest%20Fulfillment%20Center%20Beta-3\"&gt;Arbalest Fulfillment Center Beta-3&lt;/a&gt;. Ashe had access to the schematics, and they entered a shed outside the facility proper, which in fact led to an underground tunnel. McCree reminded her that if they did this, there was no going back, and maybe all Ashe needed to do was wait for her parents to cool off. Ashe considered the possibility, but refused to back down, wanting to chart her own path. They left B.O.B. outside the building and entered the facility.\nIn the storehouse, Ashe used a tablet and stolen codes to use a &lt;a href=\"warehouse%20drone\"&gt;warehouse drone&lt;/a&gt; to pick up a case of &lt;a href=\"Seraphim%20rifle\"&gt;Seraphim rifle&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014armament for which they could continue to rob Arbelest. However, as they took the cargo elevator to the surface, an explosive failsafe kicked in, as the crates had gone outside their storage location proximity. Ashe tried to use the tablet, but couldn't find any way to access the crates' systems to shut down the failsafe. Taking a rifle each, they managed to climb to the top of the shaft, escaping the blast with the aid of B.O.B. Unfortunately, they'd caught the attention of the facility's &lt;a href=\"security%20drone\"&gt;security drone&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAshe had B.O.B. hide, as the drones would identify him immediately. In the meantime, she and McCree made a break for it in the truck they'd commandeered, with McCree driving and Ashe shooting. They managed to escape.\nCutthroat Trout's.\nBack at Lead Rose, Ashe altered Beta-3's logs to have it be reported that a &lt;a href=\"retrieval%20drone\"&gt;retrieval drone&lt;/a&gt;'s programming had gone wrong, taking the rifles down the wrong tunnel by accident, and had caused an explosion, after which the security drones had pursued a pair of trespassers unrelated to the incident. Come morning, she'd finished the job, but all she and McCree had to show for it was a pair of rifles. McCree considered backing out, but Ashe was undeterred, reasoning that they needed a hacker, and someone familiar with munitions. Ashe gave McCree the opportunity to take one of the rifles and sell it, but warned him that it would give him only a few months' worth of earnings. But what would ten rifles bring him? Power cells? Sniper scopes? If he walked away now, he was missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime.\nMcCree relented, and for demolitions, suggested &lt;a href=\"Julian\"&gt;Julian&lt;/a&gt;; a fellow farmhand who had experience with demolitions. Ashe agreed, and in her search for a hacker, found \"&lt;a href=\"Frankie\"&gt;Frankie&lt;/a&gt;\" via a custom web search, but there was no way to contact her...at least not directly. She got to work on that, while McCree set up a meeting with Julian at &lt;a href=\"Cutthroat%20Trout%27s\"&gt;Cutthroat Trout's&lt;/a&gt;; a seedy hangout located outside Bellerae.\nB.O.B. took McCree and Ashe to the hangout, though they had to walk the last mile. They entered the hangout and met Julian, after which Frankie showed up. Ashe laid out her plan to carry out a series of heists over the next three months. Frankie was suspicious, as to why Elizabeth Ashe (she'd already worked out her client's identity) would need money. Truth was, she'd already put it together from the newspaper article, but was still skeptical, given the limited equipment available to Ashe. Julian, however, was far more enthusiastic, and headed off into the crowd to arrange something. \nFrankie agreed to help Ashe, at which point Julian returned, telling Ashe that he'd made a wager. If one of them won against &lt;a href=\"Dezba\"&gt;Dezba&lt;/a&gt; on the Trout's hovercycle track, she'd give them four hovercycles. If they lost, however, Dezba would get B.O.B. Ashe was enraged, and the only thing that stopped her from striking Julian was McCree holding her back. McCree pointed out that it was illegal to wager omnics these days, but as Julian said, the people here didn't much care for following the law, and furthermore, if they backed out, Dezba would win B.O.B. via right of forfeit. Ashe said that they were leaving, but Frankie pointed out that that wouldn't work either, as the people who frequented the Trout cared about honoring wagers.\nAshe resigned herself to the fact that she'd have to race. Julian provided her with a house hoverbike, and while not as good as Dezba's, Frankie said that she could hack Dezba's to ensure Ashe won. Cheating, yes, but people only cared about that here if you were caught. She gave Ashe a small ear drone through which they could communicate. All Ashe had to do was simply stay on course, and Frankie would handle the race. Meeting with Dezba herself, Ashe quickly realized that her opponent was the better rider, and had every intention of selling B.O.B. once she won him.\nFor the Trout's records, Ashe had to give her name. Thinking of her hovercycle crash from years prior, she gave &lt;a href=\"Alyssa\"&gt;Alyssa&lt;/a&gt; the name \"Calamity.\" The race began, and Frankie helped guide Ashe through the obstacles and other riders, so that by the final lap, only Ashe and Dezba were in contention to win. However, Frankie was unable to hack Dezba's bike, as it was more 'analog' than she'd expected. Despite this, Ashe was able to win the race, though with significant injury, and the wreckage of the bike she'd been leant.\nThe crowd roared in applause, and Ashe's team rushed over. She made it clear with Julian that he was never to do any wagers like this again, that she was the leader of the crew. Dezba grudgingly congratulated Ashe for her win, and arranged to have the four hovercycles delivered to them. Furthermore, Alyssa allowed Ashe to take the hovercycle that she'd crashed, as the Trout already had plenty of other bikes.\nFort Starr.\nAfter treating her team to proper food at the Trout, Ashe led them back to an old barn that lay on the edge of Lead Rose's grounds. She planned to use it as their base of operations, since it was far from any prying eyes. Ashe announced that she had plans for her next heist\u2014in three days time, an automated Arbelest transport convoy would be passing through, transporting plans to a factory (the plans were being transported physically in order to avoid online piracy). As the convoy was only transporting plans, it wouldn't be expecting any trouble, hence why it was bereft of any protection bar drones. She planned to hit the convoy before it got too close to Bellerae. \nTo prepare for the heist, Ashe took the team to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Starr\"&gt;Fort Starr&lt;/a&gt;, in order to purchase ammunition and other goods. While Julian handled the former, Frankie introduced Ashe to &lt;a href=\"Metal%20Mary\"&gt;Metal Mary&lt;/a&gt;, where they could purchase gear for their hovercycles. After they left however, they were confronted by the &lt;a href=\"Diamondbacks\"&gt;Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Sanchez-Bez\"&gt;Benito Sanchez-Bez&lt;/a&gt;. Bad blood lingered between the Diamondbacks and Frankie, given that she'd used to work with them. Furthermore, Ashe discovered that news of her win at the Trout as \"Calamity\" had spread, and she once again used the name to cover her real identity. Still, the Diamondbacks left without incident.\nBack at Lead Rose, the team began preparing for the heist. McCree joked that Ashe should ditch the ruined chopper that Alyssa had given her, but Ashe refused, declaring that she was going to fix the bike and make it the envy of Bellerae. Still, much as she wanted to get to work on it, she and her team had to prepare for the heist.\nThe Brisco Incident.\nIn what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Brisco%20Incident\"&gt;Brisco Incident&lt;/a&gt;, Ashe and her gang made their move against the Arbelest shipment. The plan was that once Frankie hacked the main transport, she and McCree would engage the drones from their hovercycles. Julian would then used his demolition skills to seal the &lt;a href=\"Brisco%20Tunnel\"&gt;Brisco Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, covering their retreat once the plans were stolen. B.O.B. was left behind, as the heist didn't require muscle, and bringing him along raised the risk of identification.\nThe plan went awry as soon as it began, as while Frankie had no problem hacking the transports, she didn't know which one was the lead one. She ordered Frankie to find out by hacking each of them in turn, while she and McCree engaged the drones. The plan was a success, and plans for the &lt;a href=\"H-29%20scope\"&gt;H-29 scope&lt;/a&gt; were obtained. Later, Frankie sold the plans, and the gang received their first payday, with Ashe confirming that Arbelest had failed to identify the bikers who'd attacked the convoy.\nThe gang celebrated their victory, though Ashe became aware of the rift that existed between her and the others, given how Frankie and Julian had both suffered during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and McCree, while mute about his past, clearly hadn't had an easy life. They discussed their plans as to what they'd do with the money once the three month window they had was up. Ashe realized that she didn't really have a plan beyond her eighteenth birthday. Even after a night at Cutthroat Trout's, she still remained haunted by the question. With her funds, she could travel anywhere, even to &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; (where B.O.B. would be welcome), but even so...\nShowdown at The Hopper.\nOver the next two months, Ashe and her gang carried out nearly a dozen nearly flawless heists; mostly against Arbelest, but also a few other companies, in order to obscure the fact that Arbelest was their main target. However, the Arbelest targets were where the big bucks were coming from. Ashe continued to use her \"Calamity\" moniker, and to cover her tracks, Frankie scrubbed images of Ashe's arrest from the \"Daily Pioneer\" archives. Over the months, Ashe noted that the mood of her gang had improved, though despite McCree's various suggestions, refused to give it a name, reasoning that they wouldn't be operating together for long. They also continued to work on the hovercycle that Ashe had picked up from the Trout.\nThings went awry however at &lt;a href=\"The%20Hopper\"&gt;The Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, where they met with &lt;a href=\"Liu\"&gt;Liu&lt;/a&gt; in what was meant to be a simple exchange. However, Liu had double-crossed them, and the gang found themselves surrounded by the Diamondbacks. Bez and &lt;a href=\"Marco%20%28Deadlock%20Rebels%29\"&gt;Marco&lt;/a&gt; walked up, and laid out his terms. This was Diamondback territory, and Ashe's gang had gotten too greedy. So they were going to cease all their activity, or else...well, there were a lot of holes where people could be buried in the desert.\nAshe had no intention of backing down, but outnumbered and outgunned, knew there was no way they could fight their way out of the situation. Even when Julian was decked, she held McCree back. Believing that they had an agreement, Marco led the Diamondbacks away, at which point Ashe revealed to her gang that they weren't going to stop their activities, much to Frankie's shock. However, Ashe pointed out that their deadline was approaching, and that they could fit in a few more well-paying jobs. Namely, a big score that she'd been planning for quite some time.\nSiren.\nThe gang carried out a heist on an Arbelest train shipment, carrying a weapon known only as \"&lt;a href=\"Siren\"&gt;Siren&lt;/a&gt;.\" The train had yet to depart when they infiltrated the train yard. McCree found the cargo crate holding the weapon, but Julian triggered a motion sensor, which alerted the yard's security drones to their location. They managed to escape, but upon opening the crate, found only standard-issue rifles. Ashe realized that she'd made a mistake.\nBirthday Girl.\nAshe's 18th birthday arrived, and she found that turning 18 didn't change anything for her emotionally. She was still frustrated over the failed Siren heist, though McCree pointed out that they still had more money than they'd ever had because of their heists (barring Ashe herself). McCree gave her a birthday gift\u2014a keychain with her name emblazoned on it, for the key to her refurbished hovercycle. Ashe, deeply moved, commented that it was the nicest thing anyone had ever given her.\nMcCree told her that they were going to take her to Cutthroat Trout's for her birthday, but instead lead her back to the manor, where she found a surprise party for her. McCree told her that the dozens of people attending still thought that she was \"Calamity,\" and that they thought they were simply gate-crashing. As fun as the event was, however, it came to a head as Ashe was confronted by the Diamondbacks, with Marco calling her by her real name. Since she'd refused to stop the heists, he was going to end them for her. A small standoff ensued, but Ashe pointed to B.O.B., daring Marco to make a move.\nWhile annoyed, Marco stated that they weren't here for a fight. Only that Ashe's fun was over, that they'd got everything they needed, and that he wanted her to know that he was the one who ended it. With that, he left. Concerned, Ashe talked to Frankie and Julian, before flaming bottles were lobbed into the mansion. In the chaos, Ashe realized that McCree had disappeared, realizing moments later, in light of Marco's claiming that they'd got what they'd needed, that the Diamondbacks had kidnapped McCree.\nThe guests scattered at the sound of approaching police sirens, and Ashe told Frankie and Julian to hide, before being confronted by her irate parents, along with Sheriff Carson. Her parents were aghast, not only at what had happened to Lead Rose, but her mother revealed that they'd discovered that Ashe herself was responsible for the heists over the last few months. Furthermore, her parents claimed that they weren't really going to disown her, that they just wanted to teach her a lesson. Ashe wasn't sure if she believed them or not, but decided it didn't matter. She wasn't the complacent daughter that her parents wanted her to be, and never would be.\nHer mother, reaching the end of her rope, ordered Carson to arrest Ashe. She was eighteen, and therefore, responsible for her own actions. Thus, she was taken into custody. Ashe was aghast, knowing that the Diamondbacks had McCree, but refused to make ammends with her parents as the police took her in.\nEarly Release.\nInside her cell, Ashe had plenty of time to reflect. It was clear that Marco was the one who'd told the police and her parents about the party, but why take McCree? And how had Marco found out who she was in the first place? \nShe tried to get Carson's attention, and after an hour of yelling, he came to her cell. She pointed out that there technically wasn't any proof that she'd comitted the crimes she had, but Carson said that it didn't matter. With her parents' resources, they'd be able to get the charges to stick. Ashe, changing tactics, said that she had to get out of here and find McCree. The court had set her bail, after all, and if she could use money from her (admittedly illegally filled) account...\nCarson was having none of it. But Ashe pointed out that Carson had detested her parents for ages. If he let her pay bail, nothing would make them angrier. And given that she was eighteen, and therefore an adult, they had no legal course to stop her. Of course, she couldn't promise she'd turn up for her court hearing, but...\nAn hour later, Ashe was on bail. It took the entirety of the gang's shared account to cover the cost, but she was free, such as it was. In a sense, she was back to being destitute, but it didn't matter. She had a new family now. Exiting the police station, she found B.O.B. waiting for her. Hugging him, she told him to contact Frankie and Julian, to meet her at the barn outside Lead Rose. They were going to save McCree.\nThe Plan.\nAshe snuck into Lead Rose to retrieve some items. This included the &lt;a href=\"Viper\"&gt;Viper&lt;/a&gt; rifle. She met Frankie and Julian in the barn, who were aghast that Ashe had spent almost the entire gang's account on her bail. Frankie told Ashe that the Diamondbacks would have taken McCree to their hideout at &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gorge\"&gt;Deadlock Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, but there was little chance of saving McCree and getting out alive. Ashe persisted, but neither Julian nor Frankie were onboard with a suicide mission. Ashe accused them of abandoning McCree, but Frankie accused her in turn of caring about nothing but money. She'd used their account without their permission, and from the beginning, Ashe had always been the one with the least to lose.\nAshe, fuming, turned to Julian, who said that he'd stick with her. Along with B.O.B., they stocked up on all the weapons they could find and set off for Deadlock Gorge.\nThe Rescue.\nAshe and Julian arrived at the gorge, where they spied the Diamondbacks' hideout. The plan was that Julian would use his dynamite to get the Diamondbacks to come out to inspect the blasts, which would allow Ashe to sneak inside and find McCree. Ashe climbed down from their position and waited for the detonations, but none came. She tried contacting Julian, but received no response. It was at this point that she was accousted by Marco and other Diamondbacks, incapacitating her.\nWaking up, Ashe found herself inside the Diamondbacks' lair, with a grinning Marco in front of her. He revealed that they knew she'd been coming, and she concluded that Frankie was the mole. In truth, however, Julian was responsible, stepping into view. He revealed that he'd got himself into debt due to his activities at Cutthroat Trout's. The Diamondbacks bailed him out, in exchange for him informing them about Ashe, and that McCree had been kidnapped after he'd refused to take part.\nMarco revealed his plan to ransom Ashe to her parents. Ashe pointed out that they'd disowned her, but Marco wasn't convinced\u2014they had a reputation to maintain, and if it came to light that their daughter had been kidnapped, their reputations demanded that they pay for her release. \nAshe was given a lifeline as one of Frankie's &lt;a href=\"microdrone\"&gt;microdrone&lt;/a&gt;s latched onto her, allowing Frankie to whisper to Ashe via radio. The hacker simulated the sounds of a police siren and speaker, making it seem that the police had surrounded the hideout. The Diamondbacks scattered, but Ashe managed to trip Julian up, at which point, B.O.B. and Frankie arrived on scene. They made up (to an extent) over their earlier altercation, and agreed to escape, but not before finding McCree. Julian said that he knew where he was.\nAs they headed through the tunnels of the lair, they came across Bez, who offered to help them. Marco had become unhinged, and he was sick of it. He led them to McCree. They headed out, and parted ways with Bez. Arriving in the warehouse section of the lair, however, they were ambushed by Marco and the Diamondbacks, having figured out Frankie's ruse. A gunfight erupted, and both Ashe and McCree were hit. Outnumbered and outgunned, Ashe offered herself to Marco, in exchange for letting the others go free. Both parties agreed, but Ashe attacked Julian, and stole the detonator to the dynamite. If she detonated it, the entire lair would be buried.\nAshe played her hand, offering the Diamondbacks a place in her own gang. That they'd be treated with respect and be given equal shares. Bez was the first to cross the floor, and the majority of the Diamondbacks followed him. Marco and Julian were tied up and put in a shipping crate, and Ashe took command of her new gang. She ordered Bez to contact McCree and B.O.B., while ordering the others to do an inventory. \nDeadlock For Life.\nAshe sent the shipping crate to Sheriff Carson as a way of settling accounts. Over the following period, more and more gangs began looking to join Ashe's new gang\u2014the Deadlock Rebels. A name decided by her and McCree, named in reference to their new lair at Deadlock Gorge (taken over from the Diamondbacks). They declared their new 'family' inside the &lt;a href=\"Panorama%20Diner\"&gt;Panorama Diner&lt;/a&gt;, before heading off for another heist.\nCriminal Enterprise.\nThe experience had opened Ashe's eyes to her new calling. Not only had she found something she enjoyed, she'd found something she was good at. As a criminal, the idea of making a name for herself appealed to her.\nOver time, Ashe started to make a name for herself with bigger and more extravagant heists. While the Deadlock Gang wasn't the first gang to plague the American Southwest, Ashe declared that the gang would be \"bigger and better\" than its rivals, that they would \"write their legend.\" Ashe found that she excelled as a leader\u2014not only was she good at organizing heists and being a career criminal, but years of watching her parents coach and run their businesses had imparted her lessons on how to run a criminal enterprise.\nDuring their time in the Deadlock Gang, Ashe and McCree never dated; according to McCree, Ashe wasn't his type, as per her wealth. McCree knew how to \"push her buttons\" better than anyone else.\nThe gang's rapid rise to prominence put them at odds with the other criminal organizations in the American southwest; the encounters often became violent. After years of skirmishes and bloodshed, Ashe called the heads of the major groups together, seeing the potential to grow the influence of all. She used what she\u2019d learned from her parents\u2019 business to bring order to these groups. Her proposal was that the gangs could work together (or at least, not work against each other). Her principles: keep your word, don\u2019t work with the law, respect each other\u2019s territory, and always punish betrayal. No longer having to focus her energies on squabbles with the other gangs, Ashe began writing her name across the American Southwest with a string of audacious heists and operations that has placed her at the top of most-wanted lists and cemented her legacy as an outlaw legend.\nMcCree ended up being captured in an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; sting operation, and ended up joining Overwatch. Following the news, Ashe kept a picture of McCree...on the dartboard of her hideout.\nReunion.\nYears after McCree's departure, Ashe and the gang planned a heist of a &lt;a href=\"hypertrain\"&gt;hypertrain&lt;/a&gt; crossing above &lt;a href=\"Route%2066\"&gt;Route 66&lt;/a&gt; at 11:55 AM, having received an anonymous tip that it was full of military ordnance. They destroyed the bridge, causing the train to plummet onto the road, giving them easy access to the cargo. While loading their hover dolly with the goods, however, the plan took an unexpected turn when McCree emerged from the dust. At Ashe's suspicion that his presence was not a coincidence, McCree confirmed that he had sent the tip about the train knowing that she couldn't resist, and all he wanted in return was a &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;specific crate&lt;/a&gt;, telling Ashe that she could have everything else. However, he refused to elaborate on what it contained. Becoming interested in what was inside after opening the crate and taking a look, Ashe prepared to drive off the disappointed McCree, which led to a standoff, and subsequently at the stroke of noon, a gunfight. Despite being outnumbered, McCree was able to hold his own, though Ashe and her crew managed to pin him down with their gunfire. However, McCree got the upper hand with a pack of grenades that &lt;a href=\"Zeke\"&gt;Zeke&lt;/a&gt; had dropped on the ground earlier in a panic, shooting them mid-air and incapacitating the gang.\nUpon waking up, Ashe found herself and her gang bound on their hover dolly just as McCree was placing B.O.B's head onto it. McCree activated the dolly and sent it down Route 66, but because Ashe had turned down his deal, had removed all the loot they'd loaded onto it beforehand. Despite Ashe's yells, threatening to have B.O.B. rip off his other arm, McCree just ignored her. Further down the road, having had time to cool down, Ashe bitterly reflected that she should have just shot him the moment he turned up, conveniently ignoring the fact that her greed was responsible for their ending up with nothing. To add insult to injury, McCree zoomed past the dolly on Ashe's own &lt;a href=\"hovercycle\"&gt;hovercycle&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring (or not hearing) her as she shouted after him.\nZero Hour.\nThe encounter with McCree left a pall over Ashe\u2014over the next few months, nothing seemed to go right. When &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; (leading to the re-emergence of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;), things got even worse for the gang, as spooked by Overwatch's return, in less than 24 hours, half of the Deadlock Gang's clients had frozen their shipments.\nLuck of the Draw.\nNot long after the Paris attack, Ashe agreed to a meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Jackpot%20Gang\"&gt;Jackpot Gang&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Spectacle%20Resort%20%26amp%3B%20Casino\"&gt;Spectacle Resort &amp; Casino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;. While Ashe was skeptical of meeting with them, &lt;a href=\"Bez\"&gt;Bez&lt;/a&gt; insisted that it was the best way for the Deadlocks to move into the local smuggling game. She, the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Triplets\"&gt;Deadlock Triplets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;B.O.B.&lt;/a&gt; entered the Spectacle, while Bez kept in touch with Ashe via radio. The pair met with &lt;a href=\"Lark\"&gt;Lark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Folly\"&gt;Folly&lt;/a&gt; of the Jackpots, and after dining, Ashe got down to business. Obliging, Lars and Folly explained that they were introduced in doing business with the Deadlocks (given their expertise in gunrunning), but were only interested in the good stuff.\nOn that note, Ashe had Bars show the Jackpots an &lt;a href=\"Arbalest\"&gt;Arbalest&lt;/a&gt; sniper rifle. As Bars ran over its properties, Ashe studied Lars and Folly\u2014despite their efforts to hide their thoughts, she could tell they were interested in the merchandise. However, they continued to press the deal, and Ashe lost patience. She told the gang they were leaving (much to the Jackpots' dismay), but before negotiations could progress, an explosion rocked the casino. Null Sector had attacked the city.\nMost of the casino's patrons fled into the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Strip\"&gt;Las Vegas Strip&lt;/a&gt;, only to run into (literally) Null Sector's warbots. Ashe and her fellow gang members took a more cautious approach, but as they made their way to the exit, they found the streets crawling with warbots, and they were forced to retreat back into the casino, not even able to get to their bikes in the underground garage. They reunited with the Jackpot Gang (along with six civilians) who'd set up shop in a tucked-away ballroom. They barricaded the doors and windows as best they could, and let events play out.\nFor nearly a day, Ashe, her gang, and the Jackpots remained holed up in the casino. 14 hours since the initial attack, while watching from a window, Ashe watched a pair of tourists and an &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; showgirl emerge on the Vegas Strip. They didn't get far before Null Sector warbots cornered them. Ashe realized they were only interested in the omnic, and watched the showgirl flee at the last moment. It was too late however, as a &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt; fixed a clamp to her head, incapacitating her. So caught up with observing the events, Ashe missed the Null Sector &lt;a href=\"search%20drone\"&gt;search drone&lt;/a&gt; until it was right on top of her. Ashe raised the &lt;a href=\"Viper\"&gt;Viper&lt;/a&gt; to take a shot, despite knowing it would give away her position, but B.O.B. crushed it, saving Ashe from exposing them. Ashe bitterly reflected that they should never have come here.\nEight hours later, things hadn't improved\u2014not only was Ramattra's message of \"liberation\" blaring out on speakers throughout the city, but it was on every communication channel as well, preventing contact with &lt;a href=\"Bez\"&gt;Bez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frankie\"&gt;Frankie&lt;/a&gt;, or the outside world as a whole for that matter. While neither the Deadlocks nor Jackpots were keen on it, Ashe and Lark/Folly still agreed that they couldn't stay here forever. They were interrupted as a voice came from outside the ballroom, requesting entry. Ashe suspected it was a ploy, but she couldn't bring herself to forsake the possibility that the plea for help was genuine. She ordered B.O.B. and Bars to cover her while she opened the doors, finding &lt;a href=\"Dietrich\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Birdie\"&gt;incapacitated omnic&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom had fled from another establishment on the Strip. Jumping the gun, Lark tried to remove the helmet clamp from the omnic's head, only to inadvertantly kill her.\nThings were tense, especially from Bars, since she'd seen yet another omnic die at the hands of humans. With a glance, Ashe silently assured Bars that she'd happily let Bars punish Lark if they didn't need every good shot they had right now. Her relations with Lark and Folly were less reciprocal\u2014Lark pointed out that it was clear that Null Sector was only targeting omnics, which meant they could use the omnics here as bait, then make a run for it. Ashe flat out refused, even drawing out her gun when the Jackpots insulted B.O.B. Her butler calmed her down, but Lark and Folly realized that Ashe wasn't nearly as tough as she presented herself as. Lark drew her gun on Ashe, but the Deadlocks' leader used the Viper to knock it out of her hand before tossing the rifle to B.O.B, who with Bars, kept the rifle trained on the Jackpots. Folly backed down, but Lark assaulted Ashe, only for Ashe to knock her out.\nAshe took back the Viper, everyone falling behind her, but they still needed a way out of here. Furthermore, they were on a deadline, as according to the civilians they'd taken in, Null Sector's forces were making their way down the Strip, and Ashe could already hear the sounds of explosions and gunfire. Ashe knew there was no way they could make a ground escape, but if they made it to the roof of the casino, they could use a &lt;a href=\"sightseeing%20ship\"&gt;sightseeing ship&lt;/a&gt; to escape. The impromptu group made their way to the roof and found a pair of ships ripe for the taking. &lt;a href=\"P.T.\"&gt;P.T.&lt;/a&gt; took the first ship with the civilians, &lt;a href=\"Zeke\"&gt;Zeke&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Terran\"&gt;Terran&lt;/a&gt;. Ashe planned to have B.O.B. take the second ship which would take the Jackpots, herself, and Bars.\nThe first ship took off, but at this point they were spotted by a Null Sector &lt;a href=\"search%20drone\"&gt;search drone&lt;/a&gt;. To Ashe's horror, B.O.B. had Folly pilot while he stayed behind to hold off Null Sector. Ashe jumped out of the craft to help B.O.B. fend off the warbots, destroying a &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt; before it could incapacitate B.O.B. with one of its clamps. However, both of them ran out of ammo, and the remaining warbots knew it, as they encircled the pair. Ashe wondered why they didn't fire and beheld the answer, as a second Subjugator arrived, ready to 'liberate' B.O.B. However, they were saved by the Jackpots (who'd returned in the craft) and Bars, who shot the warbots from the air. The pair got into the ship, but it was hit by a missile from a warbot. Ashe nearly fell out, but B.O.B. saved her, and while damaged, the aircraft was still operating. Ashe chastised B.O.B. for being so reckless before assuring him they'd remain partners to the end, as the aircraft headed back to &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gorge\"&gt;Deadlock Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nAshe is the first hero to have originated from related media rather than game development.\nThe origins of Ashe differ between sources. In \"\", Ashe and the Deadlock Gang were created by senior artist &lt;a href=\"Jungah%20Lee\"&gt;Jungah Lee&lt;/a&gt;. According to a &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt; panel however, they were created by project director &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Hill\"&gt;Jason Hill&lt;/a&gt; and storyboard artist &lt;a href=\"Mio%20del%20Rosario\"&gt;Mio del Rosario&lt;/a&gt;. Lee has stated that in her creation of Ashe, she was inspired by the Route 66 map, and she sprinkled in backstory for Ashe. The picture of Ashe and McCree that is briefly seen in Ashe's hovercycle was created by Lee.\nAt the time, Ashe wasn't intended to be a playable hero, but rather one of the enemies for McCree to battle, conceived as a female member of the Deadlock Gang with long white hair wearing a duster, wide-brimmed hat, and wielding a lever-action rifle, who would be accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"B.O.B.\"&gt;giant omnic bodyguard&lt;/a&gt; and other gang members. During the storyboarding process they found the character to be exceptionally compelling, often coming to the forefront of scenes; realizing that there was something special about her, they decided to further flesh out her character design and backstory. Senior concept artist &lt;a href=\"Jungah%20Lee\"&gt;Jungah Lee&lt;/a&gt; produced several iterations of the character in order to hone in on a unique silhouette and color palette that conveyed her youthful appearance and outlaw nature without overlapping with the likes of &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; and McCree, settling on a final design that married the Western cowgirl and biker themes. Lastly, they shortened her hair by giving her a unique asymmetrical bob, both to sharpen her silhouette and to avoid having to simulate flowing hair.\nAt around the same time, Geoff Goodman and the game design team were interested in developing a new weapon-focused Damage hero, as the two other post-launch Damage heroes they released, &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, were both ability-focused. Upon seeing the early concept and storyboard art for the character, several designers independently came up with their own hero proposals, with the inclusion of B.O.B. being one of the only universally agreed upon ideas. Ashe's final kit revolved heavily around her lever-action rifle, deciding that, like McCree's similarly anachronistic revolver, it would be an extremely powerful, highly personalized weapon. To that end they gave it two firing modes, allowing her to rapidly fire from the hip for her primary fire, or to use iron sights with a reload between each shot for her secondary fire. Additionally, they gave the rifle a unique and satisfying reload mechanic, with Ashe reloading one bullet at a time in a dynamic loop that can be interrupted to resume firing. Her Coach Gun was designed mainly to create distance between her and her enemies, though it can also be used for mobility and trick shots. Ashe's Dynamite ability, originally conceived as a cluster bomb, was designed to be a versatile, high damage ability that is difficult to use.\nHer Ultimate, B.O.B., was very technically challenging to implement due to memory and performance restrictions, and almost resulted in Ashe being scrapped, as the team was adamant about B.O.B. being included as part of the hero. Unlike the AI-controlled turrets in the game, B.O.B. is treated more like an additional teammate, and can be healed, buffed, and debuffed accordingly, and can also capture or contest objectives. For a time the team experimented with having the game treat him as a full teammate, but ran into balance issues and bugs."}
