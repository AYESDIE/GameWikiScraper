Many staple crops were no longer viable, or no longer produced the yields they historically had. Farmland became scarce as climate change transformed formerly fertile land into desert. Given the circumstances, over the course of a decade, GMOs gained greater public support than they had previously, and there was a renaissance of GMO research.\nAt the same time, the spread of GMOs resulted in fairer, more widespread regulation of them, ensuring that any new GMOs were safe and controlled. As teams produced GMOs that could thrive in freezing climates, as rice with caloric yields three times greater than their non-GMO counterparts were created, demand for these seeds grew, and their use went global. The main barrier to their use, as ever, remained those who controlled them. Agricultural megacorporations who'd sunk billions of dollars into their seeds had a stranglehold over the industry, which lead to price-fixing and lawsuits, targeting small farms unable to pay the licensing fees.\nThe situation changed through a case presented by &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Frank\"&gt;Matthew Frank&lt;/a&gt; to the Supreme Court of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, who argued that the patenting of seeds was contrary to human interest and established law. The Supreme Court sided with Frank, and while there was some outcry, GMOs became open source. Adoption of GMOs went global, and hunger became less of a burden for governments and individuals alike. However, some governments still restricted GMO technology."}

{"id": "2902", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2902", "title": "Genji", "text": "Genji is a &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". He is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nGenji flings precise and deadly Shuriken at his targets, and uses his wakizashi to deflect projectiles or delivers a Swift Strike with his technologically-advanced \"dragonblade\" that cuts down enemies.\nStrategy.\nGenji is a versatile flanker with very high mobility, boasting some of the best movement options of all the heroes. Genji is better suited for mid-range to make use of his mobility and &lt;a href=\"Shuriken\"&gt;Shuriken&lt;/a&gt;s, but can still be formidable at range. &lt;a href=\"Cyber-Agility\"&gt;Cyber-Agility&lt;/a&gt; makes Genji a difficult target and allows him to navigate the map with ease. &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Strike\"&gt;Swift Strike&lt;/a&gt; allows Genji to engage, escape, or move between targets efficiently. The damage on Swift Strike is considerable for most heroes but is insignificant to a tank. As such, Genji should use Swift Strike to either maneuver around his enemies or deal small but quick and easy damage. Deflect allows Genji to turn enemies' damage back towards them and even allows him to turn around entire ultimate abilities. This allows for potentially lethal burst damage if it is timed properly and Genji is well-positioned. Be wary when estimating your own abilities as Genji, though; you are not the most agile hero, nor do you deal the most damage. Genji fills a middle ground when it comes to these factors.\nStory.\n\"Even if I sacrifice my body, I will never sacrifice my honor.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"cybernetics\"&gt;cyborg&lt;/a&gt; Genji Shimada has made peace with the augmented body he once rejected, and in doing so, he has discovered a higher humanity. While wary of his past, he has acknowledged, and made peace with it. He (almost) constantly wears a mask, as, in his words, \"I do not want people to fear me...or pity me.\"\nGenji's sword is a katana named Ry\u016b ichimonji (\u7adc\u4e00\u6587\u5b57); he maintains it personally and has never allowed anyone else to examine or repair it. It is paired with a traditional wakizashi sheathed horizontally on his lower back. He is proficient in Meikyo Shisui, Kenjutsu, Shurikenjutsu, Omnitsujutsu, and Intonjutsu.\nBackground.\nAs the youngest son of &lt;a href=\"Sojiro%20Shimada\"&gt;Sojiro Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, the master of the &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20Clan\"&gt;Shimada ninja clan&lt;/a&gt;, Genji lived a life of luxury and privilege. He had little interest in the family's illegal businesses, and although he excelled at and enjoyed his ninja training, he spent most of his time pursuing a playboy lifestyle. As Sojori's eldest son, Hanzo had the weight of expectations in a way that Genji did not. However, Genji felt that he was living in Hanzo's shadow.\nGenji was trained in the ways of the sword by &lt;a href=\"Asa%20Yamagami\"&gt;Asa Yamagami&lt;/a&gt;, who also taught them how to wall climb. The brothers learnt alongside Asa's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt;, who became a \"cute, little niece\" figure to the brothers. Genji was closer to Kiriko than Hanzo, as they were both mischief makers. While training, Genji tripped on his own sword, and while it only happened once, the incident remained stuck in Kiriko's memory.\nWhile in the castle, Genji, who often filched sweets for her when the Shimada's many servants weren\u2019t looking, and they would get up to no good inside the castle. At some point, he had a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_cut\"&gt;bowl cut&lt;/a&gt; to match Kiriko's hairstyle, as she didn't want to be the only one with it.\nOne night, after the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Summer%20Festival\"&gt;End of Summer Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Sojiro told Genji, Hanzo, and Kiriko a story from the history of the Shimada clan. How centuries ago, a rival clan attempted to end the Shimada's rule by setting their orchards aflame, as well as the city's &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Shrine\"&gt;Fox Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. The rival clan anticipated that the Shimada would move to protect their fields rather than the people of Kanezaka, but instead, the opposite happened. The Shimada aided their people first, and united with the clan, the Kanezakans made short work of the rival clan lying in wait at the orchards. The lesson, as Sojiro imparted to the three children, was that a leader's relationship must be mutually beneficial with their people, or else, they were nothing more than a parasite.\nAs Genji came of age, he rejected his father's empire, pursuing a more easygoing lifestyle built on his family's wealth and status. Many within the clan considered the carefree Genji to be a dangerous liability. He showed no interest in clan affairs, and they resented his father for coddling and protecting him. He spent a lot of his time in an arcade in &lt;a href=\"Hanamura\"&gt;Hanamura&lt;/a&gt;, where he racked up numerous high scores on the arcade machines. He and Kiriko spent a lot of time in the arcade, and they got into trouble there on at least one occasion. \nAt some point, Sojiro called Genji \"sparrow\" as an insult. He would later come to adopt it as a nickname.\nOverwatch.\nRecruitment.\nFollowing Sojiro's untimely death, the clan elders instructed Genji's older brother, &lt;a href=\"Hanzo\"&gt;Hanzo&lt;/a&gt;, to demand that Genji take a more active role in their late father's empire. Genji refused, enraging Hanzo. The tension between the brothers built to a violent confrontation that left Genji on the verge of death. Hanzo believed that he had killed his brother, but he survived, and ended up in a hospital in/around &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt;. While alive, it was expected that Genji would succumb to his injuries. As luck would have it, an Overwatch strike team was already in the area, investigating the Shimada clan's activities. &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; approached Genji's bedside, and Genji regained conciousness long enough to confirm that he was indeed Genji Shimada, son of Sojiro Shimada, and brother of the man who now ran the clan.\nWhen he next awoke, Genji again saw Reyes beside him, who made him an offer. If he agreed to help take down the remnants of the Shimada Clan, Overwatch would rebuild him into something greater than he had ever been. &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, who was beside Reyes, objected to the coercion, but Genji agreed, as he felt he had no other choice. Ziegler was in charge of the rebuilding of Genji's body. She replaced his failing organs with cybernetics (some modeled after those used by &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Chase\"&gt;Vivian Chase&lt;/a&gt;), and once he was stable, began to rebuild and enhance what remained of his body. Genji was put through an extensive process of cyberization, which enhanced his natural speed and agility and augmented his superlative ninja skills. This was followed by months of treatment and physical therapy for his cybernetics, during which Genji and Ziegler formed a close bond. Their bond remained during their time in Overwatch, and they had many late night conversations at &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;Overwatch Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen Dragons Fall.\nWhile Genji was recovering, Reyes used his sources and knowledge to accumulate information on the Shimada clan. While Reyes was eager to move the investigation into field ops, he was forced to wait for Ziegler to clear Genji for service.\nEventually, Genji was given the green light. With the cyberization process complete, Genji was made a member of &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt;; a black-ops unit within Overwatch. As a member of Blackwatch, he had mixed views on fellow members &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20O%27Deorain\"&gt;Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt;. While he knew Blackwatch wasn't on the level, clouded by anger, Genji didn't act on his knowledge.\nNow a living weapon, Genji single-mindedly set about the task of dismantling his criminal empire. Alongside Reyes, &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Lacroix\"&gt;Gerard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;, and McCree, Blackwatch conducted well-strategized strikes to arrest major players and disrupting protection rackets, until eventually, the Shimada clan collapsed from within. In truth, the Shimada were already crumbling, given that Hanzo had left the organization by this point. While Blackwatch returned to HQ, a job well done, Genji pursued other rival gangs in the area the Shimada had once controlled.\nRetribution.\nEight years before the Overwatch recall, Genji took part in a &lt;a href=\"Venice%20Incident\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Rialto\"&gt;Rialto&lt;/a&gt; in order to apprehend &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Bartalotti\"&gt;Antonio Bartalotti&lt;/a&gt;. The Blackwatch team arrived in a Venice safehouse and set up survaillance on the manor. They found Talon soldiers patrolling the grounds. When night fell, they infiltrated the manor. They made their way through its interior, killing and/or incapacitating numerous Talon guards. Upon reaching Antonio's office, they found him there, not surprised to see them. Nor was he intimidated, as he pointed out that Overwatch abducting a \"respected businessman\" would be a public relations nightmare. Furthermore, even if they did take him, his \"friends\" would have him released within a week. After some thought, Reyes said \"you're right\" and shot Antonio, the force of the blast sending him through his office window, setting off an alarm. Genji remained silent, even as they engaged in \"Plan B\"\u2014fight their way out. During the escape, Genji voiced support for Reyes's actions, stating that the commander had found an \"expedient solution.\" He noticed that McCree was uneasy about what had occurred, pointing out that they'd killed before. McCree stated that what had happened was an execution. Genji simply responded \"dead is dead.\" He further stated that he felt no sympathy for the Talon guards.\nThe team succeeded in exfiltrating the manor, but the existence of Blackwatch was revealed to the world, resulting in political and public fallout. Genji and the others were put under suspension. However, Overwatch leadership encouraged him to keep training for the larger Overwatch strike team. With urging from Dr. Ziegler, Genji agreed.\nUprising.\nSeven years before the Overwatch recall, Genji was still a member of &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; carried out an &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;, he trained with cadet &lt;a href=\"Lena%20Oxton\"&gt;Lena Oxton&lt;/a&gt;. Genji would later comment that Tracer was \"the only one I have trouble keeping up with.\"\nReassignment.\nAfter the Uprising, Genji was transferred from Blackwatch to Overwatch proper. Ziegler was instrumental in the process. Genji began to wear a mask in order to consider his true identity, and his family name and criminal connections were kept hidden from his teammates and the broader public.\nGenji became a full-fledged member of the Overwatch strike team. He graduated alongside Oxton and &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;. Within a year after the King's Row Uprising. Genji would cut contact with his old Blackwatch team members. At some point after joining the strike team, he received representation in the \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28cartoon%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" cartoon, and was apparently one of the more beloved characters. None of its viewers however, had any idea that Genji had been a former member of Blackwatch or before that, a criminal syndicate. As a member of the Overwatch strike team, Genji, Winston, and Tracer would work together on several high profile missions.\nStorm Rising.\nSix years before the Overwatch recall, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;, Genji took part in an operation in &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; consisting of himself, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;. Their objective was to apprehend &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt;, who was travelling through the city in an armored convoy. The Overwatch team engaged, with Genji using his sword to disable Maximilian's vehicle, and his shuriken to destroy a pair of others. Maximilian fled on foot, but the team was able to catch up with him, Genji putting his sword to the omnic's neck. In exchange for leniency, Maximilian agreed to arrange a \"meeting\" with &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, informing them that Talon's leader would be in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; in three weeks.\nDoomfist.\nThree weeks later alongside Tracer and Winston, Genji confronted Doomfist in Singapore. He initially attacked Doomfist with his shurikens, but the man either deflected them with his gauntlet, or utilized a powerful shield to keep them at bay. Doomfist slammed his gauntlet into the ground, sending pillars of earth upwards, forcing Genji to jump into the air for safety. It was the opening that Doomfist needed, as he jumped up and hit Genji with his gauntlet, sending him skidding along the streets and smashing into a car. Genji's &lt;a href=\"cybernetic\"&gt;cybernetic&lt;/a&gt; body began to give out, but luckily, Winston was able to defeat Doomfist shortly afterwards.\nInner Peace.\nGenji went missing during the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;Overwatch Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. The organization was shut down not long after.\nWith Overwatch having fallen from grace, Genji felt increasingly at war with himself. For the second time, he abandoned his former life, and wandered the world in search of meaning. Genji sought healing from many wounds he'd suffered, beginning with the horrific duel he\u2019d fought with his brother, through his questionable missions in Blackwatch, to the fall of Overwatch. He drifted for many years before crossing paths with the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; monk &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suravasa\"&gt;Suravasa&lt;/a&gt;. Though Genji initially rejected Zenyatta's wisdom, the benevolent omnic would not be deterred. In time, Zenyatta became his mentor, and under the monk's tutelage, Genji reconciled his dual existence as both man and machine. \nGenji spent a great deal of time at &lt;a href=\"Shambali%20Monastery\"&gt;Shambali Monastery&lt;/a&gt; among its &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;titular order&lt;/a&gt;. While under Zenyatta's tutelage, Zenyatta spoke to Genji of &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; who had left the &lt;a href=\"Shambali%20Monastery\"&gt;Shambali Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, with doubt clouding his soul. This exchange would become relevant years later. \nUnder Zenyatta, Genji learned to accept that although he had a cyborg body, his human soul was intact, and, through Zenyatta, Genji came to see his trials and cybernetic form as both a gift and unique strength. Now, for the first time in his life, Genji was free. Even he could not say where his path would ultimately lead.\nRecall.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; issued a recall of Overwatch agents, Genji was seemingly in western North America. He decided to rejoin the organization.\nDragons.\nAt some point after the recall, Genji headed to Japan to confront his brother. He contacted &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, informing her of his decision.\nOn the tenth anniversary of Genji's supposed death, as he had done every year, Hanzo broke into Shimada Castle and took down the guards before they could alert anyone. In the main room in front of the sword display with the grand hanging scroll, he lit an incense offering and prayed to honor his brother. Genji had tracked him before he even set foot in the castle and revealed his presence to Hanzo, who sensed his presence and immediately presumed him as the next of many assassins out for Hanzo's blood. The two sparred both physically and verbally, discussing Hanzo's assassination of his brother. Hanzo unleashed his Dragon Strike ability, but Genji was able to manipulate it with his sword, a feat that only a Shimada should be capable of. Finally, with Hanzo stunned from the attack (as well as hopeless confusion), Genji held him at bladepoint with his wakasashi and Hanzo ordered him to finish the battle while he still had the chance. However, Genji refused to give his brother the death he desired, declaring that he still had a purpose in life. Genji finally releaved Hanzo of his decade-old shame by revealing to him he was his supposedly deceased brother. He took off his mask, revealing himself as Hanzo's very much alive brother. He told Hanzo that he had forgiven him, and now, Hanzo had to forgive himself. The world was changing once again and it was time for Hanzo to pick a side as Genji has. Hanzo wasn't swayed, but Genji told him that he still had hope for his brother. And with that, he disappeared into the night in a literal puff of smoke, leaving his signature sparrow feather in his place.\nReflections.\nAt Christmas, Genji was with Zenyatta. He wrote a letter using a quill. The letter could've been sent to Mercy, who received a letter with an identical quill to Genji's, but it also could've been sent to Hanzo; Genji was writing in Japanese.\nZero Hour.\nSometime after Winston's recall, Genji arrived on location in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; with impecable timing, where he aided Tracer, Winston and Mei in repelling &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s forces after the opposition began pushing them toward an early retreat. After playing a crucial part in crippling and taking down the terrorist organization's &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, Genji rejoined Overwatch, alongside &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;. He was willing to work with Overwatch, at least in the short term.\nA New War.\nAfter Paris, Genji and the others traveled to , which they used as their base of operations. As it turned out, Null Sector's attack on Paris was simply the prelude to a global invasion. &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that Null Sector wasn't the only threat Overwatch had to deal with. He declared that they'd had to fight their way through one city at a time. \nRio.\nGenji and the rest of Overwatch deployed to &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; when it was attacked by Null Sector. They teamed up with &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; and were able to blunt the initial attack, though L\u00facio warned that as long as Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; remained airborne, the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s would just keep coming. Genji and Brigitte kept Null Sector busy, while Winston and Ziegler evacuated civilians, and the rest of the team assaulted the command ship. The plan was a success, and the command ship successfully destroyed.\nAfter the mission, Genji wrote to Zenyatta. He wrote how despite again being a member of Overwatch, his outlook had changed. The first time, he had joined the organization because he had no other choice. Now, he did it willingly, to protect the world. He further wrote that having met Zenyatta and forgiven his brother, he could truly meet his potential. He would face Null Sector head on.\nToronto.\nGenji was present at &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; when Overwatch arrived to evacuate the city in light of Null Sector's attack on it. He was taken aback at the sight of dozens of &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s rendered comatose by strange devices placed upon their heads. Even more troubling was Null Sector's propaganda playing throughout the city, uttered by a &lt;a href=\"Rammatra\"&gt;mysterious figure&lt;/a&gt;. The figurehead spoke of &lt;a href=\"the%20Iris\"&gt;the Iris&lt;/a&gt; being the solution to omnics' suffering, and Genji was reminded of Zenyatta's mention of someone close to him leaving Shambali back in Suravasa. He suspected, correctly, that Zenyatta's friend and the one leading Null Sector were one and the same.\nAs the team evacuated in their shuttle, Genji remained silent until Mercy asked what was wrong. He told her that there was more to these attacks than they had previously believed, and that he had to find Zenyatta, who might have answers. He departed the group, but asked Overwatch to join him in meeting his former mentor. While en route, he wrote a letter to Zenyatta, stating that he might arrive before the letter did. He relayed his experiences with Toronto, and his lingering suspicions that the one leading Zenyatta was the friend his mentor had mentioned years ago. However, he was loathe to consider the possibility, writing \"I hope my suspicions do not offend you, Master. I do not wish to think this destruction could be at the hands of anyone you called a friend.\"\nReunion.\nSometime after Toronto, Genji returned to Zenyatta.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nGenji and Hanzo were originally envisioned as a single cyborg ninja hero named Hanzo who wielded both a bow and a sword, used parkour, and had an assassinate ability, using artwork for the Assassin class from the cancelled &lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;. They were split into two distinct heroes early in development. During development Hanzo was known as \"Bow Ninja\" and Genji as \"Sword Ninja.\" Both Genji and Hanzo's kits drew heavily from an early version of &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; that predated both heroes, which resulted in the Sombra concept being temporarily shelved. The first iteration of Genji was equipped with kunai, which were eventually equipped by &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt;. \nGenji himself was originally conceived as a slow-moving stealth assassin with an ability that allowed him to trip an enemy, stunning them, and then instantly kill them with a sword strike \"finishing move\" if another enemy didn't interrupt the attack, but this design was found to be unfun. At one point he was also given an Ultimate that would allow him to instantly kill an enemy from behind, which would have had unique stealth kill animations such as stabbing them in the back or cutting their throat. The lessons learned from this iteration of Genji were taken into consideration when developing Sombra as a stealth hacker. Another early version of Genji was treated purely as a melee hero with his sword always drawn and the ability to stick to walls. Some of these abilities appear to be the basis for the &lt;a href=\"Talon%23Paramilitary%20Forces\"&gt;Talon Assassin&lt;/a&gt; enemy unit that appears in the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Retribution\"&gt;Overwatch Retribution&lt;/a&gt; event. His Dragon Blade ability was originally his primary attack, but this didn't work well, so it became his ultimate.\nThe concept for Genji's new design in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" originated from the first storyboards for the &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Hour\"&gt;Zero Hour&lt;/a&gt; cinematic, which depicted Genji appearing in a hoodie to rescue Winston. In the original storyboards he was wearing only a hoodie, causing the art team to realize that Genji had been naked this whole time and decide that if he's going to wear a hoodie he should also put on some pants. &lt;a href=\"Jungah%20Lee\"&gt;Jungah Lee&lt;/a&gt;, a concept artist for the Story and Franchise Development team, took that idea and fleshed out the design for the cinematic, and the development team liked it so much that they decided to bring it forward as his new design.\nExternal links.\n "}

Internally, like many countries, Germany was witnessing the proliferation of &lt;a href=\"AI\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s displacing human labor. Not wanting to leave its population unemployed, the government began backing sectors of labor where AI and robotics had not sufficiently displaced human workers. One of these fields was deep-sea exploration. Prior to this, engineers had been working on exoskeletons and energy shielding, and these submersible exoskeletons operated from ports along the North Sea. Some of these projects received funding from the &lt;a href=\"German%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;German Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nExternally, Germany had to deal with growing instability in Europe, and wanted to improve its national security. This resulted in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Initiative\"&gt;Crusader Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. The Initiative was propagandized from its inception, in order to sell to the public that it was purely a defensive force.\nOmnic Crisis.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began, Germany was one of the countries attacked by &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;. When the war broke out, Germans from all walks of life applied to join the Crusaders, but despite the surge, Anubis's forces outnumbered Germany's 10:1. The Crusaders were instrumental in Europe's eastern front, but suffered catastrophic losses in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Eichenwalde\"&gt;Battle of Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt;, even if it was still a human victory. Around the time of the battle, &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; was put on its highest alert level.\n&lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; was also &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Liepzig\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; by the omnics before the war's conclusion."}

Unlike normal AIs, which are limited by their processing systems and limited resources, god programs were designed to live up to their names. Designed to be impartial, they were equipped with complex morality and emotion-synthesizing routines, which would prevent them from acting against their human masters in all but the most extreme circumstances. God programs were not truly sapient beings, though were often anthromorphized as such, and at various times, have displayed various emotional traits (sadism, regret, etc). \nGod programs came in two types. The vast majority were referred to as \"regional AI,\" working on a limited level, most often covering a single major metropolitan area and operated by the government. The larger god programs were more complex, created from a variety of sources. \nThe names of their original programmers have been lost. Writers of the &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Archive\"&gt;Zurich Archive&lt;/a&gt; have speculated that this was perhaps intentional, given the events of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nOrigins.\nGod programs were developed before the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, in a period where humanity seemed set for a bright future. However, the global population was continuing to grow, and it was theorized that the god programs could choreograph the moving pieces necessary to keep humanity on its current course. Furthermore, they could identify areas of need, ensuring equality and prosperity for all. \nEach god program was responsible for a different sphere of influence, and was given a corresponding programming team dedicated to supervision and maintenance. Any problems that arose with a god program would be resolved before it reached a boiling point. They were tested again and again for signs of bias before taking stewardship of various systems. While smaller AIs handled activities such as traffic flow, god programs had national levels of activity, such as guarding supply chain flow, analyzing national infrastructure to ensure equitable energy distribution, and ensuring ecological preservation. As such, humanity could turn its attention to the tasks that couldn't be automated. It was believed that humanity's social and structural issues could be solved while god programs took care of humanity's basic needs. \nThe more advanced god programs were created from a variety of sources. Early models were comissioned by national governments, but the private sector quickly swooped in, offering to improve existing programs or custom design programs with new functions. Because the god programs required access to major systems that involved both the public and private sectors, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; established a special agency to regulate them. But with so many programs on the bleeding edge of technology, such oversight was limited in its effectiveness. \nThe god programs were not without their detractors. During their design and deployment, concerns were raised about the possibility that they had been given too much leeway, and would be able to make decisions outside the scope of their programming, enabling them to break free of human control. These concerns were dismissed, given that steps had been taken to ensure god programs couldn't act against their creators in all but the most extreme situations, not to mention that any problems that did arise could be solved by their programming teams. In short, the brightest minds of the world agreed that the god programs were safe, and ergo, they were. \nOperation.\nThe god programs were launched internationally to manage ecological preservation, security, energy equity, and communications. Each god program was installed in a specific location, under the auspecies of a host government, which limited their reach in accordance with each country's laws pertaining to the collection of data. The god programs expanded their reach over time, though there were some regions of the world that never knew their oversight. \nMany of the researchers who worked with the more advanced god programs anthromorphized the AIs, viewing them as friends and colleagues of sorts. The researchers claimed that it was impossible to work so closely with an individual, even an AI, and not come to understand and sympathize with them.\nOn the issue of climate change, the god programs were arguably underutilized. The issue was a global one, and not everyone was willing to leave such an important issue to AI, and some were concerned that the god programs would pick winners and losers. Larger nations feared they would be forced to pay excessive reparations, while smaller nations feared any advantages they'd gained would be stripped from them. For instance, countries that had been enjoying political status as climate refugees were desperate to hang onto their political gains. In the end, humanity pursued self-interest over collective action. Public opinion held that human ingenuity had created the issue, and human ingenuity would solve it.\nThe climate issue aside, the god programs operated successfully for years, which led to governments and corporations taking their stability for granted, which in turn led to cutbacks in the funding and staffing of their monitoring and programming teams. Maintainance continued, but less frequently. The major god programs' support teams remained stable however, and were viewed as essential. The writers of the &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Archive\"&gt;Zurich Archive&lt;/a&gt; applauded this in hindsight, as it meant that when the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began, &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; was the only god program to turn against humanity.\nPost-Crisis.\nAfter the Omnic Crisis, a number of regional god programs continued to operate, albeit with more controls and monitoring systems in place than previously. The major god programs, however, were deactivated and subsequently guarded by &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; after the Omnic Crisis ended. Those involved in the god programs' development distanced themselves from the AIs after the war. They argued that none of the god programs bar Anubis had shown signs of any anti-human activity. Others responded that Anubis hadn't either before it launched its war.\nKnown God Programs.\nThe number of god programs is unclear. Some have been declassified and formally acknowledged by their host governments.\nNotes.\nIn 2017, according to lead writer &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Chu\"&gt;Michael Chu&lt;/a&gt;, \"God program\" is a colloquial term used more to describe the rogue AI &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; than to describe a whole subset of AIs. Over time however, the term has been established as a subset of AIs, rather than a colloquial one."}

He regularly debriefs Talon agents. Nguyen rarely takes to the field himself, though is a decent hand-to-hand combatant, and a crack shot with his sidearm.\nMonte Cristi and Aftermath.\nNguyen took part in a Talon operation at &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Cristi\"&gt;Monte Cristi&lt;/a&gt;; an operation that resulted in numerous civilian casualties and medic &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Augustin\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Augustin&lt;/a&gt; going AWOL in the aftermath. A strike team under Captain &lt;a href=\"Cuerva\"&gt;Cuerva&lt;/a&gt; was assigned to apprehend him in &lt;a href=\"Port-de-Paix\"&gt;Port-de-Paix&lt;/a&gt;. They failed, and Nguyen reported to Commander &lt;a href=\"McManaway\"&gt;F. McManaway&lt;/a&gt; about a log recovered from the missing strike team.\nWhat You Left Behind.\nFour years after Baptiste's abandonment of Talon, Nguyen came with &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt; to Port-de-Paix to bring &lt;a href=\"Vernand%20Sainclair\"&gt;Vernand Sainclair&lt;/a&gt; in line. Aware that Baptiste was in Haiti, Mauga insisted that they use Baptiste as part of their operation. Nguyen was skeptical, wanting someone more reliable, but Mauga insisted, and Nguyen relented. The two came to &lt;a href=\"Lefort%27s\"&gt;Lefort's&lt;/a&gt; and met Baptiste there. Baptiste initially refused, but Nguyen coldly reminded him that he didn't have a choice. After Baptiste relented, Nguyen passed him an envelope, containing the details of the mission. He told Baptiste to read it once he'd reached a safe location, and then burn it afterwards.\nThe following morning, Nguyen and Mauga met Baptiste outside &lt;a href=\"Sainclair%27s%20mansion\"&gt;Sainclair's mansion&lt;/a&gt;. He informed them that he'd scheduled an appointment with Sainclair, so all they had to do was walk in, get the money he owed Talon, then walk out. However, a hitch in the plan occurred when Nguyen led the trio into the library and found not Sainclair, but his private security waiting for them. Realizing the trap, Nguyen shot first, and the trio prevailed in the resulting gunfight. Unfazed in the hitch, Nguyen calmly said that they would have to fight their way up to Sainclair's office. \nBaptiste and Mauga took point, and soon, they confronted Sainclair himself, who protested that he was loyal to Talon. Nguyen, pointing out that Sainclair had set his security on them, asked why he shouldn't kill the man here and now. Sainclair claimed that he had information, and Nguyen gave him the chance to present it. That information was an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; recall order sent by &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;; one that he had received three days ago, having once been part of Overwatch himself. Nguyen was unimpressed\u2014as &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;former&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Overwatch agents&lt;/a&gt; were already part of Talon, the organization had received this information already. Ergo, there was no reason to leave him alive. Mauga suggested that Baptiste deliver the coup de grace, and Nguyen didn't object. However, instead of shooting Sainclair, Baptiste detonated a flashbang that temporarily incapacitated Nguyen and Mauga, allowing him to escape with Sainclair. Nguyen opened fire, but only managed to graze Baptiste as he fled the mansion. "}

However, they are denied the basic rights that humans have. &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, has become a fulcrum of omnic agitation, along with their human sympathizers. Omnics have (or had) to undergo mandatory registration, and are effectively a labor caste within the country.\nHuman-omnic tensions culminated in the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, in which a pro-omnic terrorist group known as \"&lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;\" staged an uprising in King's Row and took Mayor &lt;a href=\"Nandah\"&gt;Nandah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt; and hundreds' of others as prisoners. The British government explicitly forbade &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; from intervening despite thousands in London requiring medical aid, resulting in Commander &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; dispatching four Overwatch agents\u2014&lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to put an end to the crisis. The Uprising poisoned the well of human-omnic relations in the country. The country's media focused on omnic crime, treating even petty theft as being possible preludes to a &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Second Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe country retains a constitutional monarchy, with the king's crown jewels being stolen by &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn light of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; vigilante activities at a &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Museum\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt;, Downing Street added its voice to the international condemnation of the unauthorized action.\nOmnic spiritual leader Tekhartha Mondatta did much to try to improve the conditions of omnics within King's Row. At somepoint, he gave a speech to a joint human-omnic crowd. However, he was assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the winter holiday season after Overwatch's recall, Britain was hit with a massive winter snowstorm, creating a white Christmas."}
{"id": "2258", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2258", "title": "United Nations", "text": "The United Nations (UN) is a geo-political entity.\nHistory.\nThe Climate Crisis.\nIn the opening decades of the 21st century, climate change was perhaps the greatest issue facing humanity. The world had reduced its CO2 emissions from peak readings by a measly 5%, a number that, while seen as a great achievement, was hardly sufficient to stop, let alone reverse the worst impacts of humanity's growing energy needs. However, as time went on, there were positive signs. &lt;a href=\"Borda%20algae\"&gt;Borda algae&lt;/a&gt; proliferated through rural and residential areas, and the public continued to turn away from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy. Wind power in particular boomed in this period, as the superstorms and high winds caused by an ever-warming planet generated more energy for turbines to harvest. Integrated battery storage systems cemented renewables' leads.\nHowever, there was a growing rift across the world on the climate change issue. Major commerical, transportation, and military interests were slower to pivot. The developing world had great interest in modern eco-friendly advances, but were hamstrung by insufficient infrastructure. They openly questioned why they should invest in systems to curb their much smaller emissions when some of the world's largest carbon emitters were barely making an effort. Some nations remained noncompliant and continued to burn fossil fuels, which still accounted for around 50% of the world's energy consumption. Furthermore, carbon-capture technology remained costly and inefficient.\nThe UN stepped in and found the resources to deploy various technologies in a series of humanitarian efforts across the world. These efforts, combined with the average citizen's embrace of clean energy, reduced emissions by a further 20%. It appeared that Earth would remain hospitable to human life for a good time to come.\nDespite this, climate change was a sticky political issue given that it was global in scope, but had not been caused equally. Larger nations feared they would be expected to pay excessive reparations, while smaller nations feared that the political advantages they'd gained through climate refugee status would be lost. &lt;a href=\"God%20program\"&gt;God program&lt;/a&gt;s that had been created to deal with ecological issues were underutilized, as humanity pursued self-interest rather than the collective good. Public opinion held that human ingenuity had caused the climate crisis, and human ingenuity would solve it.\nAI Issues.\nAs &lt;a href=\"god%20programs\"&gt;god programs&lt;/a&gt; were rolled out, the UN established a special agency to regulate them. However, such oversight was limited in its effectiveness, given how advanced the programs were.\nWith the development of &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;, the UN put limits on further research into &lt;a href=\"artificial%20intelligence\"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Omnic Crisis.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, as the nations of Earth tried and failed to contain the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, the UN was busy forming an international taskforce named &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. This small, experimental group would bring together the best and brightest from around the world to wage asymmetrical warfare against the robots. Overwatch succeeded, and the war came to an end. \nPost-Crisis.\nAfter the war, the UN extended Overwatch's charter to support international peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts. It later approved Overwatch's &lt;a href=\"watchpoint\"&gt;watchpoint&lt;/a&gt; program, as well as the construction of a &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometimes after the Omnic Crisis, the UN granted omnics legal personhood. However, legal battles within countries continued to persist.\nTwo decades after the end of the war, Overwatch was faced with a series of shocking allegations: negligence resulting in high-profile mission failures, corruption and mismanagement, weapons proliferation, human rights abuses, and more. A special UN committee launched a lengthy and highly secretive investigation into the claims, which led to the disbandment of the group. After hearings with surviving members of Overwatch, the committee publicly stated that the explosion was an apparent accident. Classified documents state that it additionally determined the explosion was caused during a power struggle between &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; and , two of Overwatch's key members.\nRecent History.\nUN officials initially refused to comment on the string of attacks by Jack Morrison. After the incident at the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Museum\"&gt;Overwatch Museum&lt;/a&gt;, however, the UN released a statement, stating, \"The United Nations has not authorized any Overwatch operations. The organization\u2019s charter remains revoked.\" They did not answer further questions.\nThe international community was divided as to whether to intervene in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Second Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. The UN convened to discuss the issue.\nFollowing a number of high profile incidents involving &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt;, the UN granted Helix's request for additional funding to deal with rising threats; much to the dismay of those opposed to the increasing privatization of security following the end of Overwatch.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and Overwatch's intervention, Secretary-general &lt;a href=\"Osei\"&gt;Osei&lt;/a&gt; contacted &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, him that despite the situation, his reformed Overwatch was in breach of numerous international laws. Any further action was warned against."}

It helped find the resources and provide assets to deploy various technologies in humanitarian operations throughout the world, as humanity sought to solve the climate crisis. A startup formed by &lt;a href=\"Vishwakarma%20Bhatt\"&gt;Vishwakarma Bhatt&lt;/a&gt; was among those that received funding. This inadvertantly resulted in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt;."}

The American Southwest is a fairly lawless area, where various gangs spend their time robbing trains and carrying out bank heists.\nHistory.\nPre-Crisis.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the US used its military to enact regime change in various countries. While the regimes were cruel and authoritarian, what followed was the arrival of megacorporations, which took control and continued the same abuses under the auspices of maximizing profits.\nAs climate change ravaged the world, there was a resurgence of yellow fever within the US, as the \"Aedes aegypti\" mosquito increased its range. At the same time, the country's west was experiencing a water crisis. Experts pushed to repurposed disused oil and gas pipelines to transport water into dry regions. However, this was not required due to the innovations of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Lomakema\"&gt;Michael Lomakema&lt;/a&gt;, who developed water extractors that could draw water from the surrounding air, and in a second model, from underground water tables, without having to drill new wells.\nAt some point before the present, it was legal to wager and sell &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s between humans.\nIn a case to the Supreme Court by &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Frank\"&gt;Matthew Frank&lt;/a&gt;, GMOs were made open source. This helped alleviate global hunger in the wake of climate change and ensuing desertification. In another case brought forward by &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;, a US court granted &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; legal personhood.\nDue to the scandal involving the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20omnium\"&gt;Detroit omnium&lt;/a&gt;, US federal agencies stepped in after the local government's review. It was revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Omnica%20Corporation\"&gt;Omnica Corporation&lt;/a&gt; had lied to their shareholders and multiple governments as part of their bidding process and construction of the &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOmnic Crisis.\nWhen the Omnic Crisis hit America, the country was willing to try anything to win the war. Consequently, the United States ran the highly classified but widely acknowledged \"&lt;a href=\"Soldier%20Enhancement%20Program\"&gt;soldier enhancement program&lt;/a&gt;.\" Controversial, the program utilized pharmaceutical (among other means) to create \"perfect soldiers\" blessed with superhuman speed, strength, and agility. Ultimately, politics, mismanagement, and egos left it to &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; to finally win the war. However, the war had displaced millions, and many of them looked for a new place to settle, or at least find steady work. By this point, the wagering and selling of omnics had been outlawed, though the practice continued in criminal circles. At some point after the Crisis, the US was among the countries that gave omnics legal personhood.\nRecent History.\nAfter the theft of a &lt;a href=\"pulse%20rifle\"&gt;pulse rifle&lt;/a&gt; from the abandoned , the US conducted efforts to apprehend the . &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href=\"Olympia%20Shaw\"&gt;Olympia Shaw&lt;/a&gt; believed that this intruder was also responsible for previous bombings of corporate offices and financial institutions within the United States.\nCurrently, the US is one of the countries affected by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Second Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnown Locations.\nThe following locations are grouped on a by-state basis:"}

The player who was selected to backfill will receive \"high priority\" matchmaking after the match. Players with high priority will be put in a match faster and cannot be selected to backfill another game, while queuing for the same game mode. (Role queue and open queue are considered separate, but each role in role queue the same.) If the player exits to desktop or plays another game mode, their high priority will be lost.\nSpectating.\nIf you join someone already in an unranked mode, you will be able to spectate that game. As soon as someone leaves on the team of the person who you joined, you get to join the game. You can only spectate people on the team of the person you joined.\nLeaver penalties.\nAs Unranked modes are intended for a more casual experience and leavers can be backfilled, players are given some leniency when it comes to leaving matches. However, this can still be very disrupting and can lead to unsatisfactory experiences, so players who excessively leave Unranked matches, will be temporarily suspended from queueing to any game mode that grants &lt;a href=\"Player%20Progression\"&gt;Player Progression&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach player's last 20 matches they participated in are recorded. If the player has been marked as leaver in at least 4 of these matches, they will receive a 20 minute suspension from matchmaking. If the player has left at least 6 of their last 20 matches, the duration of the suspension is increased to 4 hours. These suspensions will be reapplied every time the player leaves a match while above these thresholds, but not when the player completes a match. If you are currently in leaver status, your player card will tell you how many games you must finish to leave that status in the upper-right corner."}

{"id": "25920", "revid": "48511500", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25920", "title": "Venice Incident", "text": "The \"Venice Incident\" was an event that occurred eight years prior to the present day. It was a turning point in the history of both &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe incident's roots lay with a series of Talon attacks on Overwatch facilities in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, and more notably, &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;. A bomb set by a Talon agent leveled the &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch%20Rome%20facility\"&gt;Blackwatch Rome facility&lt;/a&gt; and killed numerous members of its staff. Both attacks were done at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Antonio\"&gt;Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, a businessman with connections to both Talon and the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; government. Overwatch commanders &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; were at a crossroads as to how to respond. Morrison favored working with the Italian government. However, Reyes pointed out that Antonio's connections ran deep, and he'd be exonerated if arrested. Reyes pressed for Antonio to be brought in for questioning, but Morrison pointed out that unilateral action by Overwatch would violate Italy's sovereignty. Still, he left the decision to Reyes to make.\nOn that note, Reyes assembled a team of &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; agents, consisting of himself, &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genji%20Shimada\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20O%27Deorain\"&gt;Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt;. They headed for Rialto.\nThe Mission.\nThe Blackwatch team arrived in a Venice safehouse and set up surveillance on the manor. They found Talon soldiers patrolling the grounds. They originally planned to infiltrate the manor by posing as the band employed at the manor, but this idea wasn't followed up upon. When night fell, they infiltrated the manor. They made their way through its interior, killing and/or incapacitating numerous Talon guards. Upon reaching Antonio's office, they found him there, not surprised to see them. Nor was he intimidated, as he pointed out that Overwatch abducting a \"respected businessman\" would be a public relations nightmare. Furthermore, even if they did take him, his \"friends\" would have him released within a week. After some thought, Reyes said \"you're right\" and shot Antonio, the force of the blast sending him through his office window. It was the shot that stirred the hornet's nest, alerting Talon to their presence, leaving them with \"Plan B\"\u2014fight their way out. In that, they succeeded, and despite numerous Talon soldiers attacking them, they successfully exfiltrated the site.\nThe Aftermath.\nReyes and McCree were debriefed by Morrison, &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Lacroix\"&gt;Gerard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;. Morrison was incensed by what had occurred, and demanded that Reyes tell him what actually happened, plausible deniability be damned. Reyes snidely responded to Morrison's demands, but nonetheless recounted the Rialto mission. In his debrief, he pointed out that things don't always go according to plan, and stood by the decisions he had made. Reyes and the others were put under suspension.\nAntonio's warning about the public relations issue proved to be prophetic. Because of Reyes's actions, Blackwatch's existence had been revealed to the public. There were stories of assassination, coercion, kidnapping, torture, and worse. Governments called on the UN to shut down the \"aggressive and repeated violations of many countries' sovereignty.\" A special UN committee launched a lengthy and highly secretive investigation into the claims. As the UN investigation proceeded, public distrust swelled. The investigations revealed the existence of O'Deorain's illicit research within Overwatch, and the organization disavowed any knowledge of her. Thus began the twilight years of Overwatch\u2014Blackwatch would be placed on suspension one year later and a few years after that, Overwatch would be disbanded. The incident would be called \"the Blackwatch mission that changed everything.\" History would indicate that this was correct.\nTalon, for its part, continued to operate. Antonio's death opened up a void in Talon that new faces filled, including &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akande%20Ogundimu\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt;. Both of them would end up as members of Talon's inner council.\nTrivia.\nBased on pictures in &lt;a href=\"Marios%20Place\"&gt;Marios Place&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mario\"&gt;Mario&lt;/a&gt; was apparently present at the Venice Incident, caught in the crossfire during a pizza delivery. This could be creative license on his part, however, or simply gags."}

They were released in &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 10, making them the 40th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nVenture is an elusive, combo-oriented close-range damage dealer.\nMatch-Ups and Team Synergy.\nWhen fighting Tanks, Venture has \"Matchup\" ratings, ranging on a scale of 5 levels. This is because Venture's primary focus, like any other DPS, is to pressure and eliminate the enemy team's Supports and other Damage heroes:\nWhen fighting DPS &amp; Supports, Venture has \"Priority Targeting\" &amp; measures of \"Risk\" ranging on a scale of 5 levels. These heroes often pose the greatest threat to Venture or are key targets to eliminate:\nSynergies are also graded on a scale of 5 levels:\nStory.\nAn eccentric and daring adventurer, Venture is a charismatic and enthusiastic non-binary archaeologist with a passion for solving history's mysteries. When danger calls, Venture always answers. As a member of the &lt;a href=\"Wayfinder%20Society\"&gt;Wayfinder Society&lt;/a&gt;, Venture travels the world, using their excavating tools to uncover artifacts and protect archaeological sites from looters, thieves, and more dangerous criminal organizations.\nVenture's archeological interests are varied and at times, apparently contradictory. &lt;a href=\"Omnic\"&gt;Omnic&lt;/a&gt; archeology is their favorite specialization, while their favorites of archeology include Classical, Medieval, Peruvian, and Egyptian. They also like Baroque architecture, and love ice-cream. \nBackground.\nSloan Cameron had an affinity for finding lost things since they were a child. They never lived in one place for long, and each new home meant a new expedition\u2014on which they unearthed treasures, trinkets, and traces of the past. Their unusual talent drew them to the Wayfinder Society. At sixteen, they started an apprenticeship with the organization and never looked back.\nDue to their unfettered bravery, Cameron was a unique addition to the brilliant minds of the Wayfinders. From ancient ruins to dormant &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s, dangerous expeditions quickly became their go-to assignments. They often returned from digs covered in dirt, bruises, and local fauna, but always with a smile on their face, eager to learn about the artifacts they\u2019d recovered. Their dedication eventually saw them graduate from their apprenticeship, making them a full-fledged member of the Wayfinder Society.\nCameron's fearlessness came in handy for more than just expeditions. With increasing threats to Wayfinder sites, security often fell into their hands. Looters, scavengers, even master thieves would try to steal artifacts recovered by the Wayfinders. But with their excavating tools and quick wit, Cameron managed to fend off any would-be troublemakers.\nAt some point, Cameron and their fellow Wayfinders searched for &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iram_of_the_Pillars\"&gt;Iram of the Pillars&lt;/a&gt;. There wasn't much choice when it came to the area's street food.\nVenture's Adventures.\nTangle with Talon.\nCameron and their fellow Wayfinders operated on &lt;a href=\"Ilios\"&gt;Ilios&lt;/a&gt;. They encountered Talon at least twice.\nOn evening, Cameron emerged from below ground with an ancient artifact, but by the time they resurfaced, found that the sun was setting, and that the Wayfinders had left the site. They found a note from their fellow Wayfinders, explaining that they'd headed into town for the night, but had left them dinner for when they resurfaced. \"Dinner,\" as it turned out, was ice-cream, much to Cameron's delight.\nAs night fell, Cameron reflected on the site's history before they saw &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Maugaloa%20Malosi\"&gt;Maugaloa Malosi&lt;/a&gt; operating on-site, going through the artifacts the Wayfinders had collected. The Talon forces quickly set about looting the site, uncaring of the damage they were inflicting on the ruins. While the civilization who'd built the ruins was long gone, Cameron knew it was their job to protect their heritage, and attacked the criminals with their drill. Mauga opened fire with his miniguns, but Cameron burrowed underground, evading his bullets before bursting up to the surface and stealing the artifact Mauga had been holding. They geeked out over the artifact, which Mauga found amusing, even though he didn't dissuade him from attempting to take the Wayfinder out.\nHowever, the fight was interrupted as Talon overheard police chatter on their comms, prompting the criminals to exfiltrate the site. As they left, Mauga mocked Cameron in saying that &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; would have to find his artifact somewhere else, which made Cameron suspect that Talon was after something specific at the site. Cameron took care of the Talon troopers still on-site before one of them was knocked out by &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, who emerged from her stealth. She told Cameron that they'd handled themselves well in the scuffle before they'd got obsessed with the artifact. Sombra stated that she wasn't with Talon, but was just \"tagging along,\" and that what Talon was searching for wasn't at Ilios. Cameron, however...they had potential. She told Cameron they could be what she needed before disappearing.\nLeft alone, Cameron reflected on Talon's repeated heists at dig sites, and that whatever they were searching for, it was best it didn't fall into their ends. They decided to tell Wayfinder HQ about the incident.\nFurther Adventures.\nIn the wake of the Ilios attack, Cameron wondered why an organization as powerful as Talon would be pilfering ruins. It was a mystery, indeed...and Cameron could never leave a mystery unsolved.\nCameron did research on an artifact Talon had acquired, last seen in ruins at &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. The reliefs led them to the &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt;, who directed them to Talon's hideout. After a lot of digging, Cameron emerged in Talon's hidehout. The Talon troopers attempted to flee, but Cameron dodged and blasted their way through the base before incapacitating the troopers and reclaiming the artifact.\nTrivia.\nMisc. Character Information.\nDisputed Information.\nCameron worked on-site at &lt;a href=\"Petra\"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt;. Their work was interrupted by a firefight between &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; (and, apparently, not for the first time). Taking the side of the former, Cameron helped drive Talon off before returning to their excavation. Burrowing through the ground, Cameron emerged in a chamber which held a construct that looked like &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nVenture's developer nickname was \"Miner\". The inital concept was a hero who could dig underground, as such early concept art was highly experimental with their design. Senior Concept Artist &lt;a href=\"Kejun%20Wang\"&gt;Kejun Wang&lt;/a&gt; tried various themes and configurations for Venture's drill, such as sound-based weaponry and exosuits. These concepts were later experimented with and combined to help make more defined early concepts. \nNarrative designer &lt;a href=\"Miranda%20Moyer\"&gt;Miranda Moyer&lt;/a&gt; directed Venture's identity towards a swashbuckling archaeologist, which had concept artists lean into the adventurer aesthetic, specifically to design them as a daring explorer with a big drill. Whilst developing Venture's look and trying to solidify the hero's silhouette, other than the iconic big drill, concept artists ended up giving Venture a big backpack and long coat to help make them look unique to other heroes, while suiting their adventurer identity. Venture was heavily inspired by miners and mining gear, which is reflected in the design of their drill weapon.\nWhilst visualizing early concept art of Venture's drill into 3D, the design got streamlined and changed to a more conical shape to make it more recognizable and better from a first-person perspective. From the conical 3D drill, developers started to plot the moving parts and different states it would have, which led to the now moving \"Drill\" mode and idle \"Cannon\". Venture's design was also slightly inspired by motorcyclists, such as the way they hold their Drill, as well as the drill's look and loud noises. This inspiration also led to the flame decals on their weapon, as well as flame tattoos on Venture's neck. Venture's off-hand grip was inspired by vacuum cleaners.\nFor Venture's character personality and backstory, Moyer stated they worked around the concepts the hero has so far, which at the time was a character with a big drill. From this, they explored different archetypes and ultimately landed on archaeology. They explored what archaeology would be look like in the world of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\", leading to the idea that the well-charted future still had mystery and adventure if you look for it. As such, they developed Venture's daring, passionate and brazen personality.\nVenture is Overwatch 2's first trans non-binary hero, using they/them pronouns. The team gathered feedback and worked closely with the LGBT network at Blizzard, as well as gender non-conforming developers working on Venture, to try best represent Ventures gender identity as authentically as possible. \nVenture was revealed at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202023\"&gt;BlizzCon 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Reception was mostly positive, with fan art quickly appearing on the Internet. Venture was available as a trial from March 28 to 31 before Season 10 began, where they were released as a regular hero."}

He is the owner of &lt;a href=\"Sainclair%20Pharmaceuticals\"&gt;Sainclair Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;.\nStory.\nA self-serving individual, Sainclair heralded from &lt;a href=\"Port-de-Paix\"&gt;Port-de-Paix&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt; regarded him as being handsome. He dressed immaculately, as per his status.\nEarly Life.\nSainclair acted as a handler for &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed that the organization took him for granted and was \"poisoned from the very start.\" The longer he stayed with them, the more apparent Overwatch's corruption became apparent. He fed insider information to &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; as an associate, his actions helping ensure that Talon remained a thorn in Overwatch's side for years. Talon paid him handsomely for the information he provided. After Overwatch shut down, he became the owner of &lt;a href=\"Sainclair%20Pharmaceuticals\"&gt;Sainclair Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, which held a monopoly in the industry over the people in &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;. He sent a portion of the profits to Talon.\nWhat You Left Behind.\nAs the prices and profits increased, Sainclair stopped sending his payments to Talon. As a result, &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trung%20Le%20Nguyen\"&gt;Trung Le Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; were sent to his &lt;a href=\"Sainclair%27s%20mansion\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt; to collect what he had owed, or to eliminate him. Nguyen, having recruited Baptiste to join them, contacted Sainclair ahead of time, letting him know they were coming, but Sainclair had his private security attack them. In the resulting firefight, not only did his forces fail to take out the Talon operatives, but they were able to fight their way to his office, cornering him. He swore that he was loyal to Talon, before unloading a revolver onto them. However, the bullets just ricocheted off Mauga's shield. Nguyen angrily asked why he shouldn't just kill him there and then, but Sainclair offered him information in exchange for his life. He showed them a data pad that had a recording of an Overwatch recall order sent out two days prior. Problem was, Talon was already aware of the recall order. As Nguyen pointed out, Sainclair wasn't the only &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;former&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Overwatch agent&lt;/a&gt; on Talon's payroll.\nMauga bid that Baptiste shoot Sainclair. However, he instead detonated a flashbang and used his &lt;a href=\"Exo%20Boots\"&gt;Exo Boots&lt;/a&gt; to catapault both himself and Sainclair through the office's skylight. Baptiste led Sainclair away from the mansion and to the docks. Baptiste lay out the deal\u2014he'd send someone to collect Sainclair in a few hours, who'd then get him out of town. In exchange, he would supply every clinic in the country, free of charge. In a state of shock, Sainclair agreed. When he asked Baptiste why he didn't kill him at the mansion, Baptiste responded that he wasn't worth it."}

It is one of the most powerful corporations in the world, and is widely known for its use and application of &lt;a href=\"hard-light\"&gt;hard-light&lt;/a&gt;.\nVishkar, at least in theory, is known for its public service works\u2014houses, clean water, clinics, etc. While there may be some truth to that, Vishkar's activities also include more 'corporate' activities\u2014luxury retreats, exclusive clubs, and \"condominiums with prices as high as the skyscrapers that contain them.\" More than once, it has resorted to dubious tactics to achieve its goals.\nHistory.\nPre-Crisis.\nVishkar's origins lie with &lt;a href=\"Vishwakarma%20Bhatt\"&gt;Vishwakarma Bhatt&lt;/a&gt;, who formed an ambitious start-up in Bengaluru to research hard-light. Research was slow, but promising, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Global%20Recovery%20Program\"&gt;United Nations Global Recovery Program&lt;/a&gt; provided additional funding. This led to the startup turning into the corporation proper.\nBhatt hoped to share it with the world before Vishkar implemented more restrictions to the technology. Bhatt lost his life in an unfortunate car accident one year before Vishkar's first public offering. However, the company was strong to withstand the loss of its founder, and even thrive in his absence. However, Bhatt's idealistic corporate policy died with him.\nVishkar's hard-light research was well received, but its expansion into poorer nations resulted in them going into debt to Vishkar. Many decried these apparent predatory actions.\nPost-Crisis.\nAfter the Omnic Crisis, Vishkar began the laborious process of creating new, self-sustaining cities to house India's displaced population. One such city, &lt;a href=\"Utopaea\"&gt;Utopaea&lt;/a&gt;, was created using radical hard-light technology that enabled its architechs to shape the city's streets, utilities, and living spaces in the blink of an eye.\nVishkar also secured a contract to redevelop large tracts of &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. The citizens were told that the development would improve their lives. However, that promise never became a reality. Vishkar imposed controls on the residents in the name of building a more orderly society: enforcing curfews, cracking down on what the company perceived as lawless behavior, and exploiting the populace as a cheap labor force. Sonic technology was used to control the populace. However, that technology was stolen by &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;one of the citizens&lt;/a&gt; who led a popular uprising, driving Vishkar out of the city.\nPer the events in Rio, Vishkar was subjected to investigation, forcing the company into damage control. While this was going on, the company was involved in negotiations with &lt;a href=\"Lum%C3%A9riCo\"&gt;Lum\u00e9riCo&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Sanjay%20Korpal\"&gt;Sanjay Korpal&lt;/a&gt; engaging in confidential negotiations with CEO &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Portero\"&gt;Guillermo Portero&lt;/a&gt;, relaying the details to the company's executives. The discussions involved importing Lum\u00e9riCo's patented energy systems. When &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; leaked Lum\u00e9riCo documents and emails to the press, these negotiations were revealed to the public. &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt; reported on the incident, claiming that the link between the two companies should be a cause for concern.\nCurrently, Vishkar desires to have a presence in &lt;a href=\"Oasis\"&gt;Oasis&lt;/a&gt;.\nVishkar dispatched its lawyers and \"other, more dangerous forces\" to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Niran%20Pruksamanee\"&gt;Niran Pruksamanee&lt;/a&gt;, demanding that he hand over his &lt;a href=\"biolight\"&gt;biolight&lt;/a&gt; technology to them.\nStone By Stone.\nNot long after Rio, Vishkar was carrying out development in the Indian city of &lt;a href=\"Roshani\"&gt;Roshani&lt;/a&gt;. However, their ground breaking caused a tremor that destroyed a statue of &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; in the neighboring village of &lt;a href=\"Suravasa\"&gt;Suravasa&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sanjay%20Korpal\"&gt;Sanjay Korpal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tamir%20Chada\"&gt;Tamir Chada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harita%20Patel\"&gt;Harita Patel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Satya%20Vaswani\"&gt;Satya Vaswani&lt;/a&gt; convened to discuss the incident. The damage inflicted could jeopardize Vishkar's development contract. Vaswani was sent to Survasa to find out what could be done to compensate the villagers\u2014anything they asked, as the cost of repair was a drop in the bucket compared to Vishkar's development rights.\nAfter ingratiating herself into the local culture, Vaswani conducted a ceremony where she used hard-light to fix the statue. The villagers accepted the reparations."}

He formed an ambitious start-up in Bengaluru, researching methods of manifesting matter through hard-light technology. After years of limited success, many in Bhatt's discipline had run out of funding and pivoted to other fields. However, he achieved a breakthrough via a prototype photon projector, which yielded incredibly powerful destructive crystalline structures. Though not quite what Bhatt had intended, these structures could be tuned to attract carbon molecules. Progress was slower than investors would have liked, but Bhatt was able to use the carbon-cleaning benefits as a selling point. Additional grants were secured by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Global%20Recovery%20Program\"&gt;United Nations Global Recovery Program&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the formation of Vishkar.\nOver the years, Bhatt inspired his team to reach greater and greater heights, imagining a future where hard-light would eliminate housing shortages, transportation issues, even material inequalities. According to those close to him, Bhatt was firm in the belief that hard-light should be accessible to all, and was resistant to the idea of profiting from his designs. He hoped to share the technology with the world before Vishkar implemented restrictions on it. However, Bhatt lost his life in an unfortunate car accident one year before Vishkar's first public offering."}

One of the 12 maps included in the game's release on 24 May 2016. In Overwatch 2, the map is only accessible in &lt;a href=\"Custom%20game\"&gt;Custom games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcade\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, due to the removal of the Assault mode from standard modes.\nOfficial Description.\n&lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; was one of the countries hit hardest by the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, but during the rebuilding process, it rode the wave of the mechanized labor industry's revitalization and entered a period of rapid growth. However, after recent attacks from the long-dormant Siberian &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;, Russia has returned to war footing, guarding its sparkling cities with the massive, human-piloted &lt;a href=\"Svyatogor\"&gt;Svyatogor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;s developed and produced by Volskaya Industries.\nBackground.\nVolskaya Industries is a Russian company involved in Svyatogor production, and is Russia's premier anti-omnic security force. &lt;a href=\"Katya%20Volskaya\"&gt;Katya Volskaya&lt;/a&gt; is its CEO. Based in St. Petersburg, its frigid mechworks are a hotbed for conflict and corporate backstabbing.\nIn more recent times, in light of increased aggression from the Siberian omnium, the company increased production. Shortly after &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Portero\"&gt;Guillermo Portero&lt;/a&gt; stepped down as CEO of &lt;a href=\"Lum%C3%A9riCo\"&gt;Lum\u00e9riCo&lt;/a&gt;, Volskaya experienced a security breach in its network. This was at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, who was able to shut down the company's security systems as she, &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; (all &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; operatives) conducted a raid on the company's mech factory in order to assassinate Katya. Katya survived, but numerous personnel were killed and at least one mech was destroyed.\nGameplay.\nMoving platforms exist in the map.\nA flanking route runs over the left edge of the map. It is usable by &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt; can place her teleporter to get any hero across the gap. However, &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; can place her Ice Wall on the edge of the platform, preventing these heroes from getting across.\nStrategy.\nWith good enough defense, the first gate can be one of the hardest choke points to push through. Fortunately for attacking teams, the large gap to the left of the attackers' spawn can be crossed by many heroes. This leads to an open area which allows the player to get behind the defending team and aid their team in pushing through the choke point. Heroes capable of crossing the gap are &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt; (with help from another teammate), &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt; with much greater difficulty. &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt;, however, can teleport any hero across the gap to allow a fast capture of the point.\nTo prevent the attacking team from crossing the gap, &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; can block most attackers with her &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wall\"&gt;Ice Wall&lt;/a&gt; while crossing. &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt; can also guard the gap with their turrets at the risk of leaving the choke point with fewer strong defense heroes. One way to avoid these counters is to go over the building separating the gap, rather than around it, using D.Va or Pharah, although this can be a difficult maneuver."}

Apprenticeships can be undertaken as early as the age of 16 before graduating into full membership. The Wayfinders have studied ancient ruins and derelict &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;s. It has its own bioarcheology team. The &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Guild\"&gt;Ironclad Guild&lt;/a&gt; provided them with tools.\nHistory.\nOver its history of operation, the Wayfinders have unearthed numerous \"old problems.\" The Society began an excavation and preservation project at &lt;a href=\"Petra\"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt;. The research team started with the uppermost levels of the temple, finding statues of Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. While preparing for excavation of the lower chambers, early imaging revealed a hidden chamber. The Wayfinders also conducted excavations at &lt;a href=\"Ilios\"&gt;Ilios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time, the society had to deal with increasing threats to their research sites. Looters, scavengers, even master thieves would try to steal artifacts recovered by the Wayfinders. Most deadly of all was &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;, which attacked their sites at Ilios. They were driven off by Wayfinder &lt;a href=\"Sloan%20Cameron\"&gt;Sloan Cameron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wayfinders discovered a vein of metal during their excavations at Petra. It appeared to be an unknown isotope of vanadium. The isotope appeared to be utterly indestructible and not reactive save in lab conditions, and containing the isotope with the resources available on-site appeared to be challenging. The &lt;a href=\"Ministries\"&gt;Ministries&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Oasis\"&gt;Oasis&lt;/a&gt; brokered a deal with site director &lt;a href=\"Hamid%20Faisal\"&gt;Hamid Faisal&lt;/a&gt; to transport the material to Oasis for further research.\nTrivia.\n\"Note: The following information is from a gameplay trailer and of dubious canon status.\"\nThe Wayfinder Society operated in &lt;a href=\"Petra\"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt;, where they experienced a number of incidents.

Every hero in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" has at least one weapon. \nOverview.\nAll weapons have a primary fire, but some weapons also possess a secondary fire. Most weapons consume ammo and have a magazine, which if emptied, requires the hero to reload. Some heroes have multiple weapons, which can be switched using 1 and 2. Some heroes also have transformation abilities that give them new weapons.\nA vast majority of the weapons in the game are ranged. Although the effect distance of many weapons is potentially infinite, the effectiveness of a weapon can be limited by damage falloff, bullet spread, or projectile travel speed. Most weapons are fully automatic.\nWeapon types.\nHitscan.\n weapons have no travel time on their shots, meaning that their effects take place immediately when the weapon is fired. Hitscan weapons are subjects to damage falloff, meaning that they'll do less damage at longer distance. The damage at max range is typically 30%. &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt; does not have falloff damage for her scoped shots.\nThere are types of hitscan weapons: pinpoint, spread, and recoil. Pinpoint will have perfect precision at all times. Spread weapon start precise but after a few shots, but then spray erratically. With recoil weapons, your weapon starts pointing upward either after a few shots.\nProjectiles.\nUnlike hitscan weapons, weapons have a travel time on their shots, making it slightly more difficult to score successful hits. To balance that, projectiles have larger hitboxes and, excluding shotguns, do not have damage falloff.\nSome projectiles travel in an arc () rather than a straight line, and some are homing, meaning that they attempt to follow their target, but can miss if they hit a wall or their target leaves their range.\nShotguns.\n weapons fire a large number of pellets over a large spread and can be either hitscan or projectile. They are designed to deal immense amounts of damage at close range and typically experience severe damage falloff, with the range being 10 to 20 meters, or 15 to 30 meters. At maximum range, they do only 30% of their original damage. Due to the spread, shotguns are less effective against enemies with small hitboxes or enemies at long range. The exact spread of a shotgun is random or semi-random.\nExplosives.\nSome weapons fire projectiles that explode upon impact and deal splash damage to enemies in . This explosion also typically contains a &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;knock-back&lt;/a&gt; effect, with the exceptions of &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Photon%20Projector\"&gt;Photon Projector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sigma\"&gt;Sigma&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hyperspheres\"&gt;Hyperspheres&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which instead cause a slight &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;graviton&lt;/a&gt; effect. Explosive weapons cannot headshot.\nSome explosive weapons have self-damage, while others do not. This self-damage is equal to 50% of the splash damage the explosion can do.\nBeams.\nSome weapons are channeled instead of fired and emit a . Beams ignore , , and . Beams cannot headshot and have a finite maximum range. The damage of beam weapons is always reduced by 30% against &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome beams are hitscan-like, meaning they act immediately, while others are projectile-like, meaning there's travel time.\nMelee.\nMelee weapons are short-ranged but have no ammo or reload time. Melee weapons pierce &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt;s and enemies, and ignore and . They can be blocked by and , however. Heroes with melee weapons equipped are generally incapable of using quick melee (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt; using ). Melee weapons cannot &lt;a href=\"headshot\"&gt;headshot&lt;/a&gt;. Some melee weapons have knock-back like quick melee, while others do not.\nWeapon Cosmetics.\nWeapon Variants.\nWeapon variants are weapon &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; that can be purchased using &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Points\"&gt;Competitive Points&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Competitive_Points%23Legacy_Competitive_Points\"&gt;Legacy Competitive Points&lt;/a&gt; that are earned via &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt;. They do not affect gameplay, but rather change the colour of the weapon equipped, such as with &lt;a href=\"Golden%20weapon\"&gt;Golden weapon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWeapon Skins.\nWeapon skins are weapon &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;. They can be bought from the &lt;a href=\"Shop\"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt; using Coins . Weapon Skins change the appearance of a &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;'s weapon regardless of what hero &lt;a href=\"Skins\"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; is equipped. They can be used alongside &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Variants\"&gt;Weapon Variants&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeginning with &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%2011\"&gt;Season 11&lt;/a&gt;, a Weapon Skin rarity has been added. Mythic Weapon Skins can be bought with Mythic Prisms in the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Shop\"&gt;Mythic Shop&lt;/a&gt;, with the base skin costing 50 and subsequent levels unlocking at 10.

They can be used alongside &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Variants\"&gt;Weapon Variants&lt;/a&gt;, to change the material of the weapon skin. Heroes with multiple weapons, such as &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, will have all their weapons changed to the Weapon Skin equipped.\n weapon skins can have additional cosmetic features that make them more unique than default skins, such as unique sounds and visual effects.

Mythic weapon skins can be bought through the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Shop\"&gt;Mythic Shop&lt;/a&gt; at a base level for 50, with further levels costing 10. Further levels of mythic weapon skins can unlock further exclusive sound and visual effects, including a weapon flourish emote, elimination visual effects and reactive effects.\nObtaining.\nEvery hero has a \"Default\" weapon skin, which will be the current hero's skins default weapon. This is, like every common Overwatch 2 skin, already unlocked for every hero.\nLegendary.\n weapon skins can be purchased in the &lt;a href=\"shop\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt; for 1200 each. Typically, when new legendary weapon skins are released into the &lt;a href=\"shop\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt; they are sold individually and as a \"Mega Bundle\", which offer all of those themed weapon skins for ~20% cheaper.\nWhilst they are available in the shop, you can \"Try Out\" the weapon skins through a button option next to the purchase option. By pressing this, the player is sent to the &lt;a href=\"Practice%20Range\"&gt;Practice Range&lt;/a&gt;, where they are loaded directly into the game, skipping the hero selection option, with the weapon skin already equipped. While in the Practice Range, the player can still change heroes as normal and when changing back to the hero with the weapon skin equipped, the weapon skin will still be equipped even if you change that hero's skin.\nMythic.\n weapon skins, like all cosmetics, are purchased through the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Shop\"&gt;Mythic Shop&lt;/a&gt; at a base level for 50. Further levels can be bought for 10, adding further unique effects, such as a weapon flourish emote, elimination visual effects and reactive effects. \nUnlike Legendary weapon skins, Mythic weapon skins have a consistent release pattern. From &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%2011\"&gt;season 11&lt;/a&gt; onwards, each &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt; features a new mythic weapon skin available in the Mythic Shop during the mid-season patch. \nSimilar to Legendary weapon skins, there is the option to \"Try Out\" the weapon skin in the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Shop\"&gt;Mythic Shop&lt;/a&gt;, loading the player into the &lt;a href=\"Practice%20Range\"&gt;Practice Range&lt;/a&gt; with the weapon skin equipped to the hero, fully upgraded to the maximum level, for players to test out.

However, in &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt;, it may not always work to group up if your friends are too far from your rank. That\u2019s why we\u2019re introducing \u201cWide Groups\u201d in &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season 10&lt;/a&gt;, and you\u2019ll now be able to play with your friends in &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive&lt;/a&gt; no matter their &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt;.\nSo what, exactly, is a Wide Group? A Wide Group is when the highest and lowest ranked players are too far apart in Skill Tier and Divisions. Any groups with Diamond or lower ranked players that are more than five Skill Divisions apart are a Wide Group. Any groups with Masters players that are more than three Skill Divisions apart are also Wide Groups. Finally, any groups that have a Grand Masters or Champion Player are also Wide Groups regardless of how many Skill Divisions apart they are.\nWith this new queue option comes some tradeoffs. For one, queue times will be longer as we work to pair you with other wide groups, using Role Delta tech to ensure the match is as close as possible. For example, a Wide Group with a Platinum player and Bronze player will be matched against another group with similar skill distribution to try and deliver the fairest match possible. However, some matches may not appear to be as balanced as you may encounter opponents who are very different in skill level than you are. Thankfully though, such encounters won\u2019t necessarily have as much of an impact on your progress in the Competitive ranks.\nThere will also be a new Modifier at the end of a match when playing in a Wide Group. It wouldn\u2019t be fair for lower-skilled players to be directly boosted to higher ranks when they group with higher-skilled players, so some groups, depending on the skill gap, are likely to see little to no change in their skill progression. This helps ensure that high-skilled players don\u2019t boost their lower-ranked friends."}

She is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nWidowmaker equips herself with whatever it takes to eliminate her targets, including mines that dispense poisonous gas, a visor that grants her squad infra-sight, and a powerful sniper rifle that can fire in fully-automatic mode.\nStrategy.\nWidowmaker is the archetypical sniper of Overwatch. Equipped with a powerful sniper rifle, her ability to eliminate all Damage and Support heroes (except &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;) with a single headshot from extreme distances makes her long range damage unmatched. She can hold sightlines like no one else, and if left uncontested by the enemy, can pick them off one by one. Additionally, playing Widowmaker is relatively easy, provided you can hit your shots, as all of her power lies on her sniper and her abilities only support her gameplay and do not require much skill to use. A good Widowmaker that holds a strong position and hits their shots is an incredible threat and can carry games by themselves.\nBeing a powerful ranged hero, Widowmaker's weaknesses primarily lie in her close range capabilities. Having 175 HP and only a measly automatic fire to work with, she will prove to be relatively helpless without support when enemies close the distance on you. Furthermore, being a sniper means you will have to be positioned in the backline, away from your team and the objective which means you may be caught without your team to protect you from enemy flankers. Ironically however, the single biggest threat to a Widowmaker is an enemy Widowmaker. As you will both be playing the same sightlines, if you're not aware of her presence, you may end up getting sniped yourself. Not to mention, if the enemy Widowmaker is more skilled, you may find yourself losing the sniper duel often. Widowmaker is also relatively map dependent, being stronger on maps with long sightlines, lots of high ground and cover such as &lt;a href=\"Circuit%20Royal\"&gt;Circuit Royal&lt;/a&gt; and weaker on maps with less of these. \nStory.\n\"One shot, one kill.\"\nWidowmaker is the perfect assassin: a patient, ruthlessly efficient killer who shows neither emotion nor remorse. Once, her only two loves were dancing and her &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Lacroix\"&gt;husband&lt;/a&gt;, but now, her only joy is found in the moment of the kill. An unstoppable killer, Widowmaker\u2019s crosshairs are perhaps the most dangerous place in the world.\nWidowmaker does not keep track of the number of people she's killed, and prefers to work alone. She is unaffected by low temperatures.\nBackground.\nOrigins.\nAm\u00e9lie Guillard grew up in her family's ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Chateau%20Guillard\"&gt;Chateau Guillard&lt;/a&gt;, located near Annecy in rural &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. Dance became Am\u00e9lie\u2019s only escape from the crumbling manor and her conservative family, who had always urged her to follow the aristocracy\u2019s tenets of decorum and tradition.\nFor much of her life, she was known as an accomplished ballet dancer in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. She married &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A9rard%20Lacroix\"&gt;G\u00e9rard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent spearheading operations against the &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; terrorist organization. Am\u00e9lie gave little thought to her husband's career outside the interesting topic it made for dinner parties; she could hardly have guessed at the danger his job put her in.\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to eliminate G\u00e9rard, Talon decided to change its focus to his wife. In the dead of night, Talon operatives kidnapped Am\u00e9lie and subjected her to an intense program of neural reconditioning. They broke her will, creating a sleeper agent. Gerard devoted Overwatch's every resource to recovering his wife, and it wasn't long before the operation produced results. His agents saved Am\u00e9lie, and a medical and psychological evaluation after the kidnapping found her to be apparently no worse for wear. \nTwo weeks later she killed G\u00e9rard in his sleep. \nAssassin.\nAm\u00e9lie was hunted by police and Overwatch alike, but more than that, she was haunted by the way murdering her husband had made her feel. The moment of the kill was the most alive Am\u00e9lie had ever felt. With few other options left, Am\u00e9lie returned to Talon, chasing the high that had both thrilled and terrified her. At her behest, Talon completed the process of turning her into a living weapon. She was given extensive training in covert arts, and agreed to participate in an experimental marksman program, where she was \"trained by the best\" in the use of a sniper rifle. Talon\u2019s geneticist, &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt;, altered Am\u00e9lie\u2019s physiology to improve her aim, drastically slowing her heart, which turned her skin cold and blue, and numbed her ability to experience human emotion. It dulled the pain of what she\u2019d done, while heightening the charge she felt on the hunt. The slowing of her heart rate allowed her to become an exceptional sniper. Thanks to Talon's experiments Am\u00e9lie was gone, replaced by \"Widowmaker,\" Talon's most effective assassin, and feeling little save the satisfaction of a job well done. As far as Overwatch knew, she had been kidnapped.\nLegacy.\nWidowmaker was present in an anti-Talon operation conducted by Overwatch, as a force led by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; rescued a number of scientists that Talon had taken hostage. While Overwatch was successful in this regard, Widowmaker was able to take out a number of agents. The operation led to a sniper duel between her and Agent Amari, as they made their way throughout the urban terrain. Ana was able to temporarily incapacitate Widowmaker, hitting her in her helmet. But upon seeing Widowmaker's face, she froze, recognizing Am\u00e9lie. It was all the time Widowmaker needed to take her own shot, shooting Ana through the scope of her rifle and into her cybernetic eye.\nCode of Violence.\nOne year after the fall of Overwatch, Widowmaker took part in a mission to retrieve Dr. Siebren de Kuiper from a black site within the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; were assigned to clear out the facility, while Widowmaker and her team were assigned with exfiltration. &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; promised her a clear path into the facility. During the operation, Sombra and Reaper triggered the alarm, but the reinforcements summoned to de Kuiper's lab were slaughtered by Widowmaker and her team. Meeting Sombra and Reaper, Widowmaker blithly commented that the mission had been too important to leave to amateurs.\nOutside the base, Widowmaker and her troops loaded de Kuiper onto a &lt;a href=\"dropship\"&gt;dropship&lt;/a&gt;, before subsequently departing.\nAlive.\nWidowmaker was sent to &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Tekhartha%20Mondatta\"&gt;Tekhartha Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shambali%20Organization\"&gt;Shambali Organization&lt;/a&gt; leader, as he made a speech. As she made her way to her vantage point, she reflected upon how she had been frightened of spiders as a child, drawing an implicit comparison to Widowmaker herself -- neither one felt emotion or had a beating heart. She lowered herself, upside-down, off the side of a building using her grappling hook and began to line up her shot. However, unbeknownst to her, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; was also at the speech. Just before she could press the trigger, she was distracted by Tracer &lt;a href=\"Tracer%23Blink\"&gt;blinking&lt;/a&gt; through the air towards her, pistols firing. The two engaged in a rooftop chase as Mondatta was ushered away, having been warned by Tracer. In the end, Tracer's pulsebomb backfired and blew both of them into the air. As she fell, Widowmaker took careful aim, and fired a single bullet at the center of Tracer's &lt;a href=\"chronal%20accelerator\"&gt;chronal accelerator&lt;/a&gt;. Tracer blinked forward, and the bullet sped on\u2014straight into Mondatta, killing him moments before he entered his limousine. Tracer tackled her to the rooftop, demanding to know why she would do such a thing, but as a Talon aircraft arrived to retrieve her, Widowmaker just chuckled, whispered, \"Adieu, ch\u00e9rie,\" (\"Farewell, darling,\") and flipping the pair over the edge of the roof, slammed Tracer into the building's wall below them. Leaving incapacitated Tracer behind, as Widowmaker was spirited away from London she reflected that spiders did indeed feel\u2014when they kill.\nShe later reflected that her assassination of Mondatta was one of her finest kills.\nDay at the Museum.\nWidowmaker teamed up with &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; as part of an attempt to recover &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s gauntlet from the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Museum\"&gt;Overwatch Museum&lt;/a&gt;. She was hindered in this by &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; however. The mission was further complicated by a &lt;a href=\"Brian\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt; stealing the gauntlet, and using it against her. After Tracer disarmed her, she made an escape with Reaper using her grapple, though both agents engaged in pursuit.\nInfiltration.\nAlongside Reaper and &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, Widowmaker was assigned to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Katya%20Volskaya\"&gt;Katya Volskaya&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of &lt;a href=\"Volskaya%20Industries\"&gt;Volskaya Industries&lt;/a&gt;. Sombra was able to take down the facility's security system, allowing Widowmaker and Reaper access to the site. Widowmaker lined up her sights from a vantage point, and waited for Katya to enter her field of fire. She almost did, but an alarm sounded, sending the base into high alert and Katya to her fortified office. Widowmaker tried to salvage the shot anyway but narrowly missed the CEO, instead shattering the lower half of her hanging right earring. Reaper ordered her to stay put while he took her out, but he was waylaid by a &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;. Sombra engaged in pursuit, but reported that Katya had escaped. Reaper ordered that the operatives return to their ship.\nReflections.\nDuring Christmas, Widowmaker took a visit to G\u00e9rard's resting place. She left a rose on her husband's grave.\nMasquerade.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; was freed from his prison by Reaper, he rendezvoused with Widowmaker at a casino in Monaco. He complimented her for her assassination of Mondatta. Sombra, who was on the same channel, told Doomfist to ask her about her failure to assassinate Volskaya, but Doomfist shut down the conversation. Doomfist met with &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt; at a game table; Widowmaker partook in the game while they discussed matters pertaining to Talon. She won quite a few chips, but the game was interrupted by Talon agents sent by &lt;a href=\"Vialli\"&gt;Vialli&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate Doomfist. The pair fought them off and departed, headed for &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;. There, Widowmaker, Reaper, and Sombra eliminated Talon agents loyal to Vialli, while Doomfist killed Vialli himself.\nHomecoming.\nWidowmaker returned to her ancestral home at some point.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nWidowmaker has her roots in \"&lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;\". She stems in part from the Ranger class. The Ranger had a sniper rifle, an assault rifle, and a rifle that could transform into a turret. Widowmaker got the sniper rifle, while the assault rifle and transforming turret went to and &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nIn the original pitch for \"Prometheus\", the class was named Longshot and wielded a sniper rifle and machine pistol, and had the Grappling Hook and Recon Visor abilities. Longshot would appear in a later pitch for the game with a new design more closely resembling Widowmaker, and was also featured prominently in the \"Prometheus\" \"hero lineup\" key art.\nThe first concept for Widowmaker was to create a ranged sniper character. She was one of the easiest characters to animate in the game, and was one of the first three characters designed for \"Overwatch\", alongside Tracer and Reaper. Her venom mine ability originally created a much larger and deadlier explosion.\nOriginally, her assault mode was the only assault hit-scan type that didn't suffer from damage falloff. This was changed with the rework of damage falloff for all hitscan heroes.\nOverwatch 2.\nWidowmaker was redesigned for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Concepts included a more insectoid design and a treasure hunter appearance. The redesign shifted to a cyberpunk appearance, making her appear more \"upgraded\". Her hairstyles were also experimented with, while aiming to keep her signatuer long ponytail, they ultimately landed on a braid which helped preserve her original silhouette."}

{"id": "360", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=360", "title": "Winston", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". He is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nWinston wields impressive inventions\u2014a jump pack, electricity-blasting Tesla Cannon, portable shield projector and more\u2014with literal gorilla strength.\nStrategy.\nStrengths.\nWinston is one of the game's most mobile Tanks, capable of crossing vast distances in a single leap to bring the fight to his enemies. His Tesla Cannon can't be blocked by a general barrier, given its splash effect, making it very dangerous to most low-health heroes. The agility provided by his Jump Pack makes him a persistent menace that can easily disrupt any enemy team through constant harassment. Barrier Projector is his method of defense for himself or his teammates for a short duration. With the barrier being bubble-shaped, it can be one of the best barriers in the game. Primal Rage not only saves his life by increasing both his current and maximum health, it also greatly reduces the cooldown of Jump Pack and replaces his Tesla Cannon with melee attacks that can disrupt any enemy hit by it. He is of great use for diving into an open space and disrupting enemies.\nWeaknesses.\nMuch like &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, however, he is only capable of fighting at short range, and he is not nearly as consistently durable as the other Tanks. His damage output is considered to be lowest of its class, as any enemy healer will reduce the effectiveness of his weapon or even negate it. His personal barrier is very weak and has a very lengthy cooldown, not suited to be used as a main defensive tool. He has to make use of his Primal Rage to disrupt the enemies as much as possible; otherwise, it is a great ultimate battery due to his higher health and larger collision.\nStory.\n\"Imagination Is The Essence Of Discovery.\"\nA super-intelligent, genetically engineered gorilla, Winston is a brilliant scientist and a champion for humanity's potential. Since a young age, he has shown limitless curiosity for the world around him, but also has a fondness for stories, especially those passed down from generation to generation. By his own admission, he tends to overthink things, is a perfectionist, and tends to ramble. As an ape among humans, he gets regular remarks on this subject, including references to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong\"&gt;old video games&lt;/a&gt;. As a gorilla, his strength is exceptional.\nWhen Winston loses his temper, Winston becomes a raging ape. In his off-time, he enjoys peanut butter and bananas. He has stated/joked that his love of the former is due to his genetic therapy. Due to the amount of time he spent on the moon, he has to take supplements to keep his bones in good condition.\nHorizon Lunar Colony.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20Lunar%20Colony\"&gt;Horizon Lunar Colony&lt;/a&gt; was established as a first step for humanity's renewed exploration of space. Among its residents was a group of genetically enhanced gorillas that were intended to test the effects of prolonged habitation in space.\nOne gorilla, designated Specimen 28, displayed such rapid brain development from the gene therapy that he was taken under the wing of Dr. &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Winston\"&gt;Harold Winston&lt;/a&gt;, who taught him science and inspired him with tales of human ingenuity. One day, after the young ape had stolen Harold's glasses, Harold showed the ape Earth just as they were over Africa, as it appeared from the moon (prior to this, the ape had only seen the barren moonscape). Harold told him to not see the world how it was, but how it could be.\nThe young gorilla passed his days assisting with the scientists' experiments, watching the distant blue world outside his habitat window, dreaming of the endless possibilities that awaited him there. He enjoyed life at Horizon, and regarded the human scientists as his family, and Dr. Winston his father, who taught him science and engineering. In time, he also became good friends with the hamster subject designated Specimen 8, or \"&lt;a href=\"Hammond\"&gt;Hammond&lt;/a&gt;\". Lexigrams were used as part of his education process, and one day on Lunar New Year, Dr. Winston challenged the young ape to read \"Journey to the West\". The gorilla's imagination was captured by the heroic monk Tang Sanzang and his ragtag group of disciples' quest for redemption. As a result, the ape was reminded of his younger days every Lunar New Year; Dr Winston telling him the story remained one of his most treasured memories.\nBut his life was thrown into chaos when the other gorillas led an uprising, killed the mission scientists, and claimed the colony for their own. With nothing left, and unwanted by his fellow gorillas, the ape took on the name of his beloved human caretaker. So named \"Winston,\" the ape built a makeshift rocket using Emergency Pod G-42, using designs he'd found in Horizon's computer system. In truth, the rocket had been designed by &lt;a href=\"Hammond\"&gt;Hammond&lt;/a&gt;. Winston escaped from Launch Bay 14 to Earth, landing at . \nOverwatch.\nHaving landed on Earth, Winston found a new home with &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that represented everything he had come to admire about humanity. Winston was finally able to live up to the heroic ideal that had been instilled in him. However, he knew that one day, he would have to return to his former home.\nWhile in Overwatch, Winston looked up to &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; appears to have detested his presence within the organization. &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; once asked him to feature in a movie. While a member, he paid his taxes to the Swiss government. Overwatch enforced restrictions on his research, and while Winston chaffed at this, he understood that a measure of caution was needed.\nWinston met &lt;a href=\"Fareeha%20Amari\"&gt;Fareeha Amari&lt;/a&gt; at least once when she was a child. He let her ride on his back, much to her delight.\nTracer.\nWinston was responsible for designing the &lt;a href=\"chronal%20accelerator\"&gt;chronal accelerator&lt;/a&gt;, providing a solution to &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;'s chronal disassociation. Winston would watch over Tracer's training at the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;Overwatch Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of Dr. &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, and believed that if she showed no signs of trouble, she would be ready for active duty.\nGraduation.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, Winston became a member of the Overwatch strike team, alongside Tracer and &lt;a href=\"Genji%20Shimada\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt;.\nStorm Rising.\nUnder the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt; six years before the present day, Winston took part in an operation in &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; alongside Mercy, Tracer, and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;. Their objective was to apprehend &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt;, who was travelling through the city in an armored convoy. The Overwatch team engaged, with Winston destroying a number of &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; vehicles. This included Maximilien's limo, but when Winston got to the wreck, he found that the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; had fled. Tracer reassured him that he wouldn't get far on foot, but Sojourn warned them against overconfidence.\nThe team tracked Maximilien down. In exchange for leniency, he agreed to arrange a \"meeting\" with &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, informing them that Talon's leader would be in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; in three weeks.\nDoomfist.\nOverwatch acted on Maximilien's intel. Alongside Genji and Tracer, Winston fought Doomfist in Singapore. Winston initially tried to defeat Doomfist using his tesla cannon, but was ineffective, and he was sent hurtling. He eventually came to his feet, but not before Tracer and Genji had been incapacitated. Unleashing his primal rage, Winston charged Doomfist directly, and engaged him in close quarters. Winston defeated Doomfist, who was imprisoned. A newspaper article of the time coined the phrase \"primal punch\" (even though Winston didn't appear to have actually said that) when reporting on the event. Years after the event, this catchphrase remained associated with Winston's actions.\nPost-Overwatch.\nAfter the fall of Overwatch, Winston again went into seclusion, once again cut off from the world he believed in, but longing for the days of heroism to return. In the years that followed, he saw that the world's problems were growing, and saw Overwatch (or rather, its return) as the solution to all of them.\nLondon Calling.\nWhen Tracer attempted to fix the grid of the &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, Winston sent her a regulator.\nRecall.\nWhile taking a break in his lab at during the development of the barrier projector, Winston was pondering once again whether he should give Overwatch agents a recall order when the base came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; operatives led by &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;. With Winston distracted by Talon, Reaper infected Athena with a virus and attempted to download the Overwatch agent database, which would give the current location of any agent. Winston managed to best the operatives and Reaper, stop the download and quarantine the virus at the last moment. After the close call and restoring the system, he made his decision and initiated the recall. When Tracer received the signal she immediately called Winston, delighted to hear from him.\nWinston told him about Reaper's attack, but their conversation was cut short, as Tracer was called aside to help the omnics in the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. Winston called out to her, that the parts he sent were only meant to be temporary, but it was too late, as she rushed out of her appartment.\nReunion.\nWinston headed to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and met with &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; in the Underworld, in the midst of fleeing omnics under the command of &lt;a href=\"Kace\"&gt;Kace&lt;/a&gt;. Her chronal accelerator gave out, but he arrived in time to use his barrier projector to protect both of them from the omnics' gunfire. He used his tesla cannon to incapacitate them.\nWinston followed Tracer to the omnics she was helping (those not allied with Kace). She ordered &lt;a href=\"Iggy\"&gt;Iggy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lizzy\"&gt;Lizzy&lt;/a&gt; to head to the Underworld's entrance, while she and Winston would draw his forces deeper into the Underworld. Heading in deep, they found Kace and his followers at the Underworld's grid. This presented a problem, for if they opened fire, they risked damaging the grid. Tracer suggested that she could get in close, but Winston pointed out that with her accelerator glitching, she wouldn't be able to.\nThe scenario changed as Iggy led a group of omnics to confront Kace. Her speech got Kace's followers to drop their weapons. Kace, refusing to relent, fired his pistol at Iggy. Tracer used her accelrator to blink forward to intercept the bullet. She succeeded, but she was severely wounded, as due to the accelerator's malfunction, the bullet hit her over and over, rather than the damage being reversed via her usual rewind ability. Winston carried her comatose body out of the Underworld and got her to a hospital, where after eight hours in surgery, she pulled through.\nA week later, Tracer had fully healed, and Winston had repaired her accelerator. He told her that he'd looked up what info he could on Kace, but hadn't found anything to suggest that he was connected to &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;. However, he did feel that there might be a tie to &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. In better news, he reported that he and Lizzy had managed to repair the Underworld's grid. Which left the remaining question as to whether Tracer was ready for the next battle, to which Tracer responded in the affirmative.\nAre You With Us?\nWith the intent of reforming Overwatch, Winston prepared a speech to try and get its former agents to come back to the organization. After spending most of his day trying and failing to deliver it, Winston delivered the frank truth that while the world had turned against them, the state of the world showed the need for Overwatch to return. Set to repeat on the Overwatch emergency frequency, the signal reached the damaged satellite dish at , and automatically brought &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; out of cryostasis.\nDay at the Museum.\nSometime later, Winston got back in action when Reaper and &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; attempted to retrieve Doomfist's gauntlet. Teaming up with &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; however, he was able to stop the heist, and engaged in pursuit of the villains.\nReturn to Gibraltar.\n\"Note: The timing of these events is unclear\u2014Winston's meeting with Mei has to occur before \"Reflections\", but the satellite launch can occur at any point post-\"Recall\".\nAs part of his intent to reform Overwatch, Winston returned to Watchpoint: Gibraltar, an old Overwatch outpost that had once stood guard over the Mediterranean. He intended to launch a satellite drone in an effort to restore Overwatch's communications network. The drone was successfully launched, and he looked on with pride.\nWhile at Gibraltar, Winston met Mei, who had emerged from . She didn't stay long, instead seeking to re-establish Overwatch's ecological research network. He suggested that she keep a journal, telling her that people would find her \"unique\" perspective interesting. Mei obliged.\nReflections.\nDuring the holiday season after Overwatch's recall, Winston invited Tracer to dinner with him in Gibraltar. Believing that Tracer had missed their gathering, Winston told Athena that they were likely alone again for Christmas. Athena sarcastically began \"party mode,\" causing Winston to chuckle. He then reminisced over a photo of a young him and Dr. &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Winston\"&gt;Harold Winston&lt;/a&gt;, and wondered how everyone else was spending the holidays. Before Winston began eating, Tracer arrived with her girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Emily\"&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt;. Tracer endearingly apologized to Winston, calling him \"big guy,\" before the three of them embraced in a hug. The three then began celebrating the holidays over a special meal.\nBlizzard World.\nAlongside &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;, Winston watched an ad for &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20World\"&gt;Blizzard World&lt;/a&gt;.\nZero Hour.\nOver a year after sending out the recall, Winston's dream of a reformed Overwatch appeared to be faltering, as since sending it out, only Tracer and Mei had joined him in his group. Regardless, when &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Winston, Mei, and Tracer headed to the city in the &lt;a href=\"Orca\"&gt;Orca&lt;/a&gt;. Mei asked if the three of them were enough for the mission. Winston assured her that if they stuck together, things would be fine, but looking at a picture of the original Overwatch group, commented that if they were going to show up, now would be a good time. Arriving over the city, Tracer told Winston to clear a spot for them to land, and that they'd be right behind him. He jumped out of the Orca, destroying multiple &lt;a href=\"Nullifier\"&gt;Nullifier&lt;/a&gt;s and allowing the craft to land. The trio made headway initially, but had to deal with the arrival of a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;. Winston and Mei were both injured by its chest laser, and Tracer said that they couldn't stay here. Outnumbered and outgunned by the advancing omnics, Winston told Tracer to get Mei and the civilians to safety while he held off Null Sector. Mei weakly pointed out that he'd said that they'd stick together, but Winston stated that he'd be right behind them.\nWinston faced down the omnics alone, but was saved at the last minute by &lt;a href=\"Genji%20Shimada\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt;. The ninja was just the beginning of Overwatch members arriving to join the fight, including &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt; (accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Lindholm\"&gt;Brigitte Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;. The new arrivals were able to clear out the Nullifiers, but that still left the matter of the Titan. Winston had the idea of combining Mei's backpack (the power source of her blaster) with Tracer's pulse bomb. The plan worked, as Tracer was able to plant the modified explosive inside the Titan, freezing it, before the behemoth shattered. The day won, a police officer asked if Overwatch had returned. Taking his place as the group's de facto leader, Winston proudly declared that Overwatch had indeed returned.\nA New War.\nAfter Paris, Winston and the others traveled to , which they used as their base of operations. Winston installed a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20Mastery\"&gt;simulator&lt;/a&gt; in the base to help the team's new recruits master their skills, in preparation for their battles against Null Sector.\nAs it turned out, Null Sector's attack on Paris was simply the prelude to a global invasion. Winston pointed out that Null Sector wasn't the only threat Overwatch had to deal with. He declared that they'd had to fight their way through one city at a time. Winston sought to recruit &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; back into Overwatch. \nPrior to departing for Rio, Winston was contacted by UN Secretary-general &lt;a href=\"Osei\"&gt;Osei&lt;/a&gt;, who while appreciative of the grim situation the world found itself in, reminded Winston that Overwatch activity was still prohibited under international law. She gave him one warning to cease all activity, and warned Winston not to make an enemy of her. Late at night, he conversed with Tracer via texting, admitting that he was scared. He'd initiated the recall, which meant that whatever happened next, he was ultimately responsible. Tracer told him something that Emily had once told her\u2014\"do the right thing as hard as you can, apologize later.\" Winston thanked her for the advice. Later, &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; conversed with him via texts, confirming that the robots they'd fought in Paris weren't omnics, but rather non-sentient robots, and recently produced ones at that. Winston thanked her for the analysis.\nResistance.\nWinston and the rest of Overwatch deployed to &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; when it was attacked by Null Sector. They teamed up with &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; and were able to blunt the initial attack, though L\u00facio warned that as long as Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; remained airborne, the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s would just keep coming. Formulating a plan, Winston and Mercy worked on getting the civilians to safety, while the rest of the team split up between keeping Null Sector busy and taking the fight directly to the command ship. The plan worked, and the command ship's core was destabilized. Winston and the team successfully made it aboard before the command ship was destroyed.\nWith L\u00facio in tow, Winston and the team returned to Watchpoint: Gibraltar, where they were greeted by &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; and a small group he'd managed to wrangle up as reinforcements. Winston acknowledged their odds had improved, but stressed that they had to be tactical, as Null Sector's forces were too large to take on directly. On the subject of tactics, Cassidy pointed out that if they wanted to make this work, they had one last person to recruit\u2014&lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Chase\"&gt;Vivian Chase&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the reunion, Winston used &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Tower%20Chat\"&gt;Ivory Tower Chat&lt;/a&gt; to converse with a group known as the &lt;a href=\"White%20Hat%20Hackers\"&gt;White Hat Hackers&lt;/a&gt;. He needed their help in reactivating Overwatch's old satellite network. &lt;a href=\"HarOLD_20XX\"&gt;HarOLD_20XX&lt;/a&gt; told Winston that he should have news in a few hours.\nLiberation.\nWinston and the rest of Overwatch deployed at &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, which was still under attack by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; after days of fighting. After reuniting with Sojourn, she explained that Null Sector had control over most of the city, and were rounding up omnics. Overwatch commenced an op to evacuate the city. During the fighting, they saw Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt;s put strange clamps on omnics, incapacitating, and heard &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;'s propaganda. While the city's civilians were evacuated, Toronto was lost, and there was no way to get the clamps off. Winston and Cassidy urged Sojourn to rejoin Overwatch, Winston reminding her of her tactical acumen, and Cassidy pointing out that Jack Morrison was off chasing ghosts. Sojourn reluctantly agreed to join, but reminded Winston that Overwatch had been shut down for a reason.\nBack in Watchpoint: Gibraltar, Winston restarted his communication with the White Hat Hackers. HarOLD_20XX directed Winston's attention to an old Overwatch satellite decommissioned by the UN, but he used a drone to restart it. To Winston's joy, this allowed him to see live footage from all over the world. However, HarOLD_20XX warned him against relying on the satellite too much, as the connection wasn't stable enough for long-term use. If it gave out during one of Winston's missions, people could get killed.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nWinston's origin lies in a piece of concept art labelled \"Orangutank.\" The design team liked the idea of an ape hero, but wasn't sure how it could fit in. A back and forth ensued between the game design and art team about how it could work.\nWinston was one of the hardest characters to animate due to the numerous armor pieces he wears. His rage mode also presented problems due to the changes in movement animation. His design was \"top-down\" (where developers start with story/art/flavor elements and develop abilities around those ideas afterwards). One of the points of discussion was whether Winston would be sapient. During development, a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde idea was considered for him.\nDuring development he was equipped with a flak shotgun.\nExternal links.\n "}

The Winter Fair allowed players to pick and choose from a variety of cosmetics available, all purchasable through a new currency unique to the event, called Tickets. Whilst most cosmetics available were new or festive re-colours of other &lt;a href=\"Skins\"&gt;Skins&lt;/a&gt;, this event did see the return of &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;'s Kerrigan skin which was originally only available in a &lt;a href=\"limited-time%20event\"&gt;limited-time event&lt;/a&gt; during a crossover with &lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. \nTickets.\nTickets could be earned in the Winter Fair Event Pass. Players could earn tickets every 9 games played, with Wins counting as double. The Winer Fair Event pass had 2 available tracks, the \"Free\" track and \"Premium\" track. Players could purchase the \"Premium\" track with 500 . After 9 games, players would earn 10 tickets from the \"Free\" track and an additional 30 from the \"Premium\" track. The \"Free\" track provided players with a total of 120 Tickets, while the \"Premium\" track provided a total of 480. \nTo purchase all the cosmetics, you required 690 Tickets, meaning purchasing the \"Premium\" pass wouldn't provide enough for all cosmetics. However, through the \"Winter Bundle\" available in the &lt;a href=\"shop\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt; at the time for 3000 , you would receive 575 tickets alongwith &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;s Formalwear skins and other cosmetics. The 575 tickets from the bundle and 120 tickets from the \"Free\" pass, would be enough to unlock all cosmetics without needing to purchase the \"Premium\" pass. \nAt the end of the event, any remaining tickets would be converted to Credits .\nGamemodes.\nMei's Snowball Offensive.\nMei's Snowball Offensive is a 5v5 brawl that takes place on or &lt;a href=\"Black%20Forest\"&gt;Black Forest&lt;/a&gt;.

Tonight, in zomnic-haunted streets beneath the full moon glow, four more heroes would face a new peril. They would suffer the Wrath of the Bride.\"\nWrath of the Bride is a co-operative brawl that is exclusive to the &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Terror\"&gt;Halloween Terror&lt;/a&gt; event. It is a PvE that takes place in the fictional land of Adlersbrunn, which is based on &lt;a href=\"Eichenwalde\"&gt;Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvent Details.\n\"Our tale is about to begin...\"\nThis is a four player co-op event that situates the players into using only four of the characters. Players may only use &lt;a href=\"Junker%20Queen\"&gt;Junker Queen&lt;/a&gt; (The Butcher), &lt;a href=\"Ashe\"&gt;Ashe&lt;/a&gt; (The Outlaw), &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt; (The Sleuth) and &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt; (The Fortune Teller).\nThere are four different difficulty levels for this event, named \"Story\", \"Hard\", \"Expert\", and \"Legendary\". During the brawl, players are given a performance rating, indicated by the stars on the top of the HUD. In Story, two stars are locked, one is locked in Hard and all stars can be obtained in Expert and Legendary. Players' health and ultimate status are displayed in the bottom-left corner of the screen. \nMaps.\nThe event uses a modified version of &lt;a href=\"Eichenwalde\"&gt;Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Adlersbrunn\"&gt;Adlersbrunn&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnemies.\nIn the event, the main enemies are the &lt;a href=\"Zomnic\"&gt;Zomnic&lt;/a&gt;s, creations of Dr. Junkenstein.\nZomnics.\nBasic &lt;a href=\"Zomnic\"&gt;Zomnic&lt;/a&gt;s are scatered around the map, and will explode if the player gets to close to one. It deals X damage upon explosion.\nZombardier.\n&lt;a href=\"Zomnic%23Zombardier\"&gt;Zombardiers&lt;/a&gt; are much tougher than their Zomnic counterparts, but move little after spawning. They shoot energy projectiles, which look and behave similar to Zarya's alternative fire. They have more health than a normal Zomnic and can attack directly, but they are easy to defeat due to being almost stationary.\nTheir shots deal 30 damage on story mode, 60 on hard and expert, and 90 on legendary to each hero.\nShock-Tire.\nThe Shock-Tire is a modified version of &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt;'s Rip-Tire, and it inflicts less damage. It will not be able to kill a full-health hero in one hit if they are caught in its blast, but will severely injure them. The Shock-Tire is extremely hard to hit due to its unpredictable movement\nBosses.\nIn this event brawl, there are Bosses who are &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; (The Banshee), &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; (The Gargoyles), &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; (The Marionette), &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt; (The Summoner), and &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; (The Experiment). These versions of the characters have an immense amount of health pools and aren't so easily dispatched. They all have specific orders in when they'll come out and there are strategies to combat them. They can all use their Ultimate Abilities, and are all indicated by a special sound and an introduction from Reinhardt.\nThe only enemy unable to be defeated is &lt;a href=\"Sigma\"&gt;Sigma&lt;/a&gt; (The Unstoppable Ghost).\nThe Banshee.\n\"'The Banshee\" appears after the key for the door is found, appearing to the player who grabbed it as a jumpscare. She will then appear in the capture point, along with some Zombardiers. The Banshee uses &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira's&lt;/a&gt; abilities, excluding the healing Biotic Orb. She will use Coalescence at least one time.\nThe Gargoyles.\nThe Gargoyles appear when the players gather at the ramparts. Statues can be seen in the surrounding area, perched on a few platforms. A Garoyle will appear and dive onto the players. The high ground is still accessible to players, however a movement ability will be needed to get over the wall to access it. The Gargoyle uses &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston's&lt;/a&gt; abilities, as well as his ultimate, Primal Rage.\nThe Marionette.\nThe Marionette appears in a nightmare after taking the dungeon shortcut. In every difficulty besides Story, The Marionette uses the same abilities as &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;, except for Flight and Duplication.\nThe Summoner.\nThe Summoner will appear in front of the castle gate after making it through the dungeons. A Gargoyle will accompany her. Shortly after spawning, she will deploy a Photon Barrier which will last for a set duration. The Summoner also uses &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra's&lt;/a&gt; sentry turrets.\nThe Unstoppable Ghost.\nThe Unstoppable Ghost will appear once players have entered the castle. Much like the Vengeful Ghost from Junkenstein's Revenge, he will follow you around with an aura that damages the player. He can't be defeated or removed by the player.\nThe Experiment.\nThe Experiment appears in the room just past the locked doors in the hallway. The Experiment will use the same abilities as &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, except for Configuration: Artillery."}

{"id": "23946", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23946", "title": "Wrecking Ball", "text": " is a &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 24 July 2018, he is the 28th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nWrecking Ball rolls across the battlefield, using his arsenal of weapons and his mech\u2019s powerful body to crush his enemies.\nStrategy.\nAs an offense-oriented tank hero, Wrecking Ball's greatest strength lies in his high mobility, which he uses to disrupt the enemy team by forcing them out of position and initiating team fights. A good Wrecking Ball is excellent at establishing area control, knowing when and how to engage and disengage the enemy to create opportunities for his teammates. He can do so at will by switching between walker and ball mode as the situation changes. The dual machine guns deployed in walker mode provide a hitscan-ranged attack in exchange for mobility, while ball mode allows Wrecking Ball to damage enemies up close and quickly travel across the battlefield. Wrecking Ball's grappling hook allows him to tether to a surface to either gain vertical positioning and acceleration or to inflict contact damage within an area at top speed. Should he find himself outnumbered, Wrecking Ball can generate temporary shields to block incoming damage, which increase with the number of enemies nearby. Lastly, Wrecking Ball has strong area denial by deploying a mine field, which inflict heavy damage to any enemy that comes into detonation range. \nWhile Wrecking Ball is a more mobile tank than &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, he has no means of directly protecting his teammates from damage. His high dependency on his abilities and mobility makes him a sitting target when they are being limited or disabled. Furthermore, his massive size also makes him an easy target for the enemy team to focus fire if he cannot escape.\nGeneral Strategies.\nWrecking Ball is all about disruption, quick engagements and disengagements, and denying area (especially choke points and objective areas). Use Grappling Claw and Piledriver to roll through masses of enemies to quickly gain ultimate charge and scattering the enemy team. For example, Wrecking Ball can smack a Reinhardt away from his team, leaving them vulnerable. Roll and Adaptive Shield help to survive and disengage. Once Minefield is ready, Wrecking Ball can combo it with Piledriver to prevent or even end team fights. Wrecking Ball can also target specific enemies by slamming down with Piledriver, shooting them with Quad Cannons, and hitting a quick melee.\nStory.\nWitty and conniving, Hammond is a genetically modified hamster capable of speech, just not in any human language. His &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt; (named \"Wrecking Ball\") translates his comments into English via a soundboard. The mech itself is equipped with a minor &lt;a href=\"AI\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;. \nPer his nature as a hamster, Hammond has an instinctual fear of foxes. A perfectionist, Hammond is highly intelligent, and there is little he cannot fix or build.\nHorizon Lunar Colony.\nPre-Sapience.\nHammond was raised on &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20Lunar%20Colony\"&gt;Horizon Lunar Colony&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the experiments that shaped him, Hammond had the intelligence of a regular hamster. In this state, he was happy within the confines of his cage, having access to tubes. He was in the presence of his mother and fellow hamster siblings. The scientists placed him into mazes. He used his sense of smell to find the treats they put in the end. He learnt to solve puzzles and enjoyed it, especially the reward of his favorite sunflower seeds. He was pitted against his siblings, but was not aware of it, and found the treats quicker than they did. He grew to become the biggest hamster in his family. While he didn't know what was going on, when he found a treat very fast, he sometimes saw the human scientists make noises and bare their teeth, and hand paper to each other. He would later learn in hindsight that they were betting on him as a means of passing the time.\nEarly Experiments.\nIn one of the many experiments carried out at &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20Lunar%20Colony\"&gt;Horizon Lunar Colony&lt;/a&gt;, animals were given genetic therapy to assess their adaptation to extended periods of habitation on the moon. As an unexpected side effect, several of them exhibited exceptional growth in physical size and brain function. While most of the test subjects were gorillas or other primates, there were some exceptions, including a hamster designated Specimen 8, but whom the staff named \"Hammond\". \nIn the early experiments, Hammond was left cold, alone, and afraid. One scientist was there more than the others, the one the humans called &lt;a href=\"Chao\"&gt;\"Doctorchao.\"&lt;/a&gt; She jabbed him with shiny sharp sticks that hurt horribly. Unable to fight or flee his tormenter, he awaited death, but it did not come, as it did for some of his siblings. The experiments lasted for months, each interaction more than he could bear. He didn't understand why he survived while they didn't. One day, he woke up to some kind of loop. While not able to understand the humans' words at the time, he heard Chao discussing with her fellow scientists that hamsters were less expensive than gorillas, and that no-one would care how many hamsters they lost. While the scientists called him \"Hammond,\" Chao insisted on calling him \"Specimen 8,\" telling them to not get attached.\nLike the gorillas, Hammond's intelligence grew, and his size likewise increased. As his intelligence grew, he wondered why he was being experimented on, a word he was able to understand. His brain shifted, he began to understand things, including self-awareness. He came to prefer his new intellect to his former non-sapience.\nHammond was contained in a large cage in his own room. As he clawed at the bars, the scientists told him in gentle tones that they were concerned he might crush his fellow hamsters, who were much smaller than he was now. On one occasion, he saw his old family play in their separate cage, but they paid him no mind. Loneliness set in. Confused and frustrated, he tried to ask the scientists while his family was not with him, but while the scientists had increased his intelligence, they hadn't given him the ability to speak as a human could. All that came out of Hammond's mout hwas squeaks, and the scientists thought he was simply doing antics. They encouraged him to do more, and gave him treats.\nOver time, Hammond's siblings were removed from their habitat, and subjected to the same experiments he had been. Every time, he waited for one of his siblings to join him, yet none of the hamsters survived the experiments. Observing Doctors &lt;a href=\"Nevsky\"&gt;Nevsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nguyen\"&gt;Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, he could tell that they could not agree on why the other subjects were failing where Hammond had succeeded. Now able to read human facial expressions, Hammond saw no remorse in their visages, and wondered why they were not sad.\nSapience.\nHammond demonstrated impressive problem solving skills and adaptability, and he became more curious about the world around him. Much to the puzzlement and amusement of the scientists, Hammond would frequently escape into different parts of the moon base. The staff had more trouble keeping track of Hammond than any of the other test subjects, and in at least one case, it was days before he was returned to his holding area. Though they'd always find him and return him to his cell, they never figured out the true purpose behind his nightly escapades. What they didn't know was that Hammond was busy teaching himself the skills of a mechanic, which would soon come in handy.\nIn time, Hammond became good friends with one of the gorillas, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Specimen 28&lt;/a&gt;.\nHammond made his first escape through a bobby pin which he obtained and held for most of the day. It took him a few minutes to pick the padlock Dr. [[Zhang] had placed on his cage to keep him contained for the night. He quickly accessed the base's air ventilation system, and used his sense of smell to guide himself to the base's comissary, where he gorged himself on corn chips, yams, fruit, and ice cream. Later, he discovered the garages, where he taught himself how to use tools, fix broken mechanisms, and create new ones from spare parts. He left \"presents\" for Dr. [[Patel]] in his room, but more importantly, engineering, repurposing, and fixing things fed his insatiable need for challenge. Soon, there was little Hammond couldn't fix or build.\nIn time, Hammond came to memorize the network of ducts, and he realized that there are other creatures that had been \"changed\" like he was. Gorillas, and he was taken aback at their \"wrongness.\" He avoided the ducts, but one night as he was bringing some tools to work on a secret project, he heard a whimper. He looked down at the room below, and saw a gorilla. It grabbed the grate, and Hammond saw the label \"Specimen 28\" on its suit. Hammond gave it a peanut butter bar, who took a tenative bite, and broke into a sunny smile. Finishing the candy bar, the ape examined Hammond, and laughed. While neither could speak, 28 was well suited for charades, and Hammond tried to answer back with gestures. Before Hammond left, the ape asked if he would come back and Hammond agreed. He tossed his screwdriver to 28, who cradled it like something precious.\n28 became Hammond's first friend. Hammond realized that 28 was an outcast to his fellow apes, and there was an innocence in 28 that inspired a sense of protectiveness. Hammond began sneaking treats to his new friend regularly, and showed the gorilla how to fix things. In return, 28 showed Hammond how to dream of something better. One night, he showed Hammond a drawing of Earth with a rocket. 28 was in the viewport, with Hammond on his shoulder. \n28 would be called [[Winston]], and the two were close friends.\nEscape.\n[[File:HammondEscape.jpg|thumb|left|Hammond plans his escape]]\nBefore the base's fall, Hammond escaped from his cage. Dr. [[Zhang]] noted his absence, but few within the base gave it much heed. Hammond possibly escaped into the base's ventilation system, as in the same timeframe, [[Flores]] noted strange noises coming from the system. The colony was eventually thrown into chaos when some of the gorillas rose up against the human scientists and took control. Not all of the animals participated, however, and Specimen 28, taking the name \"Winston\", was making a plan to escape to Earth. Hammond sensed his opportunity, prototyped a basic build plan using toys in his room, then finalized his build onto a blueprint with sticky notes. Ignored in the uprising, he converted an empty fuel pod into a makeshift escape capsule with a claw arm and tether. Winston found Hammond's rocket design in Horizon's computer system, and built a craft of his own. To Hammond's rage, Winston blasted off from Launch Bay 14 without him. Using a modified pod, Hammond hitched a ride to the bottom of Winston's craft. As the two entered Earth's atmosphere, the tether broke; while Winston landed at [[Watchpoint: Gibraltar]], Hammond landed in a different location: the wasteland of the [[Australia|Australian]] Outback, on the outskirts of [[Junkertown]].\nOne of the primates would eventually break down the door of Hammond's room for whatever reason, but by that time the hamster was already gone.\nThe Junkers.\nHammond modified his escape pod to become the cockpit of his own mech, which he built around it, to enter the lucrative mech battle arena of the [[Scrapyard]]. Working his way up the ranks amongst the [[Junkers]], the competitor known as \"Wrecking Ball\" went from contender to champion and had fun winning numerous times, including [[Three-Arm Luke]]. He also fought against [[Roadhog]] at least once, which resulted in minor damage to his mech.\nHammond's identity remained a mystery to all. An exception was the [[Junker Queen]], and Hammond became her bodyguard. At some point, he drove through the [[Wasteland]] alongside her. The Junker Queen was the only human ever able to beat him in single combat, and for that, he respected her.\n[[File:Hammond Leaves.jpg|thumb|Hammond leaves Junkertown]]\nGathering his winnings, Hammond was able to upgrade his mech enough to survive the dangerous trek out of the Junker-controlled Outback. Now free to travel and do as he pleases, Hammond began exploring the world, finding new adventures along the way. He apparently ended up returning to Junkertown, having found a happy, if somewhat chaotic home at the Junker Queen\u2019s side. After all, as reigning champion of the Scrapyard, he had a title to defend. He still journeyed into the wider world from time to time however.\nYears later, [[Lucheng Interstellar]] was able to retrieve information from Horizon's still-operating monitoring system. Hammond was noted to be missing from the base.\nThoughtless Gods.\nDeparture.\nTwelve years after his landing in Australia, Hammond aided the Junker Queen in her search for [[antigravity thruster]]s for a \"new ride.\" They encountered a group of Outback omnics that came within 100km of Junkertown, and in so doing, sealed their doom as the Junkers lay waste to them. Hammond saved the Queen from a still active omnic, using his grapple hook to redirect the omnic's shot, which was followed by the Queen decapitating it. She gave Hammond silent thanks.\nAs the Junker factions set about salvaging the site, Hammond, losing patience, used his mech's cannons (and the mech itself) to blow out the doors of the omnics' base. Hammond entered the base's communications center, and saw reports of [[Null Sector]]'s global assault. The Queen was unfazed, but Hammond's attention was caught by footage of Null Sector's assault on [[Lijiang]], and more specifically, [[Lijiang Tower]]\u2014the headquarters of [[Lucheng Interstellar]]. Hammond was frozen, paralyzed by a seething surge of adrenaline and rage. In a blink, he was catapulted to his earliest, most fractured memories, taken from before Lucheng's experiments on him. The Queen snapped him out of his reverie, and he told her that he had something to do. The Queen told Hammond that while she was willing to give him some leeway, she couldn't just let him go AWOL. He responded that he knew where to find the components she sought, but that he had to make this trip alone. He rolled out into the desert.\nLijiang.\n[[File:Thoughtless Gods.jpg|thumb|Hammond in Lijiang]]\nSometime later, Hammond arrived at Lijiang. The city had been mostly evacuated of civilians prior to his arrival, but he still had to avoid Null Sector troops. Still, as the patrols were regularly timed and easy to hear coming, he was able to stay hidden and made his way to the city's night market, and towering above it, Lijiang Tower. The tower was being guarded by Lucheng security. Using his mech's pile driver function, he slammed into the tower lobby, knocking the guards off their feet. He used the mech's voice system to tell them that Null Sector was attacking and to flee, before he rolled out before anyone could get a sight of him. With the guards filtering out, he used his grapple hook to get to the 57th floor, which was one of the ten floors Lucheng used in the tower. \nHammond got to the control room and used his mech's tasers to incapacitate the guards there. He then used the tower's intercom system to get the rest of security and administrative staff to leave the tower. Going through the feeds in the control room, he saw one that came from Horizon Lunar Colony. Entranced by the images of his old home, Hammond was interupted by the voice of a woman. Spinning around to confront her, Hammond was reunited with Doctor Chao, but now confined to a [[hoverchair]], she was older and frailer than she had been when he had last seen her at Horizon. She explained that due to years spent in and out of microgravity, her body had atrophied beyond repair, and that at her age, it was impossible for her to recover her muscle mass. Nor was she a great candidate for [[cybernetics]].\nShe told Hammond that she knew, as well as he did, that Lucheng had secrets stored here that couldn't be allowed to be released into the wider world, and that as CEO, it was her responsibility to stop him.\nTrivia.\n[[File:Wrecking Ball-funko.png|thumb|The Wrecking Ball funko pop]]\nDevelopment.\nOverwatch.\n[[File:7eb3a4fa-319d-435a-8bb3-210003856cf0.png|thumb|\"Ball Guy\" concept art.]]\nThe concept for Wrecking Ball actually originated early in \"Overwatch's\" development, during the game's original character design phase, as \"Ball Guy,\" a spherical robot [[Arnold Tsang]] created while exploring circular robot designs, which stemmed from an early unused concept of [[Junkrat]] wearing a bomb-shaped suit. [[Geoff Goodman]] began designing this version of the hero as a \"junkyard magnet bot,\" a robotic tank hero with a kit themed around magnetism, including abilities that allowed him to attract and repel bullets. At around the same time, the concept artists were doing preliminary ideation for a \"cute hero,\" which included several prototype designs of robots, rodents, and a robotic monkey, as well as precursors to [[D.Va]]; this same ideation phase would eventually produce [[Jetpack Cat]]. Eventually, these two lines of ideation would converge on the idea of a hamster in a hamster ball, and Arnold Tsang illustrated the first iteration of Wrecking Ball, as a robotic hamster piloting a quadrupedal robot that could transform into a sphere.\nArnold Tsang took some inspiration for Hammond's design and coloration from the pet hamster he owned in college, .\n[[File:C6246640-5a61-42a4-bbe7-a832f96f6b8d.png|alt=|thumb|The first iteration of Wrecking Ball.]]\nThe illustration was emailed out and clicked with the designers, but this new direction proved to be controversial within the \"Overwatch\" development team, with some loving the idea and others believing it would ruin the game. In 2014, Jeff Kaplan, [[Jeffrey Brill]], and [[Randal Dumoret]] had a disagreement over the hero's inclusion, with Dumoret falling into the latter camp. The discussion resulted in Brill scheduling a meeting in 2024 to determine whether or not Wrecking Ball had ruined the game, and that if he had, he would be removed from the game at that point. Though the team fully intended to eventually release the hero, they didn't feel it was the right time, and so Wrecking Ball remained shelved until some time in 2017, when he was brought back up and they started seriously discussing his implementation.\nRevisiting the concept, they decided that a mechanical hamster couldn't be as cute as an actual hamster. Using Tracer as a reference point they produced a number of hamster concepts to hone in on a specific style that suited \"Overwatch's\" \"East meets West\" aesthetic, ultimately deciding on a design that fell in between [[wikipedia:Hamtaro|\"Hamtaro\"]] and [[wikipedia:Zootopia|\"Zootopia\"]]. According to Kaplan, they also deliberated over Hammond's size, eventually deciding that he should be \"[[wikipedia:Pikachu|Pikachu]]-sized.\"\nFrom there Wrecking Ball went through various design iterations with mechanics that focused on rolling around on the ground and down slopes to gain momentum and smash into enemies. Eventually, the grappling hook was incorporated into his kit, which fit into his wrecking ball theme, and his final design began to take shape with the Piledriver, Adaptive Shield, and Minefield abilities pulling everything together.\nWhile designing Wrecking Ball's legendary skins, because the hero concept was already quite different from the other heroes in the game, they decided to ground his default legendary skins in the existing \"Overwatch\" story, with his Junker skin reflecting his time as the Champion of the Scrapyard and his Lunar skin reflecting his time as an experimental test subject on the Horizon Lunar Colony.\nPrior to his release, an \"Overwatch\" tweet was released containing a video that featured several posters on a wall, one of which was a Horizon commercial displaying most likely a chimpanzee or a similar specimen flying in space. This led to speculation that this was teasing Hammond as a playable hero. With the release of the Patch 1.25, a new room was added to Horizon Lunar Colony neighboring Winston's room with the text \"Specimen 8\" written on the door, confirming that this was Hammond's room.\nOverwatch 2.\n[[File:Overwatch 2 Wrecking Ball skin concept art.jpg|thumb|Wrecking Ball's Overwatch 2 Skin Concept Art by Kejun Wang]]\nLike almost all \"[[Overwatch]]\" Heroes, Wrecking Ball was redesigned and given a new look for \"[[Overwatch 2]]\". [[Kejun Wang]] was the concept artist behind his Overwatch 2 look, but otherwise not much is known about the idea behind his new look. It was stated that the general scheme concept for all new hero looks for Overwatch 2 to be aimed at keeping the \"essence\" of the hero, while showing some evolution and character growth in the design.\nA Unicorn skin for Wrecking Ball was considered for the \"[[Transformers]]\" collaboration, but was not implemented.\nReferences.\n[[Category:Heroes]]\n[[Category:Horizon Lunar Colony test subjects]]\n[[Category:Mechs]]\n[[Category:Wrecking Ball| ]]\n[[Category:Gladiators]]\n[[Category:Mech pilots]]\n[[Category: Junkers]]"}

Coming from all walks of life, they are dedicated to protecting the people of &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Y\u014dkai was formed a bit over a year ago in response to the tyranny enacted on the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt; by the Hashimoto clan.\nThe group would strike back at the clan in a variety of ways, including but not limited to: stealing shipments of their contraband, badly beating or robbing their men, spraying bright, conspicuous messages around Kanezaka, breaking their windows, and robbing the Hashimoto's own bar, the Tora No Sumika. However, the vigilantes would hide from the Hashimoto when they responded, leaving the ordinary people of Kanezaka to suffer the Hashimoto's retribution in their place.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kiriko%20Kamori\"&gt;Kiriko Kamori&lt;/a&gt; was 20, she joined the group herself to fight against the Hashimotos. During one of the group's infiltrations to destroy a shipment of the Hashimoto's guns, they originally planned to blow it up. However, doing so would risk scaring and putting innocent citizens in harm's way. Kiriko believed this lack of regard would make the group no better than the Hashimotos. Instead, she believed they should strike from the shadows, become a force without a face, one that scares the Hashimotos and leaves them unable to explain what's happening. The others agreed, they had to strike like ghost, like Y\u014dkai.\nWith Kiriko's leadership, the Y\u014dkai became more and more of a thorn in the Hashimoto's side. They ambushed Hashimoto businesses, disrupted supply lines, and constantly undermined them through strategic attacks. But no matter how hard the Hashimoto pressed, the Y\u014dkai always managed to slip through their fingers."}

{"id": "2075", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2075", "title": "Zarya", "text": "Zarya is a &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". She is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nDeploying powerful personal barriers that convert incoming damage into energy for her massive Particle Cannon, Zarya is an invaluable asset on the front lines of any battle.\nStrategy.\nZarya is a challenging Tank to play, though one of the most rewarding when played well. She gains Energy by absorbing damage with her barrier abilities, increasing her own damage substantially. At maximum Energy, she is a monstrous threat to the enemy team, tearing them apart in seconds with her Particle Cannon. Her &lt;a href=\"Ultimate\"&gt;Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; has some of the highest play-making potential in the game, with the ability to trap entire teams in a single spot for her allies to fire upon. \nAll of this comes with a severe weakness: she is the softest of the Tanks, with the lowest base Health out of them (save for Orisa), no movement abilities, and only an infrequent, short-duration barrier to protect her and her team. She is heavily reliant on her teammates to charge up her Energy, provide cover/healing when she is out of position, and coordinate with her ultimate. \nStory.\n\"Together we are strong.\"\nAleksandra Zaryanova is one of the world's strongest women, a celebrated athlete who sacrificed personal glory to protect her family, friends, and country in a time of war. As a soldier in the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Russian Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt;, she is proud to use her strength to protect the ones she loves.\nZarya has good tactical instincts. She is distrustful of &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, even those who seek co-existence with humanity. However, after her experiences with &lt;a href=\"Lynx%20Seventeen\"&gt;Lynx Seventeen&lt;/a&gt;, her views softened, distinguishing between the &lt;a href=\"Siberia\"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;n omnics attacking her homeland, and the rest of omnic-kind in general. Similarly, Zarya initially disdained &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, at least in part due to the rivalry between Overwatch and the RDF, but she softened her stance after joining the organization.\nOne of her personal heroes is . She enjoys eating cabbage pierogis.\nBackground.\nAleksandra was born in &lt;a href=\"Novanskoye\"&gt;Novanskoye&lt;/a&gt;; a remote &lt;a href=\"Siberia\"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;n village that was on the front lines of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n forces defeated the omnics and shut down their &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;, the region was devastated by the conflict, and her father was killed in the war. Only a child at the time, Aleksandra was surrounded by the post-war destruction, and as she grew older, she swore that she would gain the strength to help her people recover.\nFocusing on weightlifting and bodybuilding, Aleksandra was identified by the national athletics program as a potential star. She trained extensively, moving up the ranks while representing her country, and was expected to shatter longstanding records in the upcoming world championships.\nBut on the eve of the tournament, an attack came from the long-dormant Siberian omnium, and her village was thrust into war once again. Aleksandra immediately withdrew from the competition and rushed home to enlist in the local defense forces, sacrificing the life of fame and fortune she might have had. The magazine \"&lt;a href=\"%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%B8\"&gt;\u0411\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0438&lt;/a&gt;\" reported on her departure. Now a soldier in the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Russian Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt;, Zarya was deployed to the &lt;a href=\"Krasnoyarsk\"&gt;Krasnoyarsk&lt;/a&gt; front in Siberia; the same front where her father had been killed holding the line against the omnics. Serving as a soldier, Zarya became a symbol to some, a stalwart fellow soldier to others. But for Zarya, it was a chance to use her great strength to protect the ones she loved.\nZarya was given an experimental weapon by &lt;a href=\"Katya%20Volskaya\"&gt;Katya Volskaya&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of &lt;a href=\"Volskaya%20Industries\"&gt;Volskaya Industries&lt;/a&gt;. Her &lt;a href=\"particle%20cannon\"&gt;particle cannon&lt;/a&gt; was deemed too heavy for standard soldiers, but it also required the kind of quick maneuvering and accuracy that Russia's mechanized force couldn\u2019t achieve. Zarya fought on the front lines, and saved many lives with the weapon.\nAs the Siberian omnium continued its attacks, &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt; interviewed Zarya. She achieved the rank of sergeant within the RDF. Over the course of her service, she destroyed hundreds of omnics. Per the rivalry between Overwatch and the RDF, Zarya developed disdain for the former.\nChristmas War.\nZarya spent Christmas fighting against the omnics alongside her fellow soldiers.\nSearching.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;trio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; agents tried to assassinate Katya, Zarya was summoned to her office. After being asked whether she knew why she was here, Zarya responded that she believed she did. However, after being told about the nature of her mission, to track down Sombra (who was among the Talon agents who'd tried to assassinate Katya), Zarya realized that the assignment hadn't been what she'd expected. She told Katya that a spy would have been a better choice. Katya shrugged the suggestion off, and sent Zarya on her way. Over weeks of searching, she visited &lt;a href=\"Lijiang%20Tower\"&gt;Lijiang Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hanamura\"&gt;Hanamura&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. She reported to Katya that her leads had run dry. Katya sent Zarya to &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; to meet a hacker.\nZarya was uncomfortable in Numbani, rankled at the sight of humans and omnics living together. Her mood wasn't improved when she discovered that her hacker contact was an omnic named &lt;a href=\"Lynx%20Seventeen\"&gt;Lynx Seventeen&lt;/a&gt;. She contacted Katya, asking if she knew the hacker was an omnic, but Katya explained that sometimes, one had to ally with undesirable allies in order to fight a common enemy. Lynx showed Zarya the data they had gathered on the \"Sombra Collective.\" Zarya explained that the supposed collective was actually a single woman, and Lynx explained that given that Sombra's calling card was a sugar skull (similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Muertos\"&gt;Los Muertos&lt;/a&gt;), and had implicated &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Portero\"&gt;Guillermo Portero&lt;/a&gt; for corruption. Given all that, they headed for &lt;a href=\"Dorado\"&gt;Dorado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, where they met with Portero himself. He wished them luck, but stated that &lt;a href=\"Lum%C3%A9riCo\"&gt;Lum\u00e9riCo&lt;/a&gt; couldn't give them any aid.\nNot giving up, Zarya and Lynx began knocking on all the doors of Dorado, asking hundreds of people per day as to whether they'd seen Sombra. None of the people had seen Sombra, or if they had, weren't admitting it\u2014Zarya noticed that they saw Sombra as being akin to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Razin\"&gt;Stepan Razin&lt;/a&gt;; robbing from the rich on behalf of the poor. They achieved a breakthrough at the &lt;a href=\"Panader%C3%ADa%20Las%20Nieblas\"&gt;Panader\u00eda Las Nieblas&lt;/a&gt; bakery, where they met a girl named &lt;a href=\"Alejandra\"&gt;Alejandra&lt;/a&gt;. Playing on the girl's emotions, Zarya asked her if she'd seen Sombra, and that if she had, she'd be a \"hero\" to her. The ploy worked, and Alejandra took them to the warehouse Sombra was operating from. Lynx deactivated the structure's security system, and as they did so, they discussed Zarya's history with the omnics, and her negative sentiment towards them. Their bickering was ended as Sombra revealed her presence. The two engaged in a battle of bullets and words, which ended as Zarya incapacitated Sombra with a graviton surge. \nSombra demanded that Zarya let her go, or otherwise, the world would know Katya's secret, that she'd been receiving technology from omnics in order to fight against the Siberian omnium. Sombra also explained that she actually wanted Katya in power, as a 'friend' to help her peel back a global conspiracy she'd uncovered. Zarya was skeptical, but her hand was forced as Lynx collapsed\u2014when they had hacked Sombra in Numbani, Sombra had hacked them right back, and now, the program was kicking in. Also, the warehouse would detonate in one minute's time. She decided to let Sombra go and rescued Lynx, escaping the blast with them. When they asked why she'd rescued them, Zarya stated that she didn't know, and that a few days ago, she might have killed them herself. She stated that she would head back to Russia to continue the fight against the Siberian omnics.\nAfter parting ways with Lynx, she conversed with Katya again. Zarya asked as to why she hadn't confessed where she got her technology from, but Katya explained that her secret dealings with omnics had to remain secret for now. One day, Russia would understand, but that day wasn't here yet. Zarya agreed to keep her secret.\nNew Blood.\nKrasnoyarsk.\nReturning to the Krasnoyarsk front, Zarya was stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Novanskoye%20Forward%20Base\"&gt;Novanskoye Forward Base&lt;/a&gt;. She and her fellow soldiers were sent out on regular patrols, and they reguarly came into contact with the Siberian omnics. Casualties were a regular occurrence, and as the war ground on, Zarya opinioned that their position wasn't sustainable. That inch by inch, the omnics were gaining ground.\nOn what would be her last patrol with the RDF, Zarya was approached by a new recruit, asking for her autograph, as he was fan of both her athletic career, and her role as a soldier. Zarya agreed, but only after the patrol. They set out, and like so many other times, were attacked by the omnics. This time, however, they made it back to base without a single casualty. The patrol route took them through the ruins of her old hometown. She gave the recruit the autograph he requested, and they settled down for breakfast. Before they could start eating, an alarm sounded.\nReporting for duty, the base commander informed Zarya that the omnics had broken through the northeastern front. All RDF forces had been ordered to fall back to &lt;a href=\"Krasnoyarsk\"&gt;Krasnoyarsk&lt;/a&gt;; to shore up its defenses and evacuate the city. Novanskoye had been declared lost. She asked the commander for permission to travel to Novanskoye; to save her hometown. After some consideration, he told her \"do what you have to do.\" Heading to the base's hanger for transport, she found a truck already available for her, driven by ex-&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;. While she didn't know him personally, she recognized his face, and accepted his offer for a ride to Novanskoye. However, she told him to just drop her off and after that, head west. He insisted on following her, but she in turn told him that this wasn't his fight.\nCassidy dropped her off at Novanskoye, set ablaze by the omnics. She engaged them alone, buying time for the villagers to find safety. She pushed her particle barrier to the limit, but it gave way under the omnics' gunfire. At the last moment however, Cassidy used the truck to smash into the attacking omnics, destroying them. Accepting his help, the two fought back to back, destroying the rest of the omnics.\nThe battle over, Zarya reunited with &lt;a href=\"Ira%20Zaryanova\"&gt;her&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marisha%20Zaryanova\"&gt;sisters&lt;/a&gt;. They explained that they, and the group they were part of, were the last residents of Novanskoye, as the rest of the villagers had fled. She ordered them to gather the children and then prepare to move out as quickly as possible, as the omnics would be regrouping. They marched away, where Zarya reunited her sisters with the rest of their family.\nZarya thanked Cassidy for his help. He responded by asking Zarya if she'd do this kind of thing more often. To join Overwatch. The RDF wouldn't miss one soldier, but with Overwatch, she could make a world of difference. Zarya accepted, and moments later, was summoned by her sisters, who showed her an Atlas News report of &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. The reporter asked whether this was an isolated incident, or the start of a new war.\nMongolia and Busan.\nZarya and Cassidy stuck together, and were eventually joined by &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt;. They appropriated an &lt;a href=\"MV-261%20Orca\"&gt;MV-261 Orca&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; base in Mongolia. At some point afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt; (re)joined the group.\nThe team flew the Orca to &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;, which was under attack by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Zarya deployed groundside and fought against the attacking omnics. Null Sector was forced to retreat, and Overwatch and the &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Squad\"&gt;MEKA Squad&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"MEKA%20Base\"&gt;MEKA Base&lt;/a&gt;. There, they met &lt;a href=\"Hana%20Song\"&gt;Hana Song&lt;/a&gt;, who joined the group. The following day, the Orca left Busan, headed for .\nResistance.\nZarya and her companions arrived at , where they saw the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; and his Overwatch group who had returned from &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. The two groups combined forces to take the fight to Null Sector.\nLiberation.\nZarya and the rest of Overwatch deployed in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, which was under attack by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. They helped evacuate the city, but ultimately, Toronto fell to the warbots. She later claimed that she took out 357 warbots all by herself.\nAfter the mission, Zarya returned to Watchpoint: Gibraltar. Following &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;'s instructions, she located the gym. As she did her stretch routine, she reflected that Overwatch was not what she had expected, as she'd anticipated more luxuries and waste. Given the historical animosity between the RDF and Overwatch, and seeing the rundown state of the latter, she felt like she was standing on the grave of a rival. \"Pleasant, but also a little sad,\" as she noted.\nZarya continued to exercise, ignoring &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;'s yammering, before she saw &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; walk in. She could tell Mei wanted to train, but was afraid to ask. Taking the initiative, Zarya asked her to restock dumbbells, before instructing Mei in lifting weights. &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; walked in as well, but Zarya told him to leave and find proper shoes before returning her attention to Mei. She noted that the scientist was doing well for a beginner. L\u00facio returned, but failed to follow Zarya's instructions when it came to his muscles. She realized that most of Overwatch's so-called agents were really just \"hopeful children,\" and not the tyrants and bureaucrats she expected.\nIronclad.\nAfter Null Sector's attack on &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Lindholm\"&gt;Brigitte Lindholm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt; returned to Gibraltar, with a new recruit\u2013&lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Zarya was in the base's cafeteria when it approached. She was initially aggressive, and could not understand the warbot's beeps and boops. After some awkward attempts at communication, she invited the omnic to sit down with her.\nTrivia.\nMisc. Character Information.\nDisputed Information.\n\"Note: The following information is taken from gameplay trailers, and is of dubious canon status.\"\nZarya was part of an Overwatch team which engaged against &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Petra\"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Venture\"&gt;Venture&lt;/a&gt;, Overwatch successfully repelled Talon.\nExternal links.\n "}

{"id": "359", "revid": "54787932", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=359", "title": "Zenyatta", "text": "Zenyatta is a &lt;a href=\"Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". He is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nZenyatta calls upon orbs of harmony and discord to heal his teammates and weaken his opponents, all while pursuing a transcendent state of immunity to damage.\nStrategy.\nZenyatta is a potent offense-focused Support. He stands out from the other supports due to his incredible killing power: his Orb of Destruction and Orb of Discord can let him shred through even the sturdiest of Tanks with well-aimed shots. While not as powerful a healer as &lt;a href=\"Lifeweaver\"&gt;Lifeweaver&lt;/a&gt;, his Orb of Harmony and Transcendence abilities are more than enough to let him keep a team alive when used intelligently. All of this power is counterbalanced by a severe lack of mobility. Unless Zenyatta is using his ultimate, he moves at a relatively slow pace and has no abilities to increase movement speed. This makes him vulnerable to agile flankers or large amounts of incoming fire.\nStory.\n\"True Self Is Without Form.\"\nZenyatta is an &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; monk who wanders the world in search of spiritual enlightenment, helping those he meets to overcome their personal struggles and find inner peace. It is said that those who cross his path are never the same again. He believes that by forming people into relationships, the world can be healed, and a better society created. However, Zenyatta is not a pacifist, and when necessary, he will fight to protect the innocent, be they omnic or human. \nThe orbs Zenyatta uses were hand-carved at the &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt; monastary and serve as a means to channel omnic energy. Zenyatta does not know who, exactly, created them, and their function is a mystery; while seemingly magical, in Zenyatta's words, \"what seems like magic is sometimes science we don't yet understand.\" Similarly, Zenyatta is able to levitate without repulsors, an ability he has attributed to &lt;a href=\"the%20Iris\"&gt;the Iris&lt;/a&gt;.\nZenyatta believes that as long as free will exists, there will always be evil in the world, yet to deny free will would also be evil. He has the ability to dream.\nZenyatta found humans' manner of speech perplexing at first, having little grasp of metaphors. He still occasionally struggles with their figures of speech.\nLike all Shambali, despite being unable to eat, Zenyatta knows how to prepare food. He likes being near the coast, as it reminds him of where he was constructed.\nBackground.\nPre-Crisis.\nZenyatta was constructed before the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, constructed on/near the coast. When asked what he did before the war, Zenyatta claimed to have served coffee, collect payments at a laser tag arena, act as a water park lifeguard, and be a tractor driver. Whether this is true or not is something Zenyatta has always refused to divulge. He has stated that his memories before the Awakening are blurry.\nThe Shambali.\nAfter the Crisis, Zenyatta was recruited into the Shambali by &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;, who hoped that Zenyatta could find purpose with the Shambali as he had. The two became \"as close as brothers,\" and spent years discussing the problems facing omnics, including the injustices being committed by humans. The two sat up at night counting stars, wondering how many omnics were doing the same. At some point, however, Ramattra committed an action that nearly resulted in Zenyatta's death. After Ramattra founded &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;, he and Zenyatta ceased all contact.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, while still with the Shambali, Zenyatta encountered &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, who had left Overwatch and was conflicted with his nature as a cyborg. Though Genji initially rejected Zenyatta's wisdom, the benevolent omnic would not be deterred. In time, Zenyatta became his mentor, and under the monk's tutelage, Genji reconciled his dual existence as both man and machine, as Zenyatta helped his student see both his trials and his cybernetic form as a unique strength.\nZenyatta would later consider Genji to be one of his brightest pupils. After Genji left his tutelage, Zenyatta began to see the limits of the Shambali path. He believed that the way to repair the problems between humans and omnics was not through dogmatic teaching but through interpersonal connection and engagement.\nUltimately, Zenyatta followed his own path. He chose to leave the monastery and wander the world, helping those he meets to overcome their personal struggles and find inner peace. \nReflections.\nZenyatta and Genji spent Christmas together in a monastery. \nStone By Stone.\nZenyatta was on pilgrimige in &lt;a href=\"Suravasa\"&gt;Suravasa&lt;/a&gt;, intending to reflect on Mondatta's teachings, when the &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt;'s ground breaking caused a tremor that destroyed the statue of &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; in a temple. Later, inside the temple, he met with Vishkar agent &lt;a href=\"Satya%20Vaswani\"&gt;Satya Vaswani&lt;/a&gt;, who'd come on Vishkar's behalf. He told her that it was good that Vishkar was taking responsibility for the damage they'd caused, but it would mean nothing if the help they provided wasn't constructive. He offered her lodging at the temple so that she may better understand the community and the temple's faith. She agreed to stay, and he guided her through the temple, also informing her about Aurora's history.\nZenyatta greeted Vaswani the next morning, noting that she had put on a temple robe. She stated that while she had not come as a pilgrim, she was sincere in her efforts to provide recompense; an intention that Zenyatta had never doubted. Days passed before Zenyatta gave her the Orb of Perception, and told her to study it. On the fourth day, she watched Zenyatta and the other omnic priests prepare food for anyone in the village who was hungry. Noting the angry whispers directed at Vaswani, served her food himself, as a gesture of silent support. Later in the evening, after meditation on the orbs had finished, Zenyatta asked Vaswani to stay behind, asking her for her thoughts on the day's events. The conversation turned to her role as a &lt;a href=\"hard-light\"&gt;hard-light&lt;/a&gt; architech. At the end of their conversation, Vaswani stated that she now knew what she had to do.\nA week after Vaswani's arrival, she and Zenyatta walked into the temple's courtyard, where they met with Sarpanch &lt;a href=\"Ranesh%20Grewal\"&gt;Ranesh Grewal&lt;/a&gt;, along with a crowd of priests, pilgrims, villagers, and Vishkar personnel. She revealed that she had used hard-light to fix the shrine, giving it a new luminescence. After the event, she met with Zenyatta outside, who gave her incense as a parting gift, telling her that she was always welcome. To &lt;a href=\"Sanjay%20Korpal\"&gt;Sanjay Korpal&lt;/a&gt; of Vishkar, he stated \"every dawn brings a new chance to choose our paths. I hope Vishkar Corporation sees that now.\"\nExternal links.\n "}

She and &lt;a href=\"Nameless\"&gt;Nameless&lt;/a&gt; were friends. They were rescued by &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;, and alongside &lt;a href=\"Lanet\"&gt;Lanet&lt;/a&gt;, they became Ramattra's inner circle. \nA year later, Ramattra led them to an &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; that had been created by &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. As Ramattra explained, of all the omnics he'd brought into Null Sector, he trusted these three the most. They reactivated the omnium, using it to create war-machines.\nTwo years later, Ramattra was ready to launch his &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, but Lanet urged caution, pointing out that the omnics they were building were antiquated. Ramattra, enraged by humanity's treatment of omnics, refused to delay the attack. Zera pointed out that Lanet wasn't saying that they shouldn't fight, but requested that Ramattra give them another week. She pointed out that her cell could take down London's power grid and water supplies, and that Nameless's shadows could seize the tunnels. Ramattra refused.\nIn the end, the Uprising was a disaster; Null Sector was defeated, and Lanet was killed. Enraged, Ramattra began smashing the screen he was watching until Zera begged him to stop. He didn't, and declared that he would build a new army, that omnics would follow Null Sector whether they wanted to or not. Zera tried to calm him down, stating that omnics would join them once the dust settled. She pointed out that Ramattra had freed them from prison, but now, it seemed like he wanted to put them in one. Ramattra replied \"if that's what it takes.\" Disgusted, Zera and Nameless promptly left."}

Only when he made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20the%20Wilds\"&gt;Witch of the Wilds&lt;/a&gt; did he finally bring &lt;a href=\"Junkenstein%27s%20Monster\"&gt;his monster&lt;/a&gt; to life, and soon he had the creature destroy the town and all those who ridiculed him.\nAs for the Zomnics, Junkenstein next sent a whole army of them to ransack the lord's castle.

The objective is to push the robot and barricade as far as possible within the 8 minute time limit (10 minutes in &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt;). When the match timer runs out, the team that pushed their barricade the farthest distance wins. If a team manages to push the barricade all the way to the end the match will end instantly in their victory.\nOvertime will trigger if the team with less distance pushed controls or is contesting the robot when time expires. If the losing team loses control of the robot, the match immediately ends. If that team manages to push the robot past the other team's best distance, they immediately win.\nRobot.\nThe &lt;a href=\"TW-1\"&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt; is captured by having one or more friendly heroes near it while no enemy team heroes are nearby. Once captured by one team, the robot will begin moving along the set track towards the enemy team's spawn. If heroes from both teams are nearby, the robot will not move.\nThe robot moves slowly while pushing a barricade, and rapidly (about as quickly as most heroes can run) while not pushing a barricade. Unlike the payload in &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt; maps, the speed of the robot's movement is not affected by the number of nearby friendly heroes.\nThis game mode features checkpoints, where the robot will stop for 9 seconds for the first time it is reached. Reaching a checkpoint also unlock forward spawn points for the teams that capture them. While forward spawn is active your team will spawn in the &lt;a href=\"spawn%20room\"&gt;spawn room&lt;/a&gt; closer to the map's center, however the &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt; time is also increased by 2 seconds. The forward spawns for your team are only available while the robot is on the enemy side of the map, deactivating if the robot is pushed past the starting point at the middle. Athena will announce \"forward spawn active.\" or \"forward spawn Lost.\" The forward spawn is active whenever the robot past the first marker on either side of the barricade path. "}

Released on 6 December 2022, is the 36th hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nRamattra is a dual-form hero. His &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; form lets him protect his teammates using a staff as his weapon, while his Nemesis form transforms him into a larger and more menacing threat, where he marches down on the enemy team.\nStrategy.\nRamattra's gameplay style differs in accordance with his form. In his omnic form, Ramattra is good at 'poking' the enemy, whereas his Nemesis form is designed for close combat. Players have to choose when it is best to use the Nemesis form, such as rushing the enemy. Also his shield is only up for 4 seconds so use it as a flash shield, to counter ultimates. His greatest strength is chaining together attacks with his team, like &lt;a href=\"Sigma\"&gt;Sigma's&lt;/a&gt; ultimate, Ravenous Vortex, and Nemesis form to quickly eliminate groups. He can also protect himself and his team from big, quick damage, with Void Barrier and Block.\nStory.\n\"Suffer as I have.\"\nRamattra's story is one of hardships, trauma, and a magnified view of humanity\u2019s harsh realities. While created as a war machine, Ramattra has only ever wanted to create a better future for &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s. As the leader of &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;, Ramattra enjoys incredible support from his people, and is primed to impose his philosophies on the world. What his goals might cost, however, remains to be seen. \nBecause of their precarious situation, Ramattra believes that omnics should only care about their own kind, and never consider humanity in their struggle for survival. He is not above working with humans however. Despite their divergent paths, he remains fond of &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;, and believes there is no omnic in the world who understands him better (though &lt;a href=\"Nameless\"&gt;Nameless&lt;/a&gt; is a close second). Despite being his creator, Ramattra despises &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;.\nRamattra is mostly emotionally reserved, but his anger can boil over while in battle. His Nemesis form is a product of his own design; a product of his genius mind, and the manifestation of his rage. He uses it sparingly however, as he prefers tactical precision to brute force.\nBackground.\nEarly Life.\nRamattra was originally built as a &lt;a href=\"R-7000%20Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Though he was built for war, Ramattra only wished to create a better future for his people. After the war, he shed his munitions. He chose the name \"Ramattra\" to \"honor the first of our [omnic/Ravager] kind and kept it to remember my mistakes.\"\nAfter the Omnic Crisis, the Ravagers were hunted to near extinction, leaving Ramattra as one of the few remaining models. Adrift, confused, and enraged, he heard rumors concerning &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;. Intrigued and seeking direction, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Nepal%20%28country%29\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; to join the &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt;, with the hope of coexisting with humans, and putting his former life behind him. He survived the harsh journey, and was welcomed by Tekhartha &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Shambali.\nChoosing to become a monk, Ramattra studied under Mondatta for years, learning about &lt;a href=\"the%20Iris\"&gt;the Iris&lt;/a&gt;, and the importance of coexisting with humans.\nYears later, Ramattra began venturing outside the temple seeking enlightenment to promote the monk's message of peace. Seven years before the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, it was on one of his pilgrimages that he met a young omnic named &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt; whom he guided to the monastery after a perilous journey, in hopes the omnic would find purpose there as he did. There the two studied under Mondatta and became \"as close as brothers,\" and spent years discussing the problems facing omnics, including the injustices being committed by humans. The two sat up at night counting stars, wondering how many omnics were doing the same.\nWhile in the village beneath the monastery, some of the humans in the village knocked Ramattra to his knees, nearly killing him. At some point, Ramattra committed an action/lack of action that nearly resulted in Zenyatta's death.\nAs time wore on, Ramattra failed to see true progress in the monks' mission of peace. The Shambali urged Ramattra to be patient, but all around him, Ramattra saw his people dying, and no one taking action as his frustrations grew. Despite the attempts at peace, most humans were still opposed to accepting omnics, and as the discrimination continued, so did the amount of destroyed omnics. Forced to watch the already limited number of his people dwindle, and believing that Mondatta wasn't doing enough to alleviate the situation, Ramattra abandoned the idea of coexistence and developed a long-lasting hatred for humanity, coming to the conclusion that the only way to create a better future for omnic kind was through force. Four years before the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, Ramattra decided to leave the Shambali and began to approach his convictions from a more pragmatic angle\u2014justifying any means necessary to defend his fellow omnics. He tried to convince Zenyatta to join him, but his fellow monk refused.\nOn the day of his departure, he conversed with Mondatta and Zenyatta. While his fellow monks were sad to see him go, Ramattra told them that he no longer believed that the answers for omnics' salvation could be found inside the monastery. Mondatta remained committed to his conciliatory approach to humanity, but Ramattra feared that humanity had no interest in sharing their world. He asked Zenyatta one last time as to whether he had reconsidered his decision to stay, but Zenyatta remained committed to the Shambali. Zenyatta told him they would meet again, and promptly left.\nAfter Ramattra's departure, he and Zenyatta ceased all contact. However, Ramattra remained fond of Zenyatta.\nNull Sector.\nAfter leaving the monastery, Ramattra began seeking out omnics fighting in secret around the world, and protecting them from the abuse of humans. The truths he shared with those he met inspired others and over time he gained an underground following of these hurt and angry omnics. Ramattra initially focused on building loyalty in his followers, but true radicalization and militarization would not be far behind. At some point after leaving the Shambali, Ramattra upgraded himself, allowing him to transform into a hulking robot.\nRamattra quickly began a series of operations to free omnics from facilities keeping them as slaves. He became well known among omnics. He realized that most omnics were pinning their hopes on the Shambali. In his eyes, it seemed that the truth that no-one was coming to save them was too much to hear. After a fight at one such facility, Ramattra was seen by a rabbit-eared omnic calling themselves &lt;a href=\"Nameless\"&gt;Nameless&lt;/a&gt;. Recognizing Ramattra as the &lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt; working to free omnics, they decided to join him, alongside their friends &lt;a href=\"Zera\"&gt;Zera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lanet\"&gt;Lanet&lt;/a&gt;. Together with his allies, he formed and became the leader of the omnic extremist liberation faction &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. \nReturn Home.\nIn its infancy, Null Sector was a small organization, and couldn't make a difference. Given his lack of allies, the group didn't appear that dangerous to the world. \nTwo years before the King's Row Uprising, Ramattra, Zera, and Lanet traveled to an &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; created by the rogue AI &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;, where Ramattra was originally built. Inside, he gained access to the omnium's control center, activating the assembly lines.\nKing's Row Uprising.\nAfter two years, Ramattra's forces were large enough to warrant a test. The target was &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, to liberate the omnics there and see how his forces would perform to a world nearly two decades after the Omnic Crisis. That London was one of the \"cruelest cities\" for omnics further spurred his decision. His plan was to establish a stronghold inside London, and make it a safe place for their fellow omnics. Through doing so, other omnics would rally to their cause.\nFour days before the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, Ramattra was met with protests from Lanet, who argued that the robots produced by the omnium were obsolete and outdated. Ramattra countered that they were usable, being expendable, unlike the omnics. Despite continued disagreement from Lanet and the proposal of an alternate plan from Zera and Nameless, he pushed forward with the Uprising.\nThe Uprising ended in failure, thanks to &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;; a contingency Ramattra hadn't foreseen, as the group had been banned from operating within the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, Lanet, who'd been sent to &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;, was killed in the crossfire. Two days after the Uprising, Ramattra angrily watched news reports regarding the Uprising, growing agitated during an interview with Mondatta. Reaching a boiling point, he lashed out, striking the screen. Despite wide condemnation of Null Sector from omnics, Ramattra pushed past a point of no return, stating he would fight to liberate omnics, whether they wished for it or not. This sparked an argument against Zera and Nameless, who left their increasingly radical friend. Ramattra was then left to lead Null Sector and pursue his goal alone.\nStorm Rising.\nOne year later, Ramattra was contacted by Talon council member &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; to arrange a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, praising him for his organization's noble goals to fight for their people, though claimed they were doomed to fail unless Null Sector chose to form an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;, with Ramattra expressing interest in the offer. However, the result of this conversation remains unknown, as Doomfist was arrested by an &lt;a href=\"Overwatch_%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; strike team in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; roughly three weeks later.\nLiberation.\n26 years after the end of the Omnic Crisis, Null Sector launched a global assault. At &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, not long after the attack started, a speech by Ramattra was broadcast across the city. While his identity remained hidden, he urged his fellow omnics to join his side. Even after the city fell, the broadcast continued.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nRamattra was a difficult hero to make. His design is a case of story/art/character inspiring mechanics, and vice versa. The developers always knew that Ramattra would be a tank because of his backstory; the idea of him being a protector of his people. \nRamattra was originally intended to be released in &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 8, and &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt; in Season 2. Their places were reversed, as Ramattra's design was completed while Mauga needed additional work.\nEarly Design.\nRamattra was first conceived in 2017 when the team was designing &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; units. In this period, there was a Null Sector lieutenant unit that resembled a pharoh. The developers thought that the unit would make a good hero. \nRammatra's final design was modeled after a nomadic shepherd to help convey his status as a leader, with his staff being a particular point of focus. It also incorporates many triangular shapes to give him a menacing appearance, as well as the skeletal silhouette and primarily purple color scheme characteristic of Null Sector omnics, and in his Nemesis form he crosses his arm to help maintain his domineering atmosphere. The Nemesis form itself came later during development. The two forms are intended to feel very different from each other, but still clearly be the same hero. Thematically, the two forms represent Ramattra as a character. His baseline form is reserved, equipped with a staff that doesn't appear that dangerous. The Nemesis form represents his suppressed fury, unleashed.\nNull Sector initially had a more overt Egyptian motif with nanite-based powers that resembled sand, and the nanites carried through to Ramattra's abilities. Early versions of his staff featured a hanging reservoir of nanites resembling particles of sand, almost like a lantern, which was simplified to an orb with a revolving band of nanites that he would wind up and shoot as his primary fire. His Nemesis form stemmed from the necessity to ensure he had the physical size and bulk to fulfill the Tank role, both visually and functionally. It drew inspiration from early Zenyatta designs that incorporated multiple-arms, archetypal of imagery in certain Eastern religions.\nReveals.\nRamattra was first seen at the end of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Storm%20Rising\"&gt;Overwatch Storm Rising&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2019, though was unnamed in the cinematic. Around the time, it was speculated that he was associated with Null Sector due to his similar color scheme and newspapers appearing on the &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; map that read \"Quien es Null Sector?\"\nAn early iteration of his design was described as far back as 2019, when Game Informer reported that &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; had shown them the silhouette of what appeared to be a male wizard or warlock hero with a crooked staff during a press tour for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". \nWell ahead of the game's release, it was decided that Ramattra would be released during \"Overwatch 2\"; season 2 ended up being his chosen position.\nHe was formally revealed in the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20League\"&gt;Overwatch League&lt;/a&gt; Grand Finals 2022 on YouTube. \nSubsequent Development.\nRamattra\u2019s initial release was met with a lot of positive feedback in terms of fun factor. There was a lot of conversation around his kit and overall design, though there was consensus that Ramattra wasn't viable in enough situations. The developers chose to increase his power while in Nemesis form by upping his armor and speed. The cooldown on Void barrier was also decreased in order to create more overall uptime with his abilities.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 3, Annihilation was given a timer, so that it would tick down slower if enemies are in it (previously, the timer paused entirely), and a cap of 20 seconds will be added. This was done to remove \"unhealthy gameplay scenarios,\"; the developers want Ramattra to feel imposing and intimidating, but not hopeless to fight against."}

Ranged abilities are in contrast to &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; abilities. Most abilities are ranged abilities.\nHitscan and Projectiles.\nMost ranged weapons and abilities are referred to as either being hitscan or projectiles.\nA hitscan weapon/ability has no travel time, and will hit a target within the shooter's crosshairs as soon as the weapon/ability fires. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;Cassidy's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Peacekeeper\"&gt;Peacekeeper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Kiss\"&gt;Widow's Kiss&lt;/a&gt;.\nA projectile weapon/ability has a travel time, and will hit a target only if the projectile collides with the target. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Strike\"&gt;Fire Strike&lt;/a&gt;.\nDamage Falloff.\nCertain ranged weapons and abilities have a property known as damage falloff. Damage falloff means that the weapon/ability does less damage, the farther the shooter is away from the target when it hits them. \nFor example, if &lt;a href=\"Ashe\"&gt;Ashe&lt;/a&gt; hits an enemy who is standing right next to her with , it will deal full damage. If, however, Ashe hits a distant enemy with , it will deal much less damage (because of how far away the target is from Ashe).\nCurrently, all forms of &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; weapons (except for &lt;a href=\"Juno\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;'s Mediblaster) and abilities have no damage falloff attached. Meaning distance from the source of healing will not affect the amount you receive.\nFor the following 2 lists, &lt;a href=\"Weapon%23Beams\"&gt;Beams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weapon%23Melee\"&gt;Melee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt; abilities are all excluded as non have damage falloff. However, an ability that is a mixture weapon types will be added. For example, &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Pummel\"&gt;Pummel&lt;/a&gt; is considered both a Melee and Projectile. \nWeapons affected by Damage Falloff.\nThis is a list of all the heroes with weapons or abilities affected by damage falloff, with some stats of the weapon.\nWeapons unaffected by Damage Falloff.\nThis is a list of all the heroes with weapons or abilities that aren't affected by damage falloff, with some stats."}

{"id": "352", "revid": "51967249", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=352", "title": "Reaper", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". He is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nHellfire Shotguns, the ghostly ability to become immune to damage, and the power to step between shadows make Reaper one of the deadliest beings on Earth.\nStrategy.\nReaper is a short-ranged flanker and one of the deadliest heroes in the game up close, with even Tanks like &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt; melting under the power of his Hellfire Shotguns. Wraith Form is one of the greatest invulnerability tools in the game; Reaper can use it to escape or chase his enemies thanks to his increased speed and immediate reload. Shadow Step is another flanking ability; provided enough time to set it up, he can use it to move to any location within his line-of-sight. When the main fight begins, Death Blossom can turn the tide of battle when using it in the middle of the fight. Its high constant damage can tear most heroes to shreds if they are not prepared. Reaper's relative simplicity makes him a good hero for new players, while still remaining deadly in experienced hands.\nReaper lacks in-combat mobility, as his Wraith Form is mainly used to save his life and escape from near-death situations, and Shadow Step is very loud and makes Reaper unable to move for a while, so he becomes easy prey if spotted. Reaper works best in close-combat and is nearly useless in fighting at mid- to- long range due to quick damage falloff and the large spread of his weapon. Death Blossom is easy to shut down by &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control%23Stun\"&gt;stunning&lt;/a&gt; Reaper or blocking it with a friendly &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt;. Reaper is most effective in a team composition or a map that keeps the fight in close-quarters.\nStory.\nThanks to his military training, Reaper has a 'sixth sense' for danger. Due to experiments carried out by &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Dr. Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt;, Reaper's cells simultaneously decay and regenerate at a hyper-accelerated rate. The process has been described as \"molecular cleansing,\" where he is \"wiped away piece by piece.\" One moment he may appear as flesh and blood, the next, as a cloud of black smoke\u2014disjointed, but still in control of his molecules. Even after the complete destruction of his body, Reaper has been observed as being a \"black mist,\" and is then able to regain physical form at a later point. He has described living in the condition as a form of \"constant agony,\" though it is only through O'Deorain's experiments that he is able to stay alive. Because of these same treatments, Reaper finds it difficult to control his anger. He is sadistic but intelligent, with a keen sense of observation, and has talent in information-gathering. He prefers to operate behind the scenes.\nReaper dual-wields &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20shotgun\"&gt;Hellfire shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s, and is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Reaper%20mask\"&gt;specialized mask&lt;/a&gt;. While the latter has its practical uses, Reaper also keeps it on to hide is disfigured face, and to not be recognized by his former family.\nAs Gabriel Reyes, he had a sense of honor that his later persona came to consider antiquated. As Reaper, Reyes believes in a \"code of violence,\" which is, in his view, the only code the world respects. To this end, he is willing to work with &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;, believing in &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s vision for a new world order.\nPre-Crisis.\nGabriel Reyes was born in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;. The Reyes family had lived in LA for generations after moving from Mexico to the US. His mother was a social worker, and his father operated his own convenience store. Both of Gabriel's parents were proud of their intelligent, athletic son, and supported his decision to join law enforcement after graduating college early with a degree in criminology.\nReyes joined the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Los Angeles Police Department&lt;/a&gt;. As a police officer, he participated in hundreds of violent crime arrests. Reyes fast-tracked his way into a detective posting, where he was able to hone his already keen sense of observation and talent for information-gathering. He came to realize that sometimes, the quieter work was essential to unraveling larger issues. However, despite all of his work in the force, the crime rate never seemed to decrease, leading him to believe that he would have to get to the source of the problem to truly destroy it.\nIn his twenties, looking for a change of pace, Reyes enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;, some nine years before the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Reyes did well and became known as a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustang_%28military_officer%29\"&gt;mustang&lt;/a&gt;, working his way up through the ranks before obtaining a senior officer's position, then veteran status, and was highly respected. He helped topple a number of authoritarian regimes, but watched in dismay as mega-corporations took control and repeated the same abuses just to maximize profits. Time and again, Reyes watched as the innocent suffered while the elites escaped prosecution. He took part in numerous extraction missions, though was was often tasked with simply extracting the target and handing them off to another party. Sometimes, to a fate \"too ghastly to recall.\" Later, he became involved in matters of national security.\nReyes later earned a coveted position in the government's controversial and classified (but widely acknowledged) &lt;a href=\"Soldier%20Enhancement%20Program\"&gt;Soldier Enhancement Program&lt;/a&gt;. Military scientists shaped Reyes and other inductees into the perfect soldiers, augmented with superhuman speed, strength, and agility. During the soldier enhancement program, Reyes was referred to as Soldier: 24. He made few friends among the other recruits.\nThe Omnic Crisis.\nThe Soldier Enhancement Program.\nReyes was still part of the Soldier Enhancement Program when the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began. He helped coordinate multiple early troop movements in response to &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;'s attacks, and fought fiercely against the proposal that all large urban meetings be ceded to Anubis. It was during one such comittee meeting that Reyes learned that both his parents had been killed in an assault on Los Angeles. Reyes became depressed, blaming tactical decisions he'd taken part in for the loss of his parents. He continued to train with other SEP candidates, but those who knew him during could tell that Reyes had become unfocused. He remained standoffish towards his fellow candidates, as he was aware of the probable outcomes that most of them would experience (death).\nHowever, Reyes did end up befriending one fellow candidate\u2014&lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, designated Soldier: 76. Given how the SEP worked, this made Morrison the 76th candidate, and he was hazed for his high recruitment number, with many other candidates seeing his late enlistment as a sign of cowardice. Reyes was not among them, as he recognized Morrison's quiet determination that he judged would carry him through the enhancement process. Despite their different backgrounds, Reyes and Morrison became fast friends, and Reyes provided Morrison with emotional support as they both endured the seemingly endless barrage of medical experimentation.\nEventually, the tests ended, and Reyes and Morrison emerged as super-soldiers, along with the minority of other candidates who'd survived the process. They left the &lt;a href=\"Wheeler%20Facility\"&gt;Wheeler Facility&lt;/a&gt; 24 hours before being cleared for release, eager as they were to rejoin the fight. Technically, this meant they were already in the field before they were announced to the world (the only two candidates to be formally revealed). Reyes's first recorded action as a SEP member was the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Echo%20Park\"&gt;Battle of Echo Park&lt;/a&gt;, where he saved thousands of lives and drove the invading &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s back to &lt;a href=\"Glendale\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile in the SEP, Reyes tended to take on smaller, less flashy missions. However, he was still integral to the Program's public success. He enjoyed challenges that relied on stealth and intelligence, given his police background.\nJoining Overwatch.\nAs governments tried and failed to neutralize the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; was busy forming an international task force called &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. Reyes and Morrison were both on the shortlist of prospective members. While Reyes was not the &lt;a href=\"Adhabu%20Ngumi\"&gt;first person&lt;/a&gt; to be approached to lead its strike team, he \"was\" the first person to accept, thus becoming the first person to be recruited into Overwatch (officially), and ultimately, its first strike commander. Reyes accepted, but was uneasy with the role. As a man who had always preferred to operate behind the scenes, he was ill-at-ease with the global attention. Morrison, who was recruited as Overwatch's second member, would have a greater impact on the group in the long term. He brought out the best in the people around him and helped mold Overwatch's diverse (and sometimes conflicting) agents into a cohesive fighting force. \nOperations.\nAlongside Morrison and &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;, Reyes took part in an operation at &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. By this stage, the burden of leadership was beginning to get to him.\nIn unity, they found the strength to defeat the robots and end the Omnic Crisis. \nOverwatch.\nReorganization.\nAfter the Omnic Crisis, Morrison, because of the key role he played in shaping the group, was given the position of strike commander by the UN, the first, official commanding officer of Overwatch. Reyes was overlooked due to being \"too rogue,\" along with his maverick leadership style. &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; was of the opinion that Reyes was overlooked as &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Adawe\"&gt;Gabrielle Adawe&lt;/a&gt; felt that Morrison could lead rebuilding efforts better than him, further commenting that Morrison \"looked the part\" of a war hero.\nDespite losing his rank, Reyes was relieved that Morrison was given the position, preferring to be the number 2 rather than hold the more political position. Morrison told Reyes that they made the wrong choice, that Reyes should have been in charge, but regardless, Morrison retained the position.\nNot long after the end of the Omnic Crisis, Reyes met a woman named &lt;a href=\"Martina%20Reyes\"&gt;Martina&lt;/a&gt; while on leave in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The pair later married and had a son. When his son was six, he took him to &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Park\"&gt;Echo Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlackwatch.\nReyes became the commander of Overwatch's &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; unit. After a sting operation that resulted in the apprehension of &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gang\"&gt;Deadlock Gang&lt;/a&gt;, at the time Reyes visited the man, as he was impressed with his expert marksmanship and resourcefulness. Reyes gave Cassidy the choice between rotting in a maximum security prison, or joining Blackwatch. Cassidy chose the latter. Reyes gave him personal instruction. \nAt some point, Reyes and &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Lacroix\"&gt;Gerard Lacroix&lt;/a&gt; partook in an operation in &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;, where Lacroix apparently saved Reyes, though Reyes remained mute on what actually happened (though in recollection, apparently found the experience amusing).\nAnother individual that Reyes recruited into Blackwatch was disgraced geneticist &lt;a href=\"Moira%20O%27Deorain\"&gt;Moira O'Deorain&lt;/a&gt;, as he wanted someone who could advise him on genetics. O'Deorain's experiments on Reyes gave him supernatural abilities, including the ability to manipulate his form.\nA Growing Rift.\nAt least for a time, Reyes remained on good terms with the rest of the team. On one Halloween, he dressed up as a pumpkin-headed monster, bursting through the door as &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; was telling a Halloween story. &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt; gave praise to his costume, with Ziegler asking him if he'd be open to designing their official uniforms. He responds with \"that'll be the day.\"\nAs time went on, the tension between Reyes and Morrison worsened, even though Morrison spent a lot of time defending Reyes's more questionable actions.\nRetribution.\nRome.\nNine years before the present day, &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; appeared on Overwatch's radar. One year later, Reyes was in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"Rome%20Blackwatch%20facility\"&gt;Blackwatch facility&lt;/a&gt; alongside Cassidy to meet up with G\u00e9rard Lacroix, who was spearheading anti-Talon operations. Lacroix briefed them on &lt;a href=\"Antonio\"&gt;Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, a Talon arms dealer who had links with the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; government, and who was also behind a recent attack on Overwatch's &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; facilities. Antonio was holed up in &lt;a href=\"Rialto\"&gt;Rialto&lt;/a&gt;, a compound in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;. Cassidy was all for a \"road trip,\" but Lacroix pointed out that Antonio was too well connected, and planned to play the long game in bringing Antonio to justice. Reyes agreed with Lacroix, and left the building with Cassidy. Seconds after exiting, the building was destroyed in an explosion set by a Talon agent. Reyes and Cassidy rushed into the burning rubble to save whoever they could find, with Reyes pulling out Lacroix.\nReyes was shaken by the event. Lacroix survived, and Ziegler informed him that he would make a full recovery, but at least 14 other agents and personnel weren't as lucky. At &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;Overwatch Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, he discussed the issue with Jack Morrison, and Morrison stated that they'd launch an official investigation. Reyes stated that Morrison's approach of \"by the book\" wasn't working, and that Antonio would weasel his way out of any proceedings launched at him. Reyes told Morrison that he wanted to apprehend Antonio to interrogate him, but Morrison pointed out that if such an operation was sanctioned, it would be a violation of Italy's sovereignty, and would erode the public trust in Overwatch. Reyes agreed that \"officially\" Morrison could never do so, but Blackwatch could get it done with no public relations conflict. Morrison left the final choice with Reyes, but asked him to seriously consider if it would help Overwatch keep the world safe in the long run.\nAfter silently thinking things over at Lacroix's bedside, Reyes decided to go ahead with the operation and took himself, Cassidy, O'Deorain, and &lt;a href=\"Genji%20Shimada\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt; on that \"road trip\" that Cassidy had suggested back in Rome. Reyes planned to snatch Antonio from Venice for a few days of interrogation, and use what he knew of Talon to hit the organization hard.\nRialto.\nArriving in Venice, Reyes and his team used the safehouse there and set up surveillance on Antonio's manor. It was heavily guarded by Talon soldiers, but when night fell, the unit moved in. The initial plan was to go in quietly, and in that, they succeeded, stealthily making their way to Antonio's office. Antonio however, was unfazed, calling Reyes by name. He pointed out that Overwatch abducting a \"respected businessman\" would be a public relations nightmare, and even if they did take him, Antonio's \"friends\" would have him released within the week. Reyes, after some thought, said \"you're right,\" and shot Antonio, sending his body flying out the office window, much to the consternation of Cassidy. This alerted the guards to their presence, and the Blackwatch team had to fight their way out of the manor. As they fought, Reyes and Cassidy continued to verbally spar over Reyes's actions. O'Deorain however, stated that Reyes had done the right thing. Reyes stated that he'd never apologized for anything before, and that he didn't intend to start now\u2014someone had to get things done.\nThe team succeeded in escaping the manor. In the aftermath, Morrison was incensed by Reyes's actions; the attack was reported in the press, and the existence of Blackwatch had been made public. Reyes was debriefed by Morrison, &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;, and a recovered Lacroix. Morrison grilled Reyes in the debriefing, demanding to know what had actually happened. Reyes snidely responded to Morrison's demands, but nonetheless recounted the Rialto mission. In his debrief, he pointed out that things don't always go according to plan, and stood by the decisions he had made. Reyes and the others were put under suspension.\nUprising.\nSeven years before the present day, Reyes and Morrison attended a briefing on the King's Row Uprising in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;Overwatch's headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. During the briefing, Blackwatch agent &lt;a href=\"McCree\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; reported on a developing hostage situation occurring at a power plant, despite the prime minister of England's demands that Overwatch remain out of the crisis. Angered by the breach of protocol, Reyes shrugged off Jack's accusing finger, stating that Cassidy was merely on \"vacation,\" and that he was not tied down by the statute. He left the command room, stating that the Brits had this under control, snidely drawing reference to Morrison's statue in the headquarters's courtyard.\nThe following day, a strike team sent in by Morrison arrived in King's Row. Reyes informed them that Blackwatch assets had reported that Null Sector had set up heavy fortifications, and they had tactical control of the area. Null Sector was defeated, but the events that transpired were classified within Overwatch's archives.\nMeeting Doomfist.\nA key point in Reyes's life was when he met &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, after his apprehension in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; (an apprehension that Reyes played a role in), three weeks after his &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;accountant&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Storm%20Rising\"&gt;cornered&lt;/a&gt; in Havana, Cuba and cut a deal with Overwatch. While Reyes had some satisfaction in seeing Doomfist incarcerated, Doomfist himself was unperturbed, calmly pointing out the world's broken global order, and how he, in his own view, fought against it. Reyes had long held similar doubts, but maintained that one could recognize a flawed system without resorting to terrorism. Doomfist acknowledged the point, but asked Reyes what he'd accomplished in that regard, be it as a police officer, a soldier, or an agent of Overwatch. \nReyes found himself unable to answer, and Doomfist asked another question\u2014who was he really protecting? Again, Reyes couldn't answer, as he realized the truth in Doomfist's words. Of all the organizations he'd been part of, none of them had fixed the system. Not even Overwatch. It was in this moment that a seed of vengeance was planted in Reyes\u2019s psyche. A seed that would give rise to Reaper. A ghost no longer subscribing to outdated notions of honor, but rather a new believer in a code of violence.\nThe only code the world respected.\nReflections.\nAfter Ana disappeared in an operation conducted in Poland, Reyes assigned Cassidy to find her. However, Overwatch was unable to find her.\nThe End of Overwatch.\nUltimately, Overwatch met its end through a combination of accusations that tainted the organization's reputation, and Reyes himself. Officially, Reyes and Morrison were killed in the blast that destroyed Overwatch's Swiss headquarters, an event the UN ruled as an accident. In reality, Overwatch had become split down the middle, with Reyes leading a rebellion against Morrison's leadership. As a battle was waged within the base, their fighting triggered an explosion that destroyed the facility. In his last moments, he saw the flash of ignition, felt the searing heat, saw the horror in Morrison's eyes, and then...darkness. As far as anyone knew, the explosion that consumed the structure took Reyes and Morrison into the inferno with it. To the present day, Reyes's true agenda remains unknown to the wider public. \nResurrection.\nReyes barely survived the blast, and woke up to find Dr. O'Deorain standing over him. As Reyes drifted in and out of consciousness, Moira explained how she\u2019d overloaded his body with a cocktail of experimental chemicals\u2014an enhanced version of the substance that had first given him the ability to manipulate his form. She claimed he'd been so close to death that she was left with no other option. Reyes lay on the gurney, feeling a sense of indescribable detachment\u2014as if his body were made of a silky molten metal that flowed between various states of matter. In one moment, he was flesh and blood; the next, he was a cluster of black smoke, aware of every molecule and yet terrified of losing command of it. Reyes looked at his arm, a torrent of ebon mist in the vague shape of an appendage. Internally, he screamed in horror, but a very small part of his brain was intrigued by it. He knew his power had grown, and his old life felt like a prologue.\nReyes was left in a state of agony, and it was now much harder for him to control his anger, but thanks to O'Deorain, he was alive. Dr. O'Deorain's procedure had amplified his powers, but had significantly destabilized his ability to control them. Reyes blamed Morrison for what had happened to him, and he didn't believe that his former friend had perished in the blast. He set out on a personal crusade to find Morrison and finish what had begun in Switzerland.\nReaper.\nReyes resurfaced as a volatile mercenary known as \"Reaper.\" His identity and motives remained unknown. Now a ruthless and remorseless killer, he was responsible for terrorist attacks throughout the world. He fought in many armed conflicts throughout the 6 years since the blast, showing no loyalty to any cause or organization. Survivors described him as a black shadow ghosting unscathed through the most hellish battlefields. The few bodies recovered of his victims were pale, empty husks drained of life, their cells showing signs of intense degradation. It was speculated that Reaper was a byproduct of failed genetic alteration which forced his cells to simultaneously decay and regenerate at a hyper-accelerated rate.\nThose attempting to track his movements began to see a pattern in his appearances. They believed (correctly) that Reaper was hunting former Overwatch agents and systematically eliminating them. This was indeed the case, as Reaper carried a list of Overwatch agents that he intended on eliminating.\nTalon.\nOne year after the destruction of Overwatch's HQ, Reaper joined Talon. While it suited his goals, he was perturbed by Talon's dynamic (or lack thereoff)\u2014multiple people pursuing their own agendas that just happened to align. However, he shared Doomfist's goal of establishing a new world order, and saw Talon as \"the bullhorn for the voiceless.\"\nCode of Violence.\nDespite remaining incarcerated, Doomfist still had influence in Talon, and one year after Overwatch's end, he assigned Reaper to retrieve Dr. &lt;a href=\"Siebren%20de%20Kuiper\"&gt;Siebren de Kuiper&lt;/a&gt; from a black site in New Mexico. Dropped off via &lt;a href=\"dropship\"&gt;dropship&lt;/a&gt;, he met with fellow Talon agent, &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;. The two grated against each other immediately, Sombra's unorthodox methodology clashing with Reaper's military training. He wondered what Doomfist had told Sombra about him, and wondered who, if anyone, he could rely on within Talon.\nInfiltrating the base, Sombra triggered the alarm. Guards responded, but Reaper killed them quickly and efficiently. Part of Sombra's plan, apparently, as she used the distraction to hack the comms. terminal, cutting the base off from the outside world, along with determining the location of de Kuiper. They entered the site proper, though the tension between the two remained. Their goals were aligned for now, but what happened when they weren't? \nInside the base, they encountered more guards which Reaper again easily killed, though not without unease, as he remembered that once, he too, had been a soldier in the US military. However, his doubt was dissolved as he remembered Doomfist's words, and by Sombra, who continued to grate on his nerves. Regardless, they entered the base's quantum chamber and found du Kuiper, but ended up drawing their guns on each other. It was broken up by &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, who led a Talon squad into the lab. Not that he'd known it, but it had been his and Sombra's job to clear a path for the extraction team. As Widowmaker explained, the mission had been too important to leave to amateurs.\nReaper made his way out of the base, passing by the bodies of the fallen. He realized that he'd now crossed the line, and could no longer call himself morally superior to terrorists. As blurred as the line between heroism and criminality could be, he knew he'd stepped over it. As Widowmaker and Sombra boarded the extraction dropship, they both mocked him, telling the mercenary that he'd find his place in Talon, even if it was at Akende's feet. As his own dropship flew over the countryside, Reaper was left to reflect on what Talon actually \"was\". Reprehensible, true, but decicive. A means to an end. As he took off his mask, feeling the wind sting his tortured flesh, the last embers of Gabriel Reyes died.\nThe only thing that mattered was his need for justice. Something Doomfist required at his disposal if he was going to fix this broken world. Because now, it was all he had left to give.\nWatchpoint: Gibraltar.\nAlongside &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; operatives, Reaper entered in an effort to gain a list of Overwatch agents. The Talon soldiers kept &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; occupied long enough for Reaper to begin downloading the agent database, but soon found themselves overpowered, forcing Reaper to enter the fray. He quickly incapacitated Winston, and mocked the ape that he'd send his fellow agents his regards. Winston stunned Reaper by activating a shield device that detonated, and then used his &lt;a href=\"Tesla%20Cannon\"&gt;Tesla Cannon&lt;/a&gt; on Reaper, incinerating him. Yet despite this, a cloud of black mist was seen leaving the base awhile later.\nIn truth, Reaper not only survived Winston's cannon, but had managed to gain access to a portion of the database. He used the data to eliminate a number of Overwatch agents.\nDoomfist's Gauntlet.\nHaving regained physical form, Reaper teamed up with &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; in order to steal &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s gauntlet, but was hampered by former &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; agents &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; and Winston. While he initially held the advantage, breaking Winston's glasses was enough to send the ape into a berserk fury, and Reaper and Widowmaker were forced to retreat without the device, having been used by a bystander to punch Widowmaker which ended up damaging the gauntlet, their foes hot on their heels.\nOld Soldiers.\nReaper was present in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Hakim\"&gt;Hakim&lt;/a&gt; was trying to set a trap for Morrison, now waging a one-man war as \"Soldier: 76.\" Hakim's compound came under attack by Morrison, though Reaper managed to get the jump on his old nemesis, shooting him in the back. Before he could finish off Morrison, he was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;, another former Overwatch operative. She healed Morrison through her &lt;a href=\"biotic%20rifle\"&gt;biotic rifle&lt;/a&gt;, and Reaper and Morrison engaged in a fist fight. Reaper was again able to incapacitate Morrison, and engaged in a dual with Ana, bitterly commenting that he shouldn't be surprised, that Ana had always taken Jack's side during their days in Overwatch. In the fight, Ana pulled off his mask, revealing his identity as Gabriel Reyes, and his disfigured face. Reaper faded away, commenting that Overwatch had left him to die, and that Ana should never forget what happened to him.\nReflections.\nAt Christmas, Reaper stalked his family down the streets through the rain.\nValkyrie.\nReaper led a Talon assault on the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Temple of Anubis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing battle against the &lt;a href=\"HSI\"&gt;HSI&lt;/a&gt; forces, Talon also had to contend with Morrison and Ana resurfacing. Morrison apparently engaged Reaper, but when asked about what happened, simply commented \"old soldiers are hard to kill.\" Reaper apparently headed for Europe after the attack.\nInfiltration.\nReaper worked with Widowmaker and &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; in a mission to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Katya%20Volskaya\"&gt;Katya Volskaya&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of &lt;a href=\"Volskaya%20Industries\"&gt;Volskaya Industries&lt;/a&gt;, on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Vialli\"&gt;Vialli&lt;/a&gt;. Sombra hacked the site's systems, allowing Reaper to bypass the factory's defenses and get within striking distance of the target, though it would be Widowmaker who would take the shot. The operation went awry when an alarm was sounded, and Widowmaker missed her shot in the commotion. Reaper ordered her to hold the perimeter while he entered the factory, guns blazing, killing numerous guards. He was confronted by a &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;, which temporarily incapacitated him, and he ordered that Sombra take out the target. Reaper was able to reduce the mech to a pile of scrap, but Sombra reported that Katya had escaped. Furious, Reaper ordered that the agents return to the ship. He walked off, throwing away his shotguns in frustration.\nIn truth, Sombra had let Volskaya live, in an attempt to gain leverage over her due to her dealings with the omnics. Reaper later developed suspicions about her actions with Volskaya, possibly learning the truth in its entirety.\nPrison Break.\nReaper was able to gain access to a &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Securities\"&gt;Helix Securities&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Securities%20maximum%20security%20prison\"&gt;maximum security prison&lt;/a&gt;, using an aircraft that was able to penetrate the base's defenses, likely due to Talon moles within Helix. Once inside the base's perimeter, Reaper headed to the prison grounds. He killed over a dozen of the base's security agents, before breaking out &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;, as well as possibly other inmates.\nMasquerade.\nAway from the base, Doomfist and Reaper discussed recent Talon operations, such as the assassination of Mondatta, and the failed assassination of Volskaya. He discussed his list with Doomfist, and how Morrison and Ana were still on it. When asked if that was due to sentimentality on his part, Reaper denied it. He helped set Doomfist up with &lt;a href=\"Maximilien\"&gt;Maximilien&lt;/a&gt; in Monaco, where Vialli sent some of his men to assassinate Doomfist. The attempt failed, and Reaper, along with Doomfist, Widowmaker, and Sombra, headed for &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;. There, they killed Vialli's men, while Doomfist killed Vialli himself. Afterwards, Doomfist and Reaper met with Talon's inner council, where Doomfist declared his intention to start a war.\nA Great Day.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s failed attack on &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; that had led the attack crashed in the sea while on its way back to base. &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; sent Reaper, &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate the ship and retrieve &lt;a href=\"power%20relay\"&gt;power relay&lt;/a&gt; data for a device Talon was building. After entering the ship, the carrier's dormant &lt;a href=\"Nulltrooper\"&gt;Nulltrooper&lt;/a&gt;s activated, forcing Reaper and Sombra to fight their way through them to a room where Sombra could perform her hack. Mauga asked if they were \"taking suggestions,\" but Reaper ordered him to hold the perimeter. Mauga did no such thing however as he ran off, apparently pursuing his own agenda. An irate Reaper drew his shotgun on him, but was forced to deal with the attacking Nulltroopers instead as Sombra continued to hack the ship's systems.\nThe ship began to sink, and Reaper told Sombra they were out of time. She refused to leave, stating that she wouldn't leave without the data. Reaper accepted, and used his wraith form to exfiltrate the ship and enter the dropship. He took off, with Mauga and Sombra getting onboard on time before the command ship sank into the ocean.\nHaving completed the mission, an irate Doomfist contacted the team, demanding an explanation as to why a covert op had resulted in the complete destruction of the carrier. Sombra explained what had happened, pinning the blame on Mauga. Having heard her account, Doomfist ordered Sombra to execute Mauga, or meet the same fate. Reaper offered to be the executioner, but Sombra refused, and headed into the back of the ship to do the deed herself. However, Mauga escaped execution, as he revealed the reasons for his actions, and handed Sombra the ship's actual power relay.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nPrior to the development of \"Overwatch\", Reaper was the name of one of the player classes in the cancelled &lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;, which in the original pitch for the game that would become \"Overwatch\" was envisioned as wielding dual shotguns and a magnum, and using the abilities Death Blossom and Shadow Walk. This class was reworked into the present day Reaper as one of the first three characters designed for \"Overwatch\", alongside Tracer and Widowmaker. The character of Reaper was inspired entirely by concept art for the game\u2014his actual character was developed after his appearance was presented. Originally, he only had a single shotgun.\nUnder \"Overwatch\"'s original leveling system, Reaper's wraith form would give him healing abilities once he reached a certain level. Reaper once had a slimmer design with a mask that was more human looking and dual wielded SMGs.\nAlong with most heroes, Reaper's appearance was redesigned for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". They spoke about integrating his armour, cloak and iconic cowl into his new look, while keeping the classic reaper silhouette. They experimented with his colour scheme in development, such as trying completely silver arms and more jacket layers. Ultimately, they replaced his \"bone white\" mask and other features with a more \"deadly, edgy silver\" to change his colour scheme. ."}

The conflict between &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s and humans has now claimed over fiftry thousand lives. So far, the international community has been reluctant to intervene.&lt;br&gt;\nAthena: Every time you see news of this sort, we go through this. Remember, recalling &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; agents to act in duty comes with great risk. The Petras Act clearly states: any Overwatch activity is deemed illegal and punishable by prosecution.&lt;br&gt;\nWinston: I know. You're right. That's the way the world is. But I do miss the old days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Harold%20Winston\"&gt;Dr. Winston&lt;/a&gt;: I think you have something that belongs to me. Hand them over. Oh, it's okay, you're not in trouble. Oh, I'll trade'ya. There you go, buddy.&lt;br&gt;\nDr. Winston: There's not much to see from here, kiddo. But you know there's more out there, don't you. Come on. It's time I showed you something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAthena: I'm detecting intruders!&lt;br&gt;\nWinston: Talon. Athena, kill the lights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAthena: Security protocols failing. Winston! Reaper is extractng Overwatch agents database!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAthena: Extraction at 32%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDr. Winston: You took these because you wanted to see if there was more out there. Well, see for yourself.&lt;br&gt;\nWinston: Woah.&lt;br&gt;\nDr. Winston: Always remember. Never accept the world as appears to be. Dare to see it for what it could be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAthena: \"Winston! Winston!\" Winston.

It is held in the &lt;a href=\"Scrapyard\"&gt;Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Reckoning is hosted every few seasons\u2014a boisterous, week-long gathering full of feasting, fighting, and shows of strength. Anyone may publicly challenge the reigning Junker monarch provided they defeat all the other challengers first. It\u2019s the main event of the Reckoning: challengers spend all year training, building ostentatious &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;s and weaponry, and cultivating juicy rivalries.\nThe Reckoning (or at least the challenge to the monarch) is a free-for-all. Once there, four combatants, including the reigning champion, take part in the fight. There are no rules, nor standardized equipment. The only way to survive the Reckoning is to win, or to be granted mercy by the winner. The Reckoning is open to those outside the Junkers.\nHistory.\nIt is not clear if &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Howl\"&gt;Mason Howl&lt;/a&gt; became king via a Reckoning, but he had numerous Reckonings over his thirteen years of rule. His reign came to an end through &lt;a href=\"Odessa%20Stone\"&gt;Odessa Stone&lt;/a&gt;, who was the first &lt;a href=\"Wastelander\"&gt;Wastelander&lt;/a&gt; to make it to the Reckoning. Becoming queen, Stone ruled for at least a decade. Few dared to challenge her, and none succeeded.\nTrivia.\nThe Reckoning appears to be inspired by the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//madmax.fandom.com/wiki/Thunderdome\"&gt;Thunderdome&lt;/a&gt; from \"Mad Max\"."}

He is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nClad in powered armor and swinging his hammer, Reinhardt leads a rocket-propelled charge across the battleground and defends his squadmates with a massive energy barrier.\nStrategy.\nReinhardt is the sturdiest of the Tanks, boasting high base Health and a massive barrier that allows him to protect himself and his team from harm. While largely defense-oriented, Reinhardt can be a deadly offensive threat as well thanks to the high damage of his Rocket Hammer and ability to crush enemies against a wall with Charge. The price he pays for all of this is that he is almost solely restricted to fighting at short range, having only a single, infrequent ranged attack.\nStory.\n\"Justice Will Be Done.\"\nA highly decorated soldier with a strong moral compass, Reinhardt Wilhelm styles himself as a champion of a bygone age, who lives by the knightly codes of valor, justice, and courage. Possessing an \"active imagination,\" he enjoys eating currywurst, is talkative, and is a fan of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hasselhoff\"&gt;David Hasselhoff's&lt;/a&gt; music, along with &lt;a href=\"Krankenwagen%20Gr%C3%BCn\"&gt;Krankenwagen Gr\u00fcn&lt;/a&gt;. He spars with &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt; every day, after which they go to a pub or tavern to relax. He is not good with computers.\nEarly Life.\nReinhardt was born to working-class parents in &lt;a href=\"Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and grew up dreaming of knights, chivalry, and adventures of old. He was a decent student, but upon graduation from secondary school, he entered the &lt;a href=\"German%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;German Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;, seeking glory and pursuing his childhood ideals. Reinhardt's superior officers labeled him a powerful, dedicated soldier with a strong moral compass, but he struggled with unit cohesion and following orders he disagreed with. Nevertheless, he served two full terms with the GAF before he transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Initiative\"&gt;Crusader Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a Crusader, Reinhardt was made a lieutenant. He served under &lt;a href=\"Balderich%20von%20Adler\"&gt;Balderich von Adler&lt;/a&gt;, who saw a spark in the young lieutenant and took him under his mentorship.\nOmnic Crisis.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began, the Crusaders became the lynchpin of all Germany military operations. Reinhardt was among the first to petition for more mobility and weaponry, claiming that the Crusaders could claim victory if given the proper tools. He was also one of a few Crusaders to advocate removing regular infantry from Crusader tactics, asserting that Crusaders would be slowed down while protecting their comparatively unarmored counterparts. Von Adler attempted to broaden Reinhardt's mind, but Reinhardt refused to be swayed.\nHonor and Glory.\nReinhardt and his fellow Crusaders, von Adler included, took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Eichenwalde\"&gt;Battle of Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt;. Balderich was chosen to join the strike force that would become &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, and was given a medal in the shape of the organization's logo with its name etched on the back, indicative of his selection. The night before he was set to leave and join his new team he and Reinhardt spent time together at Braueret Mittagskrug where Reinhardt balked at the idea of vanishing into a secret organization instead of staying in Eichenwalde, serving as a Crusader, and the glory that came with it. Before master and pupil could further debate the issue any further, Eichenwalde came under direct attack by omnic forces, and the two shook hands reciting the Crusader's oath before entering the fray.\nYoung and reckless, Reinhardt disobeyed orders to stay with his unit in favor of charging headlong into battle on his own determined to destroy as many omnics as he could in the name of glory. Though he destroyed every &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Siege%20Automaton%20E54\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; unit unfortunate enough to cross paths with him Balderich caught up to him and angrily ordered him back to his unit which was, unknown to the two, under extremely heavy fire. Insistent that they were not only fine but simply slowing him down Reinhardt continued to carve a path through the omnic forces until a then-unknown &lt;a href=\"OR14\"&gt;OR14&lt;/a&gt; unit dropped onto the field. Thrilled with the idea of a new foe Reinhardt rocketed towards the new adversary only for his opponent to stop his charge and slash Reinhardt's left eye with its heat blade. Ordering their forces to fall back, Balderich was forced to intervene to save his defenseless student. Though he succeeded, Balderich's shield emitter was destroyed and he was mortally wounded by the OR14's heat blade. With the German forces in full retreat the pair fell back to the great hall of Eichenwalde castle.\nBarricading the door, Balderich ordered Reinhardt back to the rally point with the rest of the Crusaders. Cheerfully insistent on fighting his way back with Balderich it wasn't until his master removed his helmet and insisted that he was staying did Reinhardt notice the gravity of Balderich's wound. Distraught, Reinhardt tried to reason with Balderich only for him to remind Reinhardt of his Crusader's oath and demanded that he keep it as he extended his hand. Unable to simply leave Balderich to die Reinhardt still refused. Instead of ordering him away, Balderich gently reminded him that the team needed him to be their shield, which at last caused Reinhardt to relent and he took his master's hand one final time. When their grip broke Reinhardt found Balderich's Overwatch acceptance medal in his hand. Exchanging the Crusader's oath one final time Reinhardt left Balderich his hammer and left him to his fate.\nReinhardt successfully rejoined his unit, shielding them with his body when his barrier gave out. The German forces ultimately pushed the omnics back enough to give the rest of the armed forces time to counterattack, but Eichenwalde and Balderich were lost, and with the exception of Reinhardt himself, no other Crusader escaped the battle alive. Balderich's death changed Reinhardt and his mentor's sacrifice would weigh on him for decades after the fact, but until then Overwatch awaited.\nAs one of the few survivors of the battle, Reinhardt never spoke publicaly about the horrors he had experienced, but his personality changed, demonstrating a more generous approach to the ideals he had always espoused.\nEarly Missions.\nReinhardt was inducted as part of the original Overwatch strike team, becoming its fourth member after &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;. Ten days after the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt; as the strike team's fifth member, the Overwatch strike team was dispatched on its first set of missions. Reinhardt and his fellow operatives took part in missions in &lt;a href=\"Darkhan\"&gt;Darkhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shenzhen\"&gt;Shenzhen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kyoto\"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;. The initial missions were unqualified successes, and the team was dispatched on several more operations, including &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater Actions.\nDuring one battle, Reinhardt held the line against advancing omnic forces, while awaiting the arrival of human infantry. An &lt;a href=\"ATW-Huntsman\"&gt;ATW-Huntsman&lt;/a&gt; came within point blank range of his shield, but it had suffered so much damage, it began to detonate. Reinhardt waved at the advancing infantry to get clear, but it was too late\u2014the ATW detonated and sent the infantry hurling through the air.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"the%20Awakening\"&gt;the Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, Overwatch moved in for the kill against &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing operation, Reinhardt, Reyes, and Morrison took point in infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Anubis's facility&lt;/a&gt; with a combined troop of Overwatch forces, and &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Army\"&gt;Egyptian Army&lt;/a&gt; personnel temporarily under Overwatch's command. The team fought through Anubis's forces, clearing the way for Overwatch engineers to arrive to isolate the &lt;a href=\"god%20program\"&gt;god program&lt;/a&gt;. While this was the battle that effectively sealed humanity's victory in the war, the Omnic Crisis waged for months afterwards, as Overwatch fought against Anubis's warbots and omnics that remained loyal to the &lt;a href=\"AI\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;. The strike team's final missions included &lt;a href=\"Wellington\"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jakarta\"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; before the war reached its end. By this point, all of Reinhardt's extended family had been killed by the omnics.\nPost-Crisis.\nFollowing the Crisis, a brief but vicious political battle erupted over the future of Overwatch, as its record was put under the microscope. This extended to its strike team, and in Reinhardt's case, his prior insubordination as a Crusader was called into question. Despite these objections however, Overwatch's charter was extended and expanded, their mission rescoped to rebuild the world Anubis had left in ruins. Overwatch grew into a global institution, keeping the peace in a war-torn world. Reinhardt proved himself to be one of its most stalwart champions. \nReinhardt's unique ethics and larger-than-life persona earned the admiration of his peers and superiors alike. Never afraid to speak his mind, he was Overwatch's most vocal supporter and, when necessary, its harshest critic, providing a constant reminder that Overwatch was meant to be a force for good. He got on well with &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt; (who maintained his armor). While a member of Overwatch, Reinhardt denied multiple offers of promotion, insisting that his duty was to the people first, and that no member of Overwatch should be too far from the frontlines, where true heroes were forged every day.\nOperation White Dome.\nNot long after the Omnic Crisis, Reinhardt took part in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20White%20Dome\"&gt;Operation White Dome&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a mission to root out omnic forces in &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; who remained loyal to Anubis. As soon as he and his team were deployed, they came under fire by the entrenched omnic forces. While the battle saw all the omnics subdued, Reinhardt was lightly injured. Torbj\u00f6rn was seriously injured, but Reinhardt was able to save his life in the battle, stabilizing him. However, Torbj\u00f6rn lost his left arm. \nIn the after-action report, Ana recommended that Reinhardt receive a commendation for his actions. He did indeed receive a reward for his \"conspicuous bravery.\"\nBecause of their wounds, both Reinhardt and Torbj\u00f6rn were left temporarily out of comission. Both were sent to recover in &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;. As Torbj\u00f6rn recovered in the hospital, Reinhardt spent a great deal of his time at Torbj\u00f6rn's bedside. Half in jest, Torbj\u00f6rn stated that if Reinhardt shut up, he would be allowed to name his newest daughter (who was due to be born very soon, and which the German had been asking about for several months). In correspondence to his wife &lt;a href=\"Ingrid%20Lindholm\"&gt;Ingrid&lt;/a&gt; about what had happened to him, he admitted that he had already been considering making Reinhardt the baby's godfather anyway. Reinhardt agreed, and when Torbj\u00f6rn's daughter was born he named her &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Lindholm\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;, which her mother apparently agreed with. Reinhardt was close with Brigitte as she grew up, telling her tales of valor and chivalry, and he effectively became part of the Lindholm family himself.\nMoney for Floods.\nSometime after the Omnic Crisis, massive flooding struck &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the worst of which was in &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;. Reinhardt, Morrison, &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Chase\"&gt;Vivian Chase&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt; were among the Overwatch members who worked alongside the Canadians in rescue and evacuation efforts.\nUprising.\nSeven years before the Overwatch recall, Reinhardt was part of an unsanctioned mission authorized by Strike Commander to end the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. While preparing to board an aircraft, Reinhardt welcomed the team's newest member, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Lena Oxton&lt;/a&gt;, to the team.\nThe team fought their way through the streets, even as hordes of &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; omnics tried to bar their way. The events that transpired were classified within Overwatch's archives.\nMisc. Events.\nAt some point Reinhardt was stationed at , where he got a tan. One night, he and &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt; danced in the command center until dawn.\nWhile in Overwatch, he took part in an operation in &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; that he bungled, apparently because Morrison thought Reinhardt could be stealthy.\nAt some point after the Uprising, Reinhardt was among those present at Morrison's birthday celebration.\nAsunci\u00f3n.\nAs Overwatch entered its twilight years, Reinhardt entered his midfifties. This was not unusual in of itself (as many of the members of the original strike team were of similar ages), and his enthusiasm for fieldwork had not diminished. Still refusing promotion, Reinhardt continued to chase the honor and glory he'd first found as a Crusader, and was more than happy to take point on missions alongside younger agents.\nStill, nothing good could last forever, as Reinhardt discovered when he was dispatched on a mission to &lt;a href=\"Asunci%C3%B3n\"&gt;Asunci\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, responding to a hostage situation at the &lt;a href=\"Global%20Energy%20Summit\"&gt;Global Energy Summit&lt;/a&gt;. The terrorist &lt;a href=\"Hivemind\"&gt;Hivemind&lt;/a&gt; had struck the &lt;a href=\"Palacio%20de%20los%20L%C3%B3pez\"&gt;Palacio de los L\u00f3pez&lt;/a&gt;, taking fifty hostages while she remained locked in a room with proprietary security data. Reinhardt's commanding officer ordered him to wait for negotiators, but Hivemind began executing her hostages. Knowing that obedience would lead to further loss of life, Reinhardt refused the order to stand down and, with the full support of his team, went charging in.\nIn the resulting action, 47 lives were saved, but Hivemind escaped with the data she'd sought\u2014the hostages had been a distraction. While many within Overwatch saw Reinhardt's actions as heroic, the world's militaries didn't see it that way. In a joint missive, the militaries of various nations that had been represented at the summit demanded reparations for the stolen data, and an accounting as to why Reinhardt had disobeyed his orders. \nAs mission commander, Reinhardt was forced to take the fall. A confused Reinhardt confronted Morrison and Chase, citing his success in Paraguay and countless other missions. An exasperated Morrison and Chase explained that disobeying direct orders had consequences. This was no longer the Omnic Crisis, and Overwatch had to operate within the red tape. Reinhardt was forced to retire from mandatory combat operations, and while this was officially due to his age, there was no precedent to be found in Overwatch's charter. \nReinhardt's loss was a heavy blow to the strike team's morale. Torbj\u00f6rn, only four years younger than him, was particularly incensed that the organization simply \"pushed Reinhardt out\" after giving everything of himself in years of service. The Swede would not forget the incident, and related the unfairness of it all to at least Brigitte. The general public was also sympathetic, and with the loss of Reinhardt, there was the sense that Overwatch had lost one of its best. One who had guided the organization, and given voice to its better angels.\nRetirement.\nDespondent about being removed from active duty, Reinhardt feared that his days of purpose and glory had ended. He returned to Germany, but only briefly before he relocated to &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; so he could be close to the Lindholms. \nAs times grew darker and Overwatch came under suspicion of corruption and sedition, Reinhardt could only watch as the cause he had dedicated his life to defending surrendered in disgrace.\nOne year prior to its disbandment, Overwatch's Swiss &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, apparently killing &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; in the blast. Reinhardt spoke fondly of his former commander at his memorial service.\nTaking up Arms.\nThough Overwatch was eventually disbanded, Reinhardt was not content to sit idly by while the world fell to disorder. Once again donning his Crusader armor, he vowed to fight for justice across Europe like a knight of old, defending the innocent and winning hearts and minds with the promise of better days to come. In this he was now accompanied by an adult Brigitte, who helped maintain his armor just as her father did, acting as his squire. The pair would get into numerous scraps. More and more, Brigitte was forced to tend to Reinhardt in addition to his armor, as while his body was breaking down from years of combat, his enthusiasm wasn't.\nAt some point he was present in &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;, where he protected omnics and their sympathizers from rioters.\nDragon Slayer.\nWhile in &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, Reinhardt and Brigitte found themselves low on fuel and money. They stopped off in a town to get some of the former, but found it practically abandoned. They discovered that the area was being menaced by the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28group%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, a group of scavengers who were seizing territory, unopposed by the local authorities. They encountered some of the Dragons themselves, and Reinhardt stepped in, demanding they leave. They refused, and proceeded to beat him into the ground. Laughing at his now inability to fight back, they headed off, warning Reinhardt that he should do likewise. Not following that advice, Reinhardt and Brigitte got his armor back into fighting shape. With Brigitte having located the Dragons' base of operations in a nearby factory, Reinhardt headed off to confront them. Willingly or otherwise, Reinhardt saw the Dragons as actual dragons of myth, and fought them as the proverbial knight. In this he succeeded, and demanded that they leave these lands and never return.\nThe next day Reinhardt was back in the town, telling the mayor that the Dragons would bother his people no longer. Their job done, he and Brigitte headed off to get some fuel. And currywurst.\nRecall.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; initiated the Overwatch recall from , Reinhardt's location was shown to be in southwestern Greenland.\nAt some point after receiving Winston's recall, Reinhardt forwarded it onto &lt;a href=\"Fareeha%20Amari\"&gt;Fareeha Amari&lt;/a&gt;. However, she refused to join Overwatch, as her place remained with &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Security%20International\"&gt;Helix Security International&lt;/a&gt;.\nReflections.\nAt Christmas that same year, Reinhardt and Brigitte spent Christmas at her parents' home.\nAnswering the Call.\nFollowing Winston's initiation of the Overwatch recall, Reinhardt had apparently agreed with Brigitte that he did not have to respond. However, when they eventually returned to Braueret Mittagskrug in Eichenwalde, where he had first learned of Overwatch years ago, Reinhardt indicated that he was reconsidering his decision. Brigitte, remembering the story of his forced retirement by Overwatch, was apprehensive at the idea. Staring at Balderich's worn acceptance medal, Reinhardt reflected on the events of his master's death. Visiting Balderich's remains, Reinhardt placed the medal on the arm of the throne, returning it to the man who made him what he was. Echoing his master's words to him, he quietly declared to Brigitte that he had been called and that he would always answer.\nA New War.\nZero Hour.\nDonning his armor once more, Reinhardt and Brigitte travelled to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, where they aided the newly-refounded Overwatch in repelling &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s forces after the opposition began pushing them toward an early retreat. Demonstrating a new shield inter-locking system alongside his companion, both held off the terrorist organization's &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; devised a strategy; ultimately granting them enough time for &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; to deal the final blow from the inside. After the omnic fell, Reinhardt joyously rejoined Overwatch alongside &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;, and Brigitte; the old crusader happily greeting his comrades and welcoming newcomer Mei into the team.\nInterlude.\nFollowing the battle in Paris the team traveled to , where Brigitte took advantage of Winston's technical expertise to enhance Reinhardt's armor, upgrading it to version 09.\nResistance.\nAs it turned out, Paris was just the beginning of Null Sector's attacks. One of them was &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. Reinhardt and his fellow Overwatch members arrived and allied with &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio%20Correia%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;L\u00facio Correia dos Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Reinhardt ordered the team to split up into two squads, with one focusing on getting the civilians to safety, and the other taking the fight to the command ship. The ship was destroyed and Rio saved, though there were reports of Null Sector attacking other cities.\nThe team returned to Watchpoint: Gibraltar, where they were greeted by &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Cassidy\"&gt;Cole Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; and his new recruits. This boosted their numbers, but given the size of Null Sector's forces, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; declared that they couldn't take them head on. Cassidy suggested recruiting &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Chase\"&gt;Vivian Chase&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter their arrival, Reinhardt wrote in his journal. He noted that the younger members of the team looked up to him, and reflected that he didn't blame them. He expected their future battles to go just as well as Rio, and was confident that Overwatch would defeat Null Sector promptly, after which a new Overwatch would take shape, even better than the old one.\nLiberation.\nOverwatch arrived at &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, which was under assault by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. They reunited with Sojourn, and fought their way through the city to evacuate civilians. In this, Overwatch succeeded, but ultimately, Toronto fell to Null Sector. During the fighting, they observed &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt;s fitting metal clamps to Toronto's &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, incapacitating them. After the battle, Reinhardt tried removing one of the clamps by force, but Sojourn intervened. If there was a way to remove the devices, it had to be done safely. To this end, Brigitte suggested visiting Torbj\u00f6rn, and Reinhardt agreed, confident that the engineer would have answers. Plus, it would be good to see him again.\nWhile en route to &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, Reinhardt wrote in his journal. He noted that things were worse than he had thought, and &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;whoever&lt;/a&gt; was behind it had to be stopped. He also noted his concerns about Sojourn\u2014when they'd arrived in Toronto, they'd found her fighting against Null Sector alone, as if looking to sacrifice herself. Reinhardt found her behavior troubling, as it wasn't like her. He wondered if the past few years had been as difficult for Chase as they had been for him. He reflected that people like he and Sojourn needed purpose, or else they started to go a little \"verr\u00fcckt.\" On a happier note, he was confident that Torbj\u00f6rn would find a means of removing the clamps, and that he would rejoin Overwatch as well.\nIronclad.\nReinhardt and Brigitte arrived in Gothenburg with one of the incapacitated omnics. They showed it to Torbj\u00f6rn, who after some reminiscing, examined the subject. He explained that while it might be possible to remove the clamp, he wasn't reading anything in the omnic's databanks. The omnic was alive, but its 'essence' was gone. Reinhardt suggested restoring it using a backup, but Brigitte pointed out it wasn't that simple, given the nature of omnic sapience.\nThe bliss was interrupted by the arrival of a &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; unit. Thinking it was part of Null Sector, Reinhardt charged it, but Torbj\u00f6rn intervened, explaining that this Bastion wasn't like the ones they'd fought in the Omnic Crisis. Reinhardt refused to back down, and Torbj\u00f6rn pointed out that he, and the omnic, had changed. That out of everyone here, the only person who hadn't changed was Reinhardt himself. \nThe confrontation was interrupted by Null Sector invading Gothenburg. Reinhardt commented that it was likely that Null Sector had followed them here. Regardless, the four of them worked together to repel the invaders; they successfully defended the city, and inflicted critical damage against Null Sector's command ship. For Reinhardt and Torbj\u00f6rn, it was like old times, but contrary to Reinhardt's expectations, Torbj\u00f6rn refused to rejoin Overwatch. He was willing to let Brigitte join Overwatch, but he had to stay here, to protect his home and family. He offered Reinhardt the chance to stay as well, for as he pointed out, it was time for a new generation to lead Overwatch.\nReinhardt remained committed to Overwatch however. For him, it was his second chance. He, Brigitte, &lt;a href=\"Ganymede\"&gt;Ganymede&lt;/a&gt;, and Bastion departed, while Torbj\u00f6rn told them he'd continue to study the omnic.\nAfter Gothenburg, Reinhardt returned to his journal. While he had been disappointed, he noted that in retrospect, he shouldn't have been surprised, given the size of Torbj\u00f6rn's family. If anything, he actually agreed with Torbj\u00f6rn, that it was time for a new generation of Overwatch heroes. However, he would be there to teach them, and save the world in the process. In the meantime, he was up to ch. 3 of \"&lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Empire%20of%20Dawnfire\"&gt;Dawn of the Empire of Dawnfire&lt;/a&gt;\", and was surprised at its plot developments.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nReinhardt's design stems from the playable Juggernaut class in the cancelled &lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;. During the initial pitch for the project that would become \"Overwatch\", the Juggernaut was envisioned as wielding a flamethrower and a flail, and used the Charge ability; a flamethrower was also considered for &lt;a href=\"Roadhog\"&gt;Roadhog&lt;/a&gt;'s primary weapon early in the development for \"Overwatch\". \nEarly ideation for Reinhardt's design in \"Overwatch\" involved several different versions of humanoid robots, eventually progressing into a robotic hero from &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Wildebeest\"&gt;Wildebeest&lt;/a&gt;. When Reinhardt was solidified, the fantasy was of him being a heroic knight; a protector for his team.\nWhen Reinhardt was prototyped, he was able to throw his hammer against the enemy. However, this was awkward to implement, as he had to pick up his hammer every time he threw it. This ability would later inspire the &lt;a href=\"Junker%20Queen\"&gt;Junker Queen&lt;/a&gt;'s Jagged Blade ability.\n&lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Tsang\"&gt;Arnold Tsang&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Reinhardt's new design for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" marks the ninth iteration of his armor, progressing from the eighth in the original game. This continues a legacy that dates back to Arnold's concept art for the Juggernaut class in Project Titan, which went through seven iterations before the game was cancelled. Reinhardt's new design incorporates some elements from those scrapped Juggernaut concepts, and features a more technologically advanced appearance to show that Winston helped upgrade it after Reinhardt rejoined the team.\nExternal links.\n "}

{"id": "1991", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1991", "title": "Respawn", "text": "Respawning is a mechanic in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", which allows players to automatically come back to life without intervention of other players briefly after being eliminated by the enemy team, environment or by special game mechanics in &lt;a href=\"Custom%20Game\"&gt;custom games&lt;/a&gt;. A player may also respawn by the use of &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy's&lt;/a&gt; ability, which revives the player at the location of their death.\nRespawn timer.\nWhen a player is eliminated, they will initiate a 12 second respawn timer, which upon ending causes the hero to automatically respawn in their team's &lt;a href=\"spawn%20room\"&gt;spawn room&lt;/a&gt;. Wave Respawn can decrease this timer when active. During &lt;a href=\"overtime\"&gt;overtime&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes' respawn timers are increased and Wave Respawn is disabled. \nFollowing game modes alter the default respawn time:\nWave Respawn.\nWave Respawn is a feature introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 12. It replaces Group Respawn, while also being implemented into &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;competitive&lt;/a&gt; game modes and extending the default respawn timer to 12 seconds.\nIt functions in the following way:\nSpawn rooms.\nUpon respawning, the players will spawn in spawn rooms. Spawn room locations and when you unlock another spawn, change throughout the game, one example of this is on the push maps where a forward spawn can be earned by pushing halfway to the opposing side's checkpoint.\nRespawning in Deathmatch.\nOn any &lt;a href=\"Deathmatch\"&gt;Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt; mode, the respawn timer can be skipped at the 3 second mark by pressing Jump. Additionally, since there is no single spawn area, players will respawn at one of the pre-determined locations on the map. The locations are not fully random, but are specific spots on the map, and depend on the other players' current position.\nHistory.\nAttacker advantage timer.\nAttacker advantage timer was a mechanic in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" that increased the respawn timers of the defending team when attackers outnumber defenders on an objective in &lt;a href=\"Assault\"&gt;Assault&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt; maps. It has been removed in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhile this timer was above 10 seconds, the defenders' respawn time started gradually increasing, up to a maximum of 5.0 seconds increase at ~33 seconds. If the advantage was not maintained on the objective, the timer would start ticking in reverse instead. This delay also stacked with the overtime delay of 3 seconds, resulting in a maximum possible respawn time of 18 seconds.\nGroup respawn.\nGroup respawn was a mechanic in non-&lt;a href=\"competitive\"&gt;competitive&lt;/a&gt; game modes, causing players who are eliminated close to each other to respawn together. This results in some players having either a slightly longer or shorter queue than the standard 10 seconds. The purpose of group respawn is to reduce snowballing that happens due to uncoordinated teams being unable to group up by themselves. Group respawn was replaced by Wave Respawn mechanic in &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season 12&lt;/a&gt;.\nGroup respawn is checked and applied immediately whenever a player is eliminated. If the eliminated player's respawn timer is within 5 seconds of the previous eliminated player, group respawn will trigger, causing the respawn timers of all affected players to be averaged out. Group respawn does not happen if the match is in &lt;a href=\"Overtime\"&gt;Overtime&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor example, players A and B die within 4 seconds of each other. When player B is eliminated, player A's death timer is currently at . As the two players are within 5 seconds, group respawn will trigger, causing both players respawn timers to be set to .\nGroup respawn can trigger in succession, meaning that it can also affect a previous respawn group. Continuing from the previous example, assume player C is eliminated 2 seconds after player B. When C is eliminated, the remaining respawn timers of A and B are at . This is within 5 seconds of C's respawn timer (10 seconds), so a group respawn will trigger again and all three players have their respawn timer set to . In this example, although player A and C were more than 5 seconds apart by themselves, the group respawn between A and B brought A into the range of group respawn of C, causing all three to spawn together."}

Released on 3 May 2018, making it the 26th map added to the game.\nBackground.\nRialto was home to &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Antonio\"&gt;Antonio Bartalotti's&lt;/a&gt; sprawling estate and the backdrop to the infamous \u201c&lt;a href=\"Venice%20Incident\"&gt;Venice Incident&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d a turning point for &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; and Talon. The Italian government has taken great steps to preserve &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;, and the results are striking. Tourists visiting this picturesque town can sample the regional cuisine, enjoy a relaxing gondola ride, visit Galleria D\u2019arte Omnica (the local art gallery), or take in the sights with a stroll along the canal. \nGameplay.\nRialto is an Escort Map which takes place in three main locations: The Grand Hotel and Courtyard, The Rialto Bridge and Dock, and the Talon Headquarters.\nThe Grand Hotel and Courtyard.\nAttackers spawn in the Art Museum at the start of the map. Outside of spawn, there are three walkways, two of which are thin bridges and one which is a larger bridge in which the payload moves along. In front of the bridge are three high grounds, one extending along the payload track. After this is a large open area where the payload reaches the next checkpoint. Around the Courtyard are paths that lead along the river for flanking. Attackers spawn in a building adjacent to the courtyard after reaching the checkpoint.\nThe Rialto Bridge and Dock.\nThe next checkpoint is a large arched bridge leading over to a two-storey building. Along the left side of the payload, track is a high ground which the building connects to, arching over the payload track. Outside the building on the other side is an open area with an open wall that lines the payload track. The payload curves around and stops in front of another archway. Defenders spawn in the two-story building at the first checkpoint. Attackers spawn after the first archway for the second checkpoint.\nTalon Headquarters.\nThe Final stretch is an uphill push that curves into a large open building. This area has two key flanks, one through a building on the right leading to the corner and another on the left leading to a wide building or to the payload track. The payload must be moved into the large building to win. Defenders spawn here on the second and third checkpoints, with the second spawning underground closer to the track and the third spawning in the back of the large building.\nGondola Rides.\nOn the map are Gondolas, which are moving platforms across the waterway. A selection of boats and gondolas move across the water, and the Omnic Gondoliers can be destroyed when attacked. The boats will start near the attacker's spawn and will loop around near the bridge after the first point. "}

At some point, he was recruited into &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; as part of its supplementary army force. Like his fellow recruits, he was in awe of the capabilities of Overwatch's core strike team, and at times, truly believed they could win the war.\nIn one battle, he and his fellow troopers took part in a city battle, where he and his unit were assigned to rendezvous with &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, who was holding the line against advancing &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; forces. An &lt;a href=\"ATW-Huntsman\"&gt;ATW-Huntsman&lt;/a&gt; came within point blank range of Wilhelm, but was destroyed by human gunfire. The resulting explosion sent Perez and his fellow troopers hurling through the air. Perez, however, survived the blast.\nIn another battle, he was cornered by a pair of &lt;a href=\"OR14\"&gt;OR14&lt;/a&gt;s, though they were destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the battle, during night, he and his fellow troopers ambushed a column of OR14s from above, while &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Reyes\"&gt;Gabriel Reyes&lt;/a&gt; tore through them on the street itself using his &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20shotgun\"&gt;Hellfire shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s. The column was destroyed, and Perez and his fellow troopers celebrated.\nPost-Crisis.\nPerez survived the Omnic Crisis. He apparently rejoined the Brazilian Armed Forces, rising to the rank of lieutenant general. He likewise became a member of &lt;a href=\"UN%20Military%20Affairs\"&gt;UN Military Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.\nDecades after the war, Perez was interviewed on the conflict and the history of the &lt;a href=\"Omnica%20Corporation\"&gt;Omnica Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to recounting his service, he commented that the creation of &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; had been a mistake\u2014arrogance, rather than science."}

Rio's mayor favored Calado's proposal, due to the company's history with Rio. This was in the midst of protests from Rio's townsfolk, protesting against any re-development of their neighborhoods. However, as the Calado building was destroyed in a detonation (likely caused by Vishkar itself), the contract went to Vishkar. Months later, Rio had a new city center.\nPart of the original deal or otherwise, Vishkar secured a contract to redevelop large tracts of the city. The people were told that the development would improve their lives. However, that promise never became a reality. Vishkar imposed controls on the residents in the name of building a more orderly society: enforcing curfews, cracking down on what the company perceived as lawless behavior, and exploiting the populace as a cheap labor force. Sonic technology was employed to suppress the people. However, city resident &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio Correia dos Santos&lt;/a&gt; stole the technology and used it against Vishkar, leading a popular uprising that drove out the corporation. \nThe Battle of Rio.\n&lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; attacked Rio, quickly overrunning much of the city. &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; fought against the attacking &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s, along with civilians, and fighter jets tried to engage Null Sector's &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt;. However, Null Sector forces continued to pour into the city, and while the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; helped stem the tide, Null Sector still had the means to deploy forces \"ad infinitum\". The team split up\u2014alongside L\u00facio, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; would fight their way into the ship, provided transport by &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; in the team's &lt;a href=\"shuttle\"&gt;shuttle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt; would help evacuate the civilians, while &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; ran a distraction. The plan worked, and the command ship was destroyed. \nTrivia.\nRio is featured in &lt;a href=\"Para%C3%ADso\"&gt;Paraiso&lt;/a&gt; (an &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;) and in the &lt;a href=\"story%20mission\"&gt;story mission&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

With limited resources and time, Mei must use science to figure out a way to get help.\"\nRise and Shine is an Animated Short by Blizzard Entertainment that details &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt;'s backstory. It was uploaded to YouTube on the 23rd August 2017.\nIt begins with Mei explaining in a video log that she and her friends are still stuck in an ice storm. Their resupply delivery window was missed because of it, are running low on rations and so &lt;a href=\"Opara\"&gt;Opara&lt;/a&gt; decided they're going to \"hibernate\" in the hope of rescue coming. Another team member hands Mei one last drink and reminds her they're an hour behind schedule. Mei is also going to leave the sensors online so she has a new dataset to work with when she wakes up, and signs off when the man calls for her.\nIt is only when receives a message coming through on a weak signal that Mei is woken up by her cryopod to deal with it. She wakes up &lt;a href=\"Snowball\"&gt;Snowball&lt;/a&gt; from the room's charging port and says to her friends \"Rise and shine, sleepyheads.\". After brushing her teeth (blowing a mischievous Snowball away with a hairdryer) and putting a kettle on for the team's tea, she examines the dataset to find the anomalies on the surface are much worse than her team predicted. When she receives more and more data, she asks Snowball how long the team has been asleep, and is given the answer of 9 years.\nMei is stunned, unable to believe that Overwatch didn't rescue them. After she stores the data on a USB stick, Snowball pulls up relevant news stories from the news they received over the years before communications went down. She learns that not only was the Ecopoint considered lost in the storm, but that Overwatch is gone-disbanded by the Petras Act. She realizes that her team hasn't woken up yet; with growing alarm she runs back to the cryo lab to check on them and is devastated to find that they are dead: their cryopods malfunctioned and they all died in their sleep. After falling into a seated position with Snowball in her arms and grieving for several hours, she looks at the USB stick in her hand and wonders aloud that with 9 years worth of research data she could save millions of lives. She makes a promise to her friends that she will bring their work to the world. Or rather, she'll try.\nMei soon realizes this will be easier said than done-the radio tower is broken, the snowcat is full of snow, the standby helicopter's main rotor has a snapped blade, and although she contemplates journeying into the Antarctic on foot she backs away. She states that she can't do it alone and wishes her friends were still there, before Snowball brings her a cup of tea. She thanks the robot as there is a small power fluctuation, and she decides to find out a way of extending the life of the station's power supply batteries. As she minimizes the cryopod status window, she finds the message. The signal is still weak but it is broadcasting on the Overwatch Emergency Frequency. She thinks this might be a rescue message but she has to climb and reinforce the radio tower to know for certain.\nComing up with a plan, she uses various parts found around the Ecopoint to make an improvised aerial and construct a prototype Endothermic Blaster over a period of around two days. Just after she successfully completes an endothermic reaction test but before she has finished making the blaster, the power dies completely; she realizes to her growing horror that in her excitement over the message, she had completely forgotten about saving power. There are no more batteries left either. Without power the station will eventually become an icy tomb, and neither can she finish the blaster: either way means death. As Mei tries to think of a way to restore power-just enough for her work station for a bit more time-Snowball recognizes that there is one source of power left: himself. Not knowing, or even caring about, whether he will be able to recharge ever again, he plugs into the room's charging port and completely drains his own batteries. Mei notices the power restoring, but her renewed hope quickly turns to shock when she sees why this is happening just as Snowball shuts down. Initially distraught by this, Mei realizes the importance of why Snowball had made his choice, and after emotionally thanking Snowball Mei finishes the prototype, now truly on her own.\nMei climbs the tower using her blaster to create ice to climb and reinforces a missing section beside a hazardous materials tank, partially covering it. Nearing the top, a loose girder breaks off under her weight: she leaps to safety, but the section strikes the supporting ice below and weakens the tank, causing it to explode and sending the tower toppling over. Dangling by one hand, Mei desperately fires the blaster and is amazed at the resulting large pillars of ice supporting and securing the tower to the ice wall, and finishes climbing as it turns dark.\nUsing her aerial and her laptop, Mei manages to locate the signal to find it is Winston's recording recalling Overwatch agents to active duty. At the end of the message, he asks those watching if they are with him as she looks up at the aurora australis in the night sky, and she says \"Yes Winston. I'm with you.\" After leaving each of her deceased friends' mugs full of fresh tea at the foot of their cryopods (as a funeral) Mei confidently sets out into the Antarctic on foot with a supply sled of survival gear, including her blaster and a recharge port hooked into a solar panel for Snowball. Sometime after setting out from the Ecopoint in the cloudless day, Snowball wakes up and Mei tells him \"Rise and shine, Snowball. We're on our way!\""}

{"id": "2575", "revid": "41295751", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2575", "title": "Roadhog", "text": "Roadhog is a &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". He is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nRoadhog uses his signature Chain Hook to pull his enemies close before shredding them with blasts from his Scrap Gun. He\u2019s hardy enough to withstand tremendous damage, and can recover his health with a short breather.\nStrategy.\nRoadhog is best played like his occupation: a bodyguard. Though his Chain Hook excellent for singling out vulnerable enemies and yanking them in for the slaughter, it's an effective defensive tool as well; it can pull diving enemies away from your more vulnerable teammates, or pull them back in after they try to retreat from a hit-and-run. His Scrap Gun gives him powerful short to medium-range damage, while Take A Breather allows him to remain a persistent threat, even without a friendly Support. The Pig Pen is an excellent early-warning system for flanking routes, as well as a powerful addition to your Chain Hook combo if you can pull them into it. However, he cannot create barriers or destroy projectiles, making him less effective than most tanks when your focus is on directly protecting your teammates. He can function as a flanker, where his chain can catch enemies unawares and kill them before they can react. With his large heal on a medium cooldown, he can operate for long periods of time away from his team. However, if you can alert your team when you hook an opponent they will be likely to shoot at the target, all but guaranteeing their demise.\nStory.\n\"I'M A ONE-MAN APOCALYPSE.\"\n7'3\" (221 cm) tall, and 550 lbs (250 kg), Roadhog is a ruthless killer with a well-earned reputation for cruelty and wanton destruction. He remains silent most of the time. He wears a mask with \"&lt;a href=\"hogdrogen\"&gt;hogdrogen&lt;/a&gt;\" inhalers, which contain a pressurized chemical mixture that helps counteract the effects of radiation exposure. Despite his outwardly brutal appearance, Roadhog is a sound tactician.\nBackground.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, government officials gifted the &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding area to the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s that had nearly destroyed their country, hoping to establish a long-term peace accord. This arrangement permanently displaced Mako Rutledge and a large number of the Outback's residents, a scattered collection of survivalists, solar farmers, and people who just wanted to be left alone.\nFurious over the loss of their homes, Mako and others turned to violent rebellion. They formed the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Australian Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; and struck against the omnium and its robot population to take back the lands that had been stolen. Events continued to escalate until the rebels sabotaged the omnium's fusion core, resulting in an explosion that destroyed the facility, irradiated the region, and littered the Outback with twisted metal and wreckage for kilometers around.\nMako watched as his home became an apocalyptic wasteland, and he was forever changed.\nAdapting to his environment, he donned a mask and took to the broken highways of the Outback on his ramshackle chopper. Little by little, his humanity was forgotten. The last vestiges of Mako faded away and the ruthless killer Roadhog was born. He continued to dwell in his farm, which was located on the outskirts of Junkertown.\nThe Wastelander.\nRoadhog attended the &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt; that saw &lt;a href=\"Odessa%20Stone\"&gt;Odessa Stone&lt;/a&gt; defeat King &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Howl\"&gt;Mason Howl&lt;/a&gt;. He remained silent the entire time, though &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;one loudmouth&lt;/a&gt; caught his attention as he yelled out \"Junker Queen,\" inadvertantly giving Stone the nickname she'd bear for years to come.\nWasted Land.\nRoadhog remained a thorn in the side of the Junker Queen. He didn\u2019t care\u2014he was there for his gas and everyone else could rot. While an enemy of the queen, he was still allowed inside the settlement as long as he took no weapons in. \nOne night, Roadhog found some Junkers attempting to loot his farm. He hooked one of them, but the Junker told him he was sorry and Roadhog could take all of their scrap and weapons in exchange for their lives. Roadhog accepted, stating (inwardly) that the world deserved them, and that they could scrap every panel around and it still wouldn't get them a mile to a real city. \nHe headed to Junkertown and (after some thinking on how he hated it there and how the Queen and the Junkers deserve what they get) went to a Junker named &lt;a href=\"Bruce\"&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt;. He gave Bruce the scrap and weapons from the looters in exchange for some hogdrogen canisters. Bruce also told Roadhog \"The world wants to forget blokes like us, Mako. Wants us to stay quiet. Don't give 'em the satisfaction.\" \nAfterwards he headed to the bar and silently bought a beer with the leftover coins from the looters. While there, he overheard some Junkers confronting &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt; about what treasure he'd found and also overheard him say he'd offer a friend he could trust a ten percent share. Junkrat pointed at Roadhog as he said the words. Roadhog ignored this at first while some Junkers told him to stay out of it. Junkrat offered higher percentage shares while an unnamed Junker told Roadhog to sit where he was. Roadhog then incapacitated the Junkers threatening Junkrat. \nRoadhog demanded fifty percent of Junkrat's treasure, and after some haggling, Junkrat relented. He thought about Junkrat as the two walked away: \"This idiot. He's a liar. Lies to himself most of all. But he's not the quiet type. The world deserves him. Deserves both of us. And we'll make sure they don't forget it.\"\nOn the Road.\nRoadhog grudgingly agreed to be Junkrat's bodyguard in exchange for a 50/50 share of the spoils. In his mind, better that the spoils go to him than the Queen.\nFor some reason, Junkrat and Roadhog were kicked out of Junkertown, following a string of incidents that included stealing the &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20Junkertown\"&gt;Queen of Junkertown&lt;/a&gt;'s money, blowing up her summer shack, and a bar brawl (possibly the one where they first met). Whatever the reason, Junkrat blamed Roadhog for it. Still, as Junkrat was well aware, there were two things that solved every problem\u2014money, and explosives. That gave him an idea...\nFor a time, the pair wandered the irradiated Australian Outback; Junkrat was his only associate, to the puzzlement of many. Eventually, the pair left the Outback, and embarked upon an international crime spree leaving nothing but havoc and bedlam in their wake. They were responsible for a string of robberies, arson, murder, and other crimes stretching from [[Sydney&lt;/a&gt;] to [[King's Row]]. They had a creed of \"no job too big, no score too small.\" It is known that they performed a heist of the [[Banco de Dorado]] by digging a tunnel. While in the [[United Kingdom]], they stole the crown jewels. Their spree of mayhem and chaos caused untold millions in property damage around the world.\nBritish, French, and Latin American authorities offered rewards for information on the fugitives, and theorized that they were intent on crossing the Atlantic to North America. Their activities were reported on by \"[[A Moment in Crime]]\", by which point the bounty on their heads had reached $25 million.\nGoing Legit.\n[[File:JunkratRoadhog-Going Legit.jpg|thumb|The Junkers face off against the cop bots]]\nAt some point during their escapades, Roadhog and Junkrat were offered a job by a [[The Suit|\"Suit\"]] from [[Hyde Global]]. The Suit claimed that a factory of his in downtown Sydney had been attacked by omnic terrorists, with his workers taken hostage. The Suit told the pair that he wanted to keep the [[New South Wales Police Force|police]] out of it, and that there \"was no-one better\" at keeping things quiet than the duo. The pair accepted the job, and made their way to the factory. Their 'quiet' approach consisted of detonating explosives on the roof and entering the factory in force. They blasted their way through the factory's robots, exited, and brought the whole structure down. As Roadhog reminded Junkrat, there were meant to be hostages, except there were none. And the robots they'd destroyed weren't omnics, but [[cop bot]]s. At this point the actual police arrived, but the two made their escape. Upon realizing they'd been set up, the pair headed back to see their corporate friend. They strung him up on a crane and headed off, leaving the suit to die in an explosion that consumed the entire Hyde Global building.\nReturn to Junkertown.\n[[File:JunkratRoadhogPlan2.jpg|thumb|Roadhog, after Junkrat's screw-up]]\nTheir worldwide heist complete, Junkrat and Roadhog returned to Junkertown, with a hover-trolley loaded with gold and explosives. At the town gates, Junkrat laid out his plan\u2014light the fuse, put on 'inconspicuous disguises', sneak into town, get the trolley to the queen's throne, reveal their deception, and kaboom! Roadhog had Junkrat refine the plan so that it included them escaping the detonation, and escaping with the gold at that. The plan was set in motion, only to be screwed up as Junkrat revealed their identities to the gate warden. The gates were barred shut, leaving the pair with a trolley of gold, useless disguises, and a ticking fuse. Breaking his long silence, Roadhog uttered a single word...\n\"Idiot.\"\nTrivia.\nNationality.\nRoadhog's official nationality is Australian, but there are many hints that may point to him as being a Kiwi and/or of New Zealand Maori descent. \nDevelopment.\n[[File:Roadhog-Tattoo.png|thumb|Roadhog's original tattoo]] \nExternal Links.\n[[Category: Heroes]] \n[[Category:Roadhog| ]] \n[[Category: Junkers]]\n[[Category:Australian characters]]"}

One of these areas was deep-sea exploration.\nAt the time, engineers had been working on exoskeletal suits and energy shielding for several years, primarily operating out of ports on the North Sea. Honisch was a driving force in this area, including the synthesis of advanced hydraulic and fusion technologies. The Robo-Tauchanzug were developed by Honisch to withstand the rigors of heavy construction and oceanic pressures, and they were used to construct seafloor research facilities.

A hero's role describes the general characteristics of the hero and their purpose on the team. \nTank.\nTank heroes soak up damage, create space for your team, and break apart fortified positions, like closely-grouped enemies and narrow choke-points. If you\u2019re a tank, you lead the charge.\nThere are currently Tank heroes in the game:\nExceptions.\nRoadhog lacks a barrier and has no armor or shields, so he is unable to be a protector for his teammaes. However, his Take a Breather ability reduces incoming damage by 40% while healing back half of his health, allowing him to survive large amounts of damage. This leaves the door open for his teammates to pick off distracted enemies, and for Roadhog himself to single out enemies with his Chain Hook. \n&lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt; offers very little protection to the team, making him weak when defending. Unlike other Tanks, he is not meant for long engagements, since his only protection ability, Adaptive Shield, has a long cooldown and a relatively short duration. Instead, Wrecking Ball's role is to disrupt the enemy team with Piledriver, or simply deny space with Grappling Claw or Minefield. This makes Wrecking Ball an aggressive Tank, suitable for dive compositions.\n&lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt; has a smaller health pool than the other tanks, no armor, and cannot protect multiple team members at once. However, her ability to project barriers onto allies can help her and her teammate survive large bursts of damage while dramatically improving her firepower. Because of the lack of defense she offers to the team, she is often played to provide sustainable close-range damage. She is most effective when used in and around cover, taking limited bursts of damage at a time and relying on her &lt;a href=\"Hit%20points\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; health to regenerate between exposures. Because of this regeneration, she is able to work effectively by herself as a flanker, as she does not require constant support and can project barriers from a significant distance.\nDamage.\nDamage heroes are responsible for seeking out, engaging, and defeating the enemy using their varied tools and abilities. Playing a damage hero means it is your duty to secure kills.\nThere are currently Damage heroes in the game:&lt;br&gt;\nExceptions.\nDue to her self-sustain and relatively low damage output, &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; is often considered a Damage/Tank hybrid that focuses less on damaging incoming enemies and more on guarding choke points. She has abilities that can provide more utility to her team than other Damage heroes, and is effective at contesting an objective. Mei also excels at setting up enemies for easy pickings by her team's damage dealers by using her primary fire's freeze effect.\n&lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; deals less damage, and requires skillful aim. She substitutes the burst damage of her fellow Damage heroes in exchange for incapacitating key targets with Hack for her allies to swarm. She's far less self-sufficient than other Damage heroes, relying on team coordination and communication to operate at her strongest.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt; has the potential to output tremendous amount of damage when fully charged, she is often picked for her utility role instead. Her turrets are effective at slowing down mobile targets and disrupting the enemy team, while her teleporter is useful for providing mobility to traditionally immobile heroes and even allow unusual strategies exclusive to her kit. Much like &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;, she requires a highly coordinated team to reach her highest potential. She is also often considered a Damage/Support hybrid, and in the early stages of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\", was in the Support role.\nSupport.\nSupport heroes empower their allies by healing them, boosting their damage, and providing vital utility. As support, you\u2019re the backbone of your team\u2019s survival.\nThere are currently support heroes in the game:&lt;br&gt;\nExceptions.\n&lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt; both provide low amounts of healing compared to the other supports. As such, they may find it difficult to sustain their teammates over the course of long fights. However, they make up for this deficit with more powerful utility in the form of &lt;a href=\"Crossfade\"&gt;Speed Boost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orb%20Of%20Discord\"&gt;Orb of Discord&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. In addition, their &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20ability\"&gt;ultimate abilities&lt;/a&gt; are exceptionally powerful due to the amount of healing provided, and can save their allies during fights; or be used as a way to engage in a team fight.\n&lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; offers very little direct utility for her team, having access to only high healing and lower damage. However, her movement capacity can make up for this, as she can escape many flankers and situations that would render other supports helpless. Additionally, although her damage output is relatively low, she can aid Damage heroes with its consistency, and counters heroes that can absorb projectiles (such as &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;). Lastly, her ultimate ability has the capability to sustain teammates and do massive damage simultaneously, making it a great engagement ultimate.\n&lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt; provides valuable offense when in need, while providing constant support with her passive area of effect healing. This \"carefree\" healing allows Brigitte to focus on using her abilities to knockback, displace and kill certain heroes while providing sufficient healing to her nearby teammates.\nRole Queue.\nRole Queue is the primary queue mode in \"Overwatch 2\", and restricts each team composition to one Tank hero, two Damage heroes, and two Support heroes. Players first select one or more roles before queueing, and once in a match, can only play heroes within the role that they were matched into. \nIn Competitive Role Queue, players have a separate rank and skill tier for each role. \nDevelopment.\nMerging roles.\nDuring the first two years of \"Overwatch\", the Damage role was split into two separate roles, \"Offense\" and \"Defense.\" The Offense role included more aggressive heroes (such as &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;), while the Defense role was for heroes whose strengths were more suitable for a solid defense (such as &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;). \nThese merged into the single role in the June 26, 2018 patch. Blizzard stated that merging the two roles made more sense, as it was becoming harder to differentiate one from the other.\nIntroducing Role Queue.\nRole Queue was added in August 2019 for &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20Play\"&gt;Competitive Play&lt;/a&gt;, and September 2019 for &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Play\"&gt;Quick Play&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the new system was to reduce tension, pressure, disappointment, or even hostility as a team composition comes together, leading to matches that players are in roles that they \"want\" to be in, rather than ones they were forced onto.\nAlthough Role Queue has standardized team compositions, it has drastically increased the time it takes to find a game, especially for certain roles. To pass the time, the &lt;a href=\"While%20you%20wait\"&gt;While you wait&lt;/a&gt; feature was introduced in December 2019, and allows players to use the &lt;a href=\"Practice%20Range\"&gt;Practice Range&lt;/a&gt; and play specialized game modes while waiting.\nAnother effort made to try and reduce queue times was an experimental mode dubbed \"Triple Damage,\" which was available from February 25th to March 3rd, 2020 as a trial. It increased the number of Damage heroes per team from two to three, while the number of Tank heroes decreased from two to one. According to a forum post by &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;, queue times for Damage heroes were drastically cut, but community responses seemed mostly negative, and none of the changes in Triple Damage were made permanent.\nPrior to Role Queue, Blizzard previously attempted to standardize teams by allowing players to enforce roles using the &lt;a href=\"Looking%20for%20Group\"&gt;Looking for Group&lt;/a&gt; feature. This has since been removed.\nOverwatch 2.\nUpon release of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", all roles received a new &lt;a href=\"passive%20ability\"&gt;passive ability&lt;/a&gt; that applied to each hero in the role. Support heroes regenerated their health after staying out of combat, Tank heroes gained knockback resistance, and Damage heroes reloaded faster after getting an elimination. \nEach team's player count was also reduced to six to five, allowing only one Tank per team in Role Queue. In addition to the new role passive, Tank heroes received various buffs to accommodate the reduced frontline presence.\nSeason 9: Champions.\n of \"Overwatch 2\" reworked the Damage role passive, removing the original speed boost and making it so that enemies they damage have temporarily reduced healing. Additionally, the Support role passive was applied globally to all heroes, but with a longer delay for Tank and Damage heroes.\nSeason 10: Venture Forth.\n of \"Overwatch 2\" expanded the functionality of the tank passive, causing it to also reduce damage taken from critical hits."}

Their childhood dream was to build a clinic for the people of their neighbourhood. The two would often visit &lt;a href=\"Lefort%27s\"&gt;Lefort's&lt;/a&gt; during summer. While Baptiste ended up enlisting in the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Coalition\"&gt;Caribbean Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, Ros went on medical school.

Baptiste, who'd returned after a four year absence, asked if there was anything could do to help, but unless he had a magic wand, Ros told him that the answer was no.\nThat same night, Baptiste left the city. He texted Ros that &lt;a href=\"Vernand%20Sainclair\"&gt;Vernand Sainclair&lt;/a&gt; was at a warehouse at the docks, and that he'd agreed to fund the clinic for free in exchange for a ticket of town. He told her to send someone to make the trade, and if he refused to cooperate, \"remind him that we had a deal.\" He then sent a second text, telling her to be okay."}

The gas stations, roadside shops, and cafes have gone into disuse, and the fabled &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gorge\"&gt;Deadlock Gorge&lt;/a&gt; is mostly seen from the comfort of transcontinental train cars. But amid the fading monuments of that earlier era, the outlaws of the &lt;a href=\"Deadlock%20Gang\"&gt;Deadlock Gang&lt;/a&gt; are planning their biggest heist yet.\"\nGameplay.\nRoute 66 is an escort map which takes place in three locations: A Gas Station, Western Town Complex, and a Bunker. Players must escort the payload to the end of the map to win.\nGas Station.\nThe first point takes place at the rubble of a train crash, with attackers having access to a high ground and tunnels to attack on the left, with a dangerous lower route on the right, which can be utilized by the enemy for environmental eliminations. The payload moves through the middle, under an archway. Defenders can sit atop the large gas station which the payload must curve around. There are ridges all along both sides of the gas station for more high ground fighting, and a bridge leads the high ground to the top of the gas station, as well as step access at the back of it. Attackers spawn at the diner at the start of the map and defenders spawn at a shop in the Western Town complex.\nWestern Town Complex.\nThe next stage is a complex of buildings, mainly a garage, a motel, and a saloon. The motel can only be accessed through the lowest floor and leads into the attackers third spawn later. The garage is present on the right side of the map for attackers and can be stood on top of to lead players around a high ground which trails across the rest of this segment, up to the checkpoint. Attackers also have access to a tunnel system on the right highground, or they can use the tunnels near the checkpoint, or the ridge down to the garage from the high ground. The saloon has an accessible interior on both floors, and the roof can be accessed by those capable of reaching high areas. The saloon roof does not have much access to sightlines however. The forward right side of this segment has an environmental hazard. Attackers spawn to the right of the gas station and defenders spawn in the bunker, near the start.\nBunker.\nThe last stage is the bunker which is an indoor location. Attackers can use either of the two entrances near the checkpoint, or can access the high ground which led from the attackers tunnel in the previous area. Inside the bunker are various rooms and elevated areas to attack from. There are a series of moving platforms which move along the attacker's left side of the map, and can be used for transport to behind the defenders. Once the attackers get the payload to the end of the bunker, they win. Attackers spawn at the motel at the start / end of the Western Complex (This segment is a U shape), and the defenders spawn at the end of the bunker.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nSeason 7 design changes.\nThe map received few changes in Season 7 of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". There are now additional places for the attacking team to take cover around their initial spawn. The doors on the first checkpoint will now only close one of the two doors after the payload passes by giving attackers more options to work through the difficult choke points. There will also be fewer places to take cover in the later parts of the map."}

In this, they were successful, as human-piloted &lt;a href=\"Svyatogor\"&gt;Svyatogor&lt;/a&gt; mechs were deployed to battle the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; armies. In Siberia, the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Russian Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt; were able to defeat the omnic forces and shut down their &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt;.

Propaganda was employed to remind the populace of the continuing omnic threat, and a coordinated offensive was made against the omnics, while its Svyatagors guarded its cities. The conflict has since claimed over 15,000 lives, with the international community reluctant to intervene. The &lt;a href=\"RDF\"&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt; was given control over territory east of &lt;a href=\"Krasnoyarsk\"&gt;Krasnoyarsk&lt;/a&gt;, Siberia, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Krasnoyarsk%20Front\"&gt;Krasnoyarsk Front&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith news of unauthorized Overwatch activities at a &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Museum\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt;, the Kremlin joined the international community in denouncing the vigilante actions.\nRecently, the war in Russia shifted in the omnics' favor, as the Siberian omnics breached the Krasnoyarsk Front.

Later, Sanjay was put in charge of her training, instructing her to keep her true thoughts to herself, and to focus on the mission.\nA Better World.\nSanjay communicated with the &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20%28character%29\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; as both Vishkar and &lt;a href=\"Calado\"&gt;Calado&lt;/a&gt; vied for a contract to re-develop the city. Sanjay claimed that Vishkar was the superior choice \"by every concievable metric,\" but the mayor sided with Calado, as its &lt;a href=\"Calado%20%28character%29\"&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt; had a history with the city, and the Vishkar proposal extended into the favela. Satya, by now operating under the callsign \"Symmetra,\" protested, but Sanjay had her stand down for the time being.\nAs night fell, Sanjay ordered Vaswani to infiltrate the Calado building and find some dirt on its owner. He acted as her mission supervisor. She infiltrated the building, but had to escape as she encountered some guards, Sanjay questioning why she incapacitated, rather than killed them. Back outside, Vaswani reported that she hadn't found any dirt on Calado. Sanjay accepted her report. An instant later, the Calado building was rocked by an explosion, destroying it, and a large portion of the nearby favela. Vaswani was aghast, but Sanjay was unperturbed\u2014with Calado out of the picture, nothing would stop Vishkar from doing some good for Rio. \nMonths later, Sanjay and Vaswani stood together as the mayor opened Rio's new city center. Sanjay claimed that it was a shame about Calado, but with its assets destroyed, this was still a satisfactory outcome. He assured Vaswani that the favela's people would be given housing, and that their lives would be made better. Or, at least, to the extent of serving the greater order and befitting their station. When asked whether he was involved in the destruction of the Calado building, Sanjay evaded the question, re-iterating that such events were the price of rebirth.\nNegotiations with Lum\u00e9riCo.\nSanjay engaged in email correspondence with with &lt;a href=\"Lum%C3%A9riCo\"&gt;Lum\u00e9riCo&lt;/a&gt; CEO &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Portero\"&gt;Guillermo Portero&lt;/a&gt;. He made efforts to allay Portero of the events in Rio development, and reassured him that negotiations would be kept private until Portero was confident in making them public.\nAffiliation with Talon.\nSanjay was present at the first meeting of &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;'s reformed inner council in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;, following &lt;a href=\"Akande%20Ogundimu\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt;'s elimination of the existing leadership and change in direction for the organization.\nStone By Stone.\nDuring a Vishkar construction project in &lt;a href=\"Roshani\"&gt;Roshani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, ground-breaking caused a tremor that damaged a temple in the neighboring village of &lt;a href=\"Suravasa\"&gt;Suravasa&lt;/a&gt;, along with destroying the temple's statue of &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;. In a meeting, Sanjay asked if the tremor could have been natural, but Vishkar's head geologist, &lt;a href=\"Harita%20Patel\"&gt;Harita Patel&lt;/a&gt;, assured him that there was no geological activity. Indeed, the region's geologic stability was the reason they had carried out construction there at all, and she reminded him that she'd already warned him that their development was going too fast. PR rep &lt;a href=\"Tamir%20Chada\"&gt;Tamir Chada&lt;/a&gt; stated that if they didn't fix their mistake, they could kiss any further development in the area goodbye. \nOn that note, Sanjay turned to Vaswani, 'asking' her to fix the issue, pointing out that her village background and status as Vishkar's premier hard-light architech would make her an ideal volunteer. He told her that they had to give Suravasa something to show them how sorry they were for the damages. Whatever the village wanted - a retreat, a lump sum for repairs - Vishkar would pay for it. Whatever it costed them, it would be a drop in the bucket compared to the loss of development rights.\nA week after Vaswani arrived, Sanjay and other Vishkar representatives arrived in Suravasa for what Vaswani called \"the unveiling.\" Meeting with her, he wryly commented \"no retreat center then,\" and told her that if anything went wrong, Chandra was present for damage control. Vaswani told him that they wouldn't need him, but Sanjay reminded her that with things like this, someone, somewhere, would always have a problem with something. \nRegardless, the event without a hitch\u2014Vaswani had used hard-light to repair the temple, and in a dance, used that same hard-light to fix the statue of Aurora. Sarpench &lt;a href=\"Ranesh%20Grewal\"&gt;Ranesh Grewal&lt;/a&gt; was impressed, and Sanjay was approached by an &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; pilgrim, &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;. Zenyatta told him \"every dawn brings a new chance to choose our paths. I hope Vishkar Corporation sees that now.\" After Zenyatta left, Sanjay turned to Vaswani, telling her that she'd performed admirably. She told him that she'd miss the people here, and that her actions in the village should serve as an example for how Vishkar should operate going forward; understanding how to interact, to understand, to be understood. That there was much Vishkar could do for places like this, but they had to learn \"how\" to do it. Looking at the repaired statue of Aurora, Sanjay commented that she could be right.\nRebuilding Ruins.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Vishkar smelt a financial opportunity to be involved in the city's reconstruction. Symmetra was assigned to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Arcology\"&gt;Atlantic Arcology&lt;/a&gt; to recruit Niran back into Vishkar. In less than 24 hours, Symmetra was given a whirlwind coaching session from Sanjay, who warned her (correctly) that Null Sector's attack might be a prelude to further chaos."}

It is themed around the real-world Olympic Games, and typically runs from early to mid-August.\nThe Summer Games brawl is &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcioball\"&gt;L\u00facioball&lt;/a&gt;, a 3v3 game mode played on three custom maps where three &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;s must knock a soccer ball into the opposing team's goal.\nHalloween Terror.\n&lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Terror\"&gt;Halloween Terror&lt;/a&gt; was the second seasonal event, introduced in October 2016. It is generally held in mid-October and runs until early November.

It is generally run from mid-December until early January.

The event celebrates the real-world Chinese New Year, and is generally held in late January to early February. During each event, &lt;a href=\"Lijiang%20Tower\"&gt;Lijiang Tower&lt;/a&gt; is decorated for the Lunar New Year. \nEach year, the Lunar New Year cosmetics and overall event theme changes based on the Chinese Zodiac. The themes to date are as follows: \nThe Lunar New Year brawl is &lt;a href=\"Capture%20the%20Flag\"&gt;Capture the Flag&lt;/a&gt; (CTF), a slightly modified 5v5 version of the same real-world game. It is played on a variety of different &lt;a href=\"Control\"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; maps. During the Year of the Dog, &lt;a href=\"Ayutthaya\"&gt;Ayutthaya&lt;/a&gt; was added to the game as a CTF-only map.\nOverwatch Archives.\n&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Archives\"&gt;Archives&lt;/a&gt; was the fifth seasonal event, introduced in April 2017 and last run in 2021\".\" The event released a series of PvE game modes to the &lt;a href=\"Arcade\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt; in which 4 players participated in a mission from the \"Overwatch\" lore. There were 3 missions released in total: \nIn 2020 and 2021, all three missions were available during the event, but had additional &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20event%20challenges\"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; and modifiers that players could choose from.\nOverwatch Anniversary.\n&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Anniversary\"&gt;Anniversary&lt;/a&gt; was the sixth seasonal event, introduced in May 2017. It is an event that celebrates \"Overwatch's\" release. In \"Overwatch\", it ran from late May until early June to celebrate the release date of the original game. Anniversary 2023's timeframe was moved to celebrate \"Overwatch 2\u2019\"s release date, and began on September 19th, 2023.\nIn \"Overwatch\", players were able to unlock any skin from any past event by completing challenges while the event ran. In \"Overwatch 2\", the &lt;a href=\"Shop\"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt; allows players to purchase skins from past &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Seasons&lt;/a&gt; that are typically locked."}

Thirty years later, the omnium reactivated and the region was thrust into conflict once again. The country ordered &lt;a href=\"Volskaya%20Industries\"&gt;Volskaya Industries&lt;/a&gt; to increase &lt;a href=\"Svyatogor\"&gt;Svyatogor&lt;/a&gt; production to deal with the increased hostilities. Likewise, the company developed a new type of &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat the omnics. Propaganda was employed to remind the populace of the continued omnic threat, and a coordinated offensive was made against the omnics. By the time of &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;'s recall of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, the conflict had claimed over 15,000 lives, with the international community reluctant to intervene. Fighting had also occurred in Asia, South America, Europe, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nZero Hour.\nThe RDF was given authority over all Russian territory east of &lt;a href=\"Krasnoyarsk\"&gt;Krasnoyarsk&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Krasnoyarsk%20Front\"&gt;Krasnoyarsk Front&lt;/a&gt; was established, where fighting between the RDF and omnic forces entered a routine\u2014RDF patrols would be sent out, would \"dig up\" omnics, and engage them in combat. Casualties were regularly inflicted on the RDF, and morale among the Russian people sagged, with some saying that the machines couldn't be defeated. The people of &lt;a href=\"Novanskoye\"&gt;Novoanskoye&lt;/a&gt; were tasked with stripping the region of metal in a bid to \"starve\" the Siberian omnium. However, inch by inch, the omnics gained ground.\nEvents came to a head when the northeastern section of the front was breached by the omnics. Novoanskoye was destroyed and declared lost, and RDF forces were ordered to fall back to Krasnoyarsk to consolidate their defenses and oversee the city's evacuation. Going AWOL, Sgt. &lt;a href=\"Aleksandra%20Zaryanova\"&gt;Aleksandra Zaryanova&lt;/a&gt; was able to save Novoanskoye's people, but not the town itself, and even then, the omnics were able to regroup.\nPerhaps not coincidentally, the Krasnoyarsk breakthrough occurred simultaniously with an attack by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. While the attack was repelled by a newly-reformed &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, the attack triggered global panic, and had pundits asking whether this was an isolated incident, or the start of a new war. The latter was closer to the truth, as Null Sector struck at numerous targets all over the planet, quickly overwhelming the world's militaries."}

The most noticeable change is the introduction of skill tiers, which we hope will better communicate players' relative skill levels. Competitive Play will put a greater emphasis on skill tiers over specific ratings, and as such, a player's tier will be more prominently displayed throughout the game. We've also switched the skill rating system to a 1-5000 scale to give players more detailed information about how each match affects their specific rating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nSudden Death is also going away in Season 2. Instead, matches that are tied when the clock runs out end in a draw\u2014though, it should be a rare occurrence. Because of this, we've made some changes to our game modes in Competitive Play to help reduce the chance that a draw can happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWe've also made a few minor adjustments to leaver penalties, the top 500 system, and the competitive point system. Read on below to learn more!\nNew Assault/Escort Map: &lt;a href=\"Eichenwalde\"&gt;Eichenwalde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe forest has slowly begun overtaking the abandoned village of Eichenwalde, but the scars will never completely fade. During the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Eichenwalde was the site of a key battle. General &lt;a href=\"Balderich%20von%20Adler\"&gt;Balderich von Adler&lt;/a&gt; took a handful of &lt;a href=\"crusaders\"&gt;crusaders&lt;/a&gt; to the village in an effort to outflank the omnic army. Balderich's soldiers were able to break down the enemy forces, giving the German military an opportunity to push back, but the Crusaders didn't make it out of the battle.

Over the past six months, I\u2019ve worked on creating the environment and buildings within each of Busan\u2019s three stages: Sanctuary, Downtown, and MEKA Base.\nWe released this map alongside our latest cinematic short featuring D.Va, Shooting Star. Because of this, we worked closely with the cinematics department to recreate the MEKA Base as closely as possible. We wanted players to feel like they\u2019re in the film as soon as they load into the map. This is the first time we\u2019ve done this kind of collaboration, and we think it was a success! The way the map looks in game and in the short are much more similar than our previous attempts.\nThat said, it\u2019s not a straight one-to-one. In the game, in addition to looking great, a map needs to be playable and\u2014most importantly\u2014fun. As such, we expanded and built out parts of the MEKA Base that made it intuitive for players to understand the space they\u2019re in and to offer unique gameplay moments. You can see one of these changes on the control point in the MEKA Base. There are three blast shields that go up and down, providing cover from enemy fire. An alarm accompanied by a flashing light and steam indicates when the shields will rise from the ground, signaling to the team that it is safe to attack the point. This is the first time we\u2019ve intentionally designed moving terrain as part of a map\u2019s strategy.\nThe whole team poured a lot of love and effort into capturing the likeness of Busan and building out the story of D.Va and South Korea. You may notice that D.Va\u2019s room inside the MEKA Base is full of trophies she won as a professional gamer, along with a top-of-the-line gaming rig\u2014and even a couple of cans of Nano Cola.\nWe really do hope that you will love playing on this map, and we\u2019re looking forward to reading and hearing what you have to say about it!\nPatch Highlights.\nNew Map: Busan.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt;, South Korea and battle for control across three distinct locales within one map: Sanctuary, Downtown, and MEKA Base.\nExplore the serene setting of the Sanctuary, surrounded by an ancient temple, beautiful gardens, and historic architecture. Clash in the bustling metropolis of Downtown, where players will fight across a busy PC bang, flashy karaoke bar, and central light rail station (just watch out for the train). Contest for position in MEKA Base\u2014home of South Korea\u2019s frontline defense against the gwishin omnic attacks: D.Va and the rest of the MEKA squad.\nHero Gallery - Filter.\nView all of the cosmetics Overwatch has to offer with our new Filter feature in the Hero Gallery.

To balance out a slight power decrease, especially against barriers, we decided to push his overall weapon\u2019s effective range out bit further before damage falloff begins to take effect. Note: The alternate fire falloff begins from where the scrap projectiles are formed, not from Roadhog\u2019s firing position.\"\n &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;"}

Second, you can use the \"Disable Movement Collision With Environment\" action.

It was frustrating to play against, and it incentivized Mercy players to hide away from important battles, instead of taking part in them. This version turns Resurrect into a single target ability.

Recognizing the spiritual equality they held with humans, the monks, led by the enigmatic Omnic known as Tekhartha Mondatta, sought to heal the wounds caused by the Omnic Crisis a generation earlier and bring humans and robots back into societal harmony. Their message was embraced by millions around the world, and they became global celebrities.

It operated on a system where the eldest son of the family's head would become leader.\nWhile they were criminals, the Shimada understood that honor and loyalty forge the strongest bond between ruler and ruled. They asked much of those who followed them, but they inspired them to give it. And in return, the Shimada clan led with integrity and treated the people of Kanezaka with respect.\nThe Shimada's power grew over the years, enabling them to build a vast criminal empire that profited from lucrative trade in arms, illegal substances, and assassination.\nThe Fall.\nThings started to go awry for the clan when &lt;a href=\"Sojiro%20Shimada\"&gt;Sojiro Shimada&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by a rival clan, the &lt;a href=\"Hashimoto%20clan\"&gt;Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt;. After Sojiro's death, the clan elders instructed &lt;a href=\"Hanzo%20Shimada\"&gt;Hanzo Shimada&lt;/a&gt; (Sojiro's oldest son) to straighten out his wayward younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, so that he, too, might help rule the Shimada empire. When his brother refused, Hanzo was forced to kill him. This act broke Hanzo's heart and drove him to reject his father's legacy, ultimately leading him to abandon the clan. Seeing this as betrayal, the clan declared Hanzo an enemy and assassins were sent time and time again to kill him.\nThe Shimada faced another hurdle as they were targeted by &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. In an ironic twist, Genji had survived Hanzo's attempted assassination, and been rescued by Overwatch, turned into a cybernetic ninja. Transformed into a living weapon, Genji single-mindedly set about the task of dismantling his family's criminal empire, a task in which he apparently succeeded. \nIn the current day, the Shimada appear to be defunct\u2014the Hashimoto took control of Shimada Castle, most of the members are in prison or deceased. &lt;a href=\"Hanamura\"&gt;Hanamura&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegend.\nIn the background of \"Dragons\", Sojiro narrates an ancient legend of the Shimadas.\n\"My family tells of an ancient legend about two great dragons brothers: the Dragon of the North Wind, and the Dragon of the South Wind. Together, they upheld balance and harmony in the heavens.\"\n\"But the two brothers argued over who could better rule their land. Their quarrel turned to rage and their violent struggle darkened the skies, until the Dragon of the South Wind struck down his brother, who fell to earth, shattering the land. The Dragon of the South Wind had triumphed, but as time passed and he realized his solitude, the sweetness of victory turned to ash.\"\n\"For years, the bereft dragon's grief threw the world into discord, and he knew only bitterness and sorrow. One day, a stranger called up to the dragon and asked, \"O Dragon Lord, why are you so distraught?\" The dragon told him, \"Seeking power, I killed my brother; but without him, I am lost.\" The stranger replied, \"You have inflicted wounds upon yourself... but now, you must heal. Walk the earth on two feet as I do; find value in humility. Then, you will find peace.\"\"\n\"The dragon knelt upon the ground. For the first time he was able to clearly see the world around him, and he became human. The stranger revealed himself as his fallen brother; reunited, the two set out to rebuild what they had once destroyed.\""}

Hey, why aren't \"we\" on leave with the rest of the squad? I could use a little 'glitz and glamour' in my life, you know?\nHana: It's overrated, Dae-hyun. This-- this is where the magic happens.

When entered, the Shop section is opened first.\nWhen using the in-game shop, if the prices use real money then the currency displayed will change to use the local region's currency, for example it displays USD($) in United States of America, GBP(\u00a3) for the United Kingdom and CAD($) for Canada.\nShop Section.\nThe primary section opened first, which contains all the current &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; on offer. This section is split into two seperate sections, the Featured section and Just for You Section, which can both be accessed through scrolling down, or a small menu to the left of the screen.\nFeatured.\nThe Featured section refreshes every Tuesday. Each time, it displays various cosmetic bundles or items. This section will include any event-based bundles and cosmetics being sold.\nThis section may include:\nJust For You.\nThe Just For You section refreshes every 24 hours and offers various different bundles of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" cosmetics or old \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" cosmetics. Every player has a different \"Just For You\" section, thus the name. The cosmetics displayed here can vary from previous season bundles to a single hero spray. \nIf the cosmetic is a &lt;a href=\"Shop\"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;-exclusive cosmetic that can't typically be bought through the &lt;a href=\"Cosmetics%23Heroes\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt; tab, then it will only be available for purchase through Coins.

It utilizes &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Prisms\"&gt;Mythic Prisms&lt;/a&gt; to unlock customization options for previous &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Skins\"&gt;Mythic Skins&lt;/a&gt;. Mythic Skins are added to this shop two seasons after their debut. \nUnlocking a mythic skin costs 50, which gives the player starting sets of customizations. The skin can then be further levels up for 10, 3 more times. This means to fully unlock a hero's Mythic Skin, it'll cost a total of 80. \nCurrently the Mythic Shop can only be used to purchase &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Skins\"&gt;Mythic Skins&lt;/a&gt;, however it was said that other cosmetics may be released in future.\nOverwatch League Shop.\nAnother section in the Shop is the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20League\"&gt;Overwatch League&lt;/a&gt; section, which allows players to use &lt;a href=\"League%20Tokens\"&gt;League Tokens&lt;/a&gt; to purchase various Overwatch League &lt;a href=\"skins\"&gt;skins&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Charms\"&gt;Weapon Charms&lt;/a&gt;. \nTeam Store&lt;br&gt;\nThe Team Store allows players to purchase &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; from 19 of the Overwatch League teams.

Similarly, the lack of &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt; the new hero &lt;a href=\"Venture\"&gt;Venture&lt;/a&gt; had may have contributed to the removal of this shop, as they released with no legendary skins that could be in their \"Overwatch 2 Hero Starter Pack\".\nAnniversary Shop.\nThis shop was available during the 2023 &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Anniversary\"&gt;Overwatch 2 Anniversary&lt;/a&gt; Event for a limited time from September 19 to October 16, 2023.

Purchasing them is a similar process to &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Coins\"&gt;Overwatch Coins&lt;/a&gt;, in that you have to interact with their currency display at the top right. This can only be done in the Overwatch League section of the shop, which displays the currency at the top-right.\nSame as &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Coins\"&gt;Overwatch Coins&lt;/a&gt;, they can also be bought &lt;a href=\"https%3A//us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/overwatch\"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; through battle.net, as well as on &lt;a href=\"https%3A//store.steampowered.com/itemstore/2357570/\"&gt;steam&lt;/a&gt;, where prices may differ.\nMythic Prisms.\nThe Premium &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; is the main way to unlock Mythic Prisms, as you can earn up to 80 in a season.

Released on 13 August 2019, he is the 31st hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nSigma is an eccentric astrophysicist and volatile tank who gained the power to control gravity in an orbital experiment gone wrong. Manipulated by Talon and deployed as a living weapon, Sigma's presence on the battlefield cannot be ignored.\nStrategy.\nSigma is a Tank Hero boasting both consistent offensive and defensive abilities. However, his lengthy cooldowns requires one to think ahead rather than freely using his abilities. While he is capable of high damage output, he is most useful when fighting at a distance with and while making openings and defending his team with his versatile . Quick thinking and superb situational awareness is needed when using to protect himself and his team.\nSigma's abilities can give off the perception that he is stronger than he is, which can make it tempting for players to play overly aggressive with him. While Sigma has the capability to deal a lot of damage, his lack of mobility will make any situation where you're stranded alone and surrounded by enemies a disaster. Overextending with Sigma will in most cases result in dying a swift death; likewise, if you believe your teammates are nearby but they've already fled from a fight, you're just as likely to be eliminated. With that being said, Accretion and his Hyperspheres can quickly take out a singular escaping enemy, such as &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;; in these cases, finishing them off before they can flee is the correct play. Being able to distinguish when it's a good time to push forward and when it's better to stay at range will be instrumental to the survival of both yourself and your team.\nStory.\n\"There is no obligation for the universe to make sense to you.\"\nFantastic astrophysicist Dr. Siebren de Kuiper's life changed forever when an experiment gone wrong gave him the ability to control gravity; now, Talon manipulates him to their own ends. Now a living weapon, Sigma's presence on the battlefield cannot be ignored.\nDe Kuiper is mentally damaged. He thinks about the universe, gravity, and physics all through the same 'prism', seeing them as being akin to music. He has high regard for the work of &lt;a href=\"Mei-Ling%20Zhou\"&gt;Mei-Ling Zhou&lt;/a&gt;, finding it \"brilliant.\"\nBackground.\nA brilliant astrophysicist Dr. Siebren de Kuiper was considered a pioneer in his field. His life's work involved devising a way to harness the power of gravity, which he regarded as the greatest untapped resource humanity had remaining to them. Equally known for his groundbreaking research and eccentric personality, he conducted most of his studies from his lab in the Hague. \nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, he developed a successful &lt;a href=\"lev%20rim\"&gt;maglev&lt;/a&gt; prototype. While maglev technology had existed prior to his invention, the technology had previously only been available to corporations and governments. de Kuiper's invention proliferated in the public sphere, so that by the Omnic Crisis, cars were using maglev technology as standard. It has been commented that if not for de Kuiper's work, it might have taken decades to bridge the gap between fossil fuels and a truly sustainable future.\nde Kuiper spent a year on the &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20Lunar%20Colony\"&gt;Horizon Lunar Colony&lt;/a&gt;, where he visited his good friend Dr. &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Winston\"&gt;Harold Winston&lt;/a&gt;. Winston showed him &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;one of the gorilla test subjects&lt;/a&gt;. Over the year, de Kuiper continued his gravitational studies and advised the colony's staff on the installation of their advanced low-gravity hydroponics system. He would later credit much of his research, including access to the moon's lower gravity, the null gravity of space, and artificial gravity of the colony, as key to his understanding of the universe.\nAt some point, years before his accident, he had lunch with Dr. &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; after a seminar.\nThe Accident.\nDecades of study and research led de Kuiper to the belief that \"gravity is a harness;\" if the unifying theories were correct, through his work mankind would soon even be able to command nature's most potent expression of gravity, a black hole, and it would change everything forever. Believing that he was close to achieving his goal, he performed his most important experiment on the &lt;a href=\"International%20Space%20Station\"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. However, something went terribly wrong. The field containing the experiment began to fail; as De Kuiper desperately tried to figure out why it was happening and how to stop it, the brief formation of a black hole was triggered. Screaming, De Kuiper was only exposed to its power for a moment, but he suffered serious psychological damage. The area around him began to experience strange fluctuations in gravity, peaking and dropping in time with his reactions. He had to be evacuated immediately.\nUpon returning to Earth, de Kuiper was quarantined in a secret government facility in New Mexico. Between his ravings about the patterns of the universe, the psychic damage he sustained, the gravitic anomalies happening around him, and concerns for his mental wellbeing, he was deemed a danger to himself and others and detained for years under the name \"Subject Sigma,\" with himself and his inexplicable abilities being researched. Isolated and unable to control his powers, De Kuiper retreated into his own mind. He thought he would never see the outside world again.\nTalon.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; discovered De Kuiper's existence, they infiltrated the facility and broke him out, planning to use his brilliance and research to further their plans. In their custody, De Kuiper slowly gained control of his powers. Now, gravity moved according to his will, and he was closer than ever to achieving his life's goal. But the same experiment that had opened his mind had also fractured it, and he struggled to keep the pieces together. De Kuiper continued to develop his powers in hopes of unlocking the secrets of the universe, unaware that Talon was using both him and his research. He spent most of his time working off-site in a lab Talon granted to him. In his mind (such as it was), he didn't consider himself a prisoner, and Talon provided everything he needed.\nAt some point, Sigma was in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; where he saw &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Luna\"&gt;Luna&lt;/a&gt;'s cabaret.\nTrivia.\nMisc. Character Information.\nDisputed Information.\n\"Note: The following information is from gameplay trailers and is of dubious canon status.\"\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s return, Sigma and his fellow Talon members engaged Overwatch in a firefight at &lt;a href=\"Petra\"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt;. Talon was forced to retreat.\nDevelopment.\nBlizzard began development of Hero 31 with the intent to further flesh out the &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; organization as well as to provide another barrier tank option in addition to &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;, both heavily requested by players. The creative team initially planned for &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt; to fulfill this purpose, and initially prototyped the hero dual-wielding rocket launchers, but found it difficult to convey how he would deploy his barriers with both hands occupied, and began to iterate on other concepts for his kit. In the process of developing Mauga's character for &lt;a href=\"Alyssa%20Wong\"&gt;Alyssa Wong&lt;/a&gt;'s short story, \"&lt;a href=\"What%20You%20Left%20Behind\"&gt;What You Left Behind&lt;/a&gt;\", they decided that the kit being developed by &lt;a href=\"Geoff%20Goodman\"&gt;Geoff Goodman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Noh\"&gt;Joshua Noh&lt;/a&gt; no longer meshed with Mauga's violent, aggressive personality.\nRather than scrap the kit, which they found to be exceptionally fun, they pivoted and began developing a new Hero, who would become Sigma, to better reflect the more defensive and cerebral nature of the Hero's abilities. To that end, they brainstormed a physicist who would manipulate gravity, who could act as a tragic villain being manipulated by Talon without even realizing it, due to his psychological trauma, and began prototyping the character with concept artist &lt;a href=\"Qiu%20Fang\"&gt;Qiu Fang&lt;/a&gt;, initially using existing art. As a result of this pivoting, he was created on a tighter schedule than usual and was slightly delayed compared to previous heroes. The team consulted physics programmer &lt;a href=\"Erin%20Catto\"&gt;Erin Catto&lt;/a&gt;, who holds a PhD in physics and wrote the physics engines for all of Blizzard's games, to make Sigma's physics references more scientifically accurate.\nBlizzard has a campus in The Hague and as such has several Dutch employees both in Europe and North America, so they were able to consult with their employees on names and quotes, and incorporated a lot of Dutch influences into the character.\nSigma was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//imgur.com/MlxXkac\"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; four days before his official reveal on July 18th, 2019 by the Mexican blog post detailing the new role queue feature. That image was then &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/owwcmexico/status/1151917968990920707\"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; by Team Mexico of the Overwatch World Cup.\nSigma generated some controversy with his reveal, with some claiming he was based on mental illness stereotypes. This was seen with his \"asylum\" look (plus, his asylum skin), including the lack of shoes. The barefoot look was chosen to \"sell the \u2018asylum\u2019 look a bit more\" (many psychiatric patients are not allowed to wear shoes as they might cause harm with the laces). In response to the controversy, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Chu\"&gt;Michael Chu&lt;/a&gt; stated \"with the idea of the character, we never intended him to be an example of someone who\u2019s going through mental health issues. He\u2019s really supposed to be more focused on this very specific thing that happened to him, which is that his body and his mind were literally ripped apart by the momentary exposure to a black hole.\"\nIn an interview at Comic-Con when Overwatch developers were talking about the development of &lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt;, they stated that his original ultimate idea consisted of pile driving players into the air to then have them sent back down to the ground to damage the players sent into the air. The developers instead changed to have a minefield as Wrecking Ball's ultimate but the idea wasn't scrapped. Later, the ultimate seems to have been transferred to Sigma."}

He fought during the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and was elected as president of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the end of the war. He later stepped down from this role. Portero was an incredibly popular president, and was regarded as a war hero.\nAccording to Portero, it was his dream to rebuild Mexico in the aftermath of the conflict, and to this end, his company began constructing a network of power plants throughout the country in order to give the Mexican people access to clean, affordable energy. As the final power plant was constructed in Dorado, he gave a speech to mark the occasion. \nThe King Viper.\nWhile Lum\u00e9riCo dealt with the hacking activities of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Muertos\"&gt;Los Muertos&lt;/a&gt; (including a threat to Portero directly, referring to him as the \"King Viper\"), Portero engaged in email correspondence with his subordinates. This included the subject of vacation time with Technology Chief &lt;a href=\"Gabriela%20Moyano\"&gt;Gabriela Moyano&lt;/a&gt; over the subject of vacation time for employees, and Security Chief &lt;a href=\"Mar%C3%ADa%20Jim%C3%A9nez\"&gt;Mar\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez&lt;/a&gt; concerning security teams assigned to executives, and &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Oliveira\"&gt;Manuel Oliveira&lt;/a&gt;, who updated him as to the transfer of funds via the &lt;a href=\"Dorado%20Bank\"&gt;Dorado Bank&lt;/a&gt;. However, events were soured as LumeriCo's website was hacked. He contacted &lt;a href=\"Gonzalo%20Flores\"&gt;Gonzalo Flores&lt;/a&gt; on the issue, but Flores couldn't remove the rogue news posts.\nAs the launch of the power plant in Dorado loomed, Portero sent out an email to his employees, thanking them for their efforts, and urging them not to forsake a work-play balance in their lives. However, he had to deal with continued hacks on the company website, and a malfunctioning espresso machine. The hacks resulted in a massive leak of company documents and emails to the public, done by &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;. The documents indicated that Portero used the company's funds as his own piggy bank, that he was personally involved in bribing public officials and creating a system of kickbacks and payoffs beneficial to Lum\u00e9riCo, and finally, that he proposed a plan to seize privately held land via government expropriation to expand Lum\u00e9riCo's facilities throughout Mexico. Portero forcibly denied the accusations, stating \"it is preposterous to place any faith in records purported to have been obtained by thieves. They are complete fabrications and have no basis in reality. I have dedicated my life to my home\u2014my country\u2014and I have only operated with the highest levels of integrity. I am confident that my name and the reputation of Lum\u00e9riCo will be cleared, that these baseless claims will be shown to be without merit, and that these criminals who have repeatedly broken the laws of our civil society will be brought to justice.\"\nPortero's defiance didn't last long. Less than a week later, Portero announced that he was temporarily stepping down as CEO. Sources within Lum\u00e9riCo believed that this could be the end for the executive, but stressed to the public that he hadn't officially resigned or been relieved of his duties, as some within the company still had faith in him. Portero reiterated that he expected to be fully exonerated pending the authorities' review of company conduct., while some sources within the company believed this to be the end for his career.\nExoneration.\nPortero was exonerated and remained CEO. Not long afterwards, he met &lt;a href=\"Volskaya%20Industries\"&gt;Volskaya Industries&lt;/a&gt; agents &lt;a href=\"Aleksandra%20Zaryanova\"&gt;Aleksandra Zaryanova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lynx%20Seventeen\"&gt;Lynx Seventeen&lt;/a&gt;, who were hunting down Sombra. Portero, claiming innocence for his (supposed?) crimes, wished them well, but told them that Lum\u00e9riCo couldn't provide them with any assistance."}

Every few years the omnic would return, assaulting &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; and its neighbors. The omnic learned from these encounters, often reconfiguring itself in a different form and appearing with new weapons and capabilities. Each incident ended in a stalemate, with the Colossus defeated but not destroyed. &lt;a href=\"MEKA\"&gt;MEKA&lt;/a&gt;, initially providing defense via drones, was forced to replace its drones with human-controlled mechs, as the omnic managed to disrupt the drone network.\nAs the conflict wore on, the attacks from the Gwishin began to occur every few months. In addition to the Colossus, the Gwishin deployed were aquatic and squid-like in design (due to the underwater nature of the omnium). MEKA found itself struggling to keep the Gwishin in check, as they continued to adapt and become stronger. In an example of this, the Gwishin launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt; one week after their last, rather than the previous gap of months. Having to deploy solo, &lt;a href=\"Hana%20Song\"&gt;Hana Song&lt;/a&gt; was able to destroy them but at the cost of destroying her own mech and a broken arm and leg in the process.\nTypes.\nAt least three types of Gwishin omnic are known to exist:\nAdditionally, the &lt;a href=\"Bastion/Cosmetics%23Skins\"&gt;Gwishin Bastion&lt;/a&gt; skin may indicate that the East China Sea omnium is also producing its own variants of the &lt;a href=\"E54%20Bastion\"&gt;E54 Bastion&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferences.\n "}

The two of them had a good working relationship with mutual respect. One operation they took part in occurred in &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;, where Lacroix apparently saved Reyes. Reyes remained silent on what actually happened, but apparently found the incident amusing to reflect on.\nLacroix married &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Am\u00e9lie Guillard&lt;/a&gt; at some point. &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, who was a close friend of Lacroix, expressed his concerns, but Lacroix laughed them off.\nRetribution.\nEight years before the present day, Lacroix was heavily involved in anti-Talon operations. He wrote a &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch%20Dossier\"&gt;dossier&lt;/a&gt; which detailed the standing of Talon's paramilitary forces, and the actions of &lt;a href=\"Antonio\"&gt;Antonio Bartalotti&lt;/a&gt;, an arms dealer associated with Talon. At the newly built &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch%20Rome%20facility\"&gt;Blackwatch Rome facility&lt;/a&gt;, he met with Blackwatch agents Reyes and &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt;. As he led them through the base, he explained that they were gathering intel on Talon, and directed their attention to Bartalotti, who was responsible for an attack on Overwatch's &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; facilities. He likewise informed them of Bartalotti's &lt;a href=\"Rialto\"&gt;compound&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;. McCree was up for a \"road trip,\" but Lacroix pointed out that it wouldn't be that simple\u2014Bartalotti had friends in the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; government, and they'd be able to secure his release if apprehended. Instead, Lacroix favored moving against Bartalotti's supporters, disrupting his cash flow. This would also keep Talon in the dark as to Overwatch's actions.\nReyes and McCree parted ways with Lacroix, confident in his plan. Moments after exiting the building, it was destroyed in a massive explosion, completely levelling it. Lacroix survived, and his unconcious body was pulled out of the rubble by Reyes. He was taken to &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20Headquarters\"&gt;Overwatch Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; where he was treated by Doctors &lt;a href=\"D.%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of whom expected Lacroix to make a full recovery. Reyes stayed at his bedside before launching an unsanctioned assault against Bartalotti in retaliation. The attack resulted in Bartalotti's death, and Blackwatch being revealed to the public. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;, Lacroix, now concious, debriefed Reyes on the incident.\nDeath and Legacy.\nLacroix survived the Rome attack. Over the course of his life, Talon made several attempts to assassinate him, all of which failed. They made a new move when they kidnapped and brainwashed his wife, Am\u00e9lie. Lacroix devoted all of Overwatch's resources to finding his wife, and it wasn't long before the operation produced results. Am\u00e9lie was eventually found by Overwatch agents, and after a psych eval declared her none the worse for wear, she returned to normal life with Lacroix. Two weeks later, she killed him in his sleep.\nOver the years, both Am\u00e9lie and Morrison visited Lacroix's grave and left flowers. Morrison left lilies, despite Lacroix preferring roses.\nOne such visit by Am\u00e9lie was at Christmas. "}

But to those who know its history, Hanamura is the ancestral home of the &lt;a href=\"Shimada\"&gt;Shimada&lt;/a&gt; ninja clan, which had grown over the centuries to become a powerful criminal organization. As its neighboring cities expanded, Hanamura was encircled, and eventually it was incorporated as a district within a larger city. For now, the imposing compound of the Shimada family lies empty, but that peace may soon be broken.\nHanamura is a suburban area located in Japan that features temple grounds and Shimada Castle, which is quite large. With its restaurants, shops, and prime cherry blossom viewing, Hanamura is a popular tourist destination \u2014 but the sleepy town hides a dark secret known only to a select few.\nFor generations the town was the home of the &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20clan\"&gt;Shimada clan&lt;/a&gt;. Their rule ended thanks to &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, who dismantled the clan's rule. Currently, Hanamura is under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Hashimoto%20clan\"&gt;Hashimoto clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nHanamura is an Assault Map which takes place in two main locations: a City Area with the Courtyard entrance, and the Castle Grounds.\nCity Area.\nThe Attackers spawn in an Arcade inside the city area of Hanamura. In the city there are several staircases leading up to higher ground, and there are two main routes to get to the gate to the courtyard. Defenders are rarely in this part of the map, as doing so is dangerously far from the capture point. The gate of the Courtyard has a gap along the left side which can be reached with good mobility heroes and has a viewpoint of the Courtyard.\nCourtyard.\nThe Defenders defend a capture point situated just behind the Courtyard. The Courtyard has two major high grounds along both sides, and the capture point itself has a thin rampart along the front which attacks can stand upon if they are able to reach such heights. The capture point itself is a rectangle with a circular bell in the centre. There are four entrances to the point, one of which has an environmental hazard at the back. The attackers after capturing the point now spawn in the Courtyard. \nCastle Grounds.\nThe Castle Grounds consist of a rampart along the right side of the map with high ground. Players can also attack through the centre of the castle where a gazebo is present in the centre. The right side of the map also has a large open gap for heroes with extensive movement abilities to move across.\nThe Castle.\nThe Castle itself has three high grounds, two of which are roughly twice the height of the lowest one. The right high ground is accessible via a staircase, but the left is only accessible to heroes with extensive movement abilities. The lowest high ground extends the length of the castle but is accessible from the left side. The left side after the jump contains another entrance to the point. Along the bottom of the point, close to the chokepoint is a lower area with access to the right side, or a staircase on the left that leads to the center entrance. Defenders spawn at the back of the large square capture point. The point has two rectangular boxes on each side of the entrance for cover, but is otherwise open. Finally, a roof covers the back of the point which can be accessed by heroes who can reach it, as it is very high up. It does not provide a good sightline to the point.\nWinter Version.\nThere is a version of Hanamura exclusive to the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Wonderland\"&gt;Winter Wonderland&lt;/a&gt; event, although the map is playable at all times of year in Custom Game. The differences between it and the normal version are that the map is covered in snow, with a more bluish-white color palette. There are also lights strung around the memorial shrine on the second point. The map plays identically."}

The building she and her family lived in collapsed, and she was pinned by large bricks of concrete. She was able to catch the attention of &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt;, who descended from the sky to aid her, pulling the concrete off the girl. Hanan recognised her as the infamous Mercy, part of the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; group who'd crippled Egypt ten years ago, but was willing to take what help she could get. \nHanan's injuries were minor, and Ziegler was able to use her &lt;a href=\"Caduceus%20staff\"&gt;Caduceus staff&lt;/a&gt; to heal her. Hanan was amazed at the technology, saying it was like magic, but Ziegler explained that it was something better\u2014nanobiotics. Regardless, Ziegler said they had to leave, but Hanan refused, as her brother was still trapped inside the building, and everyone else had left. The two made their way into the building and found Hanan's brother, whom she tearfully embraced. However, they couldn't linger, as a mortar hit the building, leaving it on the verge of total collapse. Ziegler grabbed Hanan's brother in her arms, and told Hanan to follow her, as they ran out of the building before it came crashing down.\nAfterwards, Ziegler took Hanan and her brother to one of the aid camps outside Cairo. As it turned out, Hanan's parents had been killed in the battle, and staff began searching for their next of kin."}

{"id": "355", "revid": "30469026", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=355", "title": "Hanzo", "text": "Hanzo is a &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". He is one of the 21 heroes included in the game's release on 24 May 2016.\nOverview.\nHanzo\u2019s versatile arrows can reveal his enemies or rapid fire to strike multiple targets. He can scale walls to fire his bow from on high, or summon a titanic spirit dragon.\nStrategy.\nHanzo is a medium-range sniper with strong team utility and area denial abilities. The relatively silent and hard-to-see nature of his arrows makes him a stealthier sniper than &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, able to get kills and then retreat before his enemies see him. Storm Bow's arrows have a travel time and arc which can make accuracy difficult at long-range, requiring him to be good at predicting where the enemy is about to move or get dangerously close to his opponents to accurately hit them.\nStory.\n\"With every death comes honor. With honor, redemption.\"\nMastering his skills as a bowman and an assassin, Hanzo Shimada strives to prove himself as a warrior without peer. He has a cynical view on the nature of the world, and believes that compassion has no place in battle.\nIn addition to his skills with the bow, Hanzo is likewise skilled with the sword, but has sworn off using such a weapon. He considers crossbows to be \"toys for children,\" and refuses to use firearms, as \"they make killing too simple.\" He carves wooden charms as a hobby, and dislikes cities, preferring quieter areas such as &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt;. He similarly avoids people in general.\nChildhood.\nHanzo was the eldest son of &lt;a href=\"Sojiro%20Shimada\"&gt;Sojiro Shimada&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20clan\"&gt;Shimada clan&lt;/a&gt;; a clan of assassins whose power grew over the years, enabling them to build a vast criminal empire out of &lt;a href=\"Hanamura\"&gt;Hanamura&lt;/a&gt; that profited from lucrative trade in arms and illegal substances. As Sojiro's firstborn, Hanzo was bound by duty to succeed his father and rule the Shimada empire, dealing with expectations that his younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, did not. While he overshadowed Genji in his status, Hanzo preferred to have his brother beside him.\nIn his youth, Hanzo spent preferred the quiet of &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt; rather than the heart of &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. On the rare occasions he accompanied his father on business trips into the city, he found it too bright and busy. Sojiro often told his sons children's stories to remind them of their duty.\nFrom a young age, Hanzo was trained for that responsibility, displaying a natural aptitude for leadership and possessing an innate understanding of strategy and tactics. He also excelled in more practical areas: he was a prodigy in martial arts, swordplay, and bowmanship. He was instructed in the ways of the sword by &lt;a href=\"Asa%20Yamagami\"&gt;Asa Yamagami&lt;/a&gt; alongside his younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;. She also taught them how to wall climb. One lesson Asa taught Hanzo was that it was just as important to know how to disarm an opponent without lifting a weapon. That often you could do it by saying the right thing or smiling the right way. Another lesson of Asa's was \"You must learn when to strike and when not to strike. Sometimes you are better off waiting for the right opportunity to make your move.\" At the time, Hanzo found the lesson counterintuitive.\nOnce, Hanzo bragged that he could beat Genji while blindfolded and with his hands tied behind his back. Asa overheard and used Hanzo's boast as a teaching moment.\nThrough Asa, the brothers learned alongside Asa's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt;, who became a \"cute, little niece\" figure to them. While younger than the brothers, she often tagged along after them. Hanzo watched Kiriko and Genji play in the Kanezaka arcade, as Genji chased one high score after another. While Genji and Kiriko were close, Hanzo kept himself at arm's length, given the duty he had to prepare for. He regarded Kiriko as \"the brat,\" and treated her as a nuisance.\nAfter Hanzo and Genji's &lt;a href=\"Rumiko%20Shimada\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; abandoned her family, Asa became the closest thing the Shimada brothers had to a mother. But like an entitled prince, Hanzo looked down on the Yamagamis as mere servants.\nOne night, after the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Summer%20Festival\"&gt;End of Summer Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Sojiro told Hanzo, Genji, and Kiriko a story from the history of the Shimada clan. How centuries ago, a rival clan attempted to end the Shimada's rule by setting their orchards aflame, as well as the city's &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Shrine\"&gt;Fox Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. The rival clan anticipated that the Shimada would move to protect their fields rather than the people of Kanezaka, but instead, the opposite happened. The Shimada aided their people first, and united with the clan, the Kanezakans made short work of the rival clan lying in wait at the orchards. The lesson, as Sojiro imparted to the three children, was that a leader's relationship must be mutually beneficial with their people, or else, they were nothing more than a parasite. \nDragon's Fall.\nWhen Sojiro was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Hashimoto%20clan\"&gt;Hashimoto clan&lt;/a&gt;, Hanzo and Genji were allowed a small time to mourn. After his death, Kiriko brought the brothers a plate piled with mochi\u2014a small sign that she cared.\nWith Sojiro's death, Hanzo was thrust into the role of leadership. He found himself ill prepared and overwhelmed, as Sojiro's death had left the Shimada clan exposed to threats from rival clans, law enforcement, and &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, and it became apparent just how much the clan's illicit activities had put the people of Kanezaka at risk. The clan elders tried to use Hanzo as a puppet, and instructed Hanzo to straighten out Genji, so that he, too, might help rule the Shimada empire. When his brother refused, Hanzo was forced to kill him. Unbeknownst to Hanzo, however, Genji narrowly survived the attempt with the help of Overwatch. This act broke Hanzo's heart and drove him to reject his father's legacy, ultimately leading him to abandon the clan and all that he had worked so hard to attain. When he left, he felt his father was a fool. In his mind, the age of honor and respect that Sojiro had derived his beleifs from was long gone, and for all of Sojiro's stories about duty and honor, it was easy to moralize and say empty words when you were the one holding power.\nAfter Hanzo left the clan, he was stripped from access to its finances. He began roaming the world in solitude as self-punishment. Hanzo swore to never again wield a sword, and would forevermore rely on his skills with the bow. He began to write poetry in an attempt to find peace. Seeing his abandonment as betrayal, the clan declared Hanzo an enemy and assassins were sent time and again to kill him.\nThat was ten years before the Overwatch recall. Over the following decade, Hanzo travelled the world, perfecting his skills as a warrior, attempting to restore his honor and put the ghosts of his past to rest, honing his murderous skills all the while. At some point he visited &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;, but did not find the city to be to his liking.\nHanzo visited Kanezaka every year after Genji's supposed death to honor him. Every year, he saw more of the Hashimoto's baleful effects upon Kanezaka.\nDragons.\nOn the tenth anniversary of Genji's death, as he had done every year, Hanzo broke into &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20Castle\"&gt;Shimada Castle&lt;/a&gt; and took down the guards before they could alert anyone. In the main room in front of the sword display he lit an incense offering and prayed to honor Genji. He however called out an apparent assassin that he knew to be there, revealed to be a cybernetic ninja. The ninja asked Hanzo about honoring his brother, yet also being his killer.\nHanzo initiated a battle between them, openly admitting that his actions were about duty, but also a burden he carried and that it didn't mean he didn't honor Genji. The ninja countered that to show honor, it should be done through one's actions, not incense offerings. Hanzo tried the Dragonstrike to take down his opponent, only to be shocked when the ninja revealed the Shimada ability to control dragons as well, turning the Dragonstrike right back at him, and took the full brunt of the attack.\nDefeated and with the ninja's wakizashi at his neck, Hanzo told him to go ahead and kill him, but the ninja refused, saying he would not grant Hanzo's wish for death and that he still had a purpose in life. To Hanzo's shock, the ninja then called him \"brother\", revealing himself to be Genji, still alive, and to prove it unlocked his facemask to show his eyes. Hanzo was a bit disturbed at seeing Genji's physical changes, but Genji stated that he was at peace with it and had forgiven Hanzo's actions: now Hanzo needed to forgive himself. Times were changing, stated Genji, and Hanzo would soon have to pick a side. Retrieving a loosed arrow Hanzo aimed it, angrily declaring Genji a fool in believing that real life was like their father's stories. Genji conceded that he might be a fool for believing that there was hope for Hanzo, but nevertheless did, which gave Hanzo pause. Asking him to think about it, Genji vanished with a smoke screen into the night, leaving nothing but a single drifting sparrow feather in his wake. With much to contemplate, Hanzo returned to the main room to finish his offering.\nDragon's Flight.\nShaken by his reunion with Genji, Hanzo fled Tokyo. Though it shamed him, he'd been running so long, he didn't know what else to do. He distracted himself with work as a mercenary, ignoring the truths that weighed on him.\nTwo years after his reunion with Genji, Hanzo was training at Okinawa when he saw news footage of &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;'s global invasion. For the first time in fourteen years, Hanzo heard his father's voice in his head, to the extent that he briefly thought his father had returned. However, he realized that he was alone. However, hearing his father's voice summoned him back to Tokyo. To where, perhaps, he was needed to be.\nWhere Honor Lives.\nThe Tiger's Cave.\nWhen Hanzo arrived in Tokyo, he found a &lt;a href=\"command%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; outside the city proper, yet to attack. People clogged the streets as they tried to escape. Hanzo knew that when Null Sector attacked, many civilians would be caught in the crossfire, and that most of the people attempting to flee wouldn't make it out. He made his way to the command ship, and while he saw no sign of police officers, he did see Hashimoto men in the shadows. He saw some Hashimoto tormenting an old man, and he wondered if this was what his father had wanted him to see. He watched the Hashimoto move on, and guessed that they'd been recalled to their stronghold to prepare for Null Sector's attack. He decided to follow them, hoping they could lead him to their base.\nHe followed the Hashimoto into an alley, but found a dead end before him, and Hashimoto around him, having planned an ambush. He loosed a warning arrow at the thugs' &lt;a href=\"Topknot\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one he refused to heed as the Hashimoto rushed Hanzo with knives and later, guns. Against the former, Hanzo had little trouble, but a bullet from the latter wounded him. The Hashimoto advanced with swords, and Hanzo noted that the swords' energy fields were unstable. Apparently the Hashimoto had tried to copy the design of the Shimada clan's blades, but they'd failed to fully replicate the technology. Hanzo stood his ground, but blood loss began to affect him. Losing patience, Hanzo engaged the Hashimoto in close-quarters, but while the Hashimoto lacked discipline, they made up for it in numbers. Down to his last arrow, Hanzo unleashed his Dragonstrike. Only Topknot and a couple of his henchmen survived the attack, and realized they were dealing with a Shimada.\nAt this point, Hanzo fell to the ground, exhausted, and still bleeding. Topknot ordered him taken to their stronghold. Before passing out, Hanzo noticed graffiti that had been painted on a wall\u2014\"If you do not enter the tiger's cave, you will not catch its cub.\"\nThe Swordmaster.\nWhen Hanzo awoke, he found himself in a cell. He asked his &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; jailer how long he'd been out, but the robot refused to answer, until it finally relented to give Hanzo a glass of water. Hanzo drifted in and out of conciousness for what felt like hours until he heard a familiar voice. A man had entered his cell, one he recognized as &lt;a href=\"Toshiro%20Yamagami\"&gt;Toshiro Yamagami&lt;/a&gt;. Putting recent events together, he realized that Toshiro had created the blades the Hashimoto had used. He accused Toshiro of abetting the clan, but Toshiro reminded him that Hanzo had been absent for a long time, and that he had his family to consider. Hanzo silently accepted the point. He had assumed that the Yamagamis would have moved on after the destruction of the Shimada clan, but apparently not. In regards to the blades, he told Toshiro that his work was shoddier than it had once been, to which Toshiro responded that he was forced to work with inadequate materials. He wondered if this was true, or if Toshiro was intentionally making inferior blades. Toshiro pointed out Hanzo's long years of absence, pointing out that he was in no position to take the moral high ground. Toshiro confirmed that Asa was still in Kanezaka.\nToshiro told Hanzo that it was good to see him, but that coming here was a mistake. The Hashimotos had realized who Hanzo was when he'd used his storm bow, hence why they'd sent Toshiro to confirm his identity. Now that they had the Shimada scion, they would execute him to break the will of Kanezaka's people. Hanzo pointed out that the Shimada clan was long dead, and that he was no true heir, but Toshiro pointed out that as long as children lived, so did people's hopes for them, and the world they would inherit. Whatever Hanzo thought of himself, as long as he was alive, he was still a symbol of the Shimada clan and their more benevolent rule. Toshiro told Hanzo that he would tell his superiors that it would be a mercy to kill Hanzo, and that Hanzo had destroyed the Shimada legacy more effectively than they ever could, and that Hanzo's next actions would reveal the truth behind those words.\nBefore he left, Toshiro requested that if Hanzo ever made it out of here, to find Kiriko. To tell her that he wished he could have written more and have been there for her. That he was proud of her actions in keeping the Hashimoto in check. He also told Hanzo that Sojiro would have been proud of him for returning to Tokyo, and that despite Hanzo's doubts, Sojiro had been proud of him in life.\nThe Fox Ninja.\nHanzo's next visitors were a pair of Hashimoto clan members, including Topknot. They explained that Hanzo was to be executed in front of the clan leaders before they evacuated. Hanzo played along, but the thugs didn't even bother blindfolding him (though they did bind his hands). Remembering Asa's lesson about knowing when to strike, Hanzo bid his time. He was taken to a spacious conference room, where he was brought in front of the clan elders. Hanzo told them that he no longer bore his father's name, but they were having none of it. He may have abandoned the Shimada name, but he was still a Dragon. The last Shimada. He would be executed for all of Kanezaka to see, and despite Hanzo's taunts, they weren't going to do anything like a duel, but rather, just shoot him.\nIt nearly came to that until the lights suddenly flickered, followed by a &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Spirit\"&gt;blue kitsune&lt;/a&gt; bounding into the room. In the confusion, Hanzo incapacitated Topknot, and a kunai thrown through the air sliced the plastic zip binding his wrists. In the gloom, he saw a woman in white and scarlet miko clothing. The two fought back to back, but more and more Hashimoto kept charging in. Hanzo could tell the fox ninja was pushing herself to her limit, while on his end, his bullet wound had re-opened. Sometime during the fight, Hanzo realized that the ninja was Kiriko, but he remained silent. The two managed to escape, along with Hanzo's bow. Emerging outside, they saw Null Sector's command ship in the sky. &lt;a href=\"Drop%20pod\"&gt;Drop pod&lt;/a&gt;s rained down on the city, and despite the efforts of Tokyo's police and the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Self-Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Japanese Self-Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt;, ground was being surrendered to Null Sector by the minute. Taking the hint, the Hashimotos abandoned their stronghold in an armored convoy.\nHanzo wanted to pursue them, but the fox ninja refused, telling Hanzo they were needed here. He was briefly overwhelmed by the sounds and smells of the carnage\u2014while he had seen Null Sector's attack on &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; via the news, this was far more personal. He also knew that if Tokyo fell, a domino effect would be triggered in Japan, not to mention that the small towns in the outlying prefectures were defenseless against the &lt;a href=\"drone%20ship\"&gt;drone ship&lt;/a&gt;s Null Sector would send to attack them.\nReunion.\nWorking together, Hanzo and the fox ninja held their ground at the Hashimoto stronghold, destroying Null Sector's attacking warbots while allowing civilians to take refuge inside the structure. With a lull in the fighting, he revealed to Kiriko that he knew who she was, and she revealed that she knew who he was in turn. While their reunion was strained given their rocky history, they were glad for each other's aid, as Kiriko made clear in her usual, overly-expressive way. He told Kiriko that he'd seen her father in the stronghold, and imparted Toshiro's message. Given how the Yamagamis had all fought against the Hashimoto in their own way, Hanzo felt ashamed for his cowardice.\nKiriko asked if he thought Overwatch would come to aid Tokyo. Hanzo doubted it, even though he knew Genji was now part of Overwatch, having seen him on the Paris feed. While it would bring him joy to see his brother again, he did not feel ready for it. Kiriko concluded that there was no-one left to protect Kanezaka, and while she had &lt;a href=\"Y%C5%8Dkai%20%28group%29\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; back there, they wouldn't be able to handle Null Sector. Hanzo suggested that they both return to Kanezaka\u2014he now owed Kiriko his life, and she offered him an ofuda for healing. Hanzo reflected that Kiriko's parents had forged him into the person he was, and that the Yamagamis were still setting an example as to how to become a better man. The Yamagamis had served the Shimadas for centuries, and now, he would serve both them and the people. It was a lesson his father had tried to teach him, but one that he'd needed time to understand.\nThe pair advanced down the street, destroying every Null Sector warbot they encountered on their way home.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nGenji and Hanzo were originally envisioned as a single cyborg ninja hero named Hanzo who wielded both a bow and a sword, used parkour, and had an assassinate ability, using artwork for the Assassin class from the cancelled &lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;. They were split into two distinct heroes early in development.During development Hanzo was known as \"Bow Ninja\" and Genji as \"Sword Ninja.\" Both Hanzo and Genji's kits drew heavily from an early version of &lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt; that predated both heroes, which resulted in the Sombra concept being temporarily shelved. His kit may have also taken inspiration from that of &lt;a href=\"Huntress\"&gt;Huntress&lt;/a&gt;, a character created for the original \"Prometheus\" pitch.\nHanzo's old Scatter Arrow is one of the few abilities that were removed in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". It was instead replaced with Storm Arrows, which has been in his kit ever since. \nOverwatch 2.\nLike almost all \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" Heroes, Hanzo was redesigned and given a new look for \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Kejun%20Wang\"&gt;Kejun Wang&lt;/a&gt; was the concept artist behind his Overwatch 2 look, but otherwise not much is known about the idea behind it. It was stated that the general scheme concept for all new hero looks for Overwatch 2 to be aimed at keeping the \"essence\" of the hero, while showing some evolution and character growth in the design.\nHanzo's Broken Heart / Depression.\nOne of the most common phrases used to describe the event where the Shimada Clan's elders forced Hanzo to attack Genji is \"The event broke his heart.\" While most likely an expression, there does exist a real-world heart condition called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, commonly referred to as Broken Heart Syndrome. This condition can be caused by grief from the death of a loved one, the loss of a relationship, job, or money\u2014all of which apply to Hanzo. He abandoned his clan and, by extension, gave up his wealth and status as the Scion of the Shimada Empire in order to escape his abusive family.\nBroken Heart Syndrome is usually temporary, but some people may continue to feel unwell even after the heart has healed. In some cases, feelings of stress, anger, and experiencing trauma triggers can exacerbate the condition and can even be fatal in some cases. Because of this, it\u2019s logical to assume that after the event, any form of stress, anger, fear, or anything that triggers his trauma (Such as holding a sword or simply being at the Shimada Castle or in Hanamura) could pose a serious risk to Hanzo's health, and could very well kill him.\nWhile the condition itself can be treated with medical care, it's unlikely that Hanzo received any treatment he needed, as it\u2019s implied he's been self-isolated since leaving the clan. Another possibility is that Hanzo intentionally doesn't seek any medical treatment or therapy to help his possible condition due to feeling \"unworthy\" of receiving help. In an interaction where Hanzo says he doesn't fear death, Genji says that Hanzo \"finds living to be the challenge.\" Which strongly implies that Hanzo suffers from severe depression and may even be suicidal, or at the very least, wants to die but continues to live as a form of self-punishment. It's also worth mentioning that Hanzo has, on several accounts, said that he is unworthy, beyond redemption, and thinks his father would be disappointed in him.\nIn Overwatch 1, his select quote is \"With every death, comes honor. With honor, redemption\" could suggest that Hanzo believes that taking his own life is the only way he can redeem himself and regain honor for killing his brother. This is further proven by his select quote in Overwatch 2, where he says, \"Honor is all I have left,\"\u00a0 which could also imply that Hanzo is on a serious mental decline and may be experiencing more suicidal thoughts or acts of self-harm and might've even come close to doing it.\nExternal Links.\n "}

It is the process of creating physical objects from a light source.\nBackground.\nHard-light uses projectors, which increases the interactivity of photons and binds them together. Carbon molecules are drawn in, which collide with the photonic structures. The carbon bonds together, creating real, lasting, physical objects made from carbon fiber.\nHistory.\nHard-light was developed by &lt;a href=\"Vishwakarma%20Bhatt\"&gt;Vishwakarma Bhatt&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to find a way to manifest matter through the use of hard-light technology. After years of limited success, many in Bhatt's field had run out of funding and pivoted to other fields. Still, Bhatt persisted. A turning point was achieved via prototype photon projectors, which created incredibly powerful, destructive crystalline structures. Though not quite what Bhatt had intended, it had a hidden benefit, in that these structures could be tuned to attract carbon molecules.\nEarly trials were hopeful, though harnessing the technology outside the lab progressed slower than many on the funding side would have preferred. Still, the results were promising, and Bhatt sold the carbon-capture aspect to the public, given that the world had an abundence of CO2 in the atmosphere due to centuries of burning fossil fuels. In truth, Bhatt had admitted this early in the project, that his startup would have to build many permanent structures to make any sort of dent in CO2 emissions that came from construction. However, this moment stuck in people's minds. As the &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Archive\"&gt;Zurich Archive&lt;/a&gt; later commented, \"the public is often swayed more by the sound bite than the full scientific picture.\"\nAdditional grants were secured by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Global%20Recovery%20Program\"&gt;United Nations Global Recovery Program&lt;/a&gt;, which led to Bhatt's startup turning into the &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years, Bhatt inspired his team to reach greater and greater heights, imagining a future where hard-light would eliminate housing shortages, transportation issues, even material inequalities. According to those close to him, Bhatt was firm in the belief that hard-light should be accessible to all, and was resistant to the idea of profiting from his designs. Bhatt hoped to share the technology with the world before Vishkar implemented more restrictions on the technology. Bhatt met his end in an unfortunate car accident one year before Vishkar's first public offering.\nHard-light has been heavily used by Viskar, who constructed the city of &lt;a href=\"Utopaea\"&gt;Utopaea&lt;/a&gt; out of hard-light, and instructs students in the process of light weaving in the &lt;a href=\"Architech%20Academy\"&gt;Architech Academy&lt;/a&gt;. People who 'weave' hard-light are referred to as \"architechs.\" When weaving hard-light, most use very precise movements.\nL\u00facio's skates project hard-light \"blades,\" allowing for quick movement on any surface. Hard-light can also be used for incarceration (a hard-light wall for a cell), and in computing (&lt;a href=\"Sombra\"&gt;Sombra&lt;/a&gt;'s arm terminal uses hard-light technology)."}

He later worked at the &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20Lunar%20Colony\"&gt;Horizon Lunar Colony&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the Simian Research Division, spending time with &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the genetically enhanced gorillas that had been brought to the base, teaching the ape science and telling him tales of human ingenuity. On one occassion, he read &lt;a href=\"Winston%27s%20Journey%20to%20the%20West\"&gt;\"Journey to the West\"&lt;/a&gt; to the young ape.\nWinston received a visit from his good friend Dr. &lt;a href=\"Siebren%20de%20Kuiper\"&gt;Siebren de Kuiper&lt;/a&gt; while at the colony.\nWinston once made Journal Entry 1963-4, regarding a status update on the hamster subject Specimen 8, whom the staff had named \"&lt;a href=\"Hammond\"&gt;Hammond&lt;/a&gt;\". He noted how Hammond was continuing to be one of their biggest surprises among the subjects. The staff had trouble keeping track of him due to multiple escapes from his cage, even though he had physically grown in size from the genetic modification. Hammond demonstrated impressive problem solving skills and adaptability, and had overcome all challenges placed before him. Winston couldn't help but wonder what Hammond was looking for during his escapes, and closed that he looked forward to whatever trouble Hammond would get into next.\nIn the base's last days, Winston corresponded with fellow staff concerning the test subjects, specifically their increased beligerance. Winston agreed with &lt;a href=\"Yoshida%20%28Lucheng%20Interstellar%29\"&gt;Yoshida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nevsky\"&gt;Nevsky&lt;/a&gt; that the gorillas should be confined to their quarters, but noted that there weren't many good options available to them. Sending the gorillas to Earth wasn't a solution in his eyes (not to mention the medical issues), and expressed his belief that the gorillas were members of the colony as much as any of the base's human staff. He noted that not all of the gorillas had experienced adverse reactions to the gene therapy, but noted that they should slow down further tests, or possibly outright discontinue them. \nWinston's last recorded message was a request for fellow staff members to aid him at airlock E-35, which had malfunctioned. He was killed in the subsequent uprising that the gorillas launched, who took the colony as their own. It has been implied that the error at the airlock was a ploy by the gorillas, who then vented the scientists onto the lunar surface to die from asphyxiation."}

Its symbol is a stylized tiger-head.\nBackground.\nThe Hashimoto make money through selling contraband and \"even more unsavory things.\" They have influence in nearly every city in Japan.\nHistory.\nKanezaka Takeover.\nIn the period after the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; dismantled the &lt;a href=\"Shimada%20clan\"&gt;Shimada clan&lt;/a&gt;. The weakening of the Shimada allowed the Hashimoto to step in to fill the power vacuum; they assassinated &lt;a href=\"Sojiro%20Shimada\"&gt;Sojiro Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, and asserted their control over &lt;a href=\"Kanezaka\"&gt;Kanezaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hanamura\"&gt;Hanamura&lt;/a&gt;.\nEight years before the present day, the Hashimoto abducted &lt;a href=\"Toshiro%20Yamagami\"&gt;Toshiro Yamagami&lt;/a&gt;, forcing him to forge blades for them. In doing so, they had leverage over his wife, &lt;a href=\"Asa%20Yamagami\"&gt;Asa&lt;/a&gt;, forcing her to serve as an enforcer in Kanezaka. The Hashimotos recognized the threat presented by the Yamagamis, and with Toshiro their prisoner, Asa's hands were tied. Over the following years, they extorted the townspeople. When the lights went out, they would go from door to door, taking payment, and funneling it to the clan through the &lt;a href=\"Tora%20no%20Sumika\"&gt;Tora no Sumika&lt;/a&gt;. The hospital always had several patients who'd run afoul of the clan, and the town closed early, as under the Hashimoto, it was no longer safe after dark.\nTen years after the Hashimoto took over control, they began being opposed by a small gang. The gang sprayed graffiti, broke windows at Hashimoto strongholds, and even robbed the &lt;a href=\"Tora%20no%20Sumika\"&gt;Tora no Sumika&lt;/a&gt;. Things escalated when the teenagers infiltrated a port, destroying an arms shipment intended for the Hashimoto. They named themselves the &lt;a href=\"Y%C5%8Dkai%20%28group%29\"&gt;Y\u014dkai&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwelve years after they made their mark on Kanezaka, things were approaching breaking point. The Hashimoto's demands were increasing, tempers were rising, and missed payments were met with more vicious abuses. Furthermore, shipments of Hashimoto contraband went missing. Their men were badly beaten or robbed when returning from their rounds, and messages in bright, conspicuous colors started to appear, before they were quickly painted over. However, while the Y\u014dkai were happy to operate against the Hashimoto, they were just as happy to hide from them, which left the ordinary people of Kanezaka to suffer the consequences. The Y\u014dkai became more and more of a thorn in the Hashimoto's side; they ambushed Hashimoto businesses, disrupted supply lines, and constantly undermined them through strategic attacks. But no matter how hard the Hashimoto pressed, the Y\u014dkai always managed to slip through their fingers.\nTrivia.\n\"Hashimoto\" (\u6a4b\u5143) roughly translates as \"original bridge\"."}

She is a fan of &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt; (and rival with Efi as to who's the bigger fan), though her knowledge tends towards trivia about L\u00facio himself rather than his music. She makes &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%25C3%25A3o_de_queijo\"&gt;p\u00e3o de queijo&lt;/a&gt; every anniversary of the day she first heard his music. She is also a fan of &lt;a href=\"Agba%20Aja\"&gt;Agba Aja&lt;/a&gt;.\nHassana is a skilled artist, and generally proficient in her school subjects, including civics. She wears her hair in braids.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Ndidi\"&gt;Ndidi&lt;/a&gt; babysat Hassana a few times when she was little.\nMeeting Efi.\nNaade and Hassana became friends with Efi at a science fair incident with a &lt;a href=\"graviton%20beam\"&gt;graviton beam&lt;/a&gt;. Efi asked them to serve as volunteers. However, she accidentally over-amplified the gravity field, and the result was that they were stuck on the floor of their school library for three hours before they were able to be freed. \nThe three became friends, but given Efi's genius, there was an emotional and intellectual gap between Efi and Naade/Hassana. Furthermore, she noted that Naade and Hassana only seemed to tolerate each other's company. At school, Hassana took choir, art, and gym classes. The year before &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on Numbani, she aced every test.\nThe Hero of Numbani.\nDoomfist's Attack.\nA few years after the science fair incident, Naade and Hassana helped Efi with her junior assistant design, the pair getting Junies of their own. Both warmed up to the technology, and continued to help Efi as orders increased. When Efi submitted her application to the &lt;a href=\"Adawe%20Foundation\"&gt;Adawe Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s \"genius grant,\" Hassana congratulated her over &lt;a href=\"HollaGram\"&gt;HollaGram&lt;/a&gt; (or more specifically, complemented her attire). However, she couldn't help Efi with her Junies, as she went shopping with &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Oyeba\"&gt;Amber Oyeba&lt;/a&gt; to get outfits for the &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Day\"&gt;Unity Day&lt;/a&gt; festivities. \nWhen Efi won the grant, it was agreed that she and her family would take a trip to &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate. Naade and Hassana were also allowed to come. A week before they left, Naade and Hassana stayed at Efi's house. When they arrived at the airport however, they never made it to their flight, as the terminal was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Doomfist\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt;. They survived, but had to stay in the city.\nBuilding Orisa.\nEfi used the money she'd been granted from the Adawe Foundation to purchase an &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt; chassis, intent on rebuilding it so it could take on Doomfist. She agreed to let Naade and Hassana help, though, granted, there was only so much they could actually do. Hassana began stylizing the chassis immediately, much to Efi's unease. However, she knew that Hassana's art skills would pay off in the end.\nNaade told Efi that he knew how to get her a fusion driver; that Isaac knew a guy who could get them military-grade equipment, albeit they only dealt with MBCs. Efi agreed, and Naade made plans with Isaac to arrange the trade. The trio arrived, but their contact was less than enthused that he was dealing with children. He took the MBCs, but didn't give them the driver, instead driving off and yelling that he didn't sell to kids.\nOver the weeks, funds for the project trickled in (Hassana donated what she could), and the trio continued to work on the robot. While at &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Plaza\"&gt;Unity Plaza&lt;/a&gt;, Hassana passed Ndidi, but she didn't acknowledge her, despite their background. She realized that Ndidi wasn't an exception, that all the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;s in the plaza were ignoring humans. A fight broke out, and she fled the scene, running to Efi's workshop, where she told her friends what had happened.\nNaade and Hassana worked alongside Efi, Naade working on the chassis while Hassanna painted, but over time, became less enthused. While they wanted to keep Numbani safe, they had trouble keeping up with her grueling pace. She watched a report on &lt;a href=\"Agba%20Aja\"&gt;Agba Aja&lt;/a&gt;, who had succumbed to the hacks affecting omnics in Numbani. Over an impromptu dinner, the trio discussed what they should do with the robot once it was activated. Hassana favored community integration, while Naade suggested target practice. Efi suggested that the pair could each work on their respective tasks.\nAfter seeing a video of Doomfist's second attack, Efi declared that they had to finish the robot tonight. The trio got to work, working past midnight, but the haste caused Hassana and Naade to behave sloppily (in Hassana's case, her painting was rushed). Efi lost her patience, which caused Hassana to snap. She stormed out of the workshop, dragging Naade with her.\nMaking Amends.\nEfi texted Hassana about taking &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt; out for community training. Hassana made no response. When Doomfist attacked the &lt;a href=\"Numbani%20Heritage%20Museum\"&gt;Numbani Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;, Efi and Orisa foiled the attack. Hassana watched the news report where Efi was interviewed, and noticed that Efi didn't mention her or Naade.\nAwhile later, Efi talked to Naade and Hassana at school over lunch bearing gifts (in Hassana's case, a fruit cup) and apologies for how she'd treated them while they'd worked on Orisa. Naade was willing to forgive her, but Hassana wasn't so eager, despite Naade's urging. She was angry that Efi had taken full credit for Orisa after the work they'd done with her. To mend the burnt bridge, Efi stood up on the lunch table, addressing the students and giving Naade and Hassana credit for their work; in Hassana's case, she credited Hassana for Orisa's look.\nEfi got detention for her stunt, but in a message with Hassana, she said it was worth it. The three made up, and Efi asked them if they'd be willing to come back and work on Orisa's repairs.\nUnity Day.\nSometime later, \"\" came out. In the space of a week, Naade saw it eleven times. He saw it a twelfth time with Efi and Hassana, unable to avoid spoiling elements of the movie. They were forced to leave due to their antics, but met L\u00facio, who told them he intended to play at the Unity Day fundraiser. Hassana later commented on HollaGram.\nA week later, the Unity Day celebration occurred. Naade and Hassana attended, but when Doomfist and his forces attacked, they helped the attendees flee. They later worked with the other drama students to create an impromptu &lt;a href=\"sonic%20amplifier\"&gt;sonic amplifier&lt;/a&gt;. After the attack, she suggested that she and Naade celebrate over puff puffs.\nVIP Pass.\nAt some point after the Unity Day celebration, &lt;a href=\"Naade\"&gt;Naade&lt;/a&gt; and Hassana were given VIP tickets to one of L\u00facio's events, much to their joy."}

Released on 7 May 2019, making it the 31st map added to the game. \nBackground.\nHavana (Spanish: \"La Habana\") is the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. It is home to the &lt;a href=\"Don%20Rumbotico\"&gt;Don Rumbotico&lt;/a&gt; distillery and the &lt;a href=\"Havana%20Sea%20Fort\"&gt;Havana Sea Fort&lt;/a&gt;, both locations considered iconic of the local area. &lt;a href=\"Alicia%20D%C3%ADaz\"&gt;Alicia D\u00edaz&lt;/a&gt;, a local, feared that Havana is changing and losing elements of its cultural legacy. A travel poster advertising tourism to Havana is located inside the Adawe International Terminal in &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nHavana is an &lt;a href=\"Escort\"&gt;Escort&lt;/a&gt; Map which takes place in three main locations: The City Streets, the Distillery, and the Sea Fort.\nCity Streets.\nThe City Streets are the first part of the map where the attackers spawn. There is a very long open street which leads up to several buildings, and curves right then left up to the distillery. Along the road there are buildings to provide cover, as well as obtain high ground for both attackers and defenders.\nDistillery.\nThe Distillery is an enclosed building with a second floor which extends around the edges and center of the building. There are large Vats blocking sightlines, as well as an office building near the end with a corridor which leads to above the checkpoint. Defenders spawn in the distillery for the first checkpoint defense. The payload curves around the right of the inside of the building before heading straight.\nSea Fort.\nThe Sea Fort has a very large straight heading up to it, with very minimal cover. Defenders can use the destroyed building on the corner, or the gaps in the Sea Fort to maintain high ground. On the entrance to the fort is an environmental hazard which also follows the straight to the fort, but underneath and to the left. This underneath area loops to the side of the fort, or back around to the entrance. Inside the fort there are two high grounds which provide sightlines or cover depending on the side. The left side of the Fort (from an attacking perspective) has an opening which can be flanked. The defenders spawn at the corner building for the second checkpoint defense, and spawn in the Sea Fort for the final defense.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nSeason 13 rework.\nHavana was one of the four maps reworked in &lt;a href=\"Season%2013\"&gt;Season 13&lt;/a&gt; with the goal to address balance issues between attackers and defenders. The changes to Havana specifically were made to address spawn camping on the first point and long sightlines for defenders as well as lack of flank routes and high ground access to the attackers.\nOn the first point, part of the attacker spawn room second floor was transformed into a balcony with a new exit leading to it. The middle part of the second floor of the building opposite to the main street was closed off and the balcony of the cafe by the distillery was lowered to reduce defenders' sigthlines. In the second area, various doorways were added or widened and the coastside platform was remodelled. Holes in various assets were blocked for better cover.

He was released in &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 14, making him the 42nd hero added to the game.\nOverview.\nHazard's cybernetics allow him to be a highly mobile tank focused on diving in and diving out. His cybernetics have a shotgun inbuilt into them, also powering his jump to be quite high. The Vanadium injection grants him the ability of a shield with being able to fire homing spikes onto nearby attackers. He can build Vanadium crystalline walls that also knock back and deal damage.\nMatch-Ups and Team Synergy.\nWhen fighting Tanks, Hazard has \"Matchups\" ratings, ranging on a scale of 5 levels. This is because as a Tank, Hazard is focused on eliminating the DPS or Supports, with controlling and annoying the enemy tank being a secondary objective:\nWhen fighting DPS &amp; Supports, Hazard has \"Priority Targeting\" &amp; measures of \"Risk\" ranging on a scale of 5 levels. This is because these heroes are Hazard's main target options to fight. Only the Supports feature a listed measure of risk as nearly all of them can counteract Hazard very reliably with CC or other miscellaneous effects:\nHazard's Synergies are also graded on a scale with 5 levels. Tank Synergies will not feature explicit gradings due to the nature of Role Lock restrictions:\nStory.\nHazard is a charismatic and contrarian punk rocker who might look a little rough around the edges but is a fierce defender at heart. His story is one of resilience and survival. The &lt;a href=\"Phreaks\"&gt;Phreaks&lt;/a&gt; are Hazard's \"found family,\" and his loyalty to them and their anti-establishment ideals are core to who he is.\nA Lonely Youth.\nBorn to veterans of the Omnic Crisis, Findlay Docherty grew up poor and surrounded by stories of violence. His mother died when he was young and his father was absent and unkind, leaving young Findlay to fend for himself. It seemed the only thing keeping food on the table was the regular check the government sent as compensation for his parents\u2019 military service. Findlay grew up respecting the institutions that fed him, but his poverty and poor performance in school made him a victim of bullying for years before he learned to fight back. He eventually enlisted in the military and left behind his old life, convinced that he could find success if he played along with the system.\nCaught in the Crossfire.\nTragedy struck when Findlay was caught at the center of a conflict between Overwatch and Talon in Glasgow. A dropship crashed into the flat he grew up in, killing his father and leaving Findlay trapped in the wreckage for almost two days. Miraculously, Findlay survived, but the accident left him a triple amputee, with chronic pain that would last for the rest of his life and brought an end to his military career. The government offered him basic prostheses, pain medication, and another monthly check to forget about what happened, but Findlay burned at the injustice of it all. His family, his home, his career... Findlay had lost everything, and had no one left to share in his grief. How was he supposed to move on?\nFinding the Phreaks.\nThat was when Findlay learned of the Phreaks, a counter cultural movement of self-augmenting anarchists that protected omnics in the wake of the Crisis. He was taken in by one of their most prominent members: an expert body-modder named Touch-Up who outfitted him with custom augmentations that helped him regain mobility and manage his pain. Over time, Findlay found a family with the Phreaks and enthusiastically embraced their cause. As a member of their crew, Findlay was committed to tearing down systems upheld by organizations like Overwatch and Talon. Together with the Phreaks, Hazard traveled the world and transformed himself through augmentation. No matter the danger, he was always the first to jump into the fray to protect his friends. Over the course of his escapades, Findlay earned himself a new name: Hazard.\nUnstoppable Upgrades.\nHazard continued to push himself with new augmentations that enhanced his physical stature, speed, and strength. But the true turning point came when the Phreaks resolved to steal a rare vanadium isotope from the Oasis Ministry of Genetics. The isotope was unstable, but Touch-Up saw its potential. She designed Hazard a powerful new mod: one that could integrate the vanadium into his body and allow him to shape it into a deadly arsenal. Though Hazard knew harboring the vanadium would make him one of the most wanted criminals in the world, it was worth the risk . Thanks to this latest upgrade, Hazard has become a serious threat to the global order and a charismatic young face among the Phreaks. To the oppressed and downtrodden, Hazard is a hero; to the rich and powerful, he is a terrifying menace... and that\u2019s just the way he likes it.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nHazard's aesthetic and concept art came from a blend of gameplay and narrative goals. Initially, the team envisioned him as a massive, beastly figure, really leaning into the power and presence his gameplay demanded. Hazard was snuck into a broader dev team playtest one day, and the reaction was so positive that it solidified Hazard as the Season 14 hero. From a narrative standpoint, Hazard's backstory mirrors that of the \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\" setting itself, of growing up through hardship and obtaining \"found family\" (in Hazard's case, the Phreaks).\nInitially starting with a cyberpunk, punk rock aesthetic, Hazard began as a monstrous and intimidating villain. Over time, his story and appearance was refined into a character who was still tough but has a rebellious charm; a mix of edginess paired with a protector\u2019s heart. As Hazard\u2019s art development refined his visuals, his backstory shifted too. The evolution from massive tank to charming rebel shaped his narrative, and he turned from a villainous figure to a hero. This shift also helped develop the Phreaks as a faction with strong ties to omnics. They have a focus on bodily autonomy and distinguished them from other groups in Overwatch lore. "}

Healing is done by &lt;a href=\"Health%20Pack\"&gt;Health Pack&lt;/a&gt;s, the spawn room, the payload (for the attacking team), and hero abilities. Although many heroes have healing abilities, &lt;a href=\"Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; heroes have a focus on healing. Generally, the act of healing generates &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20ability\"&gt;ultimate charge&lt;/a&gt; (healing allies' self damage or environmental damage will not grant ultimate charge).\nWhen receiving healing, hit points are restored in the following order: &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Overhealth\"&gt;Overhealth&lt;/a&gt; is a non-recoverable form of hit points and cannot be restored by healing.\nIn Overwatch 2, all heroes passively heal 10 health + 5% of maximum health per second after not taking damage for 5 seconds. Support heroes have this time reduced to 2.5 seconds. This can be stacked on top of their existing healing abilities.\nAlly healing.\nCertain heroes have &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s that can heal allies. Some of these may also heal the hero. \nSome of these may be responsive, and require an input to heal allies, such as shooting an ally with &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;'s , or throwing &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt;'s at an ally, while others may be more \"passive\", such as &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;'s , which can heal allies without the \"intention\" of healing them.\nBelow is a list of all &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; that can heal allies:\nSaving a teammate.\nA \"Save\" can occur when a player has received healing from another player to survive a shot that would have been lethal 2 seconds prior. When a player is saved, a sound is played and a message is shown on the screen announcing the saved player by whom they were saved, and to the saving player who they saved. Additionally, saves are tracked in the &lt;a href=\"scoreboard\"&gt;scoreboard&lt;/a&gt; as a stat specific to the &lt;a href=\"Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; role, however the ability to save is not limited to the Support role.\nFor a save to be credited, the player must have received at least 50 healing from the healer and must remain alive for an additional 0.5 seconds after taking damage. When a player has been saved, they cannot be saved again by the same player for 5 seconds. Healing from hacked &lt;a href=\"health%20pack\"&gt;health pack&lt;/a&gt;s and shots reflected by &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;'s . &lt;a href=\"Overhealth\"&gt;Overhealth&lt;/a&gt; received from &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;'s also grants the save credit, however overhealth from &lt;a href=\"Junker%20Queen\"&gt;Junker Queen&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;'s only grant save credit if the hero also received any healing from another source. Additionally, a save is granted if a hero's death is prevented by &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt;'s or if they are revived by &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Mercy&lt;/a&gt;'s . These two are special cases and ignore the aforementioned requirements.\nSelf-healing.\nSelf-Healing refers to abilities specifically designed only to heal the user. Some abilities in the Ally Healing section may be able to heal the hero who uses them, but those won't be listed below.\nAs mentioned earlier, all heroes passively heal 10 health + 5% of maximum health per second, after not taking damage for 5 seconds. &lt;a href=\"Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; heroes have this time reduced to 2.5 seconds. This healing is stacked on top of other sources and it does not count towards the \"Healing Dealt\" statistic.\nBelow is a list of all &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; that are used to only heal the hero using them:\nHealing modification.\nSome &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; may increase or decrease healing received on a target. Healing can be modified either through a status effect from an ability/weapon, or indirectly applied to projectiles with &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt;'s .\nBelow is a list of all &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; that can alter healing on allies or enemies:"}

Together, they started the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wall\"&gt;Great Wall&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn the fourth day of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Wall was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;'s omnics, but the attackers were annihilated by concentrated fire from the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Army\"&gt;Portuguese Army&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, both of the Martinses returned to work, seeking to protect Portugal from the inevitable second wave. While Cl\u00e1udio worked on the wall and convinced the Portuguese government to make an alliance with Spain, Hector and his team continued to expand the Wall. The alliance was sealed, and in exchange for their feat of engineering, Spain granted the Martinses a and research center in Gibraltar for their own use.\nThe Martinses tried to approach neighboring nations with the same deal (expand the Great Wall in exchange for military support), but they found no success. The governments they approached either wanted control of the seawall, or feared an alliance would yoke them to the defense of adjoining countries. They preferred to stand (and all too frequently, die) alone. With only Spain and Portugal accepting their services, the Martinses helped both countries retrofit their seawalls for defensive measures.\nBoth the Martinses joined &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; during the conflict. They were assigned to the group's engineering team, where they worked under engineer &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;. Though their efforts were largely limited to armor enhancements and consulting, they saved numerous lives over the course of the war.\nPost-Crisis.\nAfter the conclusion of the Omnic Crisis, Overwatch's charter was expanded. Both of the Martinses remained with the organization. Their old base in Gibraltar fell into disuse as its staff was gradually thinned, and ultimately, the base was shut down. The Martinses decided to donate the base to Overwatch, where it was named \"Watchpoint: Gibraltar.\"\nAt some point, the Martinses left Overwatch (it is not clear if this was before its disbandment or because of it) and began work on their next project\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Arcology\"&gt;Atlantic Arcology&lt;/a&gt;. The arcology had problems with curious whales, but they refused help from &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%20Lindholm\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;.

It began in the early hours of the morning, when an unidentified aircraft approached the facility. Security initially reported that the craft had no passengers on board, based on radar scans. The craft passed through the range of the installation\u2019s defense systems without incident (this feat led some individuals to believe later that Talon had moles within Helix). Video surveillance from within the compound revealed a black shadowy figure emerging from the craft and descending upon the prison grounds. The unidentified assailant easily overcame the Helix security agents, leaving over a dozen dead. Medical records of the casualties reveal injuries and cellular degeneration matching other incidents involving the mercenary known as the &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, all but confirming the incursion as a Talon attack. &lt;a href=\"Akande%20Ogundimu\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt; was freed, and possibly other inmates.\nReports reached the media, but it took three months for a complete picture of the incident to become clear; &lt;a href=\"Times%20of%20Numbani\"&gt;Times of Numbani&lt;/a&gt; ran a story on the incident, confirming that Ogudimu had indeed been freed. Helix officials were unwilling to reveal whether other escapees or items were taken from the facility, but sources indicated that there were likely other breaches."}

It is funded by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; and acts as a global security force. It is one of the most powerful corporations in the world.\nBackground.\nIn the current era, Helix serves as a replacement for &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. While officially a peacekeeping force, the group has shown disregard for collateral damage at times; &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Morrison\"&gt;Jack Morrison&lt;/a&gt; regards them as nothing more than mercenaries. It is based primarily in Egypt, and effectively acts as the country's military. \nThe Temple of Anubis.\nHSI currently has a contract to safeguard the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Anubis\"&gt;Temple of Anubis&lt;/a&gt;. A few years after it took control of the facility, the \"&lt;a href=\"god%20program\"&gt;god program&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt; broke containment. 3 hours after the incident, HSI sent in an engineering team, but lost contact with them. It thus sent in a \"kill everything\" team under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Khalil\"&gt;Khalil&lt;/a&gt;. From the outset, the team was dogged with adversity\u2014&lt;a href=\"Okoro\"&gt;Okoro&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt;, was hacked by Anubis, the omnic taking his own life to prevent himself falling under Anubis's control. Soon afterwards, the team was attacked by &lt;a href=\"sentry%20bot\"&gt;sentry bot&lt;/a&gt;s, which resulted in Khalil's death. As Lieutenant Amari took command of the operation, she and her fellow members successfully entered the temple and shut Anubis down. After the battle, Amari was promoted to the rank of Captain, replacing Khalil and continued to lead her team.\nWatchpoint: Grand Mesa.\nHSI personnel were stationed at \u2014a former &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; outpost. However, they failed to stop the theft of a &lt;a href=\"pulse%20rifle\"&gt;pulse rifle&lt;/a&gt; by an . No personnel were killed, though some had to be treated for non-threatening injuries.\nThe Doomfist Breakout.\nThe organization's &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Securities%20maximum%20security%20prison\"&gt;maximum security prison&lt;/a&gt; was breached in a &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; operation. A Talon aircraft bypassed the base's defenses without incident, which led some to speculate that Talon had moles within Helix. The mercenary known as &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; easily overcame the base's security and freed &lt;a href=\"Akande%20Ogundimu\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt;, possibly freeing other inmates and retrieving items stored in the facility. HSI lost track of Ogundimu until he resurfaced in &lt;a href=\"Numbani\"&gt;Numbani&lt;/a&gt;, where he clashed with the newly introduced &lt;a href=\"OR15\"&gt;OR15&lt;/a&gt; defense robots at the &lt;a href=\"Adawe%20International%20Terminal\"&gt;Adawe International Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, easily destroying them and reclaiming the &lt;a href=\"Doomfist%20%28title%29\"&gt;Doomfist&lt;/a&gt; gauntlet.\nIt was three months later that the events at the base became public knowledge, and when asked, HSI refused to confirm whether other inmates had escaped. Questions were ranged at Helix's effectiveness and methodology, as the breakout was just one of a number of incidents where Helix's effectiveness had come up short. Nonetheless, HSI requested, and was granted, additional funding by the UN to cope with rising threats, much to the dismay of those who'd objected to the increased privatization of security following the disbandment of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalon and the Temple.\nTalon attacked the Temple of Anubis. HSI deployed its &lt;a href=\"Raptora\"&gt;Raptora&lt;/a&gt; units to defend the complex, and the resulting rocketfire resulted in civilian casualties and damage to the surrounding buildings. In the aftermath, HSI members were treated for their injuries, along with those caught in the crossfire.\nCairo.\nHSI continued its anti-Talon operations in Cairo; Fareeha Amari spent months tracking them, and led numerous missions against the group. All of them ended in failure.\nA Talon hit squad traced an &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;unidentified target&lt;/a&gt; in Cairo, and a firefight erupted in a marketplace against two &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt;. The attack was bigger than anything HSI had seen from Talon before.\nA few days later, an HSI Raptora squad tracked the Talon agents to their warehouses. An attack was launched under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Fareeha%20Amari\"&gt;Fareeha Amari&lt;/a&gt;, and the warehouse was razed to the ground. However, she reflected that HSI's success would do little to dent Talon's operations. She ordered that HSI medics be brought in to tend to the wounded.\nLater, another Talon hit squad attacked Amari in the streets of Cairo, alongside former Overwatch members Ana Amari and Cole Cassidy. She called for reinforcements, while she and her allies fought their way through the streets. The reinforcements she requested were intercepted en route, leaving her and her allies to fight their own way out of the ambush. In the resulting firefight, the entire Talon cell was wiped out."}

It can be accessed through the Play menu.\nBackground.\nThe Hero Mastery missions take place via a simulator installed by &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; in , sometime after the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Zero%20Hour\"&gt;Zero Hour&lt;/a&gt;\". This was done to help &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;'s new recruits hone their skills, in preparation for their battles against &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nHero Mastery missions consist of courses specifically designed for each select hero, testing the player's skills with their abilities. Enemy bots will likewise differ, and each course can be player on a number of difficulties, with the course's layout shifting accordingly. Hero Mastery is also intended to help players master specific heroes.\nEach hero in Hero Mastery will have three courses available to them: Recruit, Agent and Veteran. The harder Agent and Veteran courses start locked and can be unlocked by completing the hero's Recruit course with 3 stars and Agent course with 4 stars, respectively. Stars represent the overall rating of your attempt in the course depending the amount of score earned. Each course has their own score requirements.\nHero Mastery also features global leaderboards to showcase the top-performing hero masters across the world.\nAvailable Heroes.\nThe following heroes are currently available for Hero Mastery:\nScoring.\nPlayers earn score by completing the game mode objectives. Leaderboards track highest scores for top 500 players in each region and course.\nDevelopment.\nHero Mastery stemmed from discussions among &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt;, how their children had begun playing \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". The developers wanted a safe space for them to learn how to play that wasn't in the live game. Heroes are to be added to the game mode over time. The first lot of courses for a selection of heroes (6) was released in Season 6, with more to come in future seasons."}

They had some similarity with &lt;a href=\"Story%20Experience\"&gt;Story Experience&lt;/a&gt; missions, but while Story Experience is more narrative based, Hero Missions were designed to be highly replayable (though would feature some light story elements). They were larger in scope than Story Missions.\nEach mission was different from the one before, from the map being played in to the enemies players would face, whether they were &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Objectives in the mission would vary each time they were played; for instance, a holdout mission in , or taking out a &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charger\"&gt;Charger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Route%2066\"&gt;Route 66&lt;/a&gt;. Hero missions took place in pre-existing multiplayer maps, but additional areas would sometimes be added. Environmental effects were also present (e.g. sandstorms) as well as day-night cycles.\nNull Sector and Talon were intended to serve as the initial antagonists in the mode, but it was indicated that new factions could be introduced later.\nDevelopment.\nHero Missions were announced in &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202019\"&gt;BlizzCon 2019&lt;/a&gt; as a part of the \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" major PvE release. Hundreds of hero missions were expected to be released. However, &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; ran into issues when developing the mode; the team struggled to find their footing, and the scope of the mode grew. According to &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Keller\"&gt;Aaron Keller&lt;/a&gt;, the team was trying to do too many things at once, and lost focus. Furthermore, resources were being pulled from the live-service elements of \"Overwatch 2\" to work on the mode. He has further commented that the \"crawl, walk, run\" development plan that began in \"&lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;\" wasn't working.\nThe decision to change the direction of the game's PvE content was made in late 2022, after the release of \"Overwatch 2\". As there was no definitive end in sight for the development of Hero Missions, the shift was made to put everything in the live game.\nOn May 16, 2023, it was announced that the original plan for a major PvE release had been scrapped, and that smaller batches of PvE content would be featured as part of &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;al content instead. In the process, Hero Missions and various progression features related to them, were cut from development. In its place, &lt;a href=\"Story%20Missions\"&gt;Story Missions&lt;/a&gt; would have more focus. Some elements of Hero Missions have been repurposed into other content. After the announcement, many falsely claimed that PvE had been cancelled, when in reality, only Hero Missions were."}

Players may change their hero any time while they are in their team's &lt;a href=\"spawn%20room\"&gt;spawn room&lt;/a&gt;. Upon swapping the hero it will be hidden from the enemy team's scoreboard for 15 seconds.\nEvery hero wields a unique &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, which is their main way of dealing damage and/or healing. Weapons may have an alternate fire, and some heroes may have multiple weapons, which can be switched using the number keys 1 and 2 by default. Generally, heroes have at least two normal &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;Abilities&lt;/a&gt;, which are bound by default to 'Shift' and 'E', and an &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20ability\"&gt;Ultimate ability&lt;/a&gt;, bound to 'Q'. Abilities are capable of dealing damage or healing and can provide impactful utility.\nHeroes have &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, usually referred to as \"HP\" or \"hit points,\" which represents the amount of damage the hero can take before they are eliminated. The amount of hit points that different heroes have ranges from 175 to 800, sometimes dependent upon their &lt;a href=\"Roles\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;. If a hero has taken damage, they start regenerating their lost health at a rate of 10 HP/s + 5% of their maximum HP after 5 seconds of not taking damage (except for Support heroes, who start regenerating lost health after 2.5 seconds).\nHeroes &lt;a href=\"Movement%20speed\"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; at a base speed of 5.5 m/s (except &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt;, who have a base speed of 6 m/s). Walking backwards reduces move speed by 10%, and crouching reduces move speed to 3 m/s in every direction. Additionally, all heroes can jump at a height of 0.98 meters under normal gravity.\nEach hero offers a unique style of play, and is classified under one of three roles: &lt;a href=\"Roles%23Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roles%23Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Roles%23Support\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Unranked%23Role%20Queue\"&gt;Role Queue&lt;/a&gt;, the standard game mode, each team is restricted to two Support heroes, two Damage heroes, and one Tank. However, there are various other game modes that have no role limits. Players can switch between heroes in the spawn room.\nHeroes come from a variety of national/ethnic backgrounds, and occasionally speak in their native languages. During matches, heroes exchange specific dialogue with each other based on their character history and background.\nNew heroes are added to the game over time via updates. As of Season 10, heroes do not require a purchase, and are available from the outset upon release. However, players must still complete the first-time user experience to unlock heroes.\nList of Heroes by release date.\nThere were originally 21 heroes at the launch of the game. Since then, additional heroes have been added. During \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;,\" new heroes were released roughly every four months: in March, July, and November; the November reveal always took place during the opening ceremony of that year's &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\", new heroes are expected to arrive every other season, starting in &lt;a href=\"Season%23Season%202\"&gt;Season 2&lt;/a&gt;. This means that every evenly numbered season is expected to release with a new hero.\nDevelopment.\nThere are always a few heroes in development at any given time. Which hero's development gets priority is determined through the game's current state and what hero has the best compatibility with it.\nDesign Process.\nHeroes are based off popular and recognizable archetypes. When a hero is pitched, a group of five developers examine gameplay, character concept, and character backstory to see if the idea is worth fleshing out. If that's in the affirmative, the team of five becomes a team of ten to 15, who are tasked with \"finding the fun\" in the hero and bringing out its \"core.\" This includes work on art, design, engineering, audio and quality assurance. Once this is completed, the hero gains (or will have gained) 40 or more developers, who build its respective content (skins, emotes, voice lines, etc.). For early heroes, it was common to theme the hero mainly around their weapon (examples of this include &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Pharah&lt;/a&gt;). How a hero is developed can vary; sometimes their look and feel inspire their abilities, and sometimes it\u2019s the other way around.\nAfter the hero is fully playable, a different team is brought in to build the hero's story, bringing the total team to about 80 people. These individuals work on material including origin story cinematics, comics, and animated shorts. After that, the hero then needs to be publicized. By this last stage, over 150 individuals will have worked on the hero in some form.\nCut Heroes.\nThe following heroes have been cut during development of the game:"}

{"id": "6060", "revid": "55717755", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6060", "title": "Hit points", "text": "Hit points (HP) represent how much damage a &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Objects\"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt; can take. The current and total hit points of the unit are shown in their health bar, divided into bars each worth 25 HP.\nOverview.\nThere are 4 main types of hit points in Overwatch 2. From bottom to top these are &lt;a href=\"%23Health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%23Overhealth\"&gt;overhealth&lt;/a&gt;. Out of the four, health, armor and shields are \"recoverable HP\", meaning that they can restored by &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt;, whereas overhealth is \"non-recoverable HP\". When taking damage, hit points will be consumed in order from top to bottom, and when being healed, restored from bottom to top.\nEach type of hit points has certain properties, which only apply to that portion of HP. For example, if an instance of damage is higher than remaining armor, the damage reduction will only apply in proportion to the amount of damage the armor would take, and shields will only regenerate itself rather than the other types of hit points above or below them.\nA hero's HP is \"low\" at 50% and \"critical\" at 25%. Their location will be shown to all friendly supports. If a hero's HP becomes ~25-30% or lower, a gasp sound effect is played and blood appears around the borders of the screen ( no blood in Junkenstein modes and tutorial), with the exception of 175 HP heroes, who get it at 70 HP (currently only &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eject%21\"&gt;pilot D.Va&lt;/a&gt;).\nHealth.\nThe most basic form of HP is health, which appears on all heroes. It is the bottom-most type of HP, which is depleted when there is no armor or shields to protect it, and is the first to be replenished when being healed. If a hero's health comes to 0, they will die. Heroes in the &lt;a href=\"roles\"&gt;Tank role&lt;/a&gt; have an additional 150 Health in Role Queue game modes. Health is colored white.\nArmor.\nArmor is a type of recoverable HP that reduces damage dealt to that portion of health. Armor hit points are applied on top of health and below shields. The following heroes have armor as part of their baseline health pool: &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;D.Va&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hazard\"&gt;Hazard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mauga\"&gt;Mauga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orisa\"&gt;Orisa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt;. Armor can also be obtained through some abilities. Armor is colored orange.\nArmor is extremely effective against attacks that consist of multiple smaller instances of damage, like shotguns. For every instance of damage received - that is not from a &lt;a href=\"beam\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; effect - armor reduces the damage received by 7, up to a maximum of 50% of the incoming damage. In other words, any damage instance that is lower than 14, will be halved instead of being reduced by flat 7 damage. Direct hit bonuses from explosive projectiles are dealt in the same instance as the splash damage, meaning that armor reduction only applies once. Armor reduction is always applied in full if the damage instance removes any armored health - either upon transitioning from shields or over health to armor or from armor to base health.\nAgainst beams and damage-over-time effects, armor works differently: armor reduces the damage of beam-type weapons by 30%, regardless of the amount of damage dealt by instance, and damage over time effects are completely exempt from the reduction. Exceptionally, Winston's also pierces the damage reduction from armor, causing it to deal the same damage to armor as it would to normal health. \nArmor is applied after all other damage modifications. However, it still respects the global 50% cap for &lt;a href=\"damage%20reduction\"&gt;damage reduction&lt;/a&gt; effects. For example, if a fortified Orisa would take 120 damage, (-45% taken) reduces it to 66, then armor could reduce it by another 7 points, but that would cause Orisa to take 59 damage in total, which is just under 50% of the original; so Orisa takes 60 damage.\nShields.\nShields are a type of recoverable HP that automatically regenerate while not taking damage. Shield is the topmost form of recoverable hit points, above armor. The following heroes have shields as part of their baseline health pool: &lt;a href=\"Sigma\"&gt;Sigma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;Zarya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juno\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lifeweaver\"&gt;Lifeweaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href=\"objects\"&gt;objects&lt;/a&gt; also have shield HP. Shields are colored light blue.\nAfter not taking damage for 3 seconds, shields start regenerating at a rate of . This recovery is treated as a form of healing, meaning that it can be amplified by certain effects or blocked by &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control%23Anti-Heal\"&gt;anti-heal&lt;/a&gt;. The shield regeneration works additively to the passive regen all heroes have, allowing a hero to heal up to 40 + 5% of their max HP per second without assistance, given they have shield health to regen.\nBarrier health.\n&lt;a href=\"Barrier\"&gt;Barrier&lt;/a&gt; health is a type of shield health. The main difference between barrier health and regular shields is their regeneration: Barrier health only regenerates while the barrier is inactive, meaning only recallable barriers can regenerate. Furthermore, the delay before regeneration is 2 seconds instead of 3, and the regeneration rate varies between barriers. Barriers are also destroyed by Sombra's if they are hit while active, unlike shields.\nOverhealth.\nOverhealth is a type of non-recoverable HP that represents most temporary forms of HP in Overwatch 2. It is only gained through abilities. Overhealth can decay either over time or immediately at the end of a timer. Enemies receive 50% less ultimate charge from damage dealt to overhealth. Overhealth is represented by a green health bar.\nTemporary Armor &amp; Shields.\nTemporary armor &amp; shields were a prominent feature used in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. They are types of non-recoverable HP similar to Overhealth. Temporary armor (colored \"dark orange\") granted the same effects as regular armor. Temporary shields (colored \"dark blue\") granted no unique effects. In &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;, all abilities at the time that provided temporary armor &amp; shields were removed to help reduce visual noise when multiple types of hit points were applied to a hero, especially in &lt;a href=\"Hero%20Missions\"&gt;Hero Missions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Story%20Missions\"&gt;Story Missions&lt;/a&gt;. All abilities that previously granted temporary armor or shields in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; were updated to grant overhealth in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nTemporary armor &amp; shields can still be accessed through &lt;a href=\"Workshop\"&gt;Workshop&lt;/a&gt; actions, where they can be applied to a player with the \"Add Health Pool to Player\" action. However they don't have graphics, and will appear as transparent portions of the player's health bar. Despite this, they both maintain the same functionality they had in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;, they reintroduced aspects of temporary armor with the release of &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Nemesis%20Form\"&gt;Nemesis Form&lt;/a&gt; grants him additional armor health, which disappears once the cooldown ends. As for temporary shields, aspects of this was reintroduced with &lt;a href=\"Venture\"&gt;Venture&lt;/a&gt;'s kit, with their passive &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20Resolve\"&gt;Explorer's Resolve&lt;/a&gt;, which provided them with temporary shield health which decay after a short while. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, both temporary armor and shields have the same color as regular armor and shields, being treated the same. Additionally, all abilities that grant temporary shields and armor in Overwatch 2 only grant them to the user, not allies."}

Down the street from the Mandarin Theatre, Goldshire Studios' omnic film auteur, HAL-Fred Glitchbot, has created his two latest films, \"They Come from Beyond the Moon\" and \"Six-Gun Killer\", to varying amounts of critical and commercial acclaim. However, even Tinseltown has been gripped by anti-omnic sentiment, and the outspoken director has become a prime target in the escalating conflict.\nGameplay.\nThe 'payload' in the map is &lt;a href=\"HAL-Fred%20Glitchbot\"&gt;HAL-Fred Glitchbot&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; director. The map starts off in the Hollywood boulevard, then moves on to &lt;a href=\"Goldshire%20Studios\"&gt;Goldshire Studios&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous studio sets are passed through.\nStrategy.\nAttack.\nAt the setup of the game, have any snipers or Junkrat take the side exit. From here these characters can go up the stairs and snipe/blow up enemies. Have your tanks and healers at the main entrance (a Reinhardt is recommended since there isn't much cover) though healers can choose to take the side door if wanted, since many characters go for the healer first. Attack and defense can go either way, but keep mostly everyone at the main entrance to draw the enemy team's attention off the healers or snipers on the side. \nDefense.\nUsually you should have a strong backline on the first point. The best place to set up your snipers is usually the building to your right. Also, having tanks such as Roadhog, Reinhardt and D.Va is strongly recommended."}

{"id": "2004", "revid": "27025711", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2004", "title": "Horizon Lunar Colony", "text": "Horizon Lunar Colony was an &lt;a href=\"Assault\"&gt;Assault&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 20 June 2017, making it the 20th map added to the game. In Overwatch 2, the map is only accessible in &lt;a href=\"Custom%20game\"&gt;Custom games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcade\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, due to the removal of the Assault mode from standard modes.\nOfficial Description.\nBuilt as a first step towards humanity's renewed exploration of space, the Horizon Lunar Colony\u2019s goal was to examine the effects of prolonged extraterrestrial habitation\u2014on human and ape alike. The scientists' research proved incredibly promising...until, suddenly, all contact and communications with the base were lost. \nBackground.\nThe Horizon Lunar Colony (otherwise designated \"Horizon One\") is a moonbase constructed by &lt;a href=\"Lucheng%20Interstellar\"&gt;Lucheng Interstellar&lt;/a&gt;, operated by its &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Ops\"&gt;Lunar Ops&lt;/a&gt; branch. \nHistory.\nPre-Crisis.\nHorizon Lunar Colony was established as part of humanity's renewed focus on space exploration. It was constructed by Lucheng Interstellar to observe the long-term effects of low-gravity environments on living organisms. It was expected that the colony would take years to build, but the construction time was shortened through the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Space%20Research%20Organization\"&gt;Indian Space Research Organization&lt;/a&gt;. Using &lt;a href=\"lev%20rim\"&gt;lev rim&lt;/a&gt; technology for satellite launches, the cost of such launches was reduced by 93%. With help from ISRO's orbital launch tracks, the facility was completed in a matter of years. Its hydroponics system was designed by &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Mui\"&gt;Wing Mui&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wanc%C3%A0i%20Industries\"&gt;Wanc\u00e0i Industries&lt;/a&gt;, who developed a system more advanced than any previously. Because of her work, Mui became known as \"the woman who put potatoes on the moon.\"\nHorizon's existence and accompanying gains in technology trickled down to Earth in a number of key areas. One was advances in textile technology (used to reduce the weight of spacesuits), which was used by a variety of services on Earth, which proved instrumental in saving lives during the Omnic Crisis. The other was in bone and muscle treatment. Horizon's radiation shields, while robust, could not match the defenses provided by Earth's magnetosphere against solar radiation, which forced Lucheng to rapidly focus on cancer treatments. This was applicable to patients on Earth, along with the afforementioned bone and muscle technologies. Even those who considered Horizon a distraction benefitted from the technology and admitted, however grudgingly, to the benefits of the colony.\nDespite these advances, Horizon's primary focus was preparing humanity for the rigors of long-term space travel. To this end, in addition to the scientists that worked there were a group of genetically enhanced gorillas that were intended to test the effects of prolonged habitation in space on the human body. This required Lucheng to obtain special dispensation.\nIn the colony's heyday, many prominent scientists did residencies on Horizon. This included Dr. &lt;a href=\"Siebren%20de%20Kuiper\"&gt;Siebren de Kuiper&lt;/a&gt;, who spent a year on the colony continuing his gravitational studies, and advising the staff on the installation of their advanced low-gravity hydroponics system (an upgrade to Mui's design). Other alumni included Doctors &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Naughton\"&gt;Victoria Naughton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ainar%20Omarov\"&gt;Ainar Omarov&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-Crisis.\nTowards the colony's last days, some of the gorillas had demonstrated adverse reactions to the genetic therapy, possibly compounded by life on the colony itself. A group of gorillas had established themselves as well-known troublemakers to the staff, and had put even &lt;a href=\"Nguyen\"&gt;some staff&lt;/a&gt; in the base's infirmary. It was agreed that the gorillas should be confined to their quarters, but Dr. &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Winston\"&gt;Harold Winston&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that not all of the gorillas had reacted adversely to the therapy. He didn't know if shipping them to Earth would be a viable solution, if only for the medical issues that would present themselves. He advised putting a stop to the therapy.\nThe experiments came to an end when the gorillas launched an uprising, killing the scientists and claiming the base for their own. It is known that in one of the last recorded messages, Dr Winston reported a malfunction at airlock E-35, and requested fellow staff members join him. It has further been implied that this was a ploy by the gorillas, who got the scientists in the airlock and then opened it, venting the humans onto the lunar surface to die from asphyxiation. For the gorillas themselves, it has been indicated that they are so far happy to stay within the base. &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Specimen 28&lt;/a&gt; was one of the only exceptions, who built a rocket out of makeshift parts and successfully made it to Earth. &lt;a href=\"Wrecking%20Ball\"&gt;Specimen 8&lt;/a&gt; also escaped from the colony after engineering an escape pod and secretly attaching it to Specimen 28's space shuttle. \nYears after the base's fall, Lucheng Interstellar revealed in a press conference that the colony's databases and monitoring systems were still up and running. While no direct communication was established with the facility, the company successfully retrieved interpersonnel logs sent days and moments before the base lost contact with Earth. It shared the transmissions with the press. It later released its first image of the colony's still-operating integrated monitoring systems. A Lucheng spokesperson told &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20News\"&gt;Atlas News&lt;/a&gt; that the connection was unstable, but that the company was working around the clock to gather new information.\nGameplay.\nThe map has a Point A (the telescope) and a Point B on its attack route. The base may be exited via airlock doors. Outside the base, players will fight in low gravity.\nKnown Staff.\nWith the exception of Dr. &lt;a href=\"Chao\"&gt;Chao&lt;/a&gt;, all members of staff were killed by the gorillas.\nTemporary.\nThe following individuals spent time on the colony, but cannot be considered permanent staff:\nTest Subjects.\nAt least some, if not all of the gorillas were named after the human staff.\nUnique Features.\nThe attacking team can view Earth via the telescope by holding down the default reload button. Using the telescope prompts the character (excluding &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illari\"&gt;Illari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiriko\"&gt;Kiriko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;) to comment on the view.\nDevelopment.\nThe idea of a moon map was present from the earliest days of the game's development. It kept being pushed back, as the developers wanted to do the idea justice in both story, and how low gravity would be handled. The map was created in order to introduce a new Assault map to the game. Initially, all of the map took place in low gravity. However, it felt gimmicky, and it broke the game in some ways, at least as far as competitive balance went.\nTrivia.\nStarwatch.\nHorizon Lunar Colony is used in the &lt;a href=\"Starwatch\"&gt;Starwatch&lt;/a&gt; event. In-universe, it is the interior of the \"&lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Galactrius\"&gt;Infinite Galactrius&lt;/a&gt;\", and the visuals are changed as such. 4 control points are used instead of the original 2. The defenders have the benefit of turrets that will fire on the attacking team (the turrets can be repaired by healing, but cannot be rebuilt if destroyed). Additionally, gravity implosion barrels are present throughout the facility. Destroying the container will unleash a small, yet powerful black hole that will catch anyone in its wake, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Unlike the turrets, the barrels respawn, and can be utilized by either side."}

Her favorite bands are the Stooges, the Ramones, and the Beatles. She is far less appreciative of omnic music, not even sure if it could be called such a thing.\nBackground.\nIggy worked in a lab with a technician who introduced her to human music with the song \"\" by . Over time she developed an interest in music, and shared her appreciation with two of her omnic co-workers; &lt;a href=\"Lady\"&gt;Lady&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lizzy\"&gt;Lizzy&lt;/a&gt;. Iggy moved into the Underworld, rooming with Lizzy and Lady.\nLondon Calling.\nMeeting Tracer.\nIggy met &lt;a href=\"Tracer\"&gt;Tracer&lt;/a&gt; while attempting to steal a modulator from a vendor that refused to sell to omnics. The two quickly bonded over their shared love of classic English rock music, and Iggy took her to the Underworld to listen to old records. As she left, Tracer offered to do what she could to help Iggy and the other omnics living in the Underworld, and promised Iggy that they'd meet again.\nIggy bringing Tracer into the Underworld didn't go unnoticed, as she was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Kace\"&gt;Kace&lt;/a&gt; and his followers. Tracer stumbled upon the confrontation. Kace left, but not without warning Iggy that humans had no honor, and that one day, Iggy would see this truth. Iggy was despondent, but was cheered up when Tracer revealed that she'd brought an Iggy Pop record with her. In her quarters, Iggy explained that there were omnics who feared losing themselves if they embraced human culture. Iggy explained that she didn't believe her love of human culture didn't require her to forsake being omnic. Tracer headed off, explaining that she only needed a few more parts to fix the grid.\nThat night, Iggy was once again confronted by Kace. Iggy explained that Tracer had promised to help get parts to fix the grid, but Kace was unconvinced, asking what good music would do them in the next blackout. On cue, the Underworld was plunged into darkness. Kace, losing patience, led his followers out of the Underworld, determined to acquire the parts they needed through theft. Despite the grim situation, Iggy refused to give up hope.\nThe next day, Iggy met Tracer in the street. She'd managed to acquire a regulator, but Iggy explained that the grid needed a new transformer, and that without it, the grid would continue to fail. Furthermore, she told Iggy that Tekhartha &lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt;, wanted to contact her. Tracer explained that they'd met during the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%20Uprising\"&gt;King's Row Uprising&lt;/a&gt;, but didn't know why Mondatta would want to see her. Iggy didn't know either, but told Tracer that his followers were trying to get in touch. That he was giving a speech at &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt; tonight, and wanted to see her before giving it.\nAlive.\nIggy went to the gathering and was overjoyed at seeing so many humans and omnics present, including omnics that she thought would have never come. She met with Tracer in the crowd, and listened to Mondatta as he began to speak. However, Tracer suddenly headed off. An omnic pointed out that Tracer was a former member of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, and Iggy reflected that if Tracer had headed off like that, maybe something was wrong. Iggy headed to the rooftops and saw Tracer engaged in a firefight with an &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;. She watched as the assassin fired her rifle, and Tracer blinked to avoid the bullet...which allowed said bullet to hit Mondatta instead, killing him. Iggy, distraught, reflected that Tracer could have saved Mondatta, but hadn't.\nIggy headed back to the street, telling her fellow omnics that Tracer had blinked out of the way, allowing Mondatta to be killed. And that she didn't know why. \nDeath.\nBack in the Underworld, Iggy, Lady, and Lizzy listened to music. Iggy let her bitterness consume her, stating that \"they\" had killed Mondatta. They, as in, humans. Lady pointed out that Iggy didn't know who'd fired the shot, and that Tracer had clearly not fired the bullet, but Iggy wasn't swayed. Even if Tracer hadn't fired the shot, \"someone\" had killed Mondatta, and Tracer had let them. Later, they attended a rally held by Kace, arguing that it was time for omnics to strike back at humanity. Lady and Lizzy were uneasy with Kace's aggressive stance, worried that the tense situation could escalate, but Iggy found herself swayed to Kace's words. In her mind, things were already bad, and humanity was at fault.\nOn the surface, the three took part in a protest in King's Row, coupled with omnics and human allies. &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ops\"&gt;Special Ops&lt;/a&gt; were called in, and a &lt;a href=\"sonic%20pulse\"&gt;sonic pulse&lt;/a&gt; was deployed. In the chaos, Lady was hit at point-blank range. Tracer, who'd arrived on the scene, helped Iggy take Lady back to the Underworld, but she expired. Iggy spoke at her funeral.\nIn the aftermath, Iggy and Tracer discussed Lady's death. Iggy claimed that she couldn't understand\u2014humans could repopulate, but omnics couldn't be replaced. Tracer left, forced out by Kace. \nRevolution.\nIggy attended another of Kace's rallies, but while many omnics were swept up by his words, Iggy wasn't among them. She left, contacting Lizzy, who'd left the Underworld. As she walked, she came across an omnic sniper, who fired at Kace. Kace survived, and ordered the tunnels be searched for the assassin. Iggy confronted Kace, stating that she'd seen the shooter, and recognised the 'assassin' as one of Kace's own omnics. She realized that Kace had ordered one of his followers to shoot and intentionally miss, in order to scare the Underworld's omnics into following him. Kace might style himself as a leader, but he was no Mondatta. \nIggy was taken prisoner by Kace, intent on executing her. One of his followers held her over a drop, as Tracer and Lizzy arrived. The thug let Iggy go, but Tracer was able to use her &lt;a href=\"chronal%20accelerator\"&gt;chronal accelerator&lt;/a&gt; to zip up, catch Iggy in mid-air, and get her to ground safely. They took cover from Kace's thugs, who opened fire on them. They reunited with Lizzy in the tunnels, who'd turned up with numerous omnics who wanted to get out of the Underworld. She informed them that Kace's followers were rounding up everyone, forcing the omnics to fight for him. Tracer ordered Iggy and Lizzy to take the east side of the Underworld, while she'd take the west. They'd rendezvous back here, and lead the omnics out.\nA few hours later, the exodus set off. However, Kace's followers barred the exit. Kace stated that any omnic who refused to join the revolution was a traitor, and his thugs opened fire. The omnics scattered. Tracer was able to distract them and reunited with them, alongside &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt;\u2014another former &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; agent. She told Lizzy and Iggy to head for the entrance, while she and Winston drew Kace's forces deeper into the Underworld. Iggy told Tracer that she had to stop Kace. That if he took out the grid, it would devastate the Underworld's omnics. She agreed, and the groups parted ways.\nAs Iggy and Lizzy led the omnics, Iggy discussed her surprise that Tracer wasn't angry at her. She regretted that she'd turned on Tracer after Mondatta's death. Lizzy comforted her, and in doing so, inadvertantly led Iggy to believe that they shouldn't be fighting. They could save the Underworld. To this end, she made a broadcast, addressing Kace's followers, before walking up to face Kace directly. His followers dropped their weapons, but Kace wasn't swayed, drawing out a pistol and shooting at Iggy. Tracer used her blink ability to take the bullet, but due to her malfunctioning chronal accelerator, couldn't rewind time to negate the damage. The bullet ended up richocheting within her body due to the botched rewind.\nTracer was taken to a hospital, and after eight hours of surgery, was saved. Iggy told her that the omnics who held vigil during the operation had played \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust_for_Life_%2528Iggy_Pop_song%2529\"&gt;Lust for Life&lt;/a&gt;\" on repeat. Tracer said that they \"must have tipped it,\" given that a week later, she had fully recovered.\nNull Sector.\nIggy was present in the Underworld when it came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; arrived to save her and her fellow omnics."}

It is one of the 12 maps included in the game's initial release.\nBackground.\nIlios is located in the Aegean Sea of Greece, which is part of the Mediterranean Sea. \nSituated atop a small island rising from the Aegean Sea, Ilios is a postcard-perfect Mediterranean town, with a bustling harborside, winding paths for rambling hillside strolls, and gorgeous vistas. It is the ideal vacation stop for people looking for a place to relax, or for those interested in exploring the ruins scattered at the top of the island, where many artifacts and relics of the ancient world have been unearthed. It is a lively place, and most of the island's residents and tourists remain active after sunset. The town maintains its own police force.\nHistory.\nCivilization on Ilios goes back at least 3000 years. In the 21st century, the ruins were declared an internationally protected heritage site, and the &lt;a href=\"Wayfinder%20Society\"&gt;Wayfinder Society&lt;/a&gt; was allowed to operate within them.\n&lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt; attempted to steal the artifacts, plundering the site with reckless abandon.

{"id": "63778", "revid": "54745587", "url": "https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki?curid=63778", "title": "Illari", "text": "Illari is a &lt;a href=\"Roles\"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\". Released on 10 August 2023, she is the 38th hero added to the game.\nMatch-Ups and Team Synergy.\nWhen encountering enemy heroes, Illari has \"Risk\" ratings, ranging on a scale of 5 levels. This reflects the threat level posed by different Damage and Tank heroes in terms of how vulnerable Illari is to them and how it can be mitigated through Illari's own abilities or through an ally's assistance:\nWhen encountering enemy Supports, Illari has \"Priority Targeting\" ratings on a scale of 5 levels. This reflects the importance of eliminating or disrupting specific Supports: \nSynergies are graded on a scale of 5 levels:\nStory.\nAs the last of the &lt;a href=\"Inti%20Warriors\"&gt;Inti Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, Illari is a vessel for the power of the sun, due to &lt;a href=\"solar%20threading\"&gt;solar threads&lt;/a&gt; woven throughout her body. With the sun's power, she is able to wreak havoc behind enemy lines. Illari is a ruthless vigilante plagued by a dark past: one that she'll do anything to make up for.\nIllari often hums when she's thinking; it is an automatic reflex, one she's unable to stop. She has a tendency to apologize as a side effect of her guilt.\nBackground.\nIllari's childhood was a happy one, but from the outset, she was told she would become an Inti Warrior. While in school, she studied &lt;a href=\"Ana%20Amari\"&gt;Ana Amari&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllari began the demanding Inti Warrior training at an early age. Even then, her potential was enormous; her trainers believed she would become the strongest Warrior of her time. She bowed to the desires of her community, dedicating her free time to training so that one day she might live up to the legend already growing around her. Finally, her hard work and sacrifices paid off. She became the youngest person to join the Inti Warriors.\nPer tradition, Illari was subjected to &lt;a href=\"solar%20threading\"&gt;solar threading&lt;/a&gt; augmentation. The Inti Warriors gathered at the ceremonial chamber, ready to welcome her with open arms. However, no one could have been prepared for the true extent of her power. Her procedure unleashed a devastating amount of solar energy from her body, causing a blast that destroyed the entire chamber. The Inti Warriors were gone, and so was the future Illari had spent her life preparing for.\nUnable to face anyone after the tragedy, Illari isolated herself, refusing anyone's sympathy. She replayed the accident over and over in her head, unable to help but wonder whether things could have been different if she'd never been pressured to strive for greatness. She wondered if it was her fault that no-one knew the true extent of her power. Whatever the truth was, she blamed herself regardless.\nWith no other clear path to follow, Illari continued her daily training despite having no one to guide her, determined to make up for what she'd done. Over time, it became clear that she was the last Inti Warrior, and had to face the world alone.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nEarly Development.\nThe starting point for Illari was the developers' desire to have a sun-themed hero. These themes inspired her early abilities as well as her internal codename, \"Solar.\" One of the earliest prototypes the developers played around with was a blinding ability, matching the sun-theme. Solar would throw a grenade-like stun orb, which would explode and blind enemies within its AOE. The team experimented with the physics of this ability and how it would affect enemies. After a few changes, the team added VFX of Solar jumping into the air and throwing the blind down onto her enemies. In the end, the developers moved away from a blind ability because of the somewhat hidden effectiveness and frustration caused when played against. Solar didn\u2019t feel a noticeable impact using blind, but the person getting blinded felt too much of an impact. A full-screen blind was decided to be too much in the context of \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\", given its nature of fast-paced gameplay.\nThe mobility of Solar leaping into the air felt symbolic to a sunrise, and was integrated into the Captive Sun ultimate. The ability went through a number of iterations; one of the first ideas involved a debuff called \"solar flares\" against up to five enemies. The flares would damage enemies, reveal their location, and increase their damage taken. While this ultimate was \"cool\" to play with, it wasn\u2019t enjoyable to play against. The debuff paired with the damage was a little too much, and the chaotic nature of the ultimate was frustrating to play against. Another iteration riffed off solar flares, but the debuff was only applied to enemies within an area of effect, rather than targeting them automatically. The area would also heal allies. Many versions of her ultimate increased the amount of damage she dealt, but the developers felt those would better suit damage heroes. While the developers wanted to encourage Solar players to support their team by enabling and finishing off opponents, some of the early ideas were doing too much damage for a support class. In the final version, Captive Sun's status effect keeps the ultimate ability attack oriented, while also encouraging team play to get as many detonations as possible.\nSolar's healing capabilities went through a lot of ideations and prototypes. One of the first ideas was an ability that created pockets of healing with a deployable drone\u2014she would throw a drone-grenade to allies, and the drone would hover over them to heal. Pocket healing went through a lot of tweaks and adjustments. For example, one version provided more healing to lower-HP allies but was limited in mobility. Another provided a burst heal within the first second to give allies a little more flexibility regarding their placement. There was also an iteration where the drones would automatically track allies.\nThis type of healing mechanic required a ton of management and attention, and the developers wanted something more strategic that allowed Solar to focus more of her time using the solar rifle. The turrets of &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Symmetra\"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt; were looked at, where during development, Symmetra had a healing turret ability which had problems, though players enjoyed the concept. This was turned into the solar rifle having a healing function as its primary fire. Its alt fire was initially a burst heal that could pierce allies (similar to &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"railgun\"&gt;railgun&lt;/a&gt;), albeit with a hefty cooldown. This was changed to a single-target shot with a shorter cooldown, as the developers wanted a simple secondary fire to encourage players to support through damage. The rifle's current secondary was settled upon.\nAs Solar's abilities were constantly iterated upon, this influenced her theme and personality. Eventually, \"Solar\" was renamed as \"Illari.\"\nReveals.\nIllari was hinted at in May, 2023, where it was revealed that she would debut in Season 6. It was stated that Illari be fully revealed before the season's launch. An image of Illari (Illari Quispe Ruiz) was revealed in June, 2023. At the time, many speculated that she was Peruvian, and the blade she carried was noted to possess similarities to Incan swords. It was further speculated that the hero's name was \"Luzdesol\" (Spanish for \"sunlight\"), based on the appearance of the name in a livestream for \"\". After the silouette was released, a fan-made concept piece was released, and the developers were surprised as to how close the artwork was to the hero's final version. In recognition of the work, an official piece of concept art was released in July, 2023, showing Illari undergoing a \"solar threading ritual.\" \nIllari was leaked in early August when an image of her was revealed on the Xbox \"Overwatch\" website. She was formally named/revealed on August 8."}

At the time, her focus was on biogenic chemical textile engineering, using genetically modified Darwin's bark spiders hybridized across species with common limpets to produce thread that was elastic, strong, fire-retardant, and resistant to electrical and acid damage. However, the thread cost several thousand dollars per ounce, and none of her research subjects lived beyond a year. She was on the verge of retiring from her research path when she met Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm, who saw several practical applications for even small amounts of her fiber (such as advanced circuitry).\nIngrid finished her degree but declined to pursue further work in her field, having found no funding. However, she continued her association with Torbj\u00f6rn, whom she found charming, intelligent, and a passionate conversationalist. They later married, and had several children. \nOmnic Crisis.\nAfter the start of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Torbj\u00f6rn was outside &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; working to complete the &lt;a href=\"Luftf%C3%B6rsvarsn%C3%A4tverket\"&gt;Luftf\u00f6rsvarsn\u00e4tverket&lt;/a&gt;. Ingrid gave him his blessing to stay at his post. Torbj\u00f6rn agreed to return home when Sweden was truly safe. After the installation of the network, he returned to Gothenburg to briefly see Ingrid and his children, but after several days, enlisted in &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;. \nIngrid and her children survived the &lt;a href=\"Bombardment%20of%20Gothenburg\"&gt;Bombardment of Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverwatch.\nWhile never a member of Overwatch herself, Ingrid played an indirect role through her scientific expertise, and her closeness with many of the organization's agents. \nLove and War.\nIngrid was many months pregnant with Brigitte when &lt;a href=\"Operation%20White%20Dome\"&gt;Operation White Dome&lt;/a&gt; occurred. She heard how her husband lost his arm in the battle. He later wrote to her, saying that he was quite alright, and that he would create a prosthetic to replace his missing arm. He added that young family friend &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Ziegler\"&gt;Angela Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; was able to visit him. He told her that he had told &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt; (who had saved his life in the battle) that he could become godfather to their daughter, that he could name her, and that Ingrid would have to agree to it. He hoped that she'd be alright with this and apologized for not consulting her first. As Ingrid had not yet gone into labor, he hoped that he could return home in time to see the birth of their child.\nAt some point after Brigitte's birth, Ingrid and the rest of her family visited &lt;a href=\"Ilios\"&gt;Ilios&lt;/a&gt;.\nReflections.\nIn the Christmas following the recall order of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, Ingrid spent time with her family and Reinhardt."}

The overwhelming robotic armies of the rogue &lt;a href=\"God%20program\"&gt;God Program&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;\" were more than any one nation could face. Some held out against invasion by creating unique task forces, such as &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Crusaders\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; initiative and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Soldier%20Enhancement%20Program\"&gt;soldier enhancement program&lt;/a&gt;. As the war continued and humanity struggled to survive, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; began to discuss a more global solution.\nTHE WORLD COULD ALWAYS USE MORE HEROES&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; was created to be a global task force with one singular goal: save the world from the &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; threat. The United Nations pulled together a group of soldiers, scientists, adventurers, and oddities--the best every nation in the world had to offer. These heroes were tasked with waging asymmetrical war against Anubis' relentless army. Overwatch led the global counterattack against the omnics, and with the world at their side, the Omnic Crisis eventually came to an end. Celebrated as saviors, Overwatch enjoyed a meteoric rise in power, prominence, and funding, and their research led to an era of countless technological and medical advancements.\nTHE END OF OVERWATCH&lt;br&gt;Though Overwatch outlasted the war and brought hope and liberty to many nations, years of controversy and allegations of corruption tarnished Overwatch's bright legacy. After a series of high-profile mission failures, charges of corruption and political meddling, and the discovery of the infamous covert-op division &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt;, the world turned against Overwatch. A series of hearings and devastating testimonials by former agents precipitated the end of an era. The U.N. made the decision to disband Overwatch, and former agents were &lt;a href=\"Petras%20Act\"&gt;forbidden&lt;/a&gt; from any unsanctioned \"peacekeeping\" activities.\nNull Sector: Militant Organization.\nNull Sector Faction Overview.\nExcerpt from an opinion piece: \"Another Crisis is on Our Doorstep\"\nTheir leaders are anonymous. Their motives seem clear, yet they move in the shadows. What is the greater mission of the organization known as \"&lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;\"? Though they claim their membership spans the globe, and they have eyes on all injustice perpetrated against their kind, none have stood up to reveal themselves. Advancing the fight for \"&lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; rights\" is a clear call to action, but not just for omnics. Humanity barely survived the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and since, we have given the minds behind Null Sector every reason to strike us from the face of the Earth.\nTranscribed from a Null Sector Propaganda Message prior to the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row%23Uprising\"&gt;Uprising&lt;/a&gt;: \"Our name represents who we are. We have no home, and should our cause prevail, we will have no masters.\"\ufeff\nUPRISING&lt;br\u00bbExcerpt from the book \"\"\nFollowing the Omnic Crisis, the task of rebuilding the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; fell largely on the backs of the newly sentient omnic population. Though these omnic laborers performed many menial and dangerous tasks, the UK government denied them basic rights and citizenship. This unfair treatment drove many omnics to seek support elsewhere. Null Sector seized this opportunity to recruit new followers, making promises of freedom from a life of human exploitation.\nTheir ideology spread like wildfire, creating further unrest in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, and culminated in a violent attack in &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Row\"&gt;King's Row&lt;/a&gt;. Null Sector invaded the streets with a legion of mindless drones, not unlike the units created to wage war during the Omnic Crisis before the &lt;a href=\"Awakening\"&gt;Awakening&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo this day, it is still unclear why more omnics didn't take part in the attack on King's Row. Only &lt;a href=\"Lanet\"&gt;one member&lt;/a&gt; of Null Sector, an unidentified omnic, was killed in the fighting. Where were Null Sector's fiercest fighters? Why did they choose to abandon the omnics of London?\ufeff\nOMNIC SUBJUGATION DURING THE NULL SECTOR INVASION&lt;br\u00bbExcerpt from an article: \"Null Sector Attacking Omnics\"\n...during their global attacks on major population centers, Null Sector robots have specifically hunted omnics, clamping a &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;device&lt;/a&gt; onto their head, and rendering them catatonic. With this fact in mind, we can speak with certainty: Null Sector's primary goal is no longer focused on ensuring the freedom of omnics.\nTalon: Criminal Organization.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Talon\"&gt;Talon&lt;/a&gt;\"\nTalon.\n\"Our future will be forged in conflict.\"&lt;br&gt;A secretive worldwide army of mercenaries, amoral scientists, spies, and assassins led by &lt;a href=\"Akande%20Ogundimu\"&gt;Akande Ogundimu&lt;/a&gt; (known now to the world as Doomfist). In &lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;'s absence, their power and influence has spread unchecked through the nations of the world.\nTheir goals remain a mystery.\nVishkar: Multinational Corporation.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Vishkar%20Corporation\"&gt;Vishkar Corporation&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVishkar Corporation.\n\"The future is here.\"&lt;br&gt;A multinational corporation infamous for its mastery - and ruthless protection - of its proprietary &lt;a href=\"hard-light\"&gt;hard-light&lt;/a&gt; technology used to rebuild many nations after the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Though they have largely been driven out of &lt;a href=\"Rio\"&gt;Rio&lt;/a&gt;, they maintain a domineering presence in many cities around the globe.\nThe Shambali: Monastic Order.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Shambali\"&gt;Shambali&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe Shambali Monks.\nDwelling in the &lt;a href=\"Shambali%20Monastery\"&gt;Shambali Monastery&lt;/a&gt; high in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, these &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; monks study the mysteries of the Iris and teach peaceful coexistence between omnics and humans.\nAurora.\nThe first sentient omnic, created by &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Liao\"&gt;Doctor Mina Liao&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;, Liao and &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; devised a way to grant sentience to the rest of the omnics on the planet - at the cost of Aurora's life - in the hopes of bringing an end to the devasting &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis sacrifice broke &lt;a href=\"Anubis\"&gt;Anubis&lt;/a&gt;'s control over the omnics fighting humanity, essentially ending the Crisis. But when Aurora died, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Iris\"&gt;Iris&lt;/a&gt; - an inexplicable glowing aura at the heart of the Shambali Monastery - was born.\nThe Iris.\nThe Iris's very existence is a mystery that defies description. It came into being at the exact moment of the &lt;a href=\"Awakening\"&gt;Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, the event that gave omnics sentience.\nThe Shambali believe it connects all living things, but even that may be an oversimplification.\nTekhartha Mondatta.\n&lt;a href=\"Mondatta\"&gt;Mondatta&lt;/a&gt; was a leader of the omnic monks at the Shambali Monastery. He championed peaceful coexistence between omnics and humans and attended countless outreach events before he was assassinated a few years before the return of &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;killer&lt;/a&gt; has never been brought to justice.\nTekhartha Zenyatta.\n&lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt; was brought to the Shambali Monastery by the omnic known as &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;Ramattra&lt;/a&gt;. There, studying under Mondatta and spending countless hours discussing the dangers facing their people, the two became as close as brothers.\nSome years after Ramattra left the monastery, Zenyatta did as well, traveling to nearby &lt;a href=\"Suravasa\"&gt;Suravasa&lt;/a&gt; to work closer to humanity. There, he met &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji Shimada&lt;/a&gt;, and slowly helped the young man find the peace he so desperately sought.\nRamattra.\nMade by the rogue god program Anubis, Ramattra was among many &lt;a href=\"R-7000%20Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt; units designed to lead omnics into war. Once granted sentience by event known as the Awakening, he was tormented by his role in the Crisis and struggled with the concept of sentience as a \"gift\". He buried his guilt and anger deep, striving to understand and follow Mondatta's teachings, hoping to suppress the darkness within him.\nAs a monk, Ramattra went out into the world to promote the Shambali monks' message of peace between omnics and humans. During one of these pilgrimages, he found the omnic Zenyatta and returned with him - after a dangerous journey - to the Shambali Monastery. There, the two studied under Mondatta, and became close.\nOver time, Ramattra became frustrated with the restrictive teaching of the Shambali, believing they weren't doing enough to protect omnics around the world. He left the monastery... and his brother, Zenyatta.\nIronclad Guild: Research Group.\nIronclad Guild.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, leading engineers across Europe founded the &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Guild\"&gt;Ironclad Guild&lt;/a&gt; with a strictly altruistic mission: crafting inventions to improve the world, then making those inventions available to everyone - without restrictive patents.\nThough the Guild saved many lives during the Crisis, some of their technological advancements-like the massive skyscraper-building robot known as the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; - were repurposed as weapons by Anubis, prompting a fair amount of soul-searching after the war.\nMiscellaneous.\n\"The lesser-known people and groups who populate the world of Overwatch.\"\nClaire Hopper.\n&lt;a href=\"Claire%20Hopper\"&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt;'s first year in war-damaged &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; was not an easy one. As one of &lt;a href=\"Wilcox%20Engineering\"&gt;Wilcox Engineering&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"omnic\"&gt;omnic&lt;/a&gt; laborers, Claire sheltered in the very subway tunnels she was helping rebuild, hiding from the angry mobs of humans above.\nAs Toronto healed from the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and sentiment towards omnics changed, Claire sought employment with the city. When Mayor &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt; discovered Claire's aptitude for programming, engineering, and automation, she hired the omnic on the spot.\nToday, Toronto boasts one of the largest and most efficient automated transit systems in the world, and Claire Hopper is enormously proud to have been part of that achievement."}

In &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio&lt;/a&gt; we recruited a very promising young agent &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BAcio\"&gt;L\u00facio&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=\"Cassidy\"&gt;Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; is back, having brought several impressive warriors with him, including &lt;a href=\"Ana\"&gt;Ana&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter &lt;a href=\"Pharah\"&gt;Fareeha&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Zarya\"&gt;power-lifter&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Baptiste\"&gt;man with moon shoes&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href=\"D.Va\"&gt;MEKA pilot&lt;/a&gt; who is famous for fighting the &lt;a href=\"Gwishin\"&gt;Gwishin&lt;/a&gt;!\nIt is clear that these youngsters look up to me. Ach, I don't blame them-I have fought in so many battles over the years, I can hardly remember then all! But if I pass along one thing, I hope it will be to trust themselves. They are the future, and I am just an old man, albeit one who is still very strong and handsome!\nNa ja... anyway I expect the rest of the battles to go similarly to Rio. We will defeat in no time, as we did in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, and soon a new Overwatch will take shape. And this one will be even better than the old one! We are building this new Overwatch with three very important things: Bravery, wisdom, and friendship!\nSigned,\nReinhardt Wilhelm\nPost-Toronto Journal.\nThings are much worse than I thought. Null Sector is putting helmets on omnics, and these helmets cannot be taken off, even if you are very strong (I tried). Whoever is behind this is truly evil and must be stopped.\nIt is good that we reached &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;Vivian&lt;/a&gt; when we did. She was in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; fighting on her own, as if looking to make a foolish sacrifice! It is worrisome... this sort of behaviour is not like her. I wonder if the past few years have been as difficult for her as they have been for me. I think people like us need a purpose or we start to go a little verr\u00fcckt.\nAnyway she is on the team now and I am off to &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; to visit my old friend &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;. If anyone can unpuzzle these helmets, it is him, as much as I hate to admit it. (His head has only grown larger as he ages! Unlike me. I have discovered the value of humanity.) Once he has devised a means of removing these helmets to save the omnics within, I am certain that Torbj\u00f6rn will rejoin Overwatch and help us train the next generation of heroes!\nTo those who say there is no hope... Doch! There is always hope! We will stop Null Sector and save the world, like we always do.\nHappily reunited with several old friends,\nReinhardt Wilhelm\nPost-Gothenburg Journal.\nIt was good to see Torbj\u00f6rn again. He is as short and temperamental as ever, and has been keeping busy building all manner of wild contraptions. Some of which even came in handy on this mission, though it pains me to admit it!\nHowever, though we saved Gothenburg, there is sad news as well. Torbj\u00f6rn declined to rejoin Overwatch. Na Ja... at first I was disappointed. But I shouldn't have been surprised. He has so much going on with those wonderful grandchildren! (Speaking of Torbj\u00f6rn's vastly more talented offspring, I have recieved &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A4rta%27s\"&gt;M\u00e4rta's&lt;/a&gt; latest, &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Empire%20of%20Dawnfire\"&gt;Dawn of the Empire of Dawnfire&lt;/a&gt;. I am on Chapter Three already. If you've read that far-can you believe that Dirk Bloodtithe forsook his vampire powers to save Anjabelle from the mermaid coven? Because I certainly cannot!)\nSo, ja, Torbj\u00f6rn will not be joining us. I am focusing on the positives. It is time for a new generation of Overwatch &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt;! And anyway there is plenty of wisdom on the team between Sojourn and &lt;a href=\"Mercy\"&gt;Angela&lt;/a&gt; and-I almost said \"Cassidy,\" haha! And of course myself as well. We will teach these youngsters \"was ist was!\" And save the world in the process!\nYours most determinedly,\nReinhardt Wilhelm\nWinston.\nBio.\nFull Name: Winston\nCitizenship: N/A\nAffiliation(s): &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;\nWinston was a test animal as a child for gene therapy experiments on &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20Lunar%20Colony\"&gt;Horizon Lunar Colony&lt;/a&gt;, funded and established by &lt;a href=\"Lucheng%20Interstellar\"&gt;Lucheng Interstellar&lt;/a&gt; and [ENCRYPTED].

While fighting their way through Rio's streets to the gargantuan &lt;a href=\"Command%20ship\"&gt;carrier ship&lt;/a&gt; hanging over the city, they faced deadly new war machines and discovered strange, powerful technology. Null Sector, previously a small omnic resistance group last seen in London, had gained access to troubling amounts of resources and weaponry.\nThe team destroyed Null Sector's carrier and saved Rio. With the rest of the world still under attack by Null Sector, L\u00facio returned with the team to , where five more heroes joined up: Baptiste, Cassidy, D.Va, Pharah, and Zarya.

The team adjusted on the fly, with L\u00facio guiding us through the streets of Rio. He fit in perfectly with the team; I couldn't have been happier to welcome him into our ranks! Not to mention that Cassidy is back now too, and brought some new recruits with him as well!\nThey are sorely needed. To think that Null Sector is attacking cities like this all over the world! We aren't going to beat them by going from town to town. We have to fight smarter, find their weak spots. How did they get so powerful? Where did they get all this technology?\nThat strange power relay comes to mind. I haven't yet uncovered where they draw their energy from. I have a feeling that the answer to that puzzle will point us to the culprit behind these attacks, all the same. I have to believe that!\nBut... the team doesn't need to see me worrying. And Cassidy's right: we still need &lt;a href=\"Sojourn\"&gt;one more person&lt;/a&gt; to make this team the most effective it can be.\nI just hope we can get to her in time.\nLiberation.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Liberation\"&gt;Liberation&lt;/a&gt;\"\nToronto: Briefing.\nMISSION OBJECTIVE: Locate and assist former &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28group%29\"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; Agent [ENCRYPTED].\nThe \"new Overwatch\" lacks the personnel and resources that the organization had in its prime. A superior tactician will be required to help this team address the &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; threat.\nMission Objectives are to locate callsign [ENCRYPTED] within the borders of Null-Sector-occupied &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; and secure their further assistance.\n\"I get it, okay? &lt;a href=\"Wilcox%20Engineering\"&gt;Wilcox Engineering&lt;/a&gt; hired &lt;a href=\"Omnic\"&gt;omnics&lt;/a&gt; behind the city council's back, but they also pulled Toronto out of the wreckage of the &lt;a href=\"Omnic%20Crisis\"&gt;Omnic Crisis&lt;/a&gt; during one of the worst winters we ever had. They did more than save your jobs. They saved your city. They saved lives!\nBut like I said, I get it. I made all you bigots on the city council look like fools. I understand why you want me gone. But you know what? \nToronto will want me back come winter.\"\n- &lt;a href=\"Malik%20Wilcox\"&gt;Malik Wilcox&lt;/a&gt;, at his sentencing.\nToronto: Mission Success.\nOBJECTIVES\nADDITIONAL INSIGHTS\nSUMMARY&lt;br&gt;In Toronto, Overwatch reunited with former Overwatch agent Vivian Chase (AKA \"Sojourn\"). After protecting the last ferry of civilians fleeing the city, the team encountered a broadcast from the &lt;a href=\"Ramattra\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; of Null Sector, promising to liberate omnics.\nSearching for remaining civilians in the city, Sojourn and the others found an omnic transit worker named &lt;a href=\"Claire%20Hopper\"&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt;, who promised to lead them to other omnics who had been captured by Null Sector. While following her through the subway tunnels, the team witnessed their first subjugation when a floating Null Sector machine captured a lone omnic and clamped a helmet over his head, rendering him catatonic before Overwatch could save him.\nThe team's luck did not improve. By the time Overwatch reached Claire's fellow survivors, the only conscious omnic was a lawyer named &lt;a href=\"Reggie%20Buckworth\"&gt;Reggie&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone else had been subjugated as well.\nWith Toronto conquered by Null Sector, Overwatch resolved to escape the city with Claire and Reggie in tow. After returning to , the team plotted their next moves. &lt;a href=\"Genji\"&gt;Genji&lt;/a&gt;, noticing that the mysterious leader of Null Sector had mentioned the Iris, thought of speaking with his former master, the omnic monk &lt;a href=\"Zenyatta\"&gt;Zenyatta&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=\"Brigitte\"&gt;Brigitte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to learn more about the subjugation helmets, discussed visiting the former chief engineer of Overwatch: &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn Lindholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nNOTES&lt;br\u00bbSubmitted by: Sojourn&lt;br&gt;Can't say I ever expected to be writing a debrief report again.\nFirst order of business after I get some rest: go through my eyecam footage from the last six hours. I want a closer look at those subjugators: what they're doing, how they move, every last detail.\nI'm not sure how Null Sector kept the subjugators off my radar during all those days of fighting and that's bad news; whoever's behind this attack knows how to hide and protect their assets. They have goals, and we don't know 'em yet.\nI don't have much to go on yet. Note to self, get &lt;a href=\"Winston\"&gt;Winston&lt;/a&gt; to review old Null Sector reports with me - might be something there. Until then, we're in gut territory. I hate gut territory, but here goes:\nNull Sector was an organization founded to protect omnics from humanity. They wouldn't be attacking the world to hurt omnics. Even the subjugation, nightmarish as it is, must be part of some larger goal.\nI hope that's not wishful thinking. I don't want to believe that Null Sector has become just one more group preying on omnics.\nMaybe it'll all make sense after I get about twenty minutes of sleep.\n- V\nIronclad.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Ironclad (mission)&lt;/a&gt;\"\nGothenburg: Briefing.\nMISSION OBJECTIVE: Bring the &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;subjugated&lt;/a&gt; omnic to &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn\"&gt;Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe need insight on the technology &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; is using to subjugate &lt;a href=\"Omnic\"&gt;omnics&lt;/a&gt;.

Don't tell him I said that.\" - &lt;a href=\"Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;\nGothenburg: Mission Success.\nOBJECTIVES\nADDITIONAL INSIGHTS\nSUMMARY&lt;br&gt;Reunited with his daughter Brigitte and friend Reinhardt, Torbj\u00f6rn introduced an unusual houseguest: the former war machine Bastion. Before the four of them could discuss the ongoing subjugation of omnics worldwide, Null Sector attacked Gothenburg, forcing the four heroes to activate the city's defense grid.\nTorbj\u00f6rn's weaponry critically damaged Null Sector's carrier, but not before it launched a massive Titan unit, intent on leveling Torbj\u00f6rn's workshop. Just in time, the four heroes assembled and fired Torbj\u00f6rn's mighty Mega-Cannon, destroying the Titan.\nAfter the battle, Torbj\u00f6rn stayed behind to continue his research on the subjugated omnic, but invited Reinhardt and Brigitte to take Bastion back to Watchpoint: Gibraltar.\nNOTES&lt;br\u00bbSubmitted by: Torbj\u00f6rn&lt;br&gt;Hmm. Less beeping, booping, and shouting should mean it's easier to concentrate, but here I am two hours after they've left, wishing it was a little less quiet around here.\nAh well.

We're running a tour of the Underworld, too. That way everyone gets a chance to see how things are when we're a little less under attack. We may have been through some tough times, but there's a lot to love about our little corner of London! I'm hoping we can bring together the neighborhood and get people working together to clean up after Null Sector. We'd have been wrecked without you here, but they still made a right mess of things.\n\"Let me know if you plan to stop by. Everyone would love to meet the saviors of the Underworld!

The payload stops at each turret, and players must defend them from waves of enemy &lt;a href=\"Null%20Sector\"&gt;Null Sector&lt;/a&gt; units while Torbj\u00f6rn activates them. While defending the final turret, a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; is deployed by the command ship, which destroys it. \nPlayers then head back to Torbj\u00f6rn's workshop to activate his Mega-Cannon, placing down modified &lt;a href=\"Torbj%C3%B6rn%23Deploy%20Turret\"&gt;turrets&lt;/a&gt; to fend off waves of enemy units. There are two types of turrets, freezing and knockback, which cause the respective &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; to targeted enemy units. The player that selected Torbj\u00f6rn can repair these turrets with his hammer. \nThe mission is completed once all enemy units are eliminated, and the Titan is destroyed by Torbj\u00f6rn's mega-cannon.

He was known for creating lifelike automatons that the lord was never impressed with, considering them as nothing more than slaves. Upset at this disrespect, Junkenstein intended to prove himself by creating a creature that was truly self aware. His attempts ended in failure, but before he was to give up the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20the%20Wilds\"&gt;Witch of the Wilds&lt;/a&gt; and her servant, &lt;a href=\"The%20Reaper\"&gt;The Reaper&lt;/a&gt; appeared to him with an offer. She offered him the Spark of Life in return for a favor that she will ask of him someday in the future. The doctor agreed, and with the Spark of Life he succeeded in bringing his creation to life. The doctor allowed &lt;a href=\"Junkenstein%27s%20Monster\"&gt;his monster&lt;/a&gt; to ravage the town as revenge against the people there who scorned him.\nWith his army of mindless &lt;a href=\"Zomnic\"&gt;Zomnic&lt;/a&gt;s, Junkenstein attempted to take over the castle Adlersbrunn, but four wanderers from distant lands came to stop him. They succeeded in defeating the mad doctor's army and ultimately killed him, bringing peace to the village. As he still had a debt to repay, the Witch revived Junkenstein, and he wasted no time building a new army more terrible than before. Helpless, the Lord of Adlersbrunn summoned four more champions from lands afar to bring an end to Junkenstein's seemingly endless rampage."}

He also got into \"EverQuest\" during this time period. He did not play Blizzard games during this period, as the company was more focused on RTS games during this time.\nKaplan joined &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; in May, 2002. He worked as a tester for \"Warcraft III\" as the game neared release. After the game released, he was transferred to work on \"World of Warcraft\". Kaplan has commented that the shift from RTS to MMO was a \"natural fit\" for his gaming preferences. He worked on quests for the game, and later served as the game director. \nKaplan worked for five years on \"&lt;a href=\"Project%20Titan\"&gt;Project Titan&lt;/a&gt;\" before the game's cancellation. In the aftermath, he did work on \"Crossroads\", pitching the 50 classes idea. On the side, he did a \"heroes rather than classes\" pitch, which became the basis of \"Overwatch\". \nHe was a \"stakeholder\" in the game's animated shorts, and gave feedback on their production.\nAfter the release of \"Overwatch\", Kaplan and &lt;a href=\"Chacko%20Sonny\"&gt;Chacko Sonny&lt;/a&gt; were at loggerheads with Robert Kotick of Activision over further development of the IP. &lt;a href=\"Team%204\"&gt;Team 4&lt;/a&gt; had to simultaniously develop content for \"Overwatch\", develop \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch%202\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\" (which was a project dear to Kaplan), and help work on the ever-growing &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20League\"&gt;Overwatch League&lt;/a&gt;. Kotick suggested that Team 4 simply hire more people (hundreds even), akin to Activision's \"Call of Duty\" development teams. He also suggested that a new team worked on \"Overwatch 2\" while Team 4 continued to work on \"Overwatch 1\" (or vice versa). In contrast, Kaplan and Sonny believed strongly in the culture they'd built at Team 4, not to mention that more people could lead to more problems and less efficient development. The contention between Kaplan/Sonny and Kotick led to various problems as the years wore on. \nKaplan worked on \"Overwatch 2\", and wanted to make it focused on PvE. Kaplan's departure from Blizzard was announced in April, 2021. &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Keller\"&gt;Aaron Keller&lt;/a&gt; took his position of game director."}
