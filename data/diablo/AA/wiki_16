After that, you must help Rumford fight off an onslaught of more Risen Dead that rise from the ground to attack the gates. Once both waves of the Risen Dead have been re-killed, Rumford will direct you to the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Calf%20Inn\"&gt;Slaughtered Calf Inn&lt;/a&gt;, where you will find Leah.\nThe Slaughtered Calf Inn.\nEnter New Tristram and head for the Slaughtered Calf Inn.

Talk to her, and she will tell you that she survived the fallen star, but that it blasted her uncle &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; into the depths of the old cathedral, and that she wanted to search for him but the dead were already rising. You will then have to kill the survivors, who turn into more Risen Dead. After killing the Risen, speak to her again, and she will direct you back to Captain Rumford at the gate.\nThe Wretched Mothers.\nHead back to the gate and talk to Captain Rumford. He will tell you to strike at the &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Mother\"&gt;Wretched Mother&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Queen\"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt;, who are vomiting out the Risen Dead that are attacking the town. You will have to help Rumford fight off another assault upon the barricade to the north, until one of the Wretched Mothers falls. He will then direct you to kill more of them in the ruins down the road. Head down the road and kill every Risen Dead, &lt;a href=\"Quill%20Fiend\"&gt;Quill Fiend&lt;/a&gt; and Wretched Mother you find until you reach the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tristram\"&gt;Old Tristram&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld Tristram.\nUpon reaching Old Tristram, continue killing Risen Dead and Quill Fiends until you find the &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Queen\"&gt;Wretched Queen&lt;/a&gt;, the first elite monster you are likely to face in the game.

Once the Wretched Queen is dead, activate your first &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;Waypoint&lt;/a&gt; located to the upper right of the map near the gates in order to return to New Tristram.\nOnce you make it back to town, speak with Captain Rumford. He will tell you to talk some sense into Leah, who won't give up the idea of rescuing her uncle. Your character will tell him that she shouldn't and that they will help her find him. This will end the quest. Speak to Leah to begin the next quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Legacy%20of%20Cain\"&gt;The Legacy of Cain&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, who has been showing up in disguise every now and then, informs Siggard that his suspicions were correct; Siggard is one of a rare breed, who has so much vitality death cannot touch him. After an epilogue that has Siggard walking off into the sunset in search of the next battle, his sword Guthbreoht (forged by the legendary Velund the Smith) at his side, the e-book ends.\nFollowups.\nThe Fate of Siggard was to be followed up by a second e-book continuation. Below is a synopsis:\nSiggard is drinking some mead. Tyrael steps over to him, and informs him that somehow, somebody has discovered the name of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Terror%2C\"&gt;Lord of Terror,&lt;/a&gt; meaning that one of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; can now be summoned to the mortal realm. Siggard tracks down an evil wizard and confronts him in his tower, but he is too late. Diablo has been summoned. The Lord of Terror tempts Siggard with the idea of restoring his family (killed by Assur a few centuries past in \"Demonsbane\"), and suggests that the angels have been lying to mankind all along; the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt; was never a conflict between good and evil. At the last minute Siggard resists the temptation, slays the evil wizard, and sends Diablo back to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrael appears and states that it is just the beginning, but Siggard will have nothing of it.

Within the rift, one can see a gigantic &lt;a href=\"angelic\"&gt;angelic&lt;/a&gt; siege weapon (similar to those broken and scattered around). However, instead of golden light, it has a dark red glow at its core.\nAt the stairs down to the platform in the south, two angelic scouts will welcome the Nephalem and ask to assist in a purification ritual. They theorize that purifying the Great Weapon from the evil that corrupts it will allow the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; to use this weapon again, this time against &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;.\nStarting the ritual will cause hordes of ghostly &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; to spawn: &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Warscarred%20Marauder\"&gt;Warscarred Marauder&lt;/a&gt;s. Players must kill them all: the progress bar fills based on the amount of demons killed, not time elapsed. Every 20 seconds, the weapon will release a darkfire blast towards everything on the platform which inflicts damage equal to \"half\" of a creature's &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring most defenses. The only way to avoid this damage is to stand behind the scouts - the angels will yell for the Nephalem to come closer to them so that they can protect them. One can visually see the weapon charging up with a bright red glow, as well as angels shifting from channeling beams to holding shields.\nWhen the bar is filled, the &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kurekas\"&gt;Kurekas&lt;/a&gt; spawns, and must be killed to end the event. During this fight, the weapon will continue to fire on &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, but will not damage the demon lord.\nIn the end, the angels will say that the Great Weapon is regrettably useless now due to Kurekas's corruption, but can do no more harm. The device itself will return to its original color and stand idle within the fissure. Upon completion of the event, &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Weapon\"&gt;The Great Weapon&lt;/a&gt; lore book will also be added to the player's journal."}

The woman, who presents herself as &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, an apprentice &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, whose master was also killed by the demons, says that she can help the Barbarian on his quest. She tells him of an ancient artifact of great power, the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Naz\"&gt;Hand of Naz&lt;/a&gt;. With it, Renit can raise a spectral army with which he can reach his goal, destroying the Demon Army. Renit agrees, seeing that vengeance is in his grasp.\nThey soon reach the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20of%20Kanemith\"&gt;Castle of Kanemith&lt;/a&gt;. The artifact they search for is hidden in a secret tomb beneath the castle. The two reach a sarcophagus inside of which a dead king wears the gauntlet. Upon removing the Hand of Naz from the tomb, the tomb shakes and Cairo says that their trespass has activated a curse. A wave of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; rise and attack. The Barbarian leaves Cairo behind to be killed by the monsters.\nWearing the gauntlet, Renit faces the demon army. He's not alone, the spirits of many warriors stand besides him. On his orders the spirits attack, tearing apart the demons. As the battle finishes, the spirit of the king from whom the gauntlet was taken comes towards Renit and kills him. Renit's spirit rises to join those previously enslaved by the Hand of Naz.\nBut the Barbarian awakens to see Cairo standing over him. She had &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt;ed him. The Necromancer lied when she said she was just an apprentice, she is a master, part of the &lt;a href=\"Bright%20Circle\"&gt;Bright Circle&lt;/a&gt;, but she had not lied about her people being slain by demons. This happened when she was just a girl, not recently as she led Renit to believe. Cairo said that she trained for years to exact her revenge. When she learned about the ancient gauntlet she knew that this was her chance. The search led her to Daken-Shar, where she found Renit's people besieged by the demons. She knew that the Hand of Naz could only be worn once, but she didn't know why, so she decided to use Renit as a test subject. She lured him faking distress and took him to the location of the artifact. She had known of the undead guards of the tomb and that the Barbarian would leave her to die to pursue his own goals, but the undead were not a threat to Cairo. She left Renit to accomplish their common goal and for that she brought him back to the land of the living.\nNow that the Necromancer knows what is the price of wearing the gauntlet, she takes her sword, and with its hilt breaks the jewel encrusted into the artifact. This releases all the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s trapped in the gauntlet, but gives her all the knowledge of all those that had ever worn the Hand of Naz. Cairo leaves saying that her and Renit will never meet again."}

{"id": "8675", "revid": "26096179", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8675", "title": "The Hell mod", "text": "The Hell is an unofficial addon/modification for \"\", created by Mordor and The Hell Team.\nThe project was started on April 14, 2006 by Mordor, and the first playable public version was released about a year later. Since then, the game has expanded tremendously, attracting more and more people, not only players, but also people who helped in the creation of the mod.\nOverview.\nThis is the developer's personal testimonial: \"I have always loved this game for its original taste, dark atmosphere, cold steel and blood. By the moment I started creating The Hell, I had been playing Diablo: Hellfire for ten years, and this mod represents all that I ever wanted from this game. This is Diablo's best of the best. Don't be fooled by the simplicity of the game or by its visual similarity to Hellfire. There is more than meets the eye. It's an absolutely new &amp; improved game under the old mask...\nI'll put it bluntly: not all Diablo veterans will be able to beat the game on Doom mode. It is the HARDEST Diablo mod ever!\"\nThe hallmark of The Hell is a very serious approach to development. First and foremost, it has concentrated on eliminating most of the initial bugs that \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Hellfire\" were originally released with. It also raises the challenge considerably, gives much more variety (&lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spellbook\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;boss monsters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"unique%20items\"&gt;unique items&lt;/a&gt;, item\u2014monster &amp; environment colors), improves the overall &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; balance of the game, improves the monster AI, introduces new character animations, increases the replay value, and gives full support for Multiplayer experience through a free program called Hamachi.\nThe developers are also working on The Hell 2, which is a project to rewrite the game code, and thereby make a new program that uses the same game data. Just like what OpenTTD did to transport Tycoon Deluxe, except it will not be GPLed. This will make it a lot easier to make completely new features, like raising the resolution and making IP based multiplayer.\nThe mod alters nearly every mechanic of the game, while (in general) following the similar plotline. Changes include alterations to the &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt;, most (if not all) monsters, items, and &lt;a href=\"Diablo_I_Walkthrough\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;. Random &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;unique boss monsters&lt;/a&gt; will appear on each level, sometimes even several in the same area. The developers have recently expanded the list of base items, loot tables, and drop rates available in the game and look forward to many more making an appearance in future patches. Almost all unique items have been balanced with pros and cons. Authors have removed or updated many &lt;a href=\"Affix\"&gt;prefix/suffix&lt;/a&gt; combos, some of which are even on par with uniques.\nThe core idea is that each level is supposed to be conquered with considerable effort. To succeed, the player(s) will have to clear every corner of every level, squeeze every bit of potential from their gear, use tricks and non-trivial tactics to avoid being cornered in a fight that is otherwise impossible to win.\nOne of the most wanted features for this game that was added was that the &lt;a href=\"Search\"&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; spell is now activated automatically when the Auto-Map is ON. New spell additions include; the Hellfire spell that deals &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; to monsters &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Damage\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, Arcane Nova, Fury, and Shocking Blast, just to name a few. Some spells even inflict &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; now, which is really useful in some situations.\nHundreds of new color palettes were developed for each area of the game. For the first time, you will be able to walk through &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, noon, and dusk. Some items have been recolored, and others completely replaced with new graphics. There are two new graphic add-ons, and additional high quality music as well. \nFeatures.\nSome of the core changes to \"Hellfire\" are:\nThe mod's homepage is quite user friendly; it features five different languages and contains additional downloadable material. There are two new graphics add-ons, additional high quality music and a useful clicker program. The &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Hellfire%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt; from the original Hellfire have become the Assassin and the Gladiator. The Gladiator's animation is completed and it introduces dual wielding graphics to the game, and so does the Assassin's as well. Another new feature of the mod is \"&lt;a href=\"Gillian%23Diablo\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt; the Stasher,\" who provides the player(s) with unlimited &lt;a href=\"Stash\"&gt;storage&lt;/a&gt; of valuable items. A very useful Guide section is also available on the mod's website for the starters. This mod is reportedly much harder than the original game, so it is recommended to consult this guide, and the project's forums too.\nKey features like restriction to Horror difficulty below clvl 30+, and Purgatory difficulty below clvl 40+ characters help in the balance, and to avoid frustrating players. Gear-and-&lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; loss upon &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; has also been removed. The rate at which the characters gain &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; has been fine tuned as well. As this is a mod, you cannot import existing Hellfire characters into The Hell. Starting from scratch is a daunting task, but at the rate of character growth, you will have time to get accustomed to the tactics and the gear necessary to survive.\nOne of the most appealing features of this mod is the ongoing effort to implement all of the original Diablo 1.09 patch fixes into the game, as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment\"&gt;Sierra&lt;/a&gt; forgot to do this. Bug reports and suggestions are of utmost importance in the polishing of this mod. This mod carries on the legacy of some notable Diablo: Hellfire mods from earlier in the game\u2019s history. Although they are not supported anymore and do not have updates, some of their great features and ideas live on in The Hell. Today, this is the only mod still full of life in the world of the original \"Diablo: Hellfire\".\nThis game has a full support for multi-player with the help of a free independent program called Hamachi. Documentation on how to set up and use it is available on the website. Of course, if you want to play with a friend, you can still connect two PCs to each other via a null modem.\nMonsters.\nYou will most likely not be able to beat the game in your first attempt. Instead, you will be required to conquer every area. It is recommended playing all three difficulty levels one by one. Do not start playing on the next difficulty level unless you have finished the previous one, as this will prove way too challenging, if not impossible. Forget all you have learned in previous Diablo/Hellfire mods, this one is different. Horror difficulty is basically the entry level to get you familiar with the tactics necessary to succeed and give you a taste of what is to come. The real experience begins from Purgatory onward. The game is balanced to reach the most fun on 'Doom' mode, so don't quit after beating the game on Horror difficulty, as it was only the beginning. Playing on Doom mode will never be dull or easy, because no matter how high your level is or how good your equipment is, you will always die quickly with a lapse in concentration.\nThis game is extremely hard, do not overestimate yourself as you venture deeper into the labyrinth, some of those monsters are very unforgiving. While single-player allows you to take enemies one by one and reload your game in case of failure, multi-player absolutely requires cooperation. Playing The Hell in multi-player alone will be almost impossible sometimes.\nThere is quite a number of things you should know before starting to play this game. You can check the 'Guide' section on the webpage for this info. If you've got questions, you can ask them on the TH forum. You will find a lot of useful information there. The homepage and documentation of The Hell are very user friendly, and have five languages available on their website, and three in their readme, with plans for other languages as well."}

Wearing the guise of the mysterious Wanderer, Diablo set out to free his brothers, &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, from their imprisonment in the &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Just as before, a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;new band of heroes&lt;/a&gt; arose to put a halt to Diablo's dark quest. Though the Lord of Terror succeeded in freeing his brothers from bondage, their reunion would be short-lived. The mortal heroes managed to vanquish Mephisto and even hunted Diablo into the depths of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;hell&lt;/a&gt;. Only Baal, the Lord of Destruction, was left unaccounted for...\"\n\"Once again, it seemed that justice had been served. Blind as I was, I clung to the path of the rightous\u2014believing that perhaps, finally, all was well...that the nightmare had given way to a dream of peace.\"\n\"But the plague of evil persists, and I...grow weary.\"\n\"For now, the nightmare has started once again.\"\n\"Baal has resurfaced, and behind him marches the vast &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Army of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;. He has gathered a legion of demons that revel in mayhem and wanton chaos\u2014and they are headed right towards us...right towards the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;holy mountain&lt;/a&gt; our ancestors swore to protect. It is obvious that Baal comes to assault Arreat, seeing the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Heart of the World&lt;/a&gt;. And my faith, once unwavering, is now shaken to the very core.\"\n\"The prophecies that spoke of this day have at last come true. Doom has come to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;our world&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"As I have said, my brothers, I grow weary. I have no doubt that Evil exists. I have seen it with my own eyes; I have seen its cruelty. But is it not cruel for the gods to give hope, only to dash that hope again and again?\"\n\"In my youth, I tried as best I could to prepare for such an event. It was, at one time, the very reason for my existence. But now that the moment is at hand, I feel old. I feel afraid. I feel that I have lost my strength.\"\n\"I confess that my faith no longer guides my path. It is with a heavy heart that I take my leave of you, my brothers. I would say that I will pray for you, but I fear my prayers would fall on deaf ears.\"\n\"May you someday find the truth, and may that truth finally give you freedom.\"\n\"Yours in sorrow,\"\n\"Ord Rekar\"\n\"Elder of Harrogath\""}

Abilities that normally cost Fury, but don't consume it due to the &lt;a href=\"Pylons\"&gt;Channeling Pylon&lt;/a&gt;, will still benefit from this set.\nThe Barbarian can store up to 100 stacks of Raekor's Charge, they last infinitely and are only lost if the Barbarian dies (meaning that the Barbarian can teleport to waypoints or enter other levels without losing the stacks). Only one stack is gained per cast, regardless of how many enemies it hits (even if none were hit).\n can benefit from the last bonus as well, but does so in a non-beneficial way: every \"tick\" of it will consume up to 5 stacks, resulting in a very short damage buff."}

By Kulle's estimate, within the month, the Loom would be unrecognizable. However, Ayuzhan refused to give up hope.\nKulle destroyed the device before leaving the Gatehall, and urged Ayuzhan to give up on the project, telling his friend that without him, it would take lifetimes to repair. However, Ayuzhan was possessed by &lt;a href=\"Malphas\"&gt;Malphas&lt;/a&gt; not long afterwards, who used Ayuzhan to do just that."}

Lord Dunhyld appeared with \"each\" urn, but on the first and second, bringing him below 25% &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; despawned him until the next was activated.\nThe earliest version allowed the player to touch the Sarcophagus and complete the event while Lord Dunhyld was still alive (well... \"not destroyed\").

The area itself however is quite small, and not often used for &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Find\"&gt;Magic Find&lt;/a&gt;ing for this reason."}

Opening an incorrect chest does not fail the event, and there are only three chests, so the baseline event rewards and chest loot are always guaranteed. The roll of which chest is correct is completely random, and there is no way to know which is the correct chest, so earning the first-attempt bonus is pure chance. However, when playing in a group, the same chest is correct for all players.\nIn addition to the normal rewards, players should also make sure to loot Gozek the Miser's corpse in the north corner of the hovel, as it is guaranteed to unearth a great deal of gold.\nDevelopment.\nIn the original version of The Miser's Will, only the two incorrect chests spawned \"traps\": an &lt;a href=\"Orbiter\"&gt;Orbiter&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0object for the first trap, and waves of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Vermin\"&gt;Shadow Vermin&lt;/a&gt; (similar to those in the fight with &lt;a href=\"Iskatu\"&gt;Iskatu&lt;/a&gt;) for the second. The correct chest simply dropped the loot and ended the encounter.\nA hotfix during &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.1.0%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.1.0&lt;/a&gt; removed the event from the list of possible &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; because its objectives did not force the players to actually kill any monsters they encountered. This lead to said players building themselves up for movement and survival, rather than actually damaging the minions of Hell.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.0%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.4.0&lt;/a&gt; made this available as a bounty again, and changed the threats to the three waves of monsters of its current form."}

Tyrael bequested upon &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;our Order&lt;/a&gt; three of these Stones so we could contain the vile essences of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Three Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; who had been let loose upon our world. Although the artifacts were constructed in realms far removed from our own, we found that they were simple to understand.\"\n\"The Soulstones effect only beings that are non-corporeal and thus have no power over living, breathing creatures. When invoked, the Soulstones bring into being a strong \u201cspiritual\u201d vacuum. Any non-physical entities caught within this vacuum are drawn into the burning recesses of the Soulstone and are forever trapped within. These spirits are released only when the Soulstone is deactivated or destroyed.\"\n\"The power of the Soulstones proved to be much more difficult to employ when used against the great Prime Evils. Voraciously disposed to possessing hapless mortals, the Three Brothers found that they were immune to the effects of the Stones while occupying human souls. Sadly, we were forced to hunt down and kill the innocent victims of the Prime Evils so that their &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic essences could be subject to the effects of the Soulstones.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, once found, were easily lured into the Soulstones. The capture of their brother &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, however, became complicated when the Soulstone that was to be his eternal prison was shattered and fragmented. We found that while the shards still held the power to lure the demon to them, they could not properly contain it. &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow Initiate who has been since immortalized in Horadrim lore, theorized that a mortal of strong will might be able to contain Baal within his own mortal soul. This sacrifice meant that the essence of any mortal so chosen would be forever tortured while locked in eternal conflict with the enthralled demon. To this end, Tal Rasha volunteered to contain the raging Lord of Destruction.\"\n\"Piercing his breast with a shard of the Soulstone, Tal Rasha took within himself the essence of Baal, the Lord of Destruction. The Initiate's body was shackled, chained and buried deep within a tomb under the desert. The sacrifice of Tal Rasha has kept Baal imprisoned for many years now, and although the demon was imprisoned without the use a whole Soulstone, we believe that our victory may be a hollow one. Should Tal Rasha ever escape, he would have the formidable powers of Baal added to his own. By ridding the world of this present Evil, we may have created a nightmare worse than that which we first sought to contain...\""}

They serve as the main protagonist(s) of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Nephalem is/are one of the most powerful nephalem who have ever lived, their powers only equaled by &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe coming of the Nephalem was prophesized in scripture. It was foretold (correctly) that they would battle a &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;great evil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe End of Days.\nWitnessing a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;falling star&lt;/a&gt;, the Nephalem traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; where they confronted and defeated an &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;awakened evil&lt;/a&gt;.\nTogether with new allies, the Nephalem then moved towards &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, reviving (and defeating) &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, retrieving his &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, and vanquishing &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the Nephalem fought the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Army of Sin&lt;/a&gt;, but after trapping &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the &lt;a href=\"Evils\"&gt;Evils&lt;/a&gt;, in the Soulstone, was betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; walked the earth again.\nPursuing the Lord of Terror, the Nephalem finally defeated him in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, preventing the Prime Evil from destroying the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic civilization and the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;. Recognized by &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; for the feat, the Nephalem left the Heavens and returned to Sanctuary. An unintended consequence of this battle was the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Realms%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Realms of Fate&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, the Nephalem entered the lands east of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; to search for &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;.\nReaper of Souls.\nIn Westmarch, the Nephalem encountered &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; member sent by Tyrael, who told them of the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;' attack on the city. The Nephalem then took the fight to the Reapers and managed to save the remaining survivors in time. Afterwards, the Nephalem entered the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Marsh\"&gt;Blood Marsh&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit of Adria. As the Nephalem passed through, the ruins of the lost city of &lt;a href=\"Corvus\"&gt;Corvus&lt;/a&gt; reacted to the Nephalem's presence, proving that the Nephalem had embraced the birthright due. The Nephalem found Adria and defeated her, avenging Leah.\nAfter a long intense battle, the Nephalem eventually defeated &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, however, feared that one day the Nephalem would be tempted into corruption, and wondered whether the Nephalem, who had defeated the champions of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, could resist it: depending on this, the Nephalem could be mankind's hope, or their doom.\nFurther Adventures.\nNow feared by angels and demons alike, the Nephalem turned attention to the remaining servants of chaos on Sanctuary, protecting those in need.\n\"Note: The following events take place in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;.

He told the shocked hero(es) that not even they could have killed the undying Horadrim, and that he now required their help. The &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; hidden beneath the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Sescheron\"&gt;Ruins of Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; could only be retrieved by someone who its guardians would deem worthy. The Nephalem agreed.\n&lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;, the site of the last stand of civilization, now a mass grave, met the Nephalem with hordes of savage beasts, remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Army of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, and worst of all, &lt;a href=\"The%20Unclean\"&gt;The Unclean&lt;/a&gt;, a cannibal tribe of Barbarians. In this city, the Nephalem rescued &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; himself, and honored memory of &lt;a href=\"King%20Kanai\"&gt;King Kanai&lt;/a&gt;, recovering Kanai's Cube in the process, together with the deranged mage's spirit.\nAs a token of his gratitude, Kulle unlocked the Cube's power, remaining at the Nephalem's side in their journey afterwards.\nGreyhollow Island.\nIn their travels, the Nephalem eventually found the lost &lt;a href=\"Greyhollow%20Island\"&gt;Greyhollow Island&lt;/a&gt; inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Crazed%20Man\"&gt;Crazed Man&lt;/a&gt; alone, but infested with creatures of the cursed forest and &lt;a href=\"Abyssal\"&gt;sea demons&lt;/a&gt; and littered with hundreds of ships that ran aground here over decades. Exploring the island, the Nephalem discovered its true story, the fate of demonic &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nereza\"&gt;Nereza&lt;/a&gt;, and lifted the curse from the hermit.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nThe Nephalem hunted down a group of cultists that recreated &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; as it existed in &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;'s memories. The Nephalem entered a portal and became enmeshed in a simulacrum of the town as it had existed prior to its &lt;a href=\"Tristram%23The%20Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Temple of the Firstborn.\nThe Nephalem entered the &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Moors\"&gt;Shrouded Moors&lt;/a&gt;, where they encountered a man who called himself \"Davlin.\" The two traveled together to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, where Davlin was apparently killed by &lt;a href=\"Theodosius%20Jordan\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the cultists who had taken up residence in the structure. The Nephalem traveled down to the temple's depths, where Davlin was found waiting, alive and well. It was revealed that \"Davlin\" was nothing more than a facade for the demon &lt;a href=\"Vidian\"&gt;Vidian&lt;/a&gt;, who had lured the Nephalem down to die. As they did battle, however, it was Vidian who perished.\nThe Realms of Fate.\nTyrael bid that the Nephalem investigate the &lt;a href=\"Realms%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Realms of Fate&lt;/a&gt;, recognizing the threat that these pockets of reality presented to Sanctuary. By this point, Tyrael still had faith in the skills of the Nephalem, even as he doubted the heart.\nEthereals.\nAs the Nephalem reflected on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s history, instruments of power from a bygone era resurfaced. They were left to decide how to best use these gifts before they returned to myth.\nThe Altar of Rites.\nA few days after the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt; was hauled into New Tristram, the Nephalem returned to the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, demanding to see the artifact.\nLegacy.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s genocide, &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; recounted his story to an unidentified individual. He noted that the Nephalem had been similar to the individual, and expressed his disdain, noting how the Nephalem had been manipulated by those around them.\nThe Nephalem's mastery of death inspired &lt;a href=\"Cyrik\"&gt;Cyrik&lt;/a&gt;. He hoped to harness these same abilities, but this time to better serve the &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\n\"The Nephalem\" is representative of the player character(s) of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The) Nephalem\" is often used to address the player character, as per game mechanics and bypassing gender, name, class and number of players.\nAccording to \"&lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Light\"&gt;Storm of Light&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Tyrael\"&gt;Book of Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;\", storywise, a single nephalem hero is active. This matches the in-game cinematics of \"Diablo III\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" where \"the Nephalem\" is mentioned/seen as being a single hero. In a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUvzD1G1nsxU\"&gt;lore video&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", Kulle likewise refers to the Nephalem as a single individual, and in the flavor text of &lt;a href=\"Death%20Legacy\"&gt;Death Legacy&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Nephalem is likewise referred to in the singular.\nAccording to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Story%20of%20Diablo\"&gt;The Story of Diablo&lt;/a&gt;,\" however, not only are all the classes of \"Diablo III\" nephalem, but all of them take part in the same overall story. Likewise, in a preview for Patch 2.6.0, the Nephalem is referred to in the plural, and the website for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" likewise uses plural terminology. A tenth anniversary patch refers to multiple nephalem taking part in the \"Diablo III\" storyline, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Lorath%20%28Web%20Series%29\"&gt;Book of Lorath&lt;/a&gt;\" web series refers to multiple adventurers taking part in the events of \"Diablo III\".\nThis article and related pages are written to reflect this ambiguity.\nVarious individuals have appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" and expanded universe material that are named versions of the game's classes. These include:\nEven before a named character had been provided for a Monk, the Monk had been portrayed as male as the default class gender option. Default class genders for the Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Witch Doctor, Wizard, and Necromancer, are male, male, female, malefemale, and male."}

In the back of the atrium is a spiral staircase that led to the Palace's harem.\nA secret entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; is located within the Palace.\nHistory.\nThe Palace was once a &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; fortress.\nBy the 13th century, the Palace was the seat of power of &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt;, Sultan of Lut Gholein. A Palace Guard was maintained. It was a place of luxury and comfort.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%23The%20Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt; was able to gain entry into the Palace. He disappeared shortly afterwards. Not long afterwards, troubles began to afflict &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. Jerhyn allowed the &lt;a href=\"Harem%20Guilds\"&gt;Harem Guilds&lt;/a&gt; to join him within the Palace. However, one night, screams echoed from the palace's harem. The guards arrived to find the women being slaughtered by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. The guardsmen tried to push the demons back into the rift from which they'd emerged. However, they were fighting a constant, losing battle, with demons continuing to pour into the palace. This forced Jerhyn to hire mercenaries to defend the city. \nThe Palace was entered by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. They noticed how quiet the Palace interior was. What few servants they saw moved through the shadows, darting from one hiding place to another. Through the Palace, they gained entrance to the Arcane Sanctuary. By slaying Jazreth, they cut off the flow of demons into the Palace.\nIn-game.\nThe Palace appears in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".

When Eirena woke up, the Prophet was nowhere to be found.\nEirena spoke highly of the Prophet, worshiping and revering him. However, she also noted that he had a sense of humor, although she refused to tell &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; what exactly was that hilarious thing he said about the future savior of humanity. She also noted that the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Seraphim\"&gt;Seraphim&lt;/a&gt; emanates from &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, just like the one she felt radiating from the Prophet, leading her believe that he might have been an angel as well.\nDuring her journey to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, Eirena found a dying angel and received a scroll from him. The ancient script described the Prophet's plan to prepare human followers for his schemes, and confirmed her suspicions that he was, indeed, an angel, working on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in absolute secrecy.\nReaper of Souls.\nAs Eirena and the Nephalem progress through &lt;a href=\"A%20Sister%27s%20Voice\"&gt;her storyline&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;a secret place&lt;/a&gt;, they find memories of other sisters of the Hand of the Prophet, as well as Lysa, who sheds light on the Prophet's true intentions. Foreseeing the future, the Prophet knew that only one of the &lt;a href=\"Enchantress\"&gt;Enchantress&lt;/a&gt;es (Eirena), being the strongest, will survive, to carry out his will, while the rest will give their lives for hers. Lysa refused to do so and betrayed the Prophet, but could not kill Eirena due to the binding spell.\nAfter Lysa's death, the Prophet's voice reached to Eirena one final time.\nIn-game.\nIt is unknown as to where Tyrael has heard of The Prophet before, but there is the chance that this could in some way\u00a0refer\u00a0to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; in his role as The Prophet of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;.

Not only was there the concern that the nephalem might present a threat, but furthermore, they could draw the attention of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; to the realm the renegades had created. The defectors knew that if they were ever discovered, both they and their progeny would be destroyed.\nBecause of this, many renegades held the opinion that the nephalem should be destroyed. Others that their children should be spared. Troubled by the dissension, &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; called for a period of reflection. Thus, his followers agreed to consider the matter in solitude.\nAccording to ancient texts, Lilith was driven mad by the threat of her progeny's extinction. She saw the nephalem as the future, and as the means of ending the Eternal Conflict once and for all (albeit with the proviso of them serving as her own soldiers). She morphed into a new, horrific form, and hunted down her fellow renegades, slaughtering angels and demons alike. Such was her frenzy, she did not distinguish between those she sought to eliminate and those she sought to save, and as such, nephalem fell at to her claws alongside angels and demons. She ruthlessly murdered every follower of Inarius, leaving him to discover the carnage she had wrought. \nAt this point, the Purge took on a new dimension as Inarius and Lilith rallied their followers; the &lt;a href=\"Inari\"&gt;Inari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilin\"&gt;Lilin&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Ultimately, Inarius prevailed, but despite his rage, he was unable to bring himself to kill Lilith. Instead, he banished her into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nInarius condemned the Lilin for siding with Lilith. He took the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; away from &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt; and entrusted the &lt;a href=\"Pathstone\"&gt;Pathstone&lt;/a&gt; to the Inari, who had won his favor for serving him in the conflict. Left alone in the world he had created, Inarius tampered with the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; to cause the power of the nephalem to diminish over time. Over time, the nephalem would devolve into the mortal species known as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s."}

It takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Channel\"&gt;Western Channel&lt;/a&gt;, where a &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes offered to complete it.\nThe encounter takes place in one corner of the waterway (with one channel leading to the northeast, and one to the southeast), where four piles of Putrid Muck lie stinking. Damaging any of them reveals Half-Eaten Bodies underneath, and draws the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Betrayed\"&gt;Betrayed&lt;/a&gt; that have been feasting on them. Killing a few of them leads a &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Monsters\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; Betrayed to attack. The monsters are not too numerous, and once they and the corpse piles are eliminated, the event is complete, awarding gold and experience.\nObjectives.\nIt is unusual that the bounty version of the event requires killing additional monsters in the zone of the main event; this kind of secondary objective is normally only found on \"kill bounties\"."}

Destroying all six completes the bounty with a gold and experience reward."}
