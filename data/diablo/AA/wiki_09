Project X) was an action-RPG conceptualized by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt; after they completed work on \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". \nHistory.\nAfter the release of \"Diablo II\", Blizzard North was split into two teams. One team focused on continuing to develop for the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Series\"&gt;\"Diablo\"&lt;/a&gt; series, while the other was defined as the \"we love Diablo but it's time to try something new\" team. This project was named \"Project X; there was no clear idea as to what the project would be, the team just wanted to work on something other than \"Diablo\".\nOver the next two years, Project X floundered as it transformed into a different game every few weeks or months, pivoting any time &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt; decided he didn\u2019t like an idea anymore. At one point it was about kung-fu fighting, then pirates, and then team-based superhero strategy. When interviewed, Brevik stated that he was burnt-out in the aftermath of \"Diablo II\", and he was struggling to come up with ideas. In 2003, Brevik and &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich Schaefer&lt;/a&gt; gathered the team for an impromptu meeting and declared that they were going to stick with one game\u2014\"Starblo.\" \nThe \"Starblo\" idea had been one of the ideas that had been bouncing around within the development team over the last few years. The idea was that it would be a \"Diablo clone,\" but a space opera. The project thus earned the nickname \"Starblo\" due to its mix of a space setting and Diablo's ARPG formula. Like \"Diablo II\", \"Starblo\" would take place over several acts, but be spread across numerous worlds rather than be confined to a &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;single one&lt;/a&gt;. Players would travel from world to world in a customizable spaceship, whereupon the gameplay would be based on killing and looting space monsters.\nBy 2003, a few playable builds of the game existed, but the team hadn't come up with a proper name. Development of the game ended this year with the resignations of Brevik, and &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Max%20Schaefer\"&gt;Max Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20South\"&gt;Blizzard South&lt;/a&gt; cancelled the project and redirected North's efforts to \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III%20%28Blizzard%20North%29\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt;, who worked on the game, has incorporated ideas from \"Starblo\" into his own projects."}

In some mods, &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt; would store items instead.\nDiablo II.\nThe storage space is slightly larger (48 slots) than a character's &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; (40 slots). The Stash appears near the starting location in the of each Act.\n&lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;Items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be moved freely from the inventory to the Stash, or vice-versa. Anything stored in the Stash is saved when exiting the game (while items left on the ground will disappear after a few minutes or when logging out). Items in the Stash will persist across Acts and games. A player cannot look inside or access another player's Stash for any reason.\nThe gold capacity of the Stash was once determined by the level of your character, but as of , gold capacity is capped at 2,500,000 regardless of character level.\nThe stash is not lost when a player dies in &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore Mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nThe storage space is greatly expanded in \"Diablo III\", now having multiple tabs, each of which can have up to 70 slots. Players with Diablo III and no expansions can have a total of 3 tabs, whereas players who own the &lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt; (RoS) expansion can have up to 4 tabs. Patch 2.1 expanded the maximum number of tabs for RoS players to 5, and patch 2.4 added another one to a total of 6. Additional 2 tabs are added for purchasing the \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Necromancer\"&gt;Rise of the Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;\" pack.\nThe player starts the game with only 14 stash slots available, with more being purchasable. Each purchase will add 14 more slots until the tab is full. Buying the next tab will only add 14 slots to that tab, and the process repeats until the maximum number of tabs has been reached. Each new tab costs more gold than the previous one (200,000 for the second one, 300,000 for the third, 400,000 for the fourth and the fifth, and 500,000 for the sixth).\nOne additional Stash tab per &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; (up to 5) is available to unlock by completing Seasonal objectives in Season Journeys (typically beating Chapter VIII). Players can unlock up to 5 tabs by participating in four different Seasons, regardless of which exact Season numbers they choose.\nSince carried gold no longer drops when a player dies, there is no option to store gold (or any other currency) in the stash.\nStash is shared among all characters of the same type, that is, Softcore / &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;al / Normal characters will all have separate stashes, to a total of four per account.\nFollowing patch 2.6.5, PC players will be able to filter items in their stash by typing the name of an item they wish to find. All items except those fitting the filter will be darkened.\nStash tabs and item spaces.\nSince \"Diablo III\" was released, several expansions and patches have added additional tabs and stash spaces. For the PC version, each tab can hold 35\u201370 items.\nDevelopment.\nWhen the PTR for patch 2.6.5 originally went live, it was stated that all PC players would be given five additional stash tabs and all console players would be given an additional 140 stash spaces as a quality of life improvement. The developers then revised their statement and stated that PC players would have to earn the five spaces as seasonal rewards and they cut the additional console stash spaces to 70. In the official Season 17 announcement, the developers reduced the five additional tabs to just one and there was no mention of additional console stash space. Associate community manager Nevalistis later stated that the developers \"continued testing and tweaking and could not meet a satisfactory quality game experience with the initially planned number of additional tabs\"."}

Their appearance doesn\u2019t always convey their power, though \u2013 a seemingly plain staff can also serve as a channel for mighty arcane or spiritual forces. When forged of iron and tipped with blades, staves become a deadly weapon for a trained warrior. Still, however, most of the time, enchanted staves are used by spell casters.\nDiablo I.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", magical staves are used by the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; and non-magical combat staves by the &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Hellfire%29\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;.

Many staves are concealing powerful spells with a limited amount of charges, which Sorcerer can recharge in the field with questionable efficiency and will in return diminish the charges' amount.\nDiablo II.\nStaves are two-handed rods, a type of blunt, melee weapon in \"Diablo II\". All staves have a range adder of 1.\nStaves are usually most useful to the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;, as nonmagic, magic and rare staves can have innate bonuses to individual Sorceress &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;Skills&lt;/a&gt;. Staff damage scales with the wielder's Strength, with each point of Strength equivalent to 1% enhanced damage. Magic and rare staves can have Sorceress skill es. Like other rods, staves can have increased mana and faster cast rate affixes, but fewer attack rating and weapon damage affixes. Like other blunt weapons, staves are compatible with &lt;a href=\"Mace%20Mastery\"&gt;Mace Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, and have an inherent +50% damage to undead modifier.\nStaves, &lt;a href=\"wands\"&gt;wands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20Orbs\"&gt;orbs&lt;/a&gt; are all labeled \"staff class\" in-game, but the three weapon types have distinct properties.\nTwo quest items, the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Staff of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and the , are staves.\nStaff rune words.\nThe maximum number of sockets possible in a staff is 6.\nDiablo III.\nMost staves in Diablo III are used by the &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; classes. However, &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s may wield those as well, as a cheap alternative to &lt;a href=\"Polearms\"&gt;Polearms&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Daibo\"&gt;Daibo&lt;/a&gt; (which are, in a manner of speaking, a variant of combat staves). However, in Diablo III, staves no longer have charges for spells. In light of the lack of total stats for two-handed weapons, staves are usually used by &lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt;, and not by players. Staves may be &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrified&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20Axes\"&gt;Two-Handed Axes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20Maces\"&gt;Two-Handed Maces&lt;/a&gt;, but not Polearms."}

No creature has resistance to this spell, save the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Dark Lord of Terror&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Na-Krul\"&gt;Na-Krul&lt;/a&gt;, as well as players. The target cannot move or attack, making them easy prey. Duration grows with the spell level, to a maximum of 12 seconds. Damage taken will not break the curse prematurely.\nThe usefulness of this spell is only offset by its tremendous &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; cost, and the fact that it has to be cast again to continuously keep the target paralyzed. It is therefore most effective against single powerful foes, such as . It cannot be applied to an already petrified monster until the previous Stone Curse wears off.\n&lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;Immunities&lt;/a&gt; are ignored by this spell, and the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; of the victim will be decreased to 0 for the duration. They remain material objects, and must be walked around by other monsters. A row of stoned monsters can provide a useful barrier or wall against enemies.\nMonsters that are already petrified, or which are charging or phasing in or out, are temporarily immune to Stone Curse. &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s will dodge it when &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ing, for example.\nUnsurprisingly, it also does not work on a , although it is hard to think of a reason to petrify it anyway. However, &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Demon\"&gt;Winged Demon&lt;/a&gt;s \"can\" be turned to stone with Stone Curse, and in that case, they will not regenerate lost &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; any faster than in their normal state.\n, when cast on a monster under Stone Curse effect, will instantly break the Stone Curse, removing it from the victim.\nMonsters killed while under the effect of Stone Curse will \"not\" give players any &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuration:\nAs such, Stone Curse reaches its maximum duration at Spell Level 9, and its lowest cost even earlier, so there is little point in upgrading it afterwards."}

Stormpoint Prison) is a fortress located on the island of &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint\"&gt;Stormpoint&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nOperated by &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, the keep had a standing garrison. The guards and their families resided in &lt;a href=\"the%20Shanties\"&gt;the Shanties&lt;/a&gt;, located outside the keep proper. Long before the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, Westmarch decided it could no longer afford to maintain the prison, and left the keep and its inhabitants to their own devices. Over the years, the soldiers' &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; rusted and became brittle, due to the island's constant exposure to sea wind.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed. A shard landed off the shore of Stormpoint. At some point, the shard was discovered by Warden &lt;a href=\"Woodruh\"&gt;Woodruh&lt;/a&gt;, who brought it inside the fortress. The next day, he passed it around the mess. One of the guards tried to grab it, and the next moment, began spitting up seawater. &lt;a href=\"Meris\"&gt;Another guard&lt;/a&gt; had to put the madman down.\nThe effects of the Worldstone continued to ravage the prison. Minor offenders were moved to &lt;a href=\"the%20Shanties\"&gt;the Shanties&lt;/a&gt;, while the more serious offenders remained inside, as they were too dangerous to be released. Both the guards and the creatures continued to &lt;a href=\"Transformed%20%28Monster%29\"&gt;transform&lt;/a&gt; into hideous creatures. Commander &lt;a href=\"Kenton\"&gt;Kenton&lt;/a&gt; ordered the prison sealed.\nThe Siege of Stormpoint.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, the keep was besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, in a bid to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; shard located within. The attack included &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, which the cult had summoned through conducting &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; sacrifices. The &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Terror\"&gt;Howling Terror&lt;/a&gt; was unleashed upon the fortress, bombarding it with &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; blasts from on high. Demons reguarly attacked the keep's defenders along the &lt;a href=\"Barbican%20Transverse\"&gt;barbican&lt;/a&gt;. While the keep's defenders were able to hold back the demonic hordes, hunger and exhaustion took their toll on the defenders. Hunters were offered rewards to hunt &lt;a href=\"Trebuchet%20Crab\"&gt;Trebuchet Crab&lt;/a&gt;s as a source of sustenance.\nEven after the siege proper had ended, fighting continued in and around the fortress, as the defenders struggled to react to each threat that reared itself. Guards stationed on the walls were few in number, but some had to be transferred to the prison as the Transformed wiped out the guards stationed there. Refugees kept on coming to the keep, but as space became scarce, refugees not related to the soldiers were turned back.\nIn-game.\nStormpoint Keep is explored in the &lt;a href=\"Terror%27s%20Tide\"&gt;Terror's Tide&lt;/a&gt; storyline in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Do not doubt his word, as he is probably referring to himself. Just smile and buy him another tankard of ale. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nStrafe allows the Amazon to quickly fire up to 10 arrows or bolts at all targets within range, with every projectile carrying all the properties of its launcher. Damage increases as Strafe reaches higher levels. Strafe uses only one arrow per cast. If there are only a few targets (or even one target), Strafe fires at the same target(s) multiple times.\u00a0The formula for maximum amount of arrows per target is 2 + (Strafe level / 4 rounded down). As Strafe auto-targets any enemy within range (which extends to past the border of the screen), it is a good scouting spell to cast when entering an unfamiliar area.\nIn terms of damage per second, Strafe is one of the best &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; multi-hit skills, with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Multiple%20Shot\"&gt;Multiple Shot&lt;/a&gt; being its only rival in most circumstances (although cross-synergies make maxing both skill worth it). The skill is however dangerous to use in certain situations as careless casting results in \"Strafe Lock\", causing users to be unable to move until all the arrows from Strafe are fired.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 11"}

As a result, it is not commonly sought out by players.\nPre-2.4 Reward: plain experience bonus for each kill.\n2.4 Reward: double gain of primary resource.\nSavior.\nSavior is a bonus that involves saving another player from the potential killing blow of a monster, usually done by killing the monster in question. This will pop the name of the saved player's character name. Take note that this bonus can (and often will) be earned shortly \"after\" the player in question has already been killed.\nSurvivor.\nSurvivor is a bonus that involves escaping the jaws of death, be it through killing your monsters before they can kill you, or fleeing from the situation. This bonus appears when you reach below 10% of your maximum &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and then escape combat."}

{"id": "27874", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27874", "title": "Stun (mechanic)", "text": "Stun (a.k.a. Paralysis)\u00a0is en element of gameplay and a type of &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; effect, usable by both players and monsters.\nThe general concept is completely paralyzing the target, preventing them from movement, attacking, using abilities and activating skills for a short time. Some passive effects will still work, and certain skills can even be activated while Stunned, but generally, the target will remain completely helpless and vulnerable to attack.\nContinuously stunning the same target and keeping it under control without giving it a chance to recover is known as\u00a0Stunlock. It is often used by players against single enemies, but can be used by monsters too: a player cornered and suffering many blows per second is a very easy prey.\nMost powerful enemies and &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt; are generally either highly resistant or immune to Stun.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", causing a high degree of damage to a player or monster in one hit can cause a \"micro-Stun\", causing their hit recovery animation to play. While this is in progress, the target behaves as if it was stunned. The threshold that the hit must pass is influenced by the level or &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; of the target hit, depending on the game.\nDiablo.\nIn the original\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" game, players could use the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Curse\"&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/a&gt; spell to paralyze the petrified target, leaving it essentially stunned. Micro-Stun was very common, and if a hit dealt enough &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage, the target will be pushed into a state of hit recovery. A high degree of &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the hands of a &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Hellfire%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, will ensure that once the target is hit, virtually \"nothing\", not even the &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Lord of Terror&lt;/a&gt; himself, can survive the onslaught that normally follows.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Stun is a separate effect that usually lasts a second or two. Some skills, including the 's &lt;a href=\"Stun%20%28Skill%29\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;'s , are applying the Stun to the target, causing the blue sparks (resembling the stereotypical cartoon \"stars above head\") to appear on the victim. Some monsters, like &lt;a href=\"Mauler\"&gt;Mauler&lt;/a&gt;s, even have this as a guaranteed effect on every hit.\nStun is often combined with &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;. This is not always desirable for the attacker though, since Knockback can push a target out of the range of the weapon, making it harder to stunlock them (since one must then close range with the target before hitting again).\nAlthough Stun works on most monsters in the game,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Act%20Bosses\"&gt;Act Bosses&lt;/a&gt; possess full immunity to it.\nDiablo Immortal.\nStun is a control method used mainly by the player in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". It is normally caused by &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; attacks that cause large &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;. Stunned monsters cannot perform any action (movement, attack or defend). &lt;a href=\"Unique%20monster\"&gt;Unique monster&lt;/a&gt;s are immune to stun.\nWhen performed by monsters stun is usually used by bosses to stall the player while they perform a long animation (eg changing the location of the battle). Some monsters like the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Golem\"&gt;Guardian Golem&lt;/a&gt; have attacks that can stun the player.\nDiablo III.\nIn\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, micro-Stun can no longer happen on players: taking damage will never cause them to be stunned unless combined with Knockback. However, monsters taking damage are very often suffering a micro-Stun. Monsters build up the crowd control resistance as they are continuously stunned, reducing the duration of subsequent Stuns. Some monsters have special abilities that add Stun to their attacks, such as &lt;a href=\"Armaddon\"&gt;Armaddon&lt;/a&gt;s' melee blows. However, Stun is a much less common form of monster trait than Knockback.\nA stunned target cannot perform any active actions (unless those are specifically stated to be usable while stunned, such as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Skin\"&gt;Diamond Skin&lt;/a&gt;), effectively being paralyzed. Obviously, channeled skills are interrupted by Stun.\nEquipping &lt;a href=\"Krelm%27s%20Buff%20Bracers\"&gt;Krelm's Buff Bracers&lt;/a&gt; will render player immune to both Stun and &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany skills (mostly &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Damage\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;) have a chance or even are guaranteed to add Stun to each attack.\nNote that scripted event Stun effects (such as those in battles with &lt;a href=\"Urzael\"&gt;Urzael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;) are not reduced or prevented by any means: they serve to justify the player's inaction during the cutscenes, and are not part of the gameplay itself."}

In time, he may, but that day is not yet here\"\nPart II.\n\"There must be others who seek a way out of the endless strife. &lt;a href=\"Angels\"&gt;Angels&lt;/a&gt; and demons who feel enslaved by our fate. I cannot be unique in all of creation. I know my path: I will find those disillusioned of the war, and lead them\"\nPart III.\n\"I was struck down in the third charge. I lay upon the ground only to wake in chains. I did not know that demons took prisoners. I babbled like a fool about my dreams of escaping this war. My captor freed me and said that we would meet again. Her name was &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;\"\"\nPart IV.\n\"Lilith is me, but of fire and flame. I could never have felt this way about a demon while I was mired in the endless war. The strain holds us prisoner to what we have been told to believe. She and I have made plans. We will bring others to our cause, and together, we will escape\"\nPart V.\n\"\"Those who follow us are strong in purpose and conviction, but we are only few. Yet, if we can obtain the power of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, it will be enough. We will scale the &lt;a href=\"Windshear\"&gt;Windshear&lt;/a&gt; slope, steal into the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt;, and be gone before anyone notices the stone's disappearance\"\nPart VI.\n\"Can I truly love a demon? When I gave the Worldstone to Lilith, I knew I had been right to seek her all along. We have created a new world. We can live here in peace, away from war. I have named this world &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;\"\"\nPart VII.\n\"When I see Lilith sleeping at my side, I'm filled with dark thoughts. My sins are real, and I will surely pay for them. We live in peace for now, but it cannot last. They will come for me. But what of my great deeds? When I'm in torment, who will celebrate those? Who will remember Inarius?\"\nThe Writings of Lilith.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; Levels 1 &amp; 2, found inside &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Writings\"&gt;Ancient Writings&lt;/a&gt;.\nPart I.\n\"\"&lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;My father&lt;/a&gt; is content to fight the same battles and the same foes while everything turns to ashes. Though his victories might last a day, or a year, or a hundred years, the war will never be won so long as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;he and his brothers&lt;/a&gt; lead. There is an end to it, but fools like my father are too blind to see it\"\nPart II.\n\"I took &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;a prisoner&lt;/a&gt; in the battle, an &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; whose light was dimming. I brought him to my lair for my amusement. But he surprised me. My touch seemed to breathe life into him. He raved like a madman about how he wished to escape the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps I have found someone I can use\"\nPart III.\n\"The angel I captured, Inarius, is in love with me. I can feel the intensity of his desire. I told him that we must liberate the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, and then we can be together. We will create something never imagined by those mired in the Eternal Conflict. &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;A new world&lt;/a&gt;\"\nPart IV.\n\"Inarius and I stole the Worldstone, and now we have a group of renegades to follow us. I have created a new world where we can live in peace. A place of infinite possibilities. Inarius believes that escape is enough. In time, I will show him that even victory is possible.

He was a close friend of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, and was the one to hand him the letter that informed Cain of the death of his &lt;a href=\"Amelia%20Cain\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain%20%28The%20Order%29\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;. Cain, succumbing to liquor and grief, yelled at Pepin to get out, to which Pepin obliged.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Pepin was in his mid-sixties. He was initially a high ranking priest who served under Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;. As the wind shifted, Pepin decided to hide out in Tristram after Lazarus and &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; both succumbed to &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. \nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Hellmouth%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Hellmouth&lt;/a&gt; opened beneath the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; he made the village his home. He remodeled an &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Healing\"&gt;old building&lt;/a&gt; to serve as his domicile, clinic, and workplace. When the townsfolk attacked the cathedral, led by Lazarus as part of a supposed effort to rescue Prince &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;, Pepin was shocked. Apparently still having faith in Lazarus at this point, he thought that the archbishop would have more sense. As it turned out, it was a trap, and many in the mob were slain or severely injured by a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt;. When the few survivors made it to the surface, many of them bore the scars of the demon's wrath. Pepin found that their wounds festered with disease, and found them almost impossible to treat. When the young boy &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt;, who was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt; from the depths of the cathedral, lost his left leg from the injuries inflicted by the demons, it was Pepin who attached the peg leg on him. \nAs Tristram's situation worsened, Pepin continued to act as the town healer. Putting his healing talents to use, he offered free healing to all comers. While in his clinic, he worked on concocting incredibly potent elixirs made from the herbs he stored in the back of the house. Unlike his healing, he charged people for the elixirs and potions, as he needed the &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; to purchase the unique healing ingredients he required from the caravans that came through town. This complemented the herbs he grew in his small garden.\nDiablo was defeated by a &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;trio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, but their deeds offered only a small reprieve. When Aidan departed, the town was overrun with demons, and almost all of its inhabitants slaughtered, Pepin was among them, and his death was personally witnessed by &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Tyrael\"&gt;Writings&lt;/a&gt; of Cain indicate that Pepin's death was particuarly grusome\u2014when writing on the subject, Cain commented \"suffice it to say the images are branded into my mind, and I fear they will haunt me until the end of my days.\"\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nPepin appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\". He also buys and sells healing potions and elixirs. If the well is tainted, it is Pepin who will initiate the &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20Water%20Supply%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Poisoned Water Supply&lt;/a&gt; quest, and he is also interested in studying the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mushroom%20%28quest%29\"&gt;brain of a demon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", when the player travels to Tristram, there is a corpse at the exact spot where Pepin used to stand. This may be his body.\nDiablo III.\nPepin is referenced in the flavor text of the &lt;a href=\"Wirt%27s%20Leg%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Wirt's Leg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mace%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". The text is taken verbatim from one of his lines in Diablo I.\nPersonality and Traits.\nPepin was a kind and polite man, as well skilled healer, possessing a sound understanding of potions and elixirs. He was a close friend of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, who regarded Pepin as as true friend; perhaps the closest he had while in Tristram. He commented that Pepin could be a bit addled at times, but no more caring &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; had ever existed. Other townsfolk had similar praise for Pepin's generous spirit."}

All six are required to complete the set, and all six are Necromancer-restricted.\nSet Bonus:\nThe first bonus is, in fact, the only way to fire Corpse Lance without manually aiming it. If no enemies are found, the extra Lance will not be fired. Each corpse will count as a full cast, with all runes and enhancements, automatically finding a random target in range. Note that with the Blood Lance rune, each Lance \"will\" drain &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, which may lead to uncontrolled injury with lots of corpses around. If a corpse is consumed by Corpse Lance, it will fire two of them. One can make this bonus semi-passive by using the &lt;a href=\"Devour\"&gt;Devouring Aura&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second bonus is multiplicative, and results in nearly-permanent halving of all incoming damage. This does apply to the indirect casts of Corpse Lance from the first bonus.\nThe third bonus is applied from any corpse (not corpse-consuming cast), up to 100 charges at a time. Damage buff is static (does not change with the number of accumulated charges), and each cast consumes one charge to multiplicatively boost one Bone Spear.\nThird bonus also passively and multiplicatively boosts Corpse Explosion and Corpse Lance as of patch 2.6.1. This damage bonus is not tied to Empowered Bone Spears, and instead remains active at all times.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Johnstone\"&gt;The Johnstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corpsewhisper%20Pauldrons\"&gt;Corpsewhisper Pauldrons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Land of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; are very potent additions to this set."}

{"id": "29407", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=29407", "title": "Pet", "text": "Pet\u00a0is a common name for any summonable companion of a player. \nOverview.\nPets autonomously and independently attack enemies (or otherwise assist in battle) while not being under the player's direct control. In fact, most pets act as &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt;, except for they are fighting on player's side.\nPets are sometimes called &lt;a href=\"minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt;s, but that name is generally reserved for monsters accompanying a powerful enemy. Companions, summonables and summons are also common terms for pets.\nSome pets are attackable by enemies and/or killable, while others are ignored by enemies for targeting purposes and have no &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; bar. Most pets block enemy &lt;a href=\"Pathing%20AI\"&gt;pathing&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore may lock their target in combat, taking hits on themselves while keeping their master safe. Unattackable pets, however, very rarely if ever block enemy path. In \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", killable pets' &lt;a href=\"Toughness\"&gt;Toughness&lt;/a&gt; depends on that of their master, and they take greatly reduced damage from area-of-effect attacks, as well as any attacks that are supposed to be avoided by the player.\nAll pets have their own AI, and usually attack the closest target they see. As enemies generally do so as well, melee pets are often used as a meat shield for their ranged-attacking master. In \"Diablo III\", monsters tend to attack their master's current target, unless it is somehow out of their reach.\nPets tend to stay close to their master. If the latter ventures too far, pets can teleport to their current location, although immobile summonables lack this ability, and will stay where summoned until the location is exited, or until they are killed or their timer expires.\n&lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;Follower&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hireling\"&gt;Hireling&lt;/a&gt;s are not necessarily pets, and should not be considered as such, though they share similarities with pets in the facts that they have their own AI, and also fall in battle if their master dies.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s are the three classes that have an opportunity to deal a major part of their damage through pets, although other classes may sometimes make a build focused on pets.\nIn \"Diablo III\", pets of other players are displayed transparent and less visible.\nPets can be unsummoned at will (for example, if player does not want them to attract the attention of idle monsters). In \"Diablo II\", it is done through the &lt;a href=\"Unsummon\"&gt;Unsummon&lt;/a&gt; skill, which any player gains if they have a skill that allows summoning pets. In \"Diablo III\", unless pets are passively summoned, one can dismiss them by right-clicking their portrait (upper left corner of the screen) and selecting the appropriate line. Pets almost always despawn and die if their master is killed.\nPets are present in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" as of a pre-\"&lt;a href=\"Vessel%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Vessel of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\" update. They aid with &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and material pickup.\nSkills that count as pets.\n(*) indicates that the summoned pet is not targetable at all, regardless of whether their master fights against the minions of Hell or other players.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", pets can often be enhanced with items, like &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tasker%20and%20Theo\"&gt;Tasker and Theo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20Jeram\"&gt;Mask of Jeram&lt;/a&gt;. Unless specifically stated otherwise, their attacks will give no &lt;a href=\"Life%20on%20Hit\"&gt;Life on Hit&lt;/a&gt; and will not trigger any 'on hit' special effects. In return, the Reflects Damage affix has no effect on pet attacks. Life per Kill bonus, however, is effective even if the enemy is killed by a pet.\nPets can trigger &lt;a href=\"Area%20Damage\"&gt;Area Damage&lt;/a&gt; (Patch 2.3.0, August 2015).\nOnly Tasker and Theo can increase the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; of Pets. Any other Attack Speed increase will increase the Pet's &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; instead. This makes Attack Speed critical for most Pet oriented builds.\nDue to programming errors regarding AI, pets will sometimes just stand still in front of enemies without attacking, even if they get attacked, or will simply just walk with the player and not seek enemies at all. This mostly happens when the player has too many pets active and there are too many enemies on screen. Moving around or re-summoning sometimes fix this problem. In 2.1 this problem still happens, but less frequently compared to other patches.\nWitch Doctor.\nNote: multiple passive skills and active skill runes allow summoning Zombie Dogs, even if the Witch Doctor does not have that skill)\nNon-combat pets.\nNon-combat or &lt;a href=\"cosmetic\"&gt;cosmetic&lt;/a&gt; pets can only be summoned from the &lt;a href=\"Wardrobe\"&gt;Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; or Collection screen, and do not affect gameplay in almost any way. They do collect &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; within a certain radius of the player, and with a specific unlock on the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt; they can collect and &lt;a href=\"salvage\"&gt;salvage&lt;/a&gt; non-&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; items as well. Only one non-combat pet can be summoned at a time, but they do not interfere with other types of pets.\nItems that can summon pets.\nDiablo II.\nOnly items with the actual ability to summon pets are listed; items that only enhance the existing summons are not included.\nDiablo III.\nThe list also includes the items and sets that indirectly increase the amount of pets summoned through skills."}

His role is to examine &lt;a href=\"Shassar\"&gt;Shassar&lt;/a&gt; artifacts. After the loss of &lt;a href=\"Tabri\"&gt;Tabri&lt;/a&gt;, he became the group's leader.\nPeth is able to use &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. He doesn't believe in luck.\nBiography.\nThe Shassar Sea.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; asked Peth about the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;Scepter of Fahir&lt;/a&gt;. He was aghast, given its sordid history, but seeing that they wouldn't be dissuaded, gave them the location of the first of its three pieces.\nPeth later travelled to &lt;a href=\"Sereth%20Outpost\"&gt;Sereth Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, and was present when it was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Scorpions\"&gt;Sand Scorpions&lt;/a&gt;. The attack was repelled, and Peth and his fellow Blades brought the &lt;a href=\"Tomi\"&gt;lone survivor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tabri\"&gt;Tabri&lt;/a&gt; for judgement. The survivor joined the Amber Blades, and later, Peth accompanied Tabri and the rest of the Amber Blades to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Chamber of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, where they met with the hero(es) who presented Tabri with the last piece of the scepter. With the scepter reconstituted, Tabri declared herself to be ruler of Shassar. Peth declared that this moment would be remembered forever, and knelt to his new ruler, along with the rest of the Blades.\nUpholding her end of the bargain, Tabri ordered Peth to take the hero(es) to the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, as only he knew the ancient spell that would part the sands. He obliged, and they used a &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; to head to &lt;a href=\"Sereth%20Outpost\"&gt;Sereth Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, from which he would lead them to the library.\nPeth &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed first, and after his arrival, was taken captive by some Sand Scorpions. The cadre's &lt;a href=\"Jarsem%20the%20Tracker\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; told Peth that the Scorpions knew that the Amber Blades were collecting the pieces of Fahir's scepter, and demanded to know where it was. However, the Scorpions were killed by the hero(es) who'd been following Peth. He told them they had to get out of here before more Scorpions arrived. Leading them onward, he told the hero(es) that while the Blades knew of the library, they'd never been inside, as there were \"too many warnings.\" They arrived at the library, and while Peth was uneasy, the hero(es) \"had\" survived the Tomb of Fahir, so perhaps they would survive Kulle's library as well. He told them not to worry about the Blades. That thanks to the hero's/heroes' efforts, they would retake Shassar.\nPeth then used his magic to reveal the path to the library. \nLater Events.\n\"Note: The following events aren't necessarily in chronological order, but have been arranged to be as close as possible.\"\nBounties.\nAt some point, Peth ventured into the library itself, but found it had been invaded by &lt;a href=\"Drub\"&gt;Drub&lt;/a&gt;s. He requested that adventurers remove the Ghouls from the library, as he dared not set foot inside again until the monsters had been removed. Furthermore, in doing so, the library's archives would be protected from the Drubs' ruthless scavenging.\nUpon learning of the &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s that inhabited the library, Peth requested that any adventurers that encountered them bring him their sandstone cores. He also requested that adventurers remove the Sand Scorpion bandits that had entered the library, now that it had been opened to the world.\nCurse of the Scepter.\nHaving claimed the Scepter of Fahir, the Amber Blades attacked the Sand Scorpions, but were forced to retreat into the Library of Zoltun Kulle. Tabri wrote a letter to Peth, telling him that she was heading off to face &lt;a href=\"Vataos\"&gt;Vataos&lt;/a&gt; alone, and to make sure &lt;a href=\"Zov\"&gt;Zov&lt;/a&gt; didn't cause any problems, as she had grown suspicious of him.\nPeth formed an alliance of sorts with the library's golems, but their slow speech made practical action impossible. In the end, Tabri apparently fell in battle with Vataos, and Zov stole the scepter, abandoning the Amber Blades. The Shard-seeker told Peth what had happened, and Peth realized that Zov had manipulated the Shard-seeker to find Tabri, and had made his move when opportunity struck. Peth despaired at the loss of both Tabri and the scepter.\nTo Tabri.\nBefore Tabri went missing, she gave Peth a letter with a coded message, but he was unable to decipher it. Some time after the loss of Tabri, a &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;merchant friend&lt;/a&gt; of hers arrived at the camp to deliver wine to her. He had been accosted by Lacuni, but was saved by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sahid\"&gt;Sahid&lt;/a&gt;. He informed Peth that he sent the adventurer on an errand to retrieve a letter that Tabri buried at the &lt;a href=\"Perpetual%20Hourglass\"&gt;Perpetual Hourglass&lt;/a&gt; at a point when they went there to drink.\nThe Shard-seeker returned with the letter, which was the cypher to the letter with Peth. After decoding the message, Peth read &lt;a href=\"Tabri%27s%20Will\"&gt;Tabri's last message&lt;/a&gt; for the Amber Blades, in which she named him as the new leader. The whole camp took a toast in honor of Tabri.\nLeading the Amber Blades.\nPeth settled in as the new leader of the Amber Blades. Initially, he was not much respected by the soldiers, likely because of his lack of martial prowess. By this point, he had taken &lt;a href=\"Calim\"&gt;Calim&lt;/a&gt; as his student.\nPeth promoted the people loyal to him (eg. Sahid), and they helped him to root out spies within the camp.

If only one charge-up is built, it summons a &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;-like delayed fire-elemental attack, with somewhat low impact damage but leaving behind a patch of fire that burns for a very long time. With two charges, it summons a flurry of lightning bolts that swirl around and damage many enemies in a large area surrounding the target (the attack is based on the lightning effect of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Blood Raven&lt;/a&gt;'s death, for reference). With three charges, it summons a flurry of ice missiles that freezes on hit, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Orb\"&gt;Frozen Orb&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhoenix Strike stands out for being versatile \u2014 it gives the Assassin three elements to work with, and each charge has its unique purpose as well. The first charge is useful as a boss killer due to its ability to stack multiple patches of flame that can deal very high damage over time; the second charge is a wide-area attack that works great against normal enemies, especially in wide-open fields; the third charge does low damage, freezes all foes, giving the Assassin and her teammates a great net of safety, as well as being useful against enemies that can resurrect each other.\nThe skill does have its problems, though: having three distinct charges also makes it easy for the Assassin to release the wrong charge, and while having three elements to work with is useful in Hell to bypass immunities, it also sometimes limits the Assassin as she sometimes cannot use the best charge for the situation due to those immunities.\nThis skill, unlike the elemental skills learned earlier in the tree, does not require a claw-class weapon. Although claws are generally the best idea anyway given their speed and the inherent attack rating bonus that can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Claw%20Mastery\"&gt;Claw Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, the assassin is free to use a weapon of different class if she feels that it benefits her more. Also, equipment bonuses that increases elemental damage do not work with this skill, but those that drain enemy elemental resistance do.\nPhoenix Strike is the primary skill of the &lt;a href=\"Mosaic%20Assassin\"&gt;Mosaic Assassin&lt;/a&gt;, which takes advantage of a combination of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Talon\"&gt;Dragon Talon&lt;/a&gt;'s multiple strikes and the fact that dual &lt;a href=\"Mosaic%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Mosaic Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;s cause charges to persist to deal devastating area of effect damage thanks to procing Phoenix Strike multiple times per attack.\nThis skill is known internally in the game files as \"Royal Strike\".\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 4"}

Also will be useful just with undead, it has lightning damage but it's too low. Pindleskin and his minions are undead of course.\nThis build is not recommended for online play, as creating games simply to kill a single monster will give you a temporary restriction and prevent you from being able to play on Battle.net.

It is apparently located in &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nUpon entering &lt;a href=\"World%20Tier\"&gt;World Tier&lt;/a&gt; IV, players receive a priority &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; to complete a tier 46 &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Dungeon\"&gt;Nightmare Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. Upon completion, they can start collecting &lt;a href=\"runeshard\"&gt;runeshard&lt;/a&gt;s. The runeshards can be used to activate an obelisk in &lt;a href=\"Cerrigar\"&gt;Cerrigar&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the player to descend into the Pit.\nThe player's task is to slay enough &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s before their 10-minute time limit runs out to summon a final &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;. Each player &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; removes time from the clock: first death removes 30 seconds, second death removes 60 seconds, third and subsequent deaths will remove 90 seconds.\nAfter enough monsters are slain, a portal materializes, transporting the player to the boss arena. Slay the boss before the timer expires to earn &lt;a href=\"masterworking\"&gt;masterworking&lt;/a&gt; materials, and the next tier of the Pit. If the player kills the boss with enough time left on the clock, the benefit increases. With 4-6 minutes to spare, a player can skip a level and unlock an additional tier of the Pit. Killing the boss with 6 or more minutes to spare grants two additional tier unlocks. The Pit has 200 total levels of difficulty.\nThe Pit can be entered in groups of up to four players, with the player who spends the runeshards to open the Pit earning the lion\u2019s share of materials. Only the player who opened the Pit has the chance to receive &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Stone\"&gt;Stygian Stone&lt;/a&gt;s. The further a player descends the Pit, the more frequent these Stygian Stones will appear."}

After that, you can decide where to distribute your points. Lightning Fury is useful for PvP and for Poison Immune monsters.\nImmunities.\nPlagazons have the advantage of running into fewer monsters immune to their damage than say, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;. Some monsters, usually &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and constructs are immune to poison. In\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and Hell this number increases significantly, and there are even some immune to both poison\u00a0\"and\"\u00a0lightning damage. On\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hell\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, it may be a good idea to get a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Arrow\"&gt;Fire Arrow&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cold%20Arrow\"&gt;Cold Arrow&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in case you run into\u00a0Poison Immune Monsters\u00a0(or poison\u00a0and\u00a0lightning immune if you're a hybrid).\nStrategy.\nYou can greatly increase your effective DPS by poisoning a group of enemies, then running off to find another group of enemies (at the same time as waiting for the first group to die), then running off to find another group, etc. until you circle back and pick up the death drops of the first group. This works better with Poison Javelin rather than Plague Javelin, since at higher /players settings Plague Javelin might not deal enough total damage to kill monsters (its main advantage is the larger area and higher DPS, while Poison Javelin has higher total damage dealt but takes a lot longer to kill enemies), but Poison Javelin will almost assuredly kill most monsters and champions before it wears off.\nUse Decoy as needed to keep the poisoned mobs at bay.\nThis strategy keeps your mana usage low while boosting your DPS to match those of more powerful builds, but is not viable when you are in a party since most players will prefer to have a single pass over the area rather than leaving one group to suffer poison while you search for the next group to poison.\nTactics.\nDirectly aiming at the mobs is sub-optimal unless you are using Plague Javelin and have a high-level Pierce. Until you raise your Plague Javelin and Pierce levels, you should instead aim off to the side, leaving a trail of poison clouds, then run to position the poison clouds between the mob and yourself.\nAs poison takes time, make good use of Decoy and Valkyrie to keep mobs off you until the poison wears off or the monsters die.\nUse Decoy to scout an area and attract monsters you can then throw a Plague Javelin at."}

Some poison attacks have variable damage and duration. Poison is typically associated with the color green, and takes the form of toxins, venom, and acids.\nIn Diablo III, the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer'&lt;/a&gt;s Poison skills are thematically related to decay and blight, rather than toxins. In Diablo IV, the Necromancer no longer has any Poison skills, and instead is replaced with the new &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28Damage%29\"&gt;Shadow damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable users.\nThere are two &lt;a href=\"super%20unique\"&gt;super unique&lt;/a&gt; monsters who have shot to fame by the strength of their Poison attacks alone.

The latter's poison has been known to leave even the strongest characters at 1 health and almost always the death of the accompanying &lt;a href=\"Hireling\"&gt;Hireling&lt;/a&gt;, But is only used when she dies and spills her \"green blood\" around her. Andariel uses her poison attacks much more often, and in a variety of ways. She has a poison bolt that travels along a straight line that does heavy damage per second if it strikes, or she could spread an arc-like wave of poison towards the player which does less damage than the previous attack but still is very dangerous. She can also inflict poison damage in her melee attacks. Both the above ladies do very high damage with their poison attacks, so it is highly advisable to have Antidote Potions in the &lt;a href=\"Belt\"&gt;Belt&lt;/a&gt; before fighting them.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; only characters, there is another poison user, much more deadly than the aforementioned ladies of disease, the Demon Queen, &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. Lilith can be fought in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt; Battle.net only quest and she packs quite a mean punch with her other worldly poison attacks. They do hefty amounts of damage per second and stay on the character for a very long time. It is imperative that the player fights her with Antidotes on hand. It would also help if you keep some &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; ready to resurrect your hireling after the fight.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghom\"&gt;Ghom&lt;/a&gt; is known for being the almost-exclusively Poison damage boss. &lt;a href=\"Mummy\"&gt;Mummies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Accursed\"&gt;Accursed&lt;/a&gt; are known for leaving noxious vapors after death, dealing severe Poison damage to anything they touch.\nIn Diablo Immortal, the most notable poison users are &lt;a href=\"Gorgothra%20the%20Claimer\"&gt;Gorgothra the Claimer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Corphet%20the%20Venomwing\"&gt;Corphet the Venomwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, most players do not take Poison damage as seriously as &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. This may be due to its characteristic of doing damage over time, which can be balanced by using items that give Life Regeneration, and &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s if &lt;a href=\"Antidote%20Potion\"&gt;Antidote Potion&lt;/a&gt;s are not available. It should be noted that poison will never be the cause of death for the player's hero, stopping at a Life total of 1. So, no character can be killed by poison damage alone. This can be used as an advantage by &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; players.\nWhen you are poisoned, your &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; orb turns green and you slowly lose Life.\nPoison is quite commonplace in &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Mummy\"&gt;Mummies&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mummy\"&gt;greater cousins&lt;/a&gt; alone, although that's not to say that the other acts don't have their share of enemies that make use of this element.\nPoison can instantly be cured with an &lt;a href=\"Antidote%20Potion\"&gt;Antidote Potion&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, you can lower the amount of life you lose by increasing you character's &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Resistance\"&gt;Poison Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. You can also reduce the duration of the poison with certain magic items and, if you are a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, by using the &lt;a href=\"Cleansing\"&gt;Cleansing&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, poison may come in the form of instant damage, but many Poison skills also apply damage over time effects, weaken the target, or create pools of poison and acid on the ground. Poison damage is only used by &lt;a href=\"Lyndon\"&gt;Lyndon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s and s, and hardly ever by other classes. &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s from Poison damage may leave the target seething with toxic fumes, or just dissolve it to the bone. Only Witch Doctors and Necromancers roll Poison damage as Smart-Loot.\n,\u00a0,\u00a0, &lt;a href=\"Wormwood\"&gt;Wormwood&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Land%20Waders\"&gt;Swamp Land Waders&lt;/a&gt; are the items with unconventional bonus to Poison skills damage.\u00a0This actually leaves this damage type least capable of being boosted, even though it is, in fact, used by just two classes. amulet will render the character completely immune to Poison damage (the attacks will actually \"heal\" &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;)."}

At Level 1, the creeper has 50 points of health, and can inflict 12-18 points of poison damage over a period of four seconds. In this way, the Creeper is used more like the &lt;a href=\"Raven\"&gt;Raven&lt;/a&gt; skill than a typical summon. That is to say, it is a supplement to the Druid's own attack strength, as opposed to an independent attacking minion.\nOnly one of Poison Creeper, &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Vine\"&gt;Carrion Vine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Solar%20Creeper\"&gt;Solar Creeper&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned by the same player at a time: summoning another vine will dispel any previously summoned.\nRather than killing opponents outright, it weakens them with poison damage so that the Druid can finish them. Or, a Druid can attack the opponents once or twice, and then leave them for the Creeper to finish while he focuses his attention on fresh, strong enemies. Against particularly hardy enemies it's also useful to prevent their regeneration.\nAll Vines are unattackable by normal means; that is, enemy may not direct their attacks at a vine, but can still hurt them indirectly, such as by area attacks. To compensate, Vines cannot block enemy pathing. The only time a vine may be directly attacked is when it is doing its work; for example, when a Poison Creeper rises to attack an enemy by poisoning them.\nPoison Creeper lays down a \"mat\" of poisonous leaves whenever it attacks for approximately 4 seconds. This mat persists afterwards, even if the Poison Creeper is killed, with the mat duration increasing by skill level. Against groups of monsters the mat of poison leaves is surprisingly powerful. Re-casting Poison Creeper to a different location with unpoisoned enemies lets you effectively cover many areas in such poison leaf mats.\nInternally (in Skills.txt, SkillDesc.txt etc.), this skill is known as \"Plague Poppy\".\nItems.\nOne item grants Poison Creeper skill:\nLore.\n\"A more subtle ally, these intelligent vines travel through the ground and use their cruel thorns to poison any opponents they contact. \""}

These skills focus on dealing magical damage and damage over time attacks (DoT), or preventing your enemies from attacking you. The Poison and Bone skill tree greatly supplements the Necromancer's attack ability.\nBone Attacks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s attack spells focus on dealing magical damage using bones, except for &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt;, which is self-explanatory. &lt;a href=\"Teeth\"&gt;Teeth&lt;/a&gt; is your basic spell, which generates small missiles that spread out in a fan shape. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spear\"&gt;Bone Spear&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful spell that sends a bone missile out in a straight line. It is extremely effective against groups of crowded monsters as it has a piercing ability that can hit multiple monsters in a straight line. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spirit\"&gt;Bone Spirit&lt;/a&gt; is another favorite spell of the Poison and Bone skill tree. Although it can only hit one monster at a time and costs more mana than &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spear\"&gt;Bone Spear&lt;/a&gt;, it deals a lot more damage per hit and can track or hunt enemies.\nCorpse Bombs.\nThe only direct attack spell that doesn't use bones is &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s best attack spells, if not the best. Corpse Explosion deals damage based on the percentage of life the corpse had while it was alive, dealing damage equal to 70%-120% of the monster's total hit points. Corpse Explosion deals both physical and fire-based magical damage over a small to medium sized area, which makes it difficult for anyone to resist its damage. In short, if you need a direct damage spell for your Necromancer, this is it.\nPoisons.\nAs the name of the skill tree suggests, you can also learn poison spells to slowly kill your foes. Your first and most basic poison spell is &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Dagger\"&gt;Poison Dagger&lt;/a&gt;, which adds poison damage to your melee attacks. &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Explosion\"&gt;Poison Explosion&lt;/a&gt; turns an enemy's corpse into a gas bomb. It's ideal in crowded places, but not much anywhere else. The last poison spell is &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Nova\"&gt;Poison Nova&lt;/a&gt;. It can deal large amounts of poison damage over a fairly short time, but it costs a lot of mana to use. It essentially will poison everything on the screen, assuming there are enemies that can be poisoned within your view.\nBone Protection.\nAlong with attack spells, the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; also has several defensive spells in this skill tree. Your first spell is &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Armor\"&gt;Bone Armor&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as a temporary shield that absorbs all physical damage up to a certain amount. The other protective spells, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wall\"&gt;Bone Wall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison\"&gt;Bone Prison&lt;/a&gt;, create temporary barriers to prevent your enemies from reaching you. Although Bone Wall and Bone Prison are fun spells, their usefulness is questioned by some players, whilst others find them useful because they can be used as \"tanks\" because of their increased life in Nightmare and Hell difficulties."}

Those who gaze into them see not their own reflection, but the sum total of emotion that all sentient beings in the universe are experiencing at that given moment. Apart from members of the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s frequented the pools to bask in the tranquil radiance that pervaded the domain. Others lingered here for a chance to enter in discourse with Malthael, though few were graced with such an opportunity. Of Malthael himself, it is said that he spent years on end staring into the &lt;a href=\"Chalad%27ar\"&gt;Chalad'ar&lt;/a&gt; here. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; believed that the chalice was filled with water from those pools.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; entered the realm after taking on the Aspect of Wisdom, he found the area to be cold and desolate, as if it existed just beyond the reach of Heaven's light. A silence that Tyrael almost found painful to endure pervaded the realm, and its crystalline cisterns and founts that had once sung with living light had all run dry. This remained true when the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; entered Heaven through this realm. They found themselves bombarded by all manner of visions, but were able to resist the psychological onslaught.\n&lt;a href=\"Winged%20Assassin\"&gt;Winged Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s were once &lt;a href=\"Sages%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Sages of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; who,\u00a0in return for their vow of eternal silence, were free to roam Pools of Wisdom, learning nearly everything about the past, the present, and even part of what would come."}

However, misfortune followed these relics, and eventually, the port stopped seeing them.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the town was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Fetish\"&gt;Fetish&lt;/a&gt; and set ablaze.

In response, Westmarch offered &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to attack the Fetish in their own &lt;a href=\"Fetish%20Village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompounding issues was the plague that was spreading across Bilefen, which reached the port and caused its animals to start dying. &lt;a href=\"Foul%20Raptor\"&gt;Foul Raptor&lt;/a&gt;s were suspected to be the vector, and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were requested to clear thin their numbers.\nIn-game.\nThe port appears as a zone in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

{"id": "4134", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4134", "title": "Portal", "text": "A Portal is a &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al passage that will &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; a person, creature or cargo to another area. Unlike plain Teleport, which is transporting the bearer (or target) alone through the effort of mind and magic, Portals are gateways that can exist for continuous time. Portals can be passed through by anyone, even non-mages, if they can physically fit into the wormhole. Some portals are temporary or even one-use only, while others can exist (and remain active) for aeons.\nPortals, like &lt;a href=\"Waypoints\"&gt;Waypoints&lt;/a&gt;, transport the player to another location. One key difference between them is that Waypoints can only teleport the player to areas that he/she has already been to, while portals are sometimes the only way to new or inaccessible areas.\nPortals are most often blue or red, though other variations also exist. Generally, red color indicates that the portal was opened by the magic of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;, with some exceptions.\nDiablo.\nBlue &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;s were introduced in the very first \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" and have remained a relatively consistent aspect throughout the series.\nTown Portals can be opened with a &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Scroll of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; to grant a quick return to &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Altar\"&gt;Unholy Altar&lt;/a&gt; is the only red portal in Diablo.\nDiablo II.\nPortals become even more predominant in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" with multiple &lt;a href=\"towns\"&gt;towns&lt;/a&gt; and many more locations available, with some being completely inaccessible until a portal to them is opened.\nBlue Portals.\nBlue portals are always Town Portals, and thus give access to the Act's respective towns. They can be summoned by NPCs, certain , as well as players by use of a Scroll of Town Portal.\nOnce the player summons this portal, it only dissipates if the player that cast it goes through and returns. So it is very useful in co-operative play to have 2 party members create portals so that the entire party can go back to &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"heal\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"repair\"&gt;repair&lt;/a&gt;. Just make sure that the players who summoned the portals go through each other's portals and not through their own portal.\nRed Portals.\nRed Portals are more powerful and permanent portals which never dissipate unless their use is finished.\nThey link many inaccessible areas in the world of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is a list of all the areas linked by Red Portals:\nThe portal to Tristram can only be opened by touching the &lt;a href=\"Cairn%20Stones\"&gt;Cairn Stones&lt;/a&gt; in a specific order, as found within the &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Inifuss\"&gt;Scroll of Inifuss&lt;/a&gt;. This can only be done whilst one the &lt;a href=\"Search%20for%20Cain%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Search for Cain&lt;/a&gt; quest.\nThe portal to the hidden Canyon of the Magi is opened by reading &lt;a href=\"Horazon%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Horazon's Journal&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the journal is guarded by &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;The Summoner&lt;/a&gt;. To get to the Arcane Sanctuary, players must find a hidden portal beneath the &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; Palace (in the former cellar of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; fortress).\nThe portals to Abbadon, the Pit of Acheron and the Infernal Pit are extra areas that can be used for levelling and item hunting.\nIt may be useful to know that the portal to Nihlathak's Temple will not close unless the &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;Waypoint&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Halls of Pain&lt;/a&gt; is activated. This may be useful to farm &lt;a href=\"Pindleskin\"&gt;Pindleskin&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"unique%20monster\"&gt;unique monster&lt;/a&gt; famous for high level drops.\nThe portal to the Moo Moo Farm is created by transmuting a &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Tome of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Wirt%27s%20Leg\"&gt;Wirt's Leg&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;. It gives access to the legendary &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;Secret Cow Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfernal Gate.\nIn addition to the more typical portals, the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Harrowing\"&gt;fourth act&lt;/a&gt; is reached by entering the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt;, ritually summoned by the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the namesake of the third act: &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;The Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt;. It is red-orange and horrific to behold.\nIn-game, this gate is simply labeled as \"Portal\".\nDiablo Immortal.\nPortals are also featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". They are used to travel to specific waypoints when the player is not at a waypoint. Each &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; has a different animation when summoning a portal. The appearance (and at times, the animation) of portals can be changed with &lt;a href=\"Cosmetic%20Sets\"&gt;Cosmetic Sets&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"portal%20scroll\"&gt;portal scroll&lt;/a&gt; is granted to the player in the &lt;a href=\"Prologue%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;prologue&lt;/a&gt;, which gives the player the ability to summon a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; (though the portal scroll is only seen as a yellow glow in the activation of a town portal). Town portals are used to return to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; from anywhere in the map, and to prematurely exit dungeons.\n&lt;a href=\"Hell%20Portal\"&gt;Hell Portal&lt;/a&gt;s are portals linking a location on Sanctuary to another in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. They are characterized by the corrupted growths around them (for permanent portals only), and their burning edges. Examples are the permanent portals that serve as the entrances to the &lt;a href=\"Domain%20of%20Horror\"&gt;Domain of Horror&lt;/a&gt;, and the one &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; created beneath the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Sescheron\"&gt;Ruins of Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; that links the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt; zone to the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Realm of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;. A variant of Hell Portals called Infernal Hollows serve as the entrance to hidden &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s in Frozen Tundra, Realm of Damnation, and &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint\"&gt;Stormpoint&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnstable portals have a chance to appear in &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rift\"&gt;Elder Rift&lt;/a&gt;s. They are granted by the rift modifier \"Instability\". These are portals with no set destination. Enter them at your own peril, or benefit.\nDiablo III.\nIn addition to waypoints and Town Portals (which can now be summoned at will, without scrolls), some portals also exist in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, leading to following locations:"}

They are used throughout the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;\"Diablo\" series&lt;/a&gt; in varying capacities for recovery, enhancement, and protection.\nLore.\n\"One form of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; that is still strong in the West is the brewing of elixirs that can have a variety of beneficial effects on the imbiber. By far the most common of these draughts are healing potions, which can instantly mend torn flesh and knit broken bone back together. &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; potions are infused with raw magical energy to restore the abilities of spell casters that have expended their power. &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;The old church&lt;/a&gt; is sure to have a strong supply of both types of potions, as the clergy used them to care for the sick and wounded. Locals skilled in herbcraft may also be able to supply your character with potions, for the right price. It\u2019s known that the greatest of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; alchemists created strange concoctions that permanently affected the drinker.\"\nDiablo I.\nConsumable Potions.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", potions can be consumed to help the character by replenishing &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potions\"&gt;Potions of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Potions\"&gt;Potions of Mana&lt;/a&gt;, or both with &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation%20Potions\"&gt;Potions of Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach type comes in two levels, a regular potion and a full variant. The normal ones instantly recover a portion of their respective stat, while the full potions instantly recover 100%.\nElixirs.\nElixirs are prevalent in Diablo I, adding 1 point to the appropriate &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; when they are consumed.\nIn \"\", &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Magic Elixirs&lt;/a&gt; completely refill a character's mana, and &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Vitality\"&gt;Vitality elixirs&lt;/a&gt; completely refill a player's life. &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Strength elixirs&lt;/a&gt; provide no bonus other than to the stat they boost.\nAs well as being dropped by monsters in the lower levels of the dungeons, elixirs are sold by both &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; in single-player mode after having reached &lt;a href=\"Level%2013%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Level 13&lt;/a&gt; in regular Diablo, and also after visiting the Nest and/or the Crypt in Hellfire, although Adria sells them infrequently. Adria also sells them on a random basis in multiplayer to players who have attained lv. 26 . All elixirs cost 5000 &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and elixirs of Vitality cannot be purchased.\nThey lost popularity because players thought the elixirs 'broke' the game. Their easy availability from Pepin the Healer at higher levels as well as the infamous item cloning trick led to many balance issues. It created a large number of characters with full stats fighting at low levels. Because of their infamy, elixirs were only available in Diablo II as quest rewards.\nDiablo Demo Elixirs.\nThe Elixirs used in the game's alpha were a bit more randomized, more often than not adding more than 1 point into the stat they affected. In addition, there were elixirs with effects that are negative, subtracting 1 to 5 points from one attribute.\nDiablo II.\nConsumable Potions.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", many types of potions can be consumed to help the characters by replenishing &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stamina\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; or curing &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrowing Potions.\nOther potions are used as deadly weapons that are thrown, they are carried in stacks like other &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Weapons\"&gt;Throwing Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. There are two classes of throwing potions, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Potions\"&gt;Poison Potions&lt;/a&gt; which deal &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Potions\"&gt;Fire Potions&lt;/a&gt; which deal &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage. To use them, simply equip them as one would any weapon. Some monsters, such as the &lt;a href=\"Slinger\"&gt;Slinger&lt;/a&gt;, use them against players.\nLater in the game, their small damage is negligible. However, during the early and middle stages of the game, these potions are rather effective, allowing players to barrage oncoming monsters with area of effect damage. These potions are often more effective in dungeons and enclosed areas, as enemies will have less space to maneuver and will often clump up.\nElixirs.\nElixirs made a small comeback in Diablo II, but only as quest rewards. These mystical elixirs which may be brewed by talented alchemists like &lt;a href=\"Alkor\"&gt;Alkor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. They permanently raise a character's &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; by a fixed number. The only example is the &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Life\"&gt;Potion of Life&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nPotions have seen a reduced capacity in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAll resource-regenerating potions have been removed from the game.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Health%20Potions\"&gt;Health Potions&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0still exist, but have been partially replaced by &lt;a href=\"Health%20Globes\"&gt;Health Globes&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0as a main source of in-combat and mid-combat healing. The remaining healing potions share a single 30-second cooldown among all types. As of patch 2.0, there is only one level of regular health potions, restoring 60% of maximum life regardless of level. Potions do not interrupt any other actions, and can be drunk even while channeling an attack, but cannot be used while &lt;a href=\"Frozen\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;ned.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", elixirs are partially implemented in legendary health potions, which are endless (not consumed upon drinking, but can still be &lt;a href=\"salvage\"&gt;salvage&lt;/a&gt;d), require level 61 and provide additional effects after healing:\nDevelopment.\nA couple elixirs (Elixir of Willpower, and Elixir of Vitality) were seen in pre-release gameplay, but were removed from the final game.\nBefore patch 2.0, Health Potions existed in ten levels of quality, with each level after the lowest one possessing a level requirement. Like in Diablo I, they healed a fixed amount instantly rather than over time. However, the fixed amount was not a percentage.\nOffensive potions will not be added to Diablo III\u2014they are meant to be defensive in nature.\nOriginally, the game was supposed to feature Power Potions, which would increase &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt; chance to 100% for 30 seconds, described as follows:\n\"\"How many tyrants and fools have traded their lives for one chance at victory? Such power comes with great risk.\" \u2014Warzecha's Treatise on Magical Means\"\nDiablo IV.\nElixirs return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". They can be gained through &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s, who use &lt;a href=\"herbs\"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; to craft elixirs. Some elixirs can be found/obtained beyond alchemists (e.g. &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; rewards), but this is rare. Only one elixir can be applied at a time, and will last up to 30 minutes. If a player applies an elixir while one is already active, the original elixir's effects will instantly expire."}

These passive synergies also apply to mercenaries.\nPrayer can be activated to help keep &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; and party members alive in non-intense combat and recover between battles, as the amount of life healed before the next engagement is usually negligible.\ufeff\n&lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;Redemption&lt;/a&gt;, available at Level 30, provides much higher healing for monster &lt;a href=\"corpses\"&gt;corpses&lt;/a&gt; rather than Mana.

{"id": "2521", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2521", "title": "Priests of Rathma", "text": "The Priests of Rathma, otherwise referred to as Rathmites, Rathmians, and Speakers of the Dead, are an order of &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s who base themselves in the eastern jungles of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nPractices.\nOf all the practitioners of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, none are so widely maligned and misunderstood as the Priests of Rathma. It is rare to catch a glimpse of a priest in the midst of their dark affairs.\nAs with most users of magic, the priests of the cult of Rathma hail from the far Eastern jungles. They reside in a &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;vast underground city&lt;/a&gt; located deep within those jungles. Their specific geographical locale is particularly secluded, however, preventing their assimilation into a formal &lt;a href=\"mage%20clan\"&gt;mage clan&lt;/a&gt;. But it is this same isolation that allowed them to pursue their distinct kind of arcane science. For it is through the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, as well as through years of research and physical experimentation, that these men and women have come to understand and hold sacred the delicate &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt; of life and death and are able to twist the line that borders the two. For although the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;minions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; have long possessed this power, among mortals the knowledge to &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;reanimate&lt;/a&gt; and control the dead belongs to these priests alone. It is this practice that has lead outsiders to refer to them as \"Necromancers.\" They truly comprehend the balance of all things, and understand and accept their place in what they refer to as the Great Cycle of Being. \nAlthough their art is considered \"dark,\" and the people of the outside world shun the priests who practice these arts, these mysterious cultists never suffered the epidemic of corruption that plagued the ancient Mage Clans. They will accept any spellwork provided it does not cause its user to become corrupted. Pragmatists in the truest sense, they are above temptation. They see death merely as a natural part of life and do not seek to deny its arrival. Their singular knowledge of the unknown allows them to face death without fear. These ideals, coupled with an understanding of the natural balance between Order and Chaos, explain why they have not fallen prey to the influences of evil. However, their serious demeanor and the powers of life and death they manipulate often lead others to suspect them of having more sinister motives.\nThe Priests of Rathma have often been at odds with the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; church, which has historically used any excuse it could to hunt down Necromancers.\nNecromancers do not sleep much. Instead, they sink into a trance that allows their bodies to get the rest they need while their senses remain active.\nEver since the first days of their order, the priests have collected instruments of power from a variety of sources.\nPriests of Rathma tend to avoid cities, as the masses seldom take kindly to their presence. They do not seek comforts.\nAbilities.\nNecromancers are adept at stealth, and are easily able to blend into the shadows. They are capable of utilizing &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to their powers of necromancy. Necromancers rely on a substance called &lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt;, which can be harvested from beings both living and dead, in addition to the Necromancer's own body. Through this substance, Necromancers are able to summon and command the dead, as well as cast curses upon their enemies. Through Essence, a Necromancer is rarely without power.\nNecromancers prefer to strike from a distance, unleashing destruction from afar. The skeletal undead under their command overwhelm enemies before they have a chance to strike, and the horrific curses the Necromancers employ cripple even the most resistant of demons.\nIn physical combat, Necromancers favor the use of unerring &lt;a href=\"scythes\"&gt;scythes&lt;/a&gt;. Their scythes are used not to hew crops, but to collect the life force of their foes, and to slice open corpses, powering some of their most horrifying spells. Whether they wield massive curved blades at the end of long poles, or curled, light blades more appropriate for finely harvesting organs, Necromancers are deadly with any scythe. They're also trained in the use of &lt;a href=\"phylacteries\"&gt;phylacteries&lt;/a&gt;, which enhance their power over the dead.\nBeliefs.\nThe Priests of Rathma live and die by a simple philosophy: that the eternal struggle between light and darkness is never-ending, and that Sanctuary is threatened by both sides of that war. Only by preserving the Balance and keeping those opposing forces at bay, one can hope to make the world a better place. However, there are certain moral lines the Necromancers refuse to cross.\nThe priesthood resents any force that would treat humanity as part of a cosmic game. They are willing to ally with the forces of Order, but only to the point of restoring the Balance. The Necromancers' long term goal is to rid Sanctuary of all non-mortal intervention. \nThe Necromancers do not see their actions as good or evil, simply obedience in service to the Great Cycle of Being. They view any challenges they face related to the Balance in academic terms. The Necromancers believe that even the slightest imbalance in the Cycle can lead to catastrophe, and strive to use their powers only to serve the Balance, never to upset it. To the priests, the mere presence of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; on Sanctuary upset the natural symmetry of the Balance, and as such they find it abhorant.\n&lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt; is the closest thing the priesthood has to a deity\u2014he is the focal point of the Balance, and it is from him that the Necromancers draw their powers. They believe that it is on Trag'Oul's back that Sanctuary lies. Trag'Oul has not been seen for many years, which carries dire implications, but the priesthood has not lost faith. The priests likewise venerate Rathma, whom they depict as a great writhing serpent.\nThe priests believe that when one dies, their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; passes into the next plane of existence, where they will fulfill another role for the Balance. They believe that numbers influence the Balance, and that certain numbers will shift it in one way or another.\nTraining and Organization.\nMany of the priests' strongest spells were written by Deathspeaker &lt;a href=\"Mykan\"&gt;Mykan&lt;/a&gt; during the early days of the order.\nAfter becoming a member of the priesthood, a Necromancer must forsake any surname they might possess, and any prior affiliation. It takes many years of training to become a priest. When one begins training, they are expected to set emotional connections aside in their quest to uphold the Balance. Necromancers are controlled, calculating individuals. While others might rush headlong into battle, Necromancers are taught to control their emotions in order to better wield their dark magic\u2014lest the powers they wield end up controlling their user instead.\nEvery Necromancer is taught to choose their own path as to how to best maintain the Balance. Few Necromancers reach the end of their natural lives; most perish in their service to the Balance, such is the dangerous nature of their calling.\nThe following ranks exist within the priesthood:\nBy the edict of &lt;a href=\"Kalan\"&gt;Kalan&lt;/a&gt;, all priests are to display bones in their armor as symbols of their mastery over death. Newly anointed priests dress in basic clothes; dark clothing that protects as much as thin vellum and light weaponry\u2014whatever they can scrounge from defeated enemies. Adroit Necromancers face more dangerous foes, and thus exercise more care in protecting exposed areas of their bodies with resistant shoulderpads, leather tunics, and shinguards. Elite Priests of Rathma are frightful visages of calcified bone and marrow, covered head to toe in thick armor that\u2019s resistant even to the most terrifying demons.\nA tradition exists of Necromancers taking on apprentices, though only a few are chosen to join the priesthood, and fewer still manage to master necromancy. When a priest reaches the rank of Master Necromancer, are honored with a few bones from the skeleton minions that once served Rathma. These artifacts are generally used in the priest's gloves.\nThe The &lt;a href=\"Blackthorn%20Arbiter\"&gt;Blackthorn Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; serves as a check against Necromancers who overindulge in their powers, the Arbiter will hunt them down and slay them to preserve the Balance. \nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThe culture of the Priests of Rathma stretches back to a &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23The%20Birth%20of%20Civilization\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; before magic was formalized into strict disciplines. Their culture subsisted in the shadow of the Mage Clans. During the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mendeln%20ul-Diomed\"&gt;Mendeln ul-Diomed&lt;/a&gt; was instructed in the art of necromancy by the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt;, the guardian of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the conflict he was instructed to travel into the jungles of Kehjistan, which were rife with magical energy (and thus a good place to instruct students). Kalan was instructed to gather followers to preserve the Balance, thereby preventing both &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s from having too much sway over &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. In the years that followed, Kalan named his group the \"Priests of Rathma.\" He began to teach others his skills and impart his understanding of the Balance, while recording said knowledge in the \"&lt;a href=\"Books%20of%20Kalan\"&gt;Books of Kalan&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; was constructed, and once properly trained, each of his followers ventured out on their own, seeking places where the Balance had been disrupted and working to restore it. Each of these students would continue the tradition of finding and taking apprentices.\nThe priests strove to uphold the Balance, but always feared that one day, it might be lost. The priests spent many years studying the Balance.\nThere is evidence that the order played a role in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. It is known that after the conflict, the Priests aided the Vizjerei in hiding &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;'s body away from the sight of Men, as it couldn't be destroyed.\nThe Coming of the Three.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;13th century&lt;/a&gt;, the Priests of Rathma had been fighting the servants of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; for centuries in their bid to maintain the Balance. The order engaged in much internal debate as to what the extent of their actions should be.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; to Sanctuary disrupted the symmetry of the mortal realm and that of the Balance itself. This event brought the Necromancers out of their isolation to destroy &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; once and for all, and to rid Sanctuary of non-mortal intervention altogether. Dark forces swelled in both &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;, and the Priests were more stretched out than at any point in their history. &lt;a href=\"Xul\"&gt;One Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; notably allied with a group of fellow heroes who were able to defeat the Prime Evils, though at much cost, including the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. This was a potentially disastrous event, as it left Sanctuary open to angelic and demonic intervention. Dark portents were observed after the Worldstone's destruction, and they tried to decipher them. For the Priests, it was clear that a looming disaster was coming, but they couldn't be sure what form it would take. With the Worldstone gone, demons were able to travel further east than they had done so before, coming into conflict with the priests.\nThe End of Days.\nWith the coming of the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, the Balance was threatened. With Sanctuary in need of their unique powers, the priests answered the call to arms.\nNot long afterwards, the Priesthood became at odds with &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; due to his raising of the dead, and consequent disturbance of the Balance. Many of the priests were killed by the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, Deathspeaker &lt;a href=\"Jurdann\"&gt;Jurdann&lt;/a&gt; among them. While &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; was able to defeat Malthael, the priesthood was left leaderless.\nThe Great Enmity.\nDecades after Malthael's genocide, the Priests of Rathma remained active, yet still feared and despised by the peoples of Sanctuary. Even fifty years after Malthael's genocide, only a few Necromancers remained in the Necropolis.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, the priests infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, disguising themselves as Cathedral priests.\nKnown Members.\nDeathspeaker.\nThe &lt;a href=\"deathspeaker\"&gt;deathspeaker&lt;/a&gt; is the leader of the Priests. Aside from Mendeln, known deathspeakers include:"}

All demons have their point of origin here and if struck down, will reform in time, namely from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. \nLore.\nA network of subterranean caverns runs throughout Hell. Molten rivers flow throughout the realm, numerous mesas feature, and Hell features \"vast planes\" across which &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Beast\"&gt;Siege Beast&lt;/a&gt;s rampage. Hell is cloaked in perpetual twilight, and carries the stench of sulfur. To mortals, walking into Hell is like walking into a blast furnace. Much of Hell has a high temperature, but not so high that &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s cannot withstand it (albeit with discomfort). Hell is said to have \"corrosive influence,\" and this can be seen in the ruins that dot the realm. A series of thoroughfares connect Hell, which are overseen by &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20%28Balrog%29\"&gt;Guardians&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hells were originally divided into seven realms, each corresponding to one of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;, and can geographically be distinguished between upper and lower regions. Every level of Hell exists in a void, with 200 feet separating each level from each other. No walls mark the edge of Hell, and flying creatures frequently travel between Hell's levels. The seven realms are located in the center of Hell, while the outer reaches of Hell are controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Mallet%20Lord\"&gt;Mallet Lord&lt;/a&gt;s. \nHell is rife with war, both external and internal. The &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the most ruthless, hate-filled and aggressive soldiers of mortal wars often come to reside in Hell, residing in fires of eternal punishment.\nAt times, over the centuries, Hell and &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; touch each other in a manner that allows the summoning of demons into the mortal realm to be easier than it might otherwise be.\nThe fires of Hell can be calcified to form &lt;a href=\"scoria\"&gt;scoria&lt;/a&gt;. Even one small ember of Hell could ignite a fire capable of consuming the mortal realm.\nHistory.\nLike all of Creation, Hell was created in the final battle between &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;, the corpse of the latter giving rise to the realm and demons erupting from it as maggots would from a corpse. Unlike Heaven, which has clearly defined borders, the realms of Hell were constantly shifting, the realms of influence varying under the seven &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;. Like Heaven though, Hell was indeed a physical location within the universe, though on the occasion that demonic incursions were launched against Sanctuary \"en masse\", demons erupting from the ground is a common M.O.\nIt was due to Sanctuary's existence that Hell fell into internal conflict. Even after the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; believed that humans could be converted to their creed, while the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; saw their focus on humanity as an unwanted deviation from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. The result was a civil war that resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, though in the aftermath, &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; broke their alliance and fought one another, claiming entire realms as their own. &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; also captured part of Hell as his own domain. By the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Azmodan had held the upperhand in the civil war for quite awhile. By the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, both Azmodan and Belial controlled half of Hell each.\nIt was at this point that the status quo changed. &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; had managed to gather the essences of the six other &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; into himself and after calling all the legions of Hell to his side, assaulted the High Heavens. However, he was struck down and crumbled into dust. Hell's invasion had failed, and it had lost its former lords in a single blow in the process.\nDecades later, during the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Knight\"&gt;mortal force&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; invaded Hell, clashing with a demonic army under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", the lower levels of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; are essentially Hell 'spilling over,' for all intents and purposes.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Hell is explored in .\nThe Hells seem to be similar to that described in Greek mythology, with the paths being made of black stone surrounded by lava and filled with horrible monsters and forgotten sinful souls trapped in their fate.

Predominantly, this is comprised of the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Realm of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;, which is the final zone of the baseline game. An exception to this is the &lt;a href=\"Domain%20of%20Horror\"&gt;Domain of Horror&lt;/a&gt;, which can be accessed from the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt; zone, and is apparently separate from the Realm of Damnation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Verge\"&gt;Abyssal Verge&lt;/a&gt; is implied to be located in Hell.\nDiablo III.\nHell appears in the end of of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", as the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Realm of Sin&lt;/a&gt; 'spills over' into the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , the player(s) must destroy Diablo's demonic portals, which brings them into the Burning Hells. Lastly, when fighting Diablo himself, the Prime Evil turns to his true form and pulls his foe(s) into the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Realm of Terror&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo IV.\nThe player visits the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Realm of Hatred&lt;/a&gt; during of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" in a race against time to prevent &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; from absorbing &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s essence.\nKnown Locations.\nRealms.\nThere are currently eight (known) realms of Hell, each with their correspondent demonic ruler:\nWith the exception of the Realm of Damnation, each of Hell's realms spawned from one of the seven heads of &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;, and each in turn was ruled by one of the seven &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;.

Through long forgotten texts Cholik learned about the demon &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Kabraxis&lt;/a&gt;, who was supposedly powerful enough to grant mortals eternal life. Desperate to extend his life and hungry for power, Cholik started to search for Kabraxis' prison.\nWith the aid of the demon he created a new religion ; the Way of Dreams ; where the followers worshiped the demon himself.

Why send our senses when we can send ourselves?

They spoke of a nearby &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, and that Talva believed it to be cursed. Cadeus scoffed at such a suggestion, instead stating that a creature was behind the village's suffering. If they killed the creature, the suffering would end.\nThe group came to a river where they found a &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt; floating in it, having come downriver. Cadeus pointed out that it wasn't &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; that was behind this, but rather, that the body had been injected with a toxin. He advised the hero(es) to head upriver and follow the bodies. By doing so, they could discover what was behind this.\nCadeus later found the hero(es) in the village by the remains of &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Owen\"&gt;Elder Owen&lt;/a&gt;. As it had turned out, a &lt;a href=\"Maggot%20Brood\"&gt;Maggot Brood&lt;/a&gt; had poisoned the village, killing all its inhabitants bar Owen. While &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Worm\"&gt;Corpse Worm&lt;/a&gt;s had writhed inside him, a beacon taken from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Namari\"&gt;Temple of Namari&lt;/a&gt; had kept him alive, even as the worms consumed him from the inside. Cadeus lamented Owen's fate, but the hero(es) pointed out that there was another beacon on the island, and it could be causing even more damage. Cadeus directed them to &lt;a href=\"Rikari%20Village\"&gt;Rikari Village&lt;/a&gt;, believing that it was in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Fetish\"&gt;Fetish&lt;/a&gt;es. \nCadeus felt somewhat guilty for not being able to save Owens, so he started researching means of making an antidote to the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Death\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. He was able to make a prototype. Later, there was a resurgence of the plague in &lt;a href=\"Port%20Justinian\"&gt;Port Justinian&lt;/a&gt;, and even Cadeus was infected. He enlisted the help of an adventurer to get a sample of infected water, so that he may perfect his antidote.

Cairo witnessed a Barbarian army be besieged by his demons. Only one Barbarian survived the battle\u2014&lt;a href=\"Renit%20the%20Dark%20Stalker\"&gt;Renit the Dark Stalker&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing an opportunity, Cairo planned to use the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; as a pawn, to get him to wear the gauntlet and see for herself what would happen. To this end, she presented herself as being a Necromancer of little power, calling for aid within a tower at the sight of &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s. Cairo could see Renit's lust for vengeance and told him that her breathren had been slain (a truth, but claiming that it had happened recently rather than years ago). She told him of the Hand, and how it could be used to defeat their common enemy.\nCairo led Renit to Kanemith, where they entered a tomb beneath the castle, finding the gauntlet worn by a long dead king. At this point a horde of &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s crawled out from the ground. Renit fled with the gauntlet, leaving Cairo to die. Cairo had planned for this and escaped, and saw Renit use the gauntlet against a group of demons, summoning his spectral army to his side. She watched as the spectres slew the demons, after which the king slew Renit, and she realized the truth - the price for using the Hand was to be added to the army.\nCairo &lt;a href=\"revive\"&gt;revive&lt;/a&gt;d Renit and revealed her deceptions. Unfazed by his anger, she destroyed the Jewel of Naz (a component of the gauntlet), releasing the spirits to the afterlife, but gaining their knowledge. In her eyes, this was the true prize. With that done, she rode off, telling Renit that they would not meet again."}

Being good at nothing but war (in his own words), Caldesann became a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, his company got sent to &lt;a href=\"Chizu\"&gt;Chizu&lt;/a&gt; with simple orders: conscript everyone of fighting age, or sack the place. The company was told that the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; was a bunch of settled bandits who'd attacked their neighbors, committing roberies with mass conflagrations. So when they marched in and made their demands, Caldesann wasn't surprised when one of the bandits tossed a fire pot at the man right in front of him, killing him via flame before he could even scream.\nA fight began as more fire pots came the company's way, setting many men on fire, and sending the &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s into panic.\nApparently scarred by his experiences, Caldesann decided that he would never again kill anyone on the battlefield.\nThe Hunt for the Three.\nCaldesann later became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;. He was among those who bound their &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"vessels\"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;. As the Horadrim could not conquer &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, these vessels would store their memories for future Horadrim. Despite his earlier vow to never again kill on the battlefield, Caldesann found plenty of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; awaiting him in the Horadrim's crusade against the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s. However, killing &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s was at least more palatable than killing his fellow &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; beings.\nLegacy.\nCaldesann was apparently haunted by his experiences during the &lt;a href=\"Hunt%20for%20the%20Three\"&gt;Hunt for the Three&lt;/a&gt;; enough for him to become a pacifist. However, his pacifism did not extend to demons. Despite his grim experiences, his memory commented that the best things he did were before the Horadrim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, under direction of the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Iben%20Fahd\"&gt;Memory of Iben Fahd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; awoke Caldesann's &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Caldesann\"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, which imparted tales of its progenitor.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Caldesann\"&gt;Memory of Caldesann&lt;/a&gt; appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". The NPC features in the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Horadrim\"&gt;Legacy of the Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; system, and is obtained once the player inserts the &lt;a href=\"Caldesann%27s%20Compassion\"&gt;Caldesann's Compassion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vessel\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt;. Caldesann himself is seen in a flashback during the quest, but is otherwise represented via his memory.\nDiablo III.\nCaldesann is referenced in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" via the \"Caldesann's Despair\" recipe for &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nCaldesann was a weary, melencholy &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, scarred by his experiences. While he had the ability to use &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, he was wary of it, as using magic to cause others harm prevented its user from \"feeling the injury\" the same way one would when using their own hands. He commented that \"a real warrior's proudest of their retreats.\" \nCaldesann disliked &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, calling him \"a complete mushroom,\" but also commented that he was still tough. That everybody was good at something. His disdain similarly applied to the Horadrim as a whole, considering the best things he ever did to be before he joined the Order. While he became a pacifist, he made an exception for demons."}

Now, it lies in ruins.\nLore.\nCaldeum was run by the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Consortium%20Council\"&gt;Trade Consortium Council&lt;/a&gt;, though became the seat of power for the emperor of Kehjistan after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. Under the emperor, a tribute system existed between the emperor and his subjects. Caldeum was dependent on trade to survive. Jewels were among its most valuable exports.\nCaldeum is surrounded by wastes known as the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;, and is situated atop a long, flat plain that rises above the rest of the desert. The plain ends in sheer cliffs. The city itself had a sewer system, and is surrounded by walls. Its libraries overflowed with undeciphered &lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; knowledge. Outside the city's walls were slums (which include the &lt;a href=\"Caldeum%20Bazaar\"&gt;Caldeum Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;), where crime was rife. In better times, trade tents were set up outside the walls, and were a hub of activity.\nUnlike many other locations, the &lt;a href=\"Vecin\"&gt;Vecin&lt;/a&gt; were welcome in Caldeum.\nA manner of greeting in Caldeum was to kiss the person's hand, then kiss them on each cheek.\nHistory.\nCaldeum is an ancient city\u2014By the 13th century, it had been a hub of trade for thousands of years.\nEarly History.\nCaldeum was built thousands of years ago, even before the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. It was a major hub of trade, serving as \"the trade capital of the entire world.\" However, while it rivaled &lt;a href=\"Viz-Jun\"&gt;Viz-Jun&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; in size, it was never seen as the heart of the Kehjistani Empire (and the people who called it home liked it that way). While Caldeum was technically part of the empire, it behaved as if it were a free entity for much of its existence, and declared itself neutral in regards to conflict within and/or without the empire. In its prime, it was easily able to hold its own against the savage inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt; erupted, the battles were never tolerated to affect trade in Caldeum. It has been opinioned that Caldeum's neutral stance during the conflict saved it from the same kind of destruction that visited Viz-Jun.\nCenturies later, the aftermath, the Trade Council saw an opportunity in the rapidly growing &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith, and allowed its followers to build their enormous cathedral, &lt;a href=\"Saldencal\"&gt;Saldencal&lt;/a&gt;, within the center of the city. Not content to reign supreme in commerce and religion, the Council aspired to make Caldeum a nexus of learning as well. It proposed to unite the &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; academics in a massive new structure - the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; - which remained a center of learning even over a millennium later. \nGolden Years.\nCaldeum had a string of good fortune in the later centuries of the first millennium. With the establishment of the town of &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, Caldeum had a supply of ore and water respectively. With this trinity, Caldeum's dominance over the Borderlands was complete, and it was able to maintain its power through the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Guard\"&gt;Dune Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nDecline.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; suffered the deprivations of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;. A good number of the city's nobles fled their homes and took residence in Caldeum. All manner of horrible rumors as to what had exactly happened in Kurast followed them, and soon afterwards, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20I\"&gt;Hakan I&lt;/a&gt; joined them and made Caldeum the new capital of the empire. Whatever sympathy the people of Caldeum may have had soured quickly, as the nobles' relief turned to entitlement, and then, arrogance. They had no trouble demanding their \"rightful\" place on Caldeum's &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Consortium%20Council\"&gt;Trade Consortium Council&lt;/a&gt;, and were prepared to use their wealth to hire the mercenaries needed to see their ambitions through.\nHakan stepped in to confront the situation, and managed to resolve the dispute between the council and nobles. The people came to support him as emperor, and catastrophe was averted. However, &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; would reflect years later that perhaps Hakan wasn't as successful as first thought, that the tension remained under a veneer of civility.\nWhen Hakan fell ill, his influence started to wane, and the mood in Caldeum changed with his health. As he declined, so did Caldeum. When he died, &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; priests procured an infant from the north as his spiritual successor. After the Zakarum priests' rituals were complete, they employed the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, to retrieve the child. They dubbed him &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt; and installed him on the throne despite his scant years. Caldeum fell into decline immediately afterwards.\nThe End of Days.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, the situation at Caldeum had become dire. Its infrastructure was crumbling. Emperor &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt; withdrew the support of Caldeum from the wastes and left those who live there to their own devices. Caravans became vulnerable to attack, and refugees streamed towards Caldeum, beating against the gates. Rumors spread of a &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;secretive cult&lt;/a&gt; summoning &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; refused to let people into the city. Hakan II, becoming increasingly paranoid, ordered all of his staff to leave the city, lest they be thrown off the walls. Many of Hakan's former staff fled for &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, heading west in caravans. People outside the inner city began to die from hunger and thirst, but the Imperial Guard refused entry.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;'s escape from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the spirits of some of the people began to rise. One villager claimed that there was an underground movement with the aim of deposing the emperor. Food and water was again supplied from the &lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, and the flow of refugees had ceased.\nWhen The Nephalem returned to Caldeum with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, Belial rained fire upon the city. Alongside the Iron Wolves, The Nephalem helped the people flee into the sewers for shelter. After Belial's persona as Hakan II was unmasked, and the Lord of Lies defeated, the real Hakan resurfaced. Asheara and the Iron Wolves remained in the city to rebuild it.\nReign of Enmity.\nPeople still lived in Caldeum decades after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s attempted genocide. Things were now even worse than they were during Belial's reign. When a plague beset Kehjistan, Hakan II ordered the gates of Caldeum sealed. After the gates were sealed, &lt;a href=\"Asheara\"&gt;Asheara&lt;/a&gt; led her &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; out of the city knowing full well they would never return. A number of &lt;a href=\"Crusaders\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; remained in Caldeum while the bulk of their order ventured into &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt; to search for the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Akarat\"&gt;Tomb of Akarat&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaldeum has beneath it one of the only active gates to hell (it is not explained if this gate was newly created, has always existed, or otherwise). Despite the actions of Hakan II to stop the plague from taking hold in his city, nearly half the population dies. Due to this the city is particularly weak and a large portion of it's citizens convert to the Triune under Elias's leadership. &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; intent and using the gateway to access Hell, is let in with open arms and little to no resistance. Those who do not stand with the Triune are either too afraid, or too small in number to act against the majority of the city who allow &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; into the city and summon an army of demons.\nInarius leading a &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Knight\"&gt;Pale Knight&lt;/a&gt; army numbering in the hundreds or thousands descends upon the city and slays any cultists or demons who stand in their way. Unfortunately many of the remaining innocent in the city are also killed indiscriminately for being mistaken or associated with members of the cult. A small contingent of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Iron Wolf&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries did try to help who they could but many are also slain by both demons and Inarius's forces alike.\nAfter the battle Caldeum has become a residual battleground with both demons and cultists having control of a large percentage of the once great city. The survivors have either fled or remain in the palace, or other defensible locations with the remains of both the city guard and mercenaries to protect them."}

Once a boss fight or a plot-relevant event has been completed, it will not appear in subsequent games, unless players manually reset the quest and choose to continue from an earlier point.

They tell of the mad fire that burns in the eyes of all Cannibals, of how eating the flesh of their victims in battle only fuels their hunger for more. They whisper of the unlucky &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; spared in the attacks, hauled off like livestock for the raiders to pick clean until their next hunt. And then, they say no more.\nWhile many regard the Cannibals as mindless brutes, they are more intelligent than many think. At the very least, they have the intelligence to use &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s to spread their terror across Sanctuary.\nHistory.\nNo-one is certain where the Cannibals came from but some legends claim they are a former tribe of s, banished from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; years ago. Whether their cannibalism led to their exile or developed out of desperation afterward is unknown. The outcasts brought their endless hunger to the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and from there spread to the far corners of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; to prey on lonesome caravans and unsuspecting villages. Of what is known as fact, Barbarians make up some, albeit not all of the Cannibals. Years of consuming human flesh has rotted their minds, leaving them no better than rabid beasts.\nIn years past, the Cannibals fought against the &lt;a href=\"Steppewardens\"&gt;Steppewardens&lt;/a&gt; and Barbarians across the Dry Steppes. The conflict apparently ended in the Cannibals' favor as they remained active in the Steppes.\nBy the 1330s, the Cannibals existed in a state of perpetual conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Tribe\"&gt;Crane Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and had also fought against the &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Tribe\"&gt;Bear Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, the Cannibals overran &lt;a href=\"Guulrahn\"&gt;Guulrahn&lt;/a&gt;, and repeatedly attacked &lt;a href=\"Jirandai\"&gt;Jirandai&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors spread that Cannibals had infiltrated towns across the Steppes.\nIn-game.\nThe Cannibals are a &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; family in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". The family has four members. They each have their own unique weapon and a significantly different silhouette or stance to help differentiate them from one another. There are two standard melee combatants: one wielding a two-handed greatsword cleaver, which delivers a slow, sweeping frontal attack; and the other using a lightweight halberd which allows them to leap at players from a great distance and crash down with a devastating attack. The bruiser uses a spiked club in each hand to deliver intense blows that will stun players if they aren\u2019t paying attention. By contrast, the dual-axe-wielding swarmers can unleash a flurry of frontal attacks that will quickly kill if left unchecked. However, this is a less binary pass/fail than the bruiser\u2019s stun attack. If the player finds themselves surrounded by flurrying swarmers, getting hit by the bruiser\u2019s dazing blow would remove all possibility of escape.\nBy design, the Cannibal family has no ranged units. Instead, they spring at the player with supernatural swiftness. Some may close the gap by leaping over obstacles and would-be competitors, while others will swiftly and deftly maneuver through other monsters to get first blood."}

It is almost an essential attribute to have for melee characters, particularly in difficulty. It prevents the slowing effect of &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Damage\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; attacks from affecting the character, thus allowing that character to continue moving and attacking at their normal speed. This attribute does not, however, affect cold damage, nor does it prevent &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt; from slowing down the character. The latter is because Decrepify is not a cold-based attack and the former is because the designers decided that Holy Freeze would override Cannot be Frozen.\nOnce affected by chilling, activating the attribute, such as switching to a weapon or shield which possesses it will not override the effect and will have to wait out the chill from \"that particular attack\" before the immunity to chilling will work again. So being chilled by a Cold Arrow from a monster, switching to Rhyme and then being hit with a monster level Frost Nova a second later, a character will only have to wait out the Cold Arrow's freeze, not the Frost Nova's duration.\n=Items=\nThe number in the brackets indicates the level needed to use the item(s)."}

It is here &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; is located, along with six smaller tombs, which serve as decoys. The Canyon can only be accessed through a portal found within the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, after which players can activate a &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s - &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; - were banished to the mortal realm by the combined effort of the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;. Here they caused mankind untold suffering and grief. Eventually the archangel &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; intervened and provided the ancient &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; brotherhood with a special weapon: &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s that could serve as a prison for the demons' vile spirits. Mephisto was captured in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, and before long the Horadrim cornered Baal in the deserts of Aranoch.\nCapturing Baal proved to be difficult, however. During his struggle against the Horadrim, Baal managed to shatter his soulstone. The largest shard was not powerful enough to contain the demon. The Horadric mage &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; selflessly volunteered to serve as the soulstone's extension: he would bond with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; before being stabbed with the remaining shard of the soulstone, so he could wrestle with the Lord of Destruction for all eternity.\nTo safeguard Tal Rasha and prevent anyone from freeing Baal, the Horadrim sealed Tal Rasha within an ancient Tomb. The only key to unlock &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Chamber&lt;/a&gt; would require the possession of &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Staff%20%28item%29\"&gt;Horadric Staves&lt;/a&gt;, which they guarded fiercely. In order to further confuse any would be adventurer, the Horadrim placed the tomb amongst six False Tombs.\nThe tombs are located on the northern and upper eastern sides of the area. &lt;a href=\"Urn\"&gt;Urn&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; as well as broken statues and skeletons litter the ground. The region is filled with &lt;a href=\"Slinger\"&gt;Hell Slingers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Maggot\"&gt;Sand Maggot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Demon\"&gt;Scarabs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wendigo\"&gt;Brutes&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo further confuse the player, the seven tombs are all named \"Tomb of Tal Rasha\". The only way to determine which tomb would be the real one is by comparing the ancient symbol/glyph found near the entrance to the tomb with the one found in the Quest Log after completing the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary (quest)&lt;/a&gt;. Players can therefore skip the six False Tombs, though they contain many monsters (including several &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt;) and a golden chest.\nThe True Tomb of Tal Rasha is much larger than the six False Tombs. Additionally, the True Tomb contains the &lt;a href=\"Orifice\"&gt;Orifice&lt;/a&gt; needed to gain entrance into Tal Rasha's Chamber.\nDevelopment.\nThis area is called \"Valley of the Kings\" in the files.

During the siege, a &lt;a href=\"Siegebreaker%20Assault%20Beast\"&gt;Siegebreaker Assault Beast&lt;/a&gt; was unleashed upon the fortress, though Haile and 100 soldiers were able to bring it down. On the ninth day of the siege, Commander &lt;a href=\"Calderos\"&gt;Calderos&lt;/a&gt; planned to lead a charge out of the keep on the following day, intending to scatter the demons. Haile commented that Calderos could \"commit suicide by stupidity\" if he wanted to, but he'd be damned if he sent any of his men with him.\nBy the time &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; arrived, Haile was down to just four soldiers. With The Nephalem's aid, his men was able to raise one of the catapults, holding the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s at bay. Haile told The Nephalem that it was an honor to fight at their side.\nHaile encountered The Nephalem again later in the battle at &lt;a href=\"Rakkis%20Crossing\"&gt;Rakkis Crossing&lt;/a&gt;; all of his men had perished during the charge against Azmodan's lair. The Nephalem aided him in fighting off a group of demons.\n&lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, but &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; betrayed her allies, killing numerous people in the keep, and allowing &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; to be reborn. Haile survived, but fell into despair, suffering from survivor's guilt, and asking what the point of it all was\u2014to hold off Azmodan long enough for Diablo to return? The Nephalem pointed out that there were still those who relied on him, but he bitterly pointed out that his men had as well, and they were now dead.\nThe Nephalem travelled to Heaven and returned to Bastion's Keep as necessary. Haile reacted in awe that The Nephalem was still alive. Inspired by their actions, he resolved to do what he could to keep up spirits within the fortress. Towards the end of the battle, Haile asked them to think of his lads when they struck &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; down.\nThe Fall of Westmarch.\nWhile exploring &lt;a href=\"Briarthorn%20Cemetery\"&gt;Briarthorn cemetery&lt;/a&gt; you may encounter Haile with several soldiers, he greets you as a friend before a horde of &lt;a href=\"reapers\"&gt;reapers&lt;/a&gt; attack in 3 waves ending with &lt;a href=\"Ankou\"&gt;Ankou&lt;/a&gt;.

The player can later find Haile himself in Westmarch, where he helps slaughter a large group of reapers before departing. Captain Haile appears again later on, reunited with his daughter.

While humble and introverted, he proved himself to be a capable leader when &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; was assailed by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nRumford's ancestry goes back to the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;. His ancestor was one of &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;'s most loyal lieutenants. The soldier came to settle in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;.\nRumford himself lived in/near &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. His grandfather told him stories of ancient heroes who performed impossible feats, but also told his grandson that he looked like a &lt;a href=\"Quill%20Fiend\"&gt;Quill Fiend&lt;/a&gt;. He was, in Rumford's words, \"a strange man.\"\nIn Khanduras, Rumford worked as a farmer, and also served as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Militia\"&gt;Tristram Militia&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231284\"&gt;1284&lt;/a&gt;, he met &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, who had arrived in the village alongside his adopted niece, &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;. He made a good impression on Cain.\nThe Fallen Star.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;following year&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;fallen star&lt;/a&gt; descended from the &lt;a href=\"Heavens\"&gt;Heavens&lt;/a&gt; above New Tristram, causing the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; to rise from their slumber. When Leah emerged from the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, she told the militia that undead were pouring out of the cathedral. Rumford and fifteen other militia marched upon the cathedral under the command of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Daltyn\"&gt;Captain Daltyn&lt;/a&gt;, and while they did well at first, the dead just kept coming. Only Rumford survived, and he returned to New Tristram, now the captain of the miltia.\nRumford and the remaining militia held the gates of New Tristram against the undead for six days. Morale sagged. The situation improved when they were aided by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, who was able to make short work of the creatures. Rumford told them that if they wanted to learn about the fallen star, they should talk to Leah. As The Nephalem entered the town, he ordered the guards to burn the bodies, lest they rise again.\nThe Nephalem returned, and told Rumford that they intended to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Dead\"&gt;Risen Dead&lt;/a&gt;. He told them to strike at the &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Mother\"&gt;Wretched Mother&lt;/a&gt;s. When The Nephalem returned to New Tristram, victorious, Rumford told them to talk to Leah. She hadn't given up hope of finding her uncle, and he wanted the hero to talk some sense into her.\nIn truth, Leah set out with The Nephalem to rescue Cain. With The Nephalem gone, the militia were left to defend the town. Rumford reduced the rations to halves and quarters.\nIn-game.\nCaptain Rumford appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".

Upon leaving &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and heading towards the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ruins\"&gt;Old Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, he can be found lying dead at the bridge.\nHis ghost/&lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; has a chance to appear in &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt;, but upon interaction, he will accuse &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; of letting greed drive their actions, and failing to save him.

He served in the Navy. Along the way, he \"lost a few friends.\"\nThe Black Road.\nTollifer captained the \"&lt;a href=\"Lonesome%20Star\"&gt;Lonesome Star&lt;/a&gt;\". c. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;1263&lt;/a&gt;, he and his ship faced a ship of undead sailors while on patrol. The fighting was hard and brutal, but the crew were able to prevail.\nA few months later, Tollifer commanded a mission to rescue &lt;a href=\"Lhex\"&gt;Lhex&lt;/a&gt;, nephew of King &lt;a href=\"Cornelius\"&gt;Cornelius&lt;/a&gt;, from the clutches of pirate captain &lt;a href=\"Aribar%20Raithen\"&gt;Aribar Raithen&lt;/a&gt;. He sent some of his men into &lt;a href=\"Tauruk%27s%20Port\"&gt;Tauruk's Port&lt;/a&gt; to conduct the operation. Lhex was successfully rescued, though not all the sailors made it back alive. He talked to &lt;a href=\"Darrick%20Lang\"&gt;Darrick Lang&lt;/a&gt; concerning the death of &lt;a href=\"Mat%20Hu-Ring\"&gt;Mat Hu-Ring&lt;/a&gt;, stating that his presence was expected at the funeral. He told Lang that he considered Hu-Ring to be \"one of the few good men\" born in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0and that he was privileged to have known him, though confirmed that he wouldn't let such sentiment show at the man's funeral. After said funeral, he took advantage of the wind to get the \"Star\" back to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nNine days after arriving in Westmarch, Tollifer came to Lang, who'd become embroiled in a tavern brawl with some mercenaries.

He had no compunction against leaving men behind if the situation called for it, though did have compassion for those under his command, even if protocol dictated that he maintain decorum. He didn't allow smoking on his ship, and ordered that no man drink alone while in port. He frowned on officers for fraternizing with the crew. Physically, he was a tall, solid man, with graying hair and lamb-chop whiskers."}

Though their origins remain unknown, the death and destruction wrought by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s in the western lands has done much to increase their numbers. These poisonous pests litter the fields and dungeons of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; and do not shy away from attacking living creatures. &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; said that &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; used to call these creatures \"Death with wings\".\nIn-game.\nCarrion Bats count as Beasts. They are encountered in Acts I and II, both in dungeons and in open fields. Whilst not much of a threat on their own, as their numbers grow they can become a significant threat to lower level players. Carrion Bats are continuously spawned from the grotesque &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Nest\"&gt;Carrion Nest&lt;/a&gt;s. It is advised to always look for a nest when encountering bats and take it out first, after that the remaining bats should not be much of a problem.\nThough the Carrion Bats lack any special abilities or spells, a potent poison courses through their bodies, meaning that their attacks deal additional Poison damage. Cave-inhabiting bats are often infused with Lightning, dealing extra Lightning damage instead.\nCarrion Bats are generally weak and can often be one-shot by the numbers. In area's with multiple nests players run the risk of being swarmed by bats, and in large groups their attacks certainly hurt. Remember that they can fly over impassable terrain, or even ascend from the pits to ambush the player.\nIn , they are replaced by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vile%20Bats\"&gt;Vile Bats&lt;/a&gt;, which have similar traits.\n&lt;a href=\"Zao%27Kapazao\"&gt;Zao'Kapazao&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Mage\"&gt;Thieves Guild Summoners&lt;/a&gt; can summon Vile Bats at their side, which are a variant of Carrion Bats."}

In the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, they freed &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, who became their ally in their journey to find the &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; carrying Diablo's &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring their travels to the east in order to find the wanderer, Carthas and the other heroes managed to slay &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; in the depths of &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, the city of the Zakarum, at the heart of the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. This feat had Carthas revered as a hero and immortalized by the Zakarum faith, with his triumph over Mephisto being depicted in many tapestries. However, Mephisto's putrid evil radiated from the twisted corpse of his former host, &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;Sankekur&lt;/a&gt;, and his influence seeped into Carthas' mind, slowly corrupting the paladin.\nCarthas and the heroes eventually managed to destroy Mephisto's soulstone at the Hellforge, as well kill Diablo and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;.\ndefender of the black tomb.\nFollowing the defeat of the Prime Evils, Carthas departed back to &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;, carrying the body of Sankekur with him, taking on the mission to guard it in a place where its corrupted influence could cause no more harm. Carthas decided to revive the Paladin Order with the few remaining loyal members that weren't corrupted by Mephisto. They descended deep into the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Rakhat%20Keep\"&gt;Ruins of Rakhat Keep&lt;/a&gt;, a former temple of Zakarum, and prepared a chamber to keep Sankekur's body, sealing it inside a sarcophagus made of obsidian and covered with holy wards; this chamber became known as \"The Black Tomb\".\nCarthas and his Paladins knew that a tomb alone wouldn't be enough to contain the contagion of Mephisto's rooted hatred from within Sankekur's body. For that, they dismembered Sankekur's body, placing its parts in different urns sealed with holy magic, and devoted the rest of their lives in an eternal vigil of the tomb. Unfortunately, the seeds of corruption began to spread, and all Paladins serving under Carthas started killing themselves and turned into &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nReign of Enmity.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; and a Zakarum &lt;a href=\"Crusaders\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ksenia\"&gt;Ksenia&lt;/a&gt; ventured into the depths of the Ruins of Rakhat Keep. Ksenia's plan was to cleanse the corrupted sanctum in order to free the souls of the Fallen Paladins, and purge the evil from Sankekur's body once and for all.\nThe Wanderer and Ksenia managed to exorcise the corrupted ghosts of the Paladins &lt;a href=\"Retinues\"&gt;Retinues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias\"&gt;Mathias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elazar\"&gt;Elazar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alodia\"&gt;Alodia&lt;/a&gt;, who sealed the temple under Carthas' orders. Later, they defeated the spirit of Carthas himself, who revealed the source of his corruption and disappeared.\nUnable to find a way into the Black Tomb, Ksenia gave up, but was satisfied that she was able to free Carthas and his Order of Paladins, honoring their mission and souls.\nPersonality and Traits.\nCarthas was a man of unwavering faith, fully devoted to his oath, duty to the Light and the Zakarum teachings.

It occurred sometime during the 13th century.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the insurrection lie with the death of &lt;a href=\"Korelan\"&gt;Korelan&lt;/a&gt;, grandson of &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;. As Korelan had died without producing any heirs, kingship of Westmarch passed to &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20I\"&gt;Justinian I&lt;/a&gt;, through what &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; would describe generations later as \"a somewhat convoluted interpretation of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; scripture.\" So began the &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20Dynasty\"&gt;Justinian Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. However, many saw the Justinians as usurpers, and they suffered nearly constant challenges to their rule. Finally, during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20III\"&gt;Justinian III&lt;/a&gt;, a full-fledged insurrection broke out in the outlying region of &lt;a href=\"Cartolus\"&gt;Cartolus&lt;/a&gt;. Led by a woman known only as &lt;a href=\"Tyrra\"&gt;Tyrra&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed to be descended from the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, the uprising was immediately seen as a war of the common man against the nobles and their Zakarum strictures.\nCourse of the War.\nCountess &lt;a href=\"Julia\"&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt; attempted to put down the insurrection with her own personal guard, in an attempt to impress Justinian III. The effort failed miserably, as her guard was slaughtered and the uprising spread. Only the countess's enchanted cameo enabled her to survive this folly. It did not save her life, however, as King Justinian was so displeased, he had her tortured and then executed.\nThe uprising reached its head when the peasants managed to storm &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;'s royal palace. The peasants grabbed anything they could find, and killed the more oppressive members of the royal retinue (including the executioners). Tyrra seized control of Westmarch and declared herself empress. However, her rule did nothing to quell the civil war and continued on until she was driven mad and killed by the plague. &lt;a href=\"Cornelius\"&gt;Cornelius&lt;/a&gt;, grandson of Justinian III and a Zakarum lacky, used the opening to crush the rebels once and for all and become the new king.\nAftermath and Legacy.\nThe legacy of the insurrection was felt long after its end. With Cornelius's death, and the passing on of the crown to &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Torion\"&gt;General Torion&lt;/a&gt; was wary of a repeat of the insurrection, given the lack of support for the youth. The history of the insurrection was later chronicled by &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20History%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;The History of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;\", at some point after Justinian IV's ascension to the throne.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; lay waste to Westmarch, history repeated itself once again. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Wynton\"&gt;Lord Wynton&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of Korelan through his grandmother, had long been an aggravator against the crown. As the Reapers butchered their people, Wynton killed Justinian, only to be struck down by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; immediately afterwards."}

The wandering of these groups often brought them into conflict with other peoples, so Cassia was accustomed to fighting to defend her own. She was much sought after as a mercenary\u2014Cassia was loyal to those who hired her, as long as her own ends were also served.\nThe Prime Evils.\nWith the return of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt;, Cassia traveled to &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, where she allied with a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; who were likewise driven to defeat the darkness. In the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, she was the one who freed &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; from his cage. His legs buckled, but she caught him before he fell. He ended up joining them in their quest.\nThe quest culminated with the defeat of the Prime Evils, but also much loss, including the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the warnings of the &lt;a href=\"Horadric\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; scholar &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; as to what the event might portend for &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes disbanded and returned to their homes and families. \nWarmatron.\nCassia was changed by her ordeal, having seen &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;hatred&lt;/a&gt;, terror, and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; firsthand. She decided that if the &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt; were to survive the coming darkness, they needed an army. She thus returned to &lt;a href=\"Skovos\"&gt;Skovos&lt;/a&gt; to begin training her fellow Amazons immediately. She ascended through the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Caste\"&gt;Amazon Caste&lt;/a&gt; to become their most legendary commander. She received the rank of warmatron, and received the warmatron's armor from Queen &lt;a href=\"Xaera\"&gt;Xaera&lt;/a&gt; herself.\nC. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231273\"&gt;1273&lt;/a&gt;, she made an order to &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt; for a ceremonial spear.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nCassia is the canonical representation of the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; class in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHeroes of the Storm.\nCassia is a playable hero in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", representing the Amazon class (\"&lt;a href=\"Javazon\"&gt;Javazon&lt;/a&gt;\" build).\nHer armor is reminiscent of the original Amazon attire, though more complex, with &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; and a shield, complete with a pack of &lt;a href=\"javelins\"&gt;javelins&lt;/a&gt; on the back.\nHer abilities include &lt;a href=\"Avoid\"&gt;Avoid&lt;/a&gt;ance, &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;, Ball Lightning (inspired by &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Strike\"&gt;Lightning Strike&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Fend\"&gt;Fend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Fury\"&gt;Lightning Fury&lt;/a&gt;.

Her skill with the &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; rivals that of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, and she is also adept in the use of &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"javelins\"&gt;javelins&lt;/a&gt;, along with hand to hand combat. With superhuman agility, Cassia relies on &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to enhance her significant martial abilities.\nCassia is tall, and Cain considered her to be beautiful. In her youth, she possessed golden hair, though it turned gray as she aged."}

A large number of monsters tend to be found near each one, but they do not actually need to be defeated to complete the quest, especially if the sentries keep them occupied. With speedy movement skills, the quest can be completed quickly despite the large distance to cover, by moving directly to each objective and skipping most monsters."}

Instead, it struck at the sun in the sky and aimed at the moon and roared of its &lt;a href=\"Dhasocth%20Iyadur\"&gt;Dhasocth Iyadur&lt;/a&gt;: a time without light. In return, the &lt;a href=\"Untameable%20Wilds\"&gt;Untameable Wilds&lt;/a&gt; circle drew Catarag to their glade where they battled it.

It then ignites his sword. In this phase, Catarag adds melee to its combat, which deal higher damage.\nAt about total life, Catarag leaps to the center of the arena, then causes lava to seep from the edges. This created a continuously shrinking circle available for the player to move about. If Nisza is still alive, she clears the lava after a minute. If not, the player has to kill Catarag before everywhere is submerged by lava. Catarag uses most of the attacks of the previous phase, but at higher damage and Attack Speed."}

Once formed just prior to the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, it now exists in new form in the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nOrganization.\nIn both incarnations, the Cathedral of Light's symbol is the Cathedral Cross. \nFirst Incarnation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, the Cathedral operated on the following lines:\nAll men who served the Cathedral were obliged to be clean shaven (in order to emulate the Prophet). Its priesthood wore white robes.\nThe Cathedral maintained its own choir of 200 singers.\nSecond Incarnation.\nDuring the Great Enmity, the Cathedral of Light was a militant order. While Inarius was the supreme leader of the church, &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt; handled the day-to-day operations, and acted as a bridge between Inarius and the rest of his followers. \nWhile Inarius was the focus of the Church's worship, its members still gave praise to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Devotees would make pilgrimages to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%20%28Fractured%20Peaks%29\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cathedral has control over the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. Many &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s provide the Church with tithes, and members of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Penitent\"&gt;Knights Penitent&lt;/a&gt; were also expected/obliged to tithe to the Cathedral.\nRemorseful devotees of the Cathedral must undertake a grueling pilgrimage, journeying across the frigid glacier known as the &lt;a href=\"Serac%20Rapture\"&gt;Serac Rapture&lt;/a&gt;. Only then may their gravest sins be forgiven. The pilgrimage requires the penitent to carry the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20the%20Faithful\"&gt;Idol of the Faithful&lt;/a&gt; along their back; the idol is cursed, sapping the strength and dulling the senses of whoever wears it (supposedly, this is the manifestation of the bearer's sins). The penitent must travel to a series of shrines to remove the curse, before finally making it to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Penitent\"&gt;Shrine of the Penitent&lt;/a&gt;. This process was also required for any who wished to see Inarius. Many died while undertaking the pilgrimage, even Knights Penitent.\nThe Cathedral entombed its honored dead in the &lt;a href=\"Hallowed%20Ossuary\"&gt;Hallowed Ossuary&lt;/a&gt; (at least prior to its corruption) while dead Knights Penitent are cremated.\nThe Cathedral has no tolerance for apostasy. If one strays from the flock, they can be expected to be hunted down by the &lt;a href=\"Tongue%20Rippers\"&gt;Tongue Rippers&lt;/a&gt;. Many members of the Cathedral impose their beliefs through brutal means.\nWhile few in number, a number of s serve the Cathedral as powerful &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. They have little fear of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, pain, or evil, believing their fate written by Inarius himself.\nGospels.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, the Cathedral preached a gospel based on the tenets of tolerance, cooperation, and unity. It was stated that the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the faithful would be gathered at the Prophet's side after &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. It accepted members regardless of caste or race.\nIn its second incarnation, the Cathedral stated that Inarius was the creator of Sanctuary and humanity. In the Heavens' eyes, creating humanity was a sin, and they cast him down (it should be noted that the above claims had elements of truth, but were twisted well beyond what happened before and during the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Rathma%27s%20Prophecy\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt; was incorporated into the Cathedral's gospel, but presented to make it seem that Inarius was a hero destined to save humanity. The gospel also stated &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; would one day return to Sanctuary, and it would be the sin of mankind that would bring her into the mortal world. However, in this chain of events, Inarius would slay Lilith, and be able to ascend into Heaven. The line from the prophecy referring to \"a spear of light, piercing Hatred's heart\" was presented as proof that this was pre-ordained. It was claimed that by this act, Inarius would be given the means to ascend to &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, and bring the faithful with him.\nThe Cathedral considered some, if not all other faiths to be heretical.\nThe idea of \"sin\" applied to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity as a whole in the Cathedral's creed. It was stated that all of mankind was \"born in sin,\" and that the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; could be found through penitence and faith. The Cathedral stressed its followers to resist sin; beyond petty crimes, such \"sins\" included drinking and gambling.\nThe Cathedral's holy &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; (or one of them) was \"&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Words%20of%20the%20Father\"&gt;Holy Words of the Father&lt;/a&gt;\",\nEven after Inarius's death, &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; speculated that the Cathedral would continue to venerate the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSin War.\nThe Cathedral of Light was founded by Inarius in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23-1820\"&gt;-1820&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"the%20Purge\"&gt;the Purge&lt;/a&gt;, he had wandered Sanctuary in grief for ages, but when he learnt of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;, he immediately recognized it for what it was\u2014a front for the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt humanity. Afraid for both himself and humanity, Inarius founded the Cathedral of Light to counter their influence. Taking on the mantle of the Prophet, Inarius disseminated his doctrine from the Cathedral, gaining fame for his youthful physical perfection, and spread the church's influence through angelic powers of pursuasion. Soon, between them, the Triune and Cathedral held sway over much of &lt;a href=\"Estuar\"&gt;Estuar&lt;/a&gt;, and while other faiths had existed before them, the pair had become the two dominant ones.\nThe competition between the Triune and Cathedral marked the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. The status quo between the two bodies was maintained, as agents of both religions carried their messages to the people, building bases of power, constructing monuments, and winning the absolute loyalty of faithful supplicants. While the Triune had been formed decades before the Cathedral, the Cathedral reached parity in terms of influence at an incredible speed. Furthermore, that the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt; were on the verge of war themselves, many in Kehjan flocked to one of the two faiths. The Cathedral established its &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%20%28Kehjan%29\"&gt;primary structure&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;, but established various smaller cathedrals throughout the land. The Cathedral gathered a large flocked, the faithful mixing regardless of race or caste.\nThe Cathedral signed an agreement with Kehjan that gave them authority over certain matters. This included the ability to supersede the authority of &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; guards.\nIn the last year of the Sin War, the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; emerged, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian%20ul-Diomed\"&gt;Uldyssian ul-Diomed&lt;/a&gt;. They moved against the Triune, but while the Edyrem intended to move against the Cathedral next, Inarius initially stayed his hand.\nInterlude.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Gamuel\"&gt;Breath of Gamuel&lt;/a&gt;, a small sect of the Cathedral, survived the body's end, and continued to venerate &lt;a href=\"Gamuel\"&gt;Gamuel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great Enmity.\nAfter returning to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Inarius reformed the Cathedral of Light, intent on using it as a tool to help him return to Heaven. The clergy studied the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, even having bodysnatchers deliver &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s to them, on the basis that studying one's enemy was the first step to defeating them. Based on paintings found in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Light's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that the Cathedral waged war against the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, emerging triumphant.\nThe Cathedral established its base of power in &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, and imposed its authority on the region's culture through ceremonies and rituals. In turn, it incorporated elements of Peaks culture into its own structure. Ancient sites across the Fractured Peaks were torn down, and had their stone repurposed to build new structures devoted to the Cathedral. This was done deliberately, to erase and replace the vestiges of what the Cathedral considered to be superstitious and heretical practices. The &lt;a href=\"Altars%20of%20Illumination\"&gt;Altars of Illumination&lt;/a&gt; were one such example of what the Cathedral erected in the old ruins' stead. Shrines to Inarius were also erected all over the Peaks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the Cathedral, disguising themselves as Cathedral priests.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, this incarnation of the Cathedral had apparently been operating for quite some time, and had done as much harm to Sanctuary as it had good.\nNew Leadership and Schism.\nAfter the death of Inarius and the Cathedral's failed assault on Hell, leadership of the Cathedral fell to Prava. She issued a decree in which she blamed the Horadrim for Lilith's existence, and declared that they were to be eradicated. &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; was not overly concerned\u2014the Horadrim did not exist in any substantive way, nor did the Cathedral possess the power to actually eradicate them, not to mention that the Horadrim still had many friends in Sanctuary. However, he noted that the Cathedral had been wounded, and like any wounded &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; in Sanctuary, their chastening could make them more dangerous than before. While Prava had control of the Cahtedral proper however, Inarius's death caused a schism within the Cathedral. A new militant wing called the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Knights\"&gt;Burnt Knights&lt;/a&gt; struck out on their own.\nThe Cathedral gained new recruits during this period, even as a corruptive force began to grow within the church. Around the same time, a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; plague was sweeping through the Fractured Peaks. Despite the growing fear and &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s, the Cathedral ignored the issue. Even as the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Harvest\"&gt;Blood Harvest&lt;/a&gt; grew in intensity, the Cathedral refused to engage the &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s in combat, and kept their doors shut to the people of Kyovashad.\nIn the deep winter months of the year, the people of Kyovashad revived the &lt;a href=\"Midwinter%20Blight\"&gt;Midwinter Blight&lt;/a&gt; festival. While the Cathedral was not pleased, having previously suppressed the practice, the people wanted a return to their roots.\nBy the time &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; reached &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;, the Cathedral was still in disarray.\nKnown Members.\nReign of Enmity.\nKnights.\n\"For a list of Knights Penitent, see &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Penitent%23Known%20Members\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The Cathedral was designed to invoke the architecture of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, though it was rare that Inarius felt that Heaven's granduer was truly mimicked. Its design included great towers that reached skyward, giving people a view of the surrounding miles. During night, the Cathedral appeared like a glowing beacon, and remained open at all hours, whether it be to pilgrims or lost &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, posing as the Prophet, decreed that salvation of the masses could not cease just because the day was over. The Cathedral included a choir of 200, and its interior could fit at least 3000 pilgrims.\nInarius's Chambers.\nThe Cathedral included personal quarters for Inarius. The quarters were guarded by &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s, though this was purely ceremonial, as even they knew that the Prophet could defend himself better than he could. The entrance to his quarters was a pair of elegantly carved twin doors. When alone in his chambers, he would sometimes take &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic form so he could marvel at himself.\nThe interior of the chambers were sparse. There was a down couch for show (as Inarius didn't require sleep), and beyond that, a collection of the finest glass sculptures and vases from across Sanctuary. The walls bore paintings of every imaginable land in the mortal realm, each painting personally dictated by Inarius himself. An immense mural covered the ceiling, each portion of it displaying creatures of myth. These included angels, though specifically, angels as humans imagined them to be, with feathered wings and gossamer robes. To the careful onlooker, it was clear that the angels were not part of the scenery, but molding it."}

Interestingly, Celia speaks of Theodore as of a living being (which is understandable for a little girl), and until the moment of slaying the Hork Demon, players will not find out that Theo is actually a toy."}

Unlike other &lt;a href=\"Summoning%20Spells\"&gt;Summoning Spells&lt;/a&gt;, it forces slain enemies to fight for the Necromancer instead of simply creating minions with fixed attributes.\nLore.\n\"The ultimate goal of a &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priest of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; is the perfect reanimation and control of a dead creature, maintaining the purity and properties of its body while releasing its soul to allow the Necromancer full control. When a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; at long last gains this ability, he can truly claim mastery of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Cycle%20of%20Being\"&gt;Great Cycle of Being&lt;/a&gt;. \"\nGeneral Information.\nRevive allows the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect a slain monster to fight for his cause. The monster is a shadowy version of what it was before death, but has been brought back stronger than it was with double the &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;. It only lasts for three minutes before it drops to the ground again, however. After that, it may not be revived for the second time.\nRevive benefits from &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Mastery\"&gt;Skeleton Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, which boosts their damage and Life, and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Resist\"&gt;Summon Resist&lt;/a&gt; increases their &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;.\nRevived Monsters possess all the attacks that they had in life; however they will not raise other monsters, even if they had those abilities previously.\nRevived Monsters do not possess pathfinding AI as that of other Necromancer minions. The player also cannot revive the following monster types:\nMoreover, monsters slain by a player having the &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;Slain Monsters Rest in Peace&lt;/a&gt; magic property on any item will not be revived.\nRevived Monsters often die when they are too far away from their Necromancer. Generally it's a good idea to watch the Automap and if the player notices they are getting too far away or disappearing from the Automap, stop and wait for them. Sometimes you have no choice but to leave them behind, but other times you can slow yourself down, allowing them to keep up. An instant revive-collecting solution would be to cast a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; and come back through it again, effectively teleporting all your revives to you. is also helpful, making especially popular with Necromancers who use revived minions.\nFigure out what monsters are the best to Revive for the situation. In cases where it may be difficult to lead a group of ground based Revived Monsters around (such as the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"River%20of%20Flame\"&gt;River of Flame&lt;/a&gt;), choose flying monsters to Revive such as &lt;a href=\"Willowisp\"&gt;Willowisp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Mage\"&gt;Finger Magi&lt;/a&gt;. Some monsters are really great to have, like &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Lord%20%28Act%20V%29\"&gt;Blood Lords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Viper\"&gt;Tomb Viper&lt;/a&gt;s, so you might want to pick them (or whatever your favorite is) over other monsters. &lt;a href=\"Blunderbore\"&gt;Blunderbore&lt;/a&gt;s have a chance of dealing &lt;a href=\"crushing%20blow\"&gt;crushing blow&lt;/a&gt;s, making them a popular choice for &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt;. Making good decisions about which monsters to Revive can be really helpful.\nBefore spending many points in Revive or maxing it out (at 20), take a look at how many Revived you can support at a time. Try an additional point, see if you can keep your Revived at max while you're playing. If you're unable to keep the maximum number of Revived active, don't spend any more points. For each point in Revive only allows a player to create 1 additional monster, so unless you are always at max, placing additional points in Revive is not worth it.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 45\nHit Points: 200% Original\nDuration: 180 seconds"}

The monsters are revived with their exact same &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, abilities and attributes (except the ability to summon other monsters), and they fight for the Necromancer now.\nRevived monsters are visibly different from their normal counterparts: darkened grey, and depending on monster type, they may be transformed into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; versions, provided the model exists.\nThis skill can revive corpses left after actual monsters slain \"and\" corpses generated by skills (even &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Land of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;); any generic corpse, or a corpse left after an immobile monster (such as &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Nest\"&gt;Carrion Nest&lt;/a&gt;) will be raised as a &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Shieldman\"&gt;Skeletal Shieldman&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"elites\"&gt;elite monsters&lt;/a&gt; are revived, a normal version is raised; additionally, one can't revive other players and &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;.

The skill cannot revive allies.\nMinions only function for a short period, and the number of minions the Necromancer can hold at once is both capped at 10 and limited by their short duration. Once they are killed or their duration expires, they cannot be raised again. Unless the Purgatory skill rune is chosen, they also do not leave behind corpses afterwards.\nThe skill costs no &lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt; to cast, and has no &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, so with sufficient corpses, it can be used again and again.\nDevelopment.\nRevive took the most development time for all of the Necromancer's skills, as different skins had to be created for each creature type."}

The revived monster does not give any experience or loot when killed.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt; can also use revive, to more of an effect. For example: &lt;a href=\"Bishibosh\"&gt;Bishibosh&lt;/a&gt; (a Unique Fallen Shaman) can revive normal Fallen Shamans as well as Fallen minions.\nLimits.\nThere doesn't seem to be a limit to how many deaths a monster can suffer before it can't be revived anymore. To counter this, it seems you have to either slay as many monsters in your way and then kill the monster reviving them, lead the monsters away to kill them and then come back to kill the monster reviving them, or destroy the corpses with a spell or item. Some items and spells that can be used to counter Revive include &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Peace\"&gt;Nature's Peace&lt;/a&gt; (and other &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;Slain Monsters Rest in Peace&lt;/a&gt; artifacts), various &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; spells, the 's &lt;a href=\"Find%20Potion\"&gt;Find Potion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Find%20Item\"&gt;Find Item&lt;/a&gt; spells, and the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;Redemption&lt;/a&gt; spell. &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; spells can also be used to destroy corpses by either killing the monster while it is chilled or killing a monster while it is frozen.\nDiablo II: Lord Of Destruction.\nNo new monsters were introduced in \"\" that have this spell.

Unlike the resurrection provided by other reviving monsters, the reborn Reanimated Horde creature gives experience and loot upon death.\nDiablo III.\ns return with this skill. &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Shaman\"&gt;Flesh Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s have a similar ability to raise fallen &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Gorger\"&gt;Flesh Gorger&lt;/a&gt;s. However, summoning new minions is far more common than raising the fallen ones.\nThis ability is easier to counter in the third game, as any &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt; that kills a monster will also destroy their corpse (with the exceptions of corpses that provide a special effect on death, like explosion or creating new lesser monsters).\n&lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;Slain Monsters Rest in Peace&lt;/a&gt; is weaker in this game, due to most such effects not functioning on &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; difficulty."}

Its stats are still present there as a grim reminder to all those Hardcore characters who lost their lives to find it.\nUnofficial Lore.\n\"Spawned from the very bowels of the skulking Stygian Beast who awakens only once every 1000 years to feed off the spawn of its own bile and pus, the Reziarfg is truly the most hideous and vile monster in all of the Three\u2019s bestiary. It was once said that the Three did not always rule the darkness that beasts beyond thought swelled and slithered across the void. It is believed that some of these nightmares may still exist hidden deep within the pitch of the abyss where even the darkness of the upper realms of hell seems like day. This is where Reziarfg lives.\"\nCreation.\nThe Reziarfg was created by Blizzards Battle.net staff as part of an un-official joke for April Fool's Day, 2003. Its name was derived from one of the staff regulars on Battle.net, G. Fraizer. Because it was put up on the Arreat Summit with only its stats and some official sounding lore reproduced above, many gamers derived their own theories to find the enigma that was Reziarfg in their realms.\nWays to \"find\" it.\nSome speculated that the mysterious beast was part of a future major patch as an Uber Monster for the realms. So, when the game overhaul of was released, there was a flurry of excitement when their speculation was found half-true. There were new Battle.net only quests but no Reziarfg. So some more unscrupulous gamers thought of more ways to find the elusive beast. \nSome of these \"methods\", most of which require &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;, are described below:\nEastern Sun.\nHowever, a creature named Reziarfg appears in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Sun\"&gt;Eastern Sun&lt;/a&gt; mod. It is the boss of a small but very hard sublevel beneath the uber levels &lt;a href=\"Naraku\"&gt;Naraku&lt;/a&gt; level 1 and 2, called the &lt;a href=\"GFraizer%20dome\"&gt;GFraizer dome&lt;/a&gt; (Reziarfg read from behind). Reziarfg appears left of the little river in the level and is apparently based on the apparition of &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; as it looks quite similar in form and behaviour and also asks the player: \"Looking for Baal?\". Different from Duriel, Reziarfg doesn't use the (Un-)&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt; Aura, but the newly introduced &lt;a href=\"Acid%20rain\"&gt;Acid rain&lt;/a&gt; spell available to the Druid.

Warriors from different clans gathered to defeat him. After a long battle, they couldn't kill it. Instead, they drove it into a lake, and froze the lake before Rhewilf could get out. Using runic swords, the Barbarians erected a ward around Rhewilf, to keep the lake frozen for all time and Rhewilf trapped within it. Some of the Barbarians stayed back to stand eternal vigil over Rhewilf and make sure nothing frees it.

The Warden of Everfrost has always kept vigil, and employed the help of adventurers to resheathe the swords and kill the thralled yetis. But with the destruction of Mount Arreat, people have started to migrate from the Frozen Tundra. At a time there will be none to resheathe the swords, and Rhewilf will rise again.\nIn-game.\nA frozen Rhewilf can be seen at the Everfrost Lake in the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt; zone.

They appear once the player's progress bar has reached 100%. The Guardian is chosen randomly, regardless of the map's type or enemies encountered during the Rift. Each Guardian has 35%\u00a0&lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0above an average &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;Act Boss&lt;/a&gt; for the corresponding difficulty, greatly increased damage, most (if not all) abilities for their normal monster type, as well as few new ones (sometimes including spawning several minions every few seconds, minions often have unusual abilities too). Some Guardians are the empowered versions of actual bosses of the game, also with new abilities added.

Guardians that can charge target random players (not the closest ones).\nIn &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s, the reward for killing a Rift Guardian is greatly increased with every rank of the Rift itself.

They move slowly and can easily be outrun.\nShould large packs of these monsters prove too much to defeat; try and scatter their ranks with area of affect spells or run back a little to spread them out more.\nBe advised; in some area's, Risen can claw forth from the ground or burst from tombs.

A sacred challenge, the Shadows initiate the Rite if they deem that the &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt; have become too corrupt. Should the Shadows overthrow the Immortals, the Cycle of Strife restarts.\nGameplay.\nThe Rite of Exile is a gameplay mechanic of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", which runs on weeks 4, 5 and 6 of an &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortal&lt;/a&gt; reign. The Rite of Exile sees the top ten Shadow clans sending their eight strongest members to fight the best the Immortals have to offer. This kicks off ten separate simultaneous 8v8 battles. The battles use the same format as &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;, with the Shadows taking on the role of the attackers. The Shadows must win a certain number of battles - 5 on week 4, 4 on week 5 and 3 on week 6. If enough battles are won by Shadows fighters, the dark clan at the top of the Shadows ranking will become the new Immortals and a new cycle begins. Shadows who succeeded in the Rite progress to the &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20of%20the%20Immortal\"&gt;Challenge of the Immortal&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers belonging to both the winning and losing sides will be rewarded with random items (including a guaranteed &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Set%20Item\"&gt;Set Item&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Hilts\"&gt;Hilts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scrap%20Materials\"&gt;Scrap Materials&lt;/a&gt;. These rewards are provided directly after completing Rite of Exile.\nSpectators.\nPlayers can guess whether the Immortals or Shadows will win the Rite of Exile. A gift pack is rewarded with the contents depending on whether the guess was correct. The players who guessed correctly are entered into a lottery where 5 &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Crest\"&gt;Legendary Crest&lt;/a&gt;s are awarded.\nFurthermore, within 1 hour of the event starting, players can guess which side will win each individual battle, but only 5 prediction tickets are available per player. A correct guess rewards 100 &lt;a href=\"Hilts\"&gt;Hilts&lt;/a&gt; while an incorrect one rewards 50.\nOnce the match goes into preparation mode, players can spectate, and make further predictions on who will get the most kills and the most assists. These cost 2 tickets each and pull from the same ticket pool as the match predictions.\nWhenever the Shadows complete a phase of the battlefield, or the Immortals reach 30 kills, a cheering interface comes up where players can rapidly click to cheer for either side for 10 seconds. Clicking enough times unlocks up to 3 chests containing gear, scrap materials and gold.\nPlayers who are participating in the battle can't spectate. As a compensation they are entitled for the full rewards as if they guessed correctly.\nHistory.\nOriginally Rite of Exile was tied to Shadow progression as opposed to following a fixed schedule. The fixed schedule, spectator mode and prediction features were added in the September 21 2023 update."}

It is initiated by talking to &lt;a href=\"Qual-Kehk\"&gt;Qual-Kehk&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Betrayal%20of%20Harrogath%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Betrayal of Harrogath (quest)&lt;/a&gt; has been completed, or when players first enter &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients%27%20Way\"&gt;The Ancients' Way&lt;/a&gt;. \nBefore gaining entrance into the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20Keep\"&gt;Worldstone Keep&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers are tested by the spirits of legendary warriors known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients\"&gt;The Ancients&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Madawc\"&gt;Madawc the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talic\"&gt;Talic the Defender&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Korlic\"&gt;Korlic the Protector&lt;/a&gt;. If the adventurer manages to best the Ancients in combat, they are found worthy of gaining entrance into the Keep, wherein lies the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe quest is completed after the last of the Ancients has been defeated. The player is rewarded with a substantial experience gain, often resulting in &lt;a href=\"Leveling%20Up\"&gt;Leveling Up&lt;/a&gt;. In addition players may now enter the Worldstone Keep where they will face the Lord of Destruction, &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditional Tips and Information.\nPast the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt; you will find &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients%27%20Way\"&gt;The Ancients' Way&lt;/a&gt;; follow this until you find the way towards the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Summit\"&gt;Arreat Summit&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn the center of the Summit the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Altar of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt; can be found. When the player first approaches the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Summit\"&gt;Arreat Summit&lt;/a&gt;, the player should not activate the altar right away. Instead, the player should open a town portal going back to &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; and purchase plenty of extra healing and mana potions that they can't carry on their belt, then return to the Arreat Summit and drop them around particularly at the altar. This strategy is a way to simply replenish any potions used during the fight, since if the player runs low they can easily pick up potions dropped previously rather than go into their inventory. Casting a Town Portal will revert the Ancients back to their statue pedestals which forces the player to restart the fight with the Ancients at full health and having different modifiers.\nAfter activating the Altar of the Heavens, the thee statues of the Ancients come to life and attack the player. The three Ancients each utilize different skills; Madawc uses &lt;a href=\"Double%20Throw\"&gt;Double Throw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shout%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt;, Talic uses &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; and Korlic &lt;a href=\"Leap%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Leap&lt;/a&gt;. The immediate focus should be on &lt;a href=\"Madawc\"&gt;Madawc the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; (double throw Barbarian) since of the three he is the fastest ranged attacker and can send the character into hit recovery/dodge animation/blocking animation much faster than the others, effectively stunning long enough for the remaining two to land fatal blows. If the hero is a melee character, it is especially advised not to directly start attacking neither &lt;a href=\"Talic\"&gt;Talic the Defender&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Korlic\"&gt;Korlic the Protector&lt;/a&gt; until felling Madawc. This is due to Madawc's Shout ability which will increase the enemies defenses to radically high levels, thus making a physical hit much harder to land. Once Madawc is slain, focus should then shift to Korlic the Protector (leap attack Barbarian). This is because though Madawc is the only one of the three with an actual ranged weapon, leap attack acts a pseudo ranged attack and will be the source of many unexpected random hit recovery/dodging/blocking animations while fighting the remaining Barbarian. After Madawc and Korlic are defeated, Talic the Defender should be much more manageable.\nIf you hide behind the pillars on the summit, Madawc will keep throwing axes at you but they can't hit you because of the pillars, so you can easily take care of Korlic and Talic first. If you have trouble fighting all three of them at the same time, try to separate them by running across the summit, with some luck they will stuck at the corners, allowing you to fight one at a time.\nNote that if you happen to leave before all three are killed, their mods will change. At times, they spawn with immunities to different elements. If you feel as though the odds are against you, simply leave and return. Keep in mind that the Ancients can also be aura enchanted and elementally enchanted as well.\nNote: opening a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; mid-fight will reset the Ancients to full health and different modifiers, forcing you to fight them again from scratch. Town Portals that were opened before activating the Altar will disappear when the Ancients awaken.\nDefeating the Ancients grants the player access to the Worldstone Keep. More importantly, it gives a huge boost of experience. There is a limit of 1 level-up during this process.\nThe exact amounts of experience gain are:\nFurthermore, there is one more limitation - the reward is given only if the player is at least level 20 in Normal, level 40 in Nightmare, and level 60 in Hell."}

If you have a powerful character, it can be a decent place to do &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Find\"&gt;Magic Find&lt;/a&gt; runs due to its large size and accessibility. Monsters there can be troublesome to kill, however, boasting various resistances (not to mention a &lt;a href=\"Hephasto\"&gt;Hephasto&lt;/a&gt; that can spawn with some particularly dangerous mods)."}

When they feel a hero passing nearby, they shake the ground violently as they burrow towards them - the location they will emerge can be seen by the earth cracking and rising. Then they emerge abruptly, bursting out and trying to attack the enemy with their jaws. Their bites are very quick and deal heavy &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage. Moreover, if they manage to emerge directly beneath an unwary player's feet, they are capable of eating said player whole, chewing them and spitting them out after a few seconds. Rockworms do not have ranged attacks. They are immune to most forms of &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter emerging, Rockworms will burrow again if there are no enemies within melee range, only to unburrow moments later at a different location. They may not burrow within 4 seconds of emerging, and they may not stay burrowed more than 3 seconds. Rockworms do not chase fleeing prey: if it runs further than a Rockworm can see, the worm will wait patiently for it to return.\nWith careful positioning, one may kill a worm from afar without ever giving them a chance to attack. This is is especially useful against &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; Rockworms, who are very challenging to fight normally due to burrowing and high melee damage."}

For example; if a Warrior is attacking, then the Rogue has to accurately target the monster to avoid hitting the Warrior. The only saving grace a Warrior has from accidental damage is his Shield; since there is not a hard cap on &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;ing, if he were to have enough Dexterity he would be able to block the most of a Rogue's arrows, if not every arrow she fires as long as he is immobile.\n\u00b9This is rounded down. In addition, Diablo has a calculation oversight wherein rounding down is done individually for each separate source of vitality, so while magic items will give the full 1.5 life per vitality and/or mana per magic, the player will only receive 1 health or mana per stat point allocated to magic or vitality.\n\u00b2 There is a bug that causes rogues to gain 3 mana instead of 2 when reaching the 33rd level\n\u00b3These are what the values theoretically should be according to the rest of the numbers in these tables.

To make Marquise Rubies balanced compared to other types, it also changed the calculation of its bonus damage effect to be more straightforward and intuitive than it had been previously, and increased the bonus for all quality tiers to compensate for this change. The old calculation was related to a long-standing bug with \"&lt;a href=\"black%20weapon\"&gt;black weapon&lt;/a&gt;s\" where percent damage bonuses were not applied to non-&lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage; the updated Rubies applied the same to all weapons regardless of added &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; type.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, gems in \"Diablo III\" had nineteen tiers.

They are specific combinations of &lt;a href=\"runes\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt; that grant specific &lt;a href=\"sockets\"&gt;socketed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; several new magical properties. When a Rune Word is made, the item's name is changed to the Rune Word's name. It appears in gold text, like &lt;a href=\"Unique%20items\"&gt;Unique items&lt;/a&gt;.\nRune Words keep the original properties of the socketed item. They do not work on socketed unique, magic, or rare items even if they have the required number of sockets, meaning players can only make Rune Words from items which have black-colored names. When runes are not inserted into an item properly (in correct order), the item will only gain bonuses from the inserted individual runes. Players must also have the right patch for Rune Words to work.\nMostly, effect of a Rune Word combines the normal effect of runes (even augments them), plus several other properties, which effectively turn the socketed item into a Unique Item, keeping the base attributes of the original item.\nFor example, the Rune Word &lt;a href=\"Ancient%27s%20Pledge\"&gt;Ancient's Pledge&lt;/a&gt; requires a 3 socketed &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and will not work on any other item even if there are more than 3 sockets. The Runes must be inserted in the right order -\nDoing so will grant the shield all of these bonuses:\nAll players are able to complete this Rune Word after they complete the Act 5 Second Quest.\nNotes.\nRune Words do not work if the required number of sockets is not equal to the number present on the item. If this were so, then it could be possible that multiple runewords could be socketed in the same item, possibly making it overpowered.\nThey also fail to work when the item they are socketed to is not valid. The player cannot have an Ancient's Pledge &lt;a href=\"Bardiche%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Bardiche&lt;/a&gt; even if they have all 3 runes and a 3-socketed Bardiche. The player must use a shield for this rune word.\nThe Runes socketed must also be arranged in the correct order. Otherwise you will only get the effects of the individual runes without the bonus.\nRune Words won't work in &lt;a href=\"Mechanic%27s\"&gt;Mechanic's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Artisan%27s\"&gt;Artisan's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeweler%27s\"&gt;Jeweler's&lt;/a&gt; items. These items have sockets for magical reasons. Rune Words don't work on magical, rare, set and unique items, only on normal socketed items. For some rune words, finding the right socketable item can prove even more challenging than obtaining the specified runes.\nYou can still have a Rune Word item with bonuses other than those provided by the Rune Word itself. This exception works in non-magical Class-specific Items which sometimes have &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Mod\"&gt;additional attributes&lt;/a&gt; linked to them. Rune Words added to such items with the correct number of sockets and no magical attributes will provide stacking bonuses with the original bonuses.

Players gain access to Rune Words during the expansion's campaign, after which runes will start dropping from enemies. There are two types of runes in the game: ritual, and invocation. When two are combined in an item socked, they form a Rune Word. Half of the Rune Word will cause certain things the player does to build a resource called offering and the other half will trigger an effect that uses up the offering. All runes are tradeable between players, and 3 of the same rune can be crafted into a different rune, with the potential to be of higher quality."}

They made their first appearance in the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion \"&lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;\" as usable &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. They were reintroduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;\" as a new type of &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;able item along with jewels. Their role changed again in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", where they are no longer items, but affect the way skills work.\nDiablo I: Hellfire expansion.\nRunes are &lt;a href=\"Traps\"&gt;trap-like&lt;/a&gt; objects that can only be found in the \"&lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion. Runes are dropped by &lt;a href=\"chests\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; and randomly sold by &lt;a href=\"Adria%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Adria the Witch&lt;/a&gt;. They serve as &lt;a href=\"traps\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;, activating a spell. They deal &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt;, or cast a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Curse\"&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/a&gt;, on monsters that walk over the activated rune. These runes are not &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; items.\nTo set a rune, place it in the belt, then click the appropriate key: your cursor will become a pointer. Clicking on the dungeon floor will set the rune, so long as the cursor is within the character's line of sight. The next monster or player to walk over the rune will trigger it, and the appropriate spell will cast from the spot of the rune. Runes can be cast directly on a monster's current location, and will detonate at once.\nThe damage/duration from rune effects is determined by the player's level. They become more damaging for higher level characters (as is the case with almost everything in \"Diablo I\"/\"Hellfire\"). The increasing power of runes does not keep pace with the increase in power of other abilities after the early portions of the game.\nDiablo II.\nRunes are a type of socketable item introduced in Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction. The player can insert them into socketed items to add many magical attributes. The type of attribute added depends on the socketed item.\nRunes are unique as they can be used to create &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt;. Rune words are special combinations of runes that bestow not only the benefits of the associated runes but also add many powerful magical attributes due to their combination.\n&lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"crafting%20recipes\"&gt;crafting recipes&lt;/a&gt; utilize runes. A and an armor piece combined in the Cube will result in the armor being &lt;a href=\"repair\"&gt;repair&lt;/a&gt;ed. can be similarly used to repair weapons. As the repair cost of very high level armor can be many thousands of gold, it can actually be easier to trade for a Ral than collect that much gold. This is additionally useful since repairing is the means by which spell charges are restored to equipment, and such charges can be even more costly than &lt;a href=\"Durability\"&gt;Durability&lt;/a&gt; repairs. Other &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"crafting%20recipes\"&gt;crafting recipes&lt;/a&gt; use runes as an ingredient in making custom items, or upgrading the base item type from Normal to Exceptional, or from Exceptional to Elite (the latter is a Ladder-only recipe).\nRunes in the Lord of Destruction expansion were identified by certain mystical words (E.g.: ).\nIn patched versions of \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;\", runes can be upgraded to higher runes by using the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; to transmute three same runes much like &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;. Runes from to can only be transmuted with the addition of gems to the recipe; runes from to can only be transmuted by ladder characters or in single player. Runes from require only two lower runes (and a gem) instead of three.\nDiablo III.\nRunes in Diablo III provide bonuses to character skills in lieu of items. They have much more descriptive names now and are directly integrated into the Skill screen instead of the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo Immortal.\nRunes return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". Originally, they were used to craft &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt; and could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rift\"&gt;Elder Rift&lt;/a&gt;. They were reworked in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Unmaking\"&gt;Age of Unmaking&lt;/a&gt; update, where they were changed to socketable items similar to \"Diablo II\".\nDiablo IV.\nThere are two types of Runes in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", Condition Runes and Effect Runes. Any Condition Rune can be combined with any Effect Rune to create a Rune Word. Rune progression is in the works."}

Ruza's family agreed to have his eyes removed, and they fed each one to crows that might carry their &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; far away. The &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; who plucked Ruza's eyes died within a day, in agony, as did the assistant who tended his wounds. Sated crows fell like stones from their perches above his family's house.\nRuza's empty sockets no longer kept the hex inside. It had grown worse than ever. Just glancing at him sent people to their deaths: sputtering, choking, their eyeballs putrefying in burning-red faces. No one dared kill him now. The townsfolk left food and clothing in the town square for Ruza, and his family bid him farewell with their backs turned. He ignored their offer and strode blindly into hermitage and freedom.\nRuza walked until his legs and feet failed him, then collapsed, only to rise again in what felt like nighttime. He did not know his destination, but when he heard the barks of the crows quiet and the crunch of stones beneath his feet, Ruza knew he was headed in the right direction. He scaled the great mountain, alone and silent. In the cold and darkness of the heights, none could look upon Ruza, and he could look upon no other. There was no world save himself, and the &lt;a href=\"deities\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; themselves would envy such abandon.\nIn-game.\nRuza is mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", in the pieces of the \"&lt;a href=\"Banquet%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;Banquet of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"item%20set\"&gt;item set&lt;/a&gt;."}

Being far more intelligent than his destructive colleague &lt;a href=\"Gulag\"&gt;Gulag&lt;/a&gt;, Astrogha was a cunning and plotting demon, always scheming and planning in the dark recesses of the Temple of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;. He is featured in both &lt;a href=\"The%20Sin%20War%20%28novels%29\"&gt;The Sin War Trilogy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20of%20the%20Spider%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Moon of the Spider&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20A.%20Knaak\"&gt;Richard A. Knaak&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nThe Sin War\nAstrogha appears as a giant, humanoid spider. His lower body is that of a spider, but his torso and head resemble something vaguely human. On his head he has several hand-like limbs, used for pushing prey into his mouth. He also has many smaller spider-spawns made of his essence, called 'Children', who act as spies. Astrogha also has the ability to create thick webbing which he uses to constrict prey in. He feeds on human bodies, sucking out their fluids.\nPersonality.\nAstrogha is a somewhat reluctant and suspicious ally of &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt;, though he always remains true to his lord, Diablo. Astrogha once plotted to overthrow Lucion, but realizing his master would not back him against &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, Lucion's father, he backed off. After Lucion's strange disappearance at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Birthright\"&gt;Birthright&lt;/a&gt; novel, Astrogha once more planned to take his place as the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, but the strange reappearance of the Primus (this time Lilith) made him abandon his plans. After Astrogha finally realized Lilith was now using the guise of the Primus, Astrogha started scheming against her, even taking the form of the Primus himself for a while. After a short showdown with Lilith, which was only a way to gauge her powers, Astrogha fled the Temple, once again opting for scheming in the shadows.\nBiography.\nMoon of the Spider\nAppearing once again as a main character of the book, Astrogha remains in an orb called the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20of%20the%20Spider%20%28item%29\"&gt;Moon of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;. A prison bound to an unknown dimension, Astrogha was sent there by &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; after his own cult fell. He was then released by a Noble of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; by the name of Aldric Jitan, which Astrogha then tries to lay waste to the capital through his 'Children'. It was only through the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;Zayl&lt;/a&gt; and the Noble Salene Nesardo, who is revealed to be a descendant of Astrogha himself, that Astrogha was banished back into the Moon."}

{"id": "35264", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=35264", "title": "Atanna", "text": "Atanna was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Khan\"&gt;Juris Khan&lt;/a&gt;, and an inhabitant of &lt;a href=\"Ureh\"&gt;Ureh&lt;/a&gt;. She was well-versed in &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and music (specifically the flute), and was exceptionally beautiful.\nBiography.\nThe Fall of Ureh.\nAtanna lived in &lt;a href=\"Ureh\"&gt;Ureh&lt;/a&gt; when the city was besieged by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. In an effort to save themselves, her father and the city's &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s attempted to cast a spell that would take the city into &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of the &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; Mirakodus. However, Mirakodus was nothing but Diablo in disguise, and the spell would actually drag Ureh into &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. The Sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Gregus%20Mazi\"&gt;Gregus Mazi&lt;/a&gt; (whom Atanna may have been romantically entangled with) disrupted the spell, which left the city stuck in &lt;a href=\"Limbo\"&gt;Limbo&lt;/a&gt;, and he himself cast out of the city.\nJuris Khan, still in Diablo's thrall, and now ruler of a stranded city, followed the \"archangel's\" directions, and opened up his people to the \"subtle ministrations of other angels.\" Or, in reality, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Atanna tried to resist, and gave Diablo himself pause, but he nonetheless forced himself into her. Like the rest of Ureh's people, Atanna became an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; monster.\nThe Return of Ureh.\nThousands of years later, a band of mercenaries led by &lt;a href=\"Kentril%20Dumon\"&gt;Kentril Dumon&lt;/a&gt; made their way into the city, having followed the guidance of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; Sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Quov%20Tsin\"&gt;Quov Tsin&lt;/a&gt;. Her father introduced her to the mercenary captain. She served the mercenaries with food and drink as her father told them the (false) story of how Gregus Mazi had betrayed Ureh, stranding the city in Limbo and thwarting its people's attempt to ascend into &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, to escape from &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. She followed her father's line in describing Mazi. They told the Dumon how they might escape their fate if the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Light\"&gt;Key of Light&lt;/a&gt; was placed atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Nymyr\"&gt;Mount Nymyr&lt;/a&gt;; an impossible task for the people of Ureh, as they would burn if they stepped out of the city.\nDumon succeeded, and Ureh returned to the mortal realm, much to the joy of its citizenry, though a shadow needed to remain over the city, lest they burn from the sunlight. Dumon handed Atanna a brooch that contained her visage, one which he had found in the ruins of Ureh before he and the mercenaries had succeeded in entering it. She claimed that Mazi had desired her, and had stolen the brooch. She noticed Dumon clutch his &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, and asked if he would be her champion. Enraptured, Dumon declared that he would do anything for her, and she kissed him.\nDumon later encountered Atanna again in the palace, seeing her play the flute. She guided him through the gardens, and mended his hand after it was stung by something, presumably an insect (now possible as Ureh had returned to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;). In truth, no such sting had occurred, and Dumon had momentarily glimpsed Ureh's true, hellish state. Awhile later, she saw him again, thanking him in regards to Tsin, who had told her father that he might have found a way to completely solve Ureh's curse. He had likewise convinced her father that Ureh shouldn't try to ascend to Heaven again, that rather, ascending to Heaven would be something to be earned within the mortal realm. A celebratory dinner was held, with Dumon continuing to be enraptured by Atanna. He did, however, suffer a kind of panic attack (another glimpse of the nightmare that was Ureh), but Atanna got him to come to his senses.\nTsin's spell worked, and Dumon was made consort to Atanna. However, not all was well, and Dumon had come to suspect that something was wrong in Ureh, foremost of which was that a number of men had disappeared. She pouted, hoping that Dumon wasn't accusing her, but he pressed forward, telling her that her father hadn't slain Mazi, but had imprisoned him beneath the palace, turning him into some kind of hellish sentinel. Atanna momentarily lost her composure as Dumon continued to press that something was wrong, but regained it enough to try an alay his fears through seduction. She reached out for him, but something caused Dumon to surge forward, barging into Atanna and sending her plummeting off the palace balcony. The shadow made it too dark for him to see her body hit the ground, but there was no doubt in his mind that she should be dead.\nAnd yet she wasn't, for she found Dumon with her father, desparately trying to explain that he hadn't meant to kill his daughter. One of her legs had snapped in the middle, her other foot was twisted on the side, her left arm was at an impossible angle, and her right was mangled beyond recognition. Physically, she was maimed, yet there was no sign of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;, and Atanna appeared to not even notice the damage that had been inflicted on her. Khan cast a spell and the damage appeared to heal, though her head still hung limply. Or at least it did, until Khan physically fixed it in place, as flesh and muscle fused, all sign of injury gone. Such was the power of Heaven, apparently, even while Dumon found the sight hellish. Atanna wasn't perturbed though...soon, she and Dumon would be together, and he'd be just like her. The true story of Ureh was soon revealed, and Atanna revealed herself as being so far gone, that she appeared enraptured at the memory of Diablo forcing himself onto her.\nThe time came to allow Ureh's people to enter Sanctuary proper. A ritual that would involve Dumon being a &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; sacrifice. Atanna stroked her lover's hair, content that he would soon be like her, in an undead state. However, the ritual was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;one of Dumon's companions&lt;/a&gt;, who absconded with the mercenary. Frustrated, Khan slew Tsin, completing the blood ritual, and thus, the stage was set for the people of Ureh to gain access to Sanctuary. All that remained was the sun to rise and touch the Key of Light atop Mount Nymyr. Atanna was assigned to guide the key, but was tormented as to what might happen to Dumon. Of what she might have to do to guard the key. She remembered the \"archangel\" that spoke to her, this time her memories tinged with both love and fear. She resolved that if Dumon confronted her, she would give him a test. Ideally, he would pass, but if not, he would die. She could accept that.\nDumon reached the key, but Atanna mentally contacted him, trying to sway his actions to not destroy it. Even her father attempted to keep the mercenary at bay, but he nonetheless threw the key off the top of the mountain. The sun rose, and Ureh's people burnt in its light. Dumon found himself falling down from the mountain, towards the city. About a hundred feet before the ground, however, Atanna, from the palace, used her magic to slow his fall. Even so far apart, their eyes locked, and her final moments, Atanna realized all she had done. Light began to shine over the palace, and she hastened the rate of his descent, but not so much that it would kill him. Yet the light reached her, and as it rose up her body, Atanna simply faded away.\nHer actions weren't in vain however, and while injured, Dumon survived the fall. Two days later, he departed the ruins of Ureh with his surviving fellows, yet still kept the brooch that held Atanna's image."}
