This is useful if grouping with classes with low armor, such as &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es, to increase their survivability. It is also very useful for characters with high armor (such as &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s) to improve their tanking ability.\nPlacing points into Shout, especially when its synergies are taken care of properly, can often reduce the need to place more than one point into &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Skin\"&gt;Iron Skin&lt;/a&gt;, due to a greater bonus to the hero's Defense than Iron Skin itself provides, and the fact that it benefits all friendly beings within the radius.

His brother taught him how to fight and how to use a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, reasoning that it would give Lyndon time to run if things went awry.\nAs Lyndon grew older he developed a skill for theft and joined the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; against Edlin's advice, while his brother became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Kingsport%20City%20Guard\"&gt;city guard&lt;/a&gt;. Lyndon fell in love with a woman named &lt;a href=\"Rea\"&gt;Rea&lt;/a&gt;, but his feelings were not reciprocated, and she ultimately chose to marry his brother instead.\nAs a member of the Thieves Guild, Lyndon was privy to all of their plans, and contrived a scheme to work with Edlin to their advantage. Lyndon would tip him off to the Guild's targets, while Edlin would bring the guards on to the scene of the crime, and play it off like a lucky catch. When Lyndon's crew robbed the &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20Guild%20Bank\"&gt;Merchants Guild Bank&lt;/a&gt; however, Edlin showed up too early and was accused of being involved in the heist. Edlin was confined to Kingsport's prison, while Lyndon managed to escape and flee the city. Ever since,\u00a0Rea believed Lyndon was responsible for Edlin's imprisonment, and eventually convinced Edlin of the same.\nOn the Road.\nIn the years prior to the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;, Lyndon spent his time moving from place to place to escape the Thieves Guild's wrath, conning locals, seducing ladies, and relieving the unwitting of their drink and money in order to help provide for Edlin's family and pay off his 'debts' to the &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20Guild\"&gt;Merchants Guild&lt;/a&gt;. The threat of imprisonment or from armed guard has never dissuaded Lyndon from living a life of larceny as he journeyed the land. For all the &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; he sent to Rea in order to pay off Edlin's debt, he received no word in response.\nAt some point, he knew a woman from Caldeum, but he left her. While he described her as being \"fair as the sun,\" he also reasoned, \"every sun must set.\"\nThe End of Days.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Lyndon was in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. He discovered that a family near &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; had obtained a valuable relic. He decided to get it by going through their daughter, &lt;a href=\"Sasha\"&gt;Sasha&lt;/a&gt;. He was able to successfully woo her.\nAt &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Mill\"&gt;The Old Mill&lt;/a&gt;, Lyndon encountered &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; \"en route\" to the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Temple\"&gt;Drowned Temple&lt;/a&gt;. He convinced the hero to help aid him in saving Sasha from the Thieves Guild brigands. After dispatching the brigands, he retrieved his relic from Sasha and hastily concocted a excuse to escape his 'betrothal' by accompanying The Nephalem's group. His efforts, however, were in vain - the relic was a fake. He subsequently offered his services to The Nephalem and accompanied the hero(es) on their journey to the Temple.\nLyndon stuck with the Nephalem as they traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and into the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; in order to thwart &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal, he fell into despair. After the final battle with the Prime Evil, the Nephalem suspected the presence of tears in the scoundrel's eyes who assured the Nephalem that it was raining. Towards the end of the quest, the Nephalem gifted Lyndon with gold, declaring that they would travel to Kingsport and pay off Edlin's debt once the quest was over. Lyndon was overwhelmed with gratitude.\nReaper of Souls.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, Lyndon finally decided he had to free Edlin from the Kingsport dungeons before he died there. After hearing from a &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; Dungeon Guard that prisoners from Kingsport had been transferred to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, he and the Nephalem proceeded to the dungeons in hopes of freeing Edlin.\nUpon their arrival, the pair realized that the Thieves Guild had managed to infiltrate the dungeon. After fighting their way through the complex, Lyndon entered his brother's cell, only to discover that Edlin had been murdered. A wave of remorse and grief swept over Lyndon as he bitterly blamed himself for the death of his brother. Upon inspection of Edlin's body, he took the dagger that was used to kill him, and noted how suspiciously familiar it was.\nThe Nephalem attempted to console Lyndon, but was rebuffed, Lydon said that the great hero could never understand his grief. Despondent and mournful, Lyndon indulged in a drunken binge. The Nephalem eventually confronted him, and offered to help find Edlin's killer, but Lyndon ignored the offer and continued in an intoxicated state.\nLater, however, he left the dagger he found with &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%20Eamon\"&gt;Haedrig Eamon&lt;/a&gt;, and the Nephalem asked him to tell them more about it. After remarking on the craftsmanship of the dagger, Haedrig noticed that the hilt was hollow, inside which was a note. The Nephalem gave the note to Lyndon. It appeared that Rea, Edlin's wife, had murdered him. The note said that if Lyndon wanted to seek revenge, she would be waiting for him. Lyndon resolved to find Rea after Malthael was dealt with.\nDisciples of Sanctuary.\nHaving long been in study and observation of The Nephalem, &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt;, and Lyndon formed the &lt;a href=\"Disciples%20of%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Disciples of Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, continuing to fight against the minions of Hell.\nBackwater.\nWhile boss of Backwater, Lyndon played a game of &lt;a href=\"Skull%20%26amp%3B%20Anchor\"&gt;Skull &amp; Anchor&lt;/a&gt; where according to rumor, he won the &lt;a href=\"Scoundrel%27s%20Leathers\"&gt;leathers&lt;/a&gt; of his opponent. He apparently gave the leathers back, as he wanted to give the poor sod something warm without wounding his pride.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nLyndon is first met at &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Mill\"&gt;The Old Mill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Act%20I%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt;, while on the way to the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Temple\"&gt;Drowned Temple&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;. He is voiced by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Baker\"&gt;Troy Baker&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment.\nLyndon fights with ranged weapons, specifically bows, allowing him to keep his distance from the enemy. In battle, he fires quick bolts or arrows at enemies to cripple them, stun them, or do moderate single-target damage. Lyndon also carries pieces of unique equipment with him; mementos of a life guided by wit and luck, such as loaded dice, razors, or mysterious pouches. These souvenirs, known as Scoundrel Tokens, improve his ability in combat as much as, if not more than, the jewelry and other trinkets he collects.\nThe Scoundrel has the highest damage output of all the followers. When fitted with high dexterity, damage, and critical gear, he can do almost as much damage as the player.\nAvailable equipment:\nSkills.\nLyndon's skills increase your party\u2019s damage, as well as his own ability to cripple or poison opponents and his capacity to evade attacks. He can also gain the ability to strike multiple foes at once with a salvo of arrows or a carefully placed explosive bolt.\nQuotes.\n\"Upon recruiting the Scoundrel\"\n\"Waiting to be recruited\"\n\"When the Follower gains a level\"\n\"Upon training\"\n\"Upon equipping with an item\"\n\"Upon noticing a rare monster or a champion pack\"\n\"Upon defeating a rare monster or a champion pack\"\n\"Upon a standard encounter\"\n\"Random comment after killing monsters\"\n\"Upon taking damage\"\n\"After a near death\"\n\"Random comment\"\n\"When left idle\"\n\"Upon Entering the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Misery\"&gt;Fields of Misery&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"In the &lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur Oasis&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"In the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Sands\"&gt;Desolate Sands&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Upon entering Kulle's Archives\"\n\"In the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"In the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;\"\nDiablo IV.\nLyndon appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". He can be found in &lt;a href=\"Backwater\"&gt;Backwater&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\n\"Rogue\" and \"rake\" are two words that describe Lyndon. Outwardly, he appears charming and unhesitatingly selfish, lusting after women, wine, and wealth. Inwardly, he was dedicated to the fight against &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and other monsters, and was wracked with guilt over his brother's predicament. He has a tendency to exaggerate the charms of Kingsport.\nLyndon is, as suggested, an incredibly good thief; deft and subtle enough to steal &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Leah%27s%20Ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; from her finger without her even noticing (though &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; did see that act easily). He is also skilled at dice. "}

Home to the great merchant fleets and endless nets of reeking fish!\nPlayer:\nAnd your trade?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nI am between jobs at the moment.\nPlayer:\nThat is not an honest answer.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nNonsense. I am the most honest thief you will ever meet.\nThe Unrepentant Rogue.\nAvailable in the Quest: The Doom in Wortham (Act I)\nPlayer:\nIt is strange that you waste your time in pursuit of women.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nWaste?! Time is scarcely better spent.\nPlayer:\nBut you stay with none of them.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nI've only found one worth keeping... but she slipped way from me.\nPlayer:\nI see. You bother women to ease the sting.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nWell, no. Sometimes they should bother me!\nKingsport Fighting.\nAvailable in the Quest: Trailing the Coven (Act I)\nPlayer:\nYou are a skilled fighter.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nMy brother taught me when we were younger. He thought the crossbow was the best weapon for me since it would give me time to run away if i botched things too badly.\nPlayer:\nWhere is he now?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nOh, he's still in Kingsport. I expect he'll be there a good long time.\nSticky Fingers.\nAvailable in the Quest: The Imprisoned Angel (Act I)\nPlayer:\nHow did you become a thief?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nThat's a long and terrible story that y-you wouldn't want to hear.\nPlayer:\nYou found something you liked and couldn't afford?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nBasically.\nPlayer:\nPerhaps you should be more reasonable.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nOh, there was nothing reasonable about her.\nDifficult Decisions.\nAvailable at the start of Quest: Return to New Tristram (Act I)\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nDo you ever doubt your choices?\nPlayer:\nI ponder them before, not after.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nThings never seem to turn out like I hope they will.\nPlayer:\nTrust the spirits.

We only had each other.\nPlayer:\nIs he a thief also?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nNo. He was a member of the city guard.\nPlayer:\nThat seems odd.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nNot as much as you might think. Until the end, that is.\nBrothers Divided.\nAvailable at the start of Quest: City of Blood (Act II)\nPlayer:\nWhy did you not follow your brother into the guards?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nWe're not much alike, really. He was always dependable and practical... a complete bore, I'd say.\nPlayer:\nAnd you were drawn to trouble.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nHardly! I was just amusing myself with the Thieves Guild. It was nothing serious.\nPlayer:\nUntil you became a criminal.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nThat may have been serious.\nThe Guard's Fate.\nAvailable at the start of Quest: Unexpected Allies (Act II)\nPlayer:\nWhat happened to your brother?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nNothing you'd want to hear.\nPlayer:\nI wouldn't ask if I didn't.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nAnd then what? I suppose you'll make it all right? You'll fix it up just like another one of your little errands? Some things aren't that easy.\nPlayer:\nAnd some things are made harder than they should be.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nOh gods, and you're so noble about it too. Spare me.\nFirst Love.\nAvailable at the start of Quest: Blood and Sand (Act II)\nPlayer:\nTell me, have you ever truly loved a woman?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nAh yes, the unreasonable one I spoke of earlier. I loved her with every inch of my heart before it went black as coal.\nPlayer:\nWhere did she go?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nWell, she did what all unreasonable women do: married the wrong man.\nPlayer:\nYou did not steal her back?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nWouldn't have been easy... He was my brother.\nThe Thief's Secret.\nAvailable at the start of Quest: The Siege of Bastion's Keep (Act III)\nPlayer:\nTell me more of your brother. Tell me the truth.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nWe used to be a team. I'd tip him off to some of the Thieves Guild's hits; he'd bring in the guards and play it off like it was a lucky catch. But one time he showed up too early...\nPlayer:\nWhen you robbed the Merchants Guild Bank.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nNone other. Some of the guards became suspicious. They thought he was involved... and he's been rotting in a cell in Kingsport ever since, I... well, I managed to escape.\nPlayer:\nAnd you feel responsible.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nI don't know what I feel anymore.\nThe Scoundrel's Wealth.\nAvailable at the start of Quest: Tremors in the Stone (Act III)\nPlayer:\nWhat do you do with all of the riches you find?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nLiving a life of depravity and overindulgence, naturally.\nPlayer:\nIn this cold and desolate place? I doubt it.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nFine. Perhaps I have found that my treasure is put to better use elsewhere.\nPlayer:\nYou send your riches away?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nWe all have debts to pay, friend.\nBrotherly Love.\nAvailable at the start of Quest: Heart of Sin (Act III)\nPlayer:\nDoes your brother know that you love his wife?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nNo. She didn't take the time to tell him before waltzing off to the altar. Now their children would starve if not for the gold I send their way.\nPlayer:\nBut you are responsible for their father's imprisonment.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nHe will be free again in time. Paying off the Merchants Guild of Kingsport is no small task. And aren't you supposed to be on my side here?!\nA Dark Outlook.\nAvailable at the start of Quest: Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nWell, we've had a good time, right? Shame about our imminent deaths.\nPlayer:\nYou do not seem troubled.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nYou don't choose this life and expect to live to an old age. Still, it's the women I feel sorry for.\nPlayer:\nWhich women?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nAll of them. There will be heaving bosoms and torn clothes all across the land when word spreads that I've fallen in battle.\nA Lost Family.\nAvailable at the start of Quest: Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)\nPlayer:\nDo you think of your family still?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nNo point in it. I'll never see them again.\nPlayer:\nAre you so assured of our defeat?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nMy brother's wife thinks I was... involved with his imprisonment, and he believes her.\nPlayer:\nWhat?\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nAs low as I am, I would never frame him. Not even to win her back. But they won't hear a word of it. For all the gold I send to them, I receive nothing in response.\nA Final Gift.\nAvailable at the start of Quest: Prime Evil (Act IV)\nPlayer:\nI have a gift for you, Lyndon.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nIs that so?\nPlayer:\nIt is gold. We will go to Kingsport one day soon. Then you can pay your debts, and your brother will be free.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nYou are much too kind.\nPlayer:\nWe have journeyed together a long way. I am happy to aid you.\nScoundrel Lyndon:\nWords fail me.\nPlayer:\nWords are not always needed."}

During her youth, Lysa and her sisters were the servants of a &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt;, one of Lysa's sisters, secretly read their masters spell books and taught her siblings, though the first spells they learned were nothing more than tricks. One time Eirena miscast a &lt;a href=\"charm%20spell\"&gt;charm spell&lt;/a&gt;, causing Lysa to fawn over her for a fortnight (14 days). Ignorance and bliss ended however when she and her sisters learned that their master had begun to summon demons.\nUpon learning this, the sisters waited until their master and more mages joined together in a ritual to summon a greater demon in reality. Knowing of the mages' evil, Lysa and her sisters used their magic to kill the mages before they could complete their ritual. However, they cursed them with their last breaths, and it seemed that they too would fall. A man called &lt;a href=\"the%20Prophet\"&gt;the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; saved the sisters however, using his powers to heal them. He commended them on their deeds, and offered to train them further. They accepted.\nThe group was called the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Hand of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Prophet himself foresaw a great disaster that would occur &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;fifteen hundred years&lt;/a&gt; in the future, and Lysa and her sisters pledged their lives to preventing the tragedy. The sisters\u2019 pledges were far from mere words, and the Prophet placed the entire sisterhood in a &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al slumber to preserve them until the appointed time. A time where they would aid a hero in that time.\nReaper of Souls.\nEirena was reunited with her once thought dead sister, when she followed the voice of their other sibling she'd been hearing in &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;. There, Lysa revealed the truth of their sisters' deaths to the already shocked Eirena\u00a0\u2014Eirena was chosen by the Prophet as the most powerful of their sisters, and the one who needed to survive above all else. He revealed this to the rest of them, giving them the choice of either leaving, or entering the slumber with knowledge that they are all going to give their lives to protect her when the need arose. Lysa was jealous of her sister for not being chosen and conspired with demons to kill her, betraying the Prophet. Their sisters then sacrificed themselves to protect her just as the Prophet predicted they would. When Eirena and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; ventured into the Pandemonium, they followed Lysa's voice, which proved to be a trap: souls of the slain sisters, dragged to the &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Lair of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, were supposed to lure Eirena into the jaws of death. When other demons failed, the corrupted Lysa turned into a &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;demonic creature&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to kill her shocked and guilt ridden sister, but was slain by her and &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nIn the Lair of the Prophet, the Nephalem will have to face Lysa, The Corrupted Enchantress, in combat. She is a &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monster\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Succubus, having no special affixes, but being able to use all of Eirena's skills. Demons (mostly &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Destroyer\"&gt;Armored Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s) constantly come to her aid. The moment combat starts, she blocks the exit, cutting all ways back. After her death, the quest is completed, and the Prophet reaches Eirena with his final words."}

The base damage of some of these weapons is another advantage: a &lt;a href=\"War%20Hammer%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;War Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, while slower than a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sword%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Great Sword&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the best one-handed Normal tier weapons available in terms of damage per hit.

Those who were crazy enough to battle beside Madawc referred to him as the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; prophet. He claimed he was cursed with visions from both past and present. He would often begin fights without provocation, claiming he sought justice for crimes not yet committed. Before every battle he would sit, trance like, staring up to the skies. Sometimes, when he would fall out of these trances, he would rise from wherever he was, and leave, not taking part in the waiting battle. Those that knew of Madawc\u2019s trances began to believe he could tell the outcome of a battle even before it was fought. How else could the crazy old codger have survived for as long as he had? He became well known among the warriors of the Northern Lands because of his supposed gift. Men began to follow Madawc wherever he went, staying if he stayed, leaving when he left. He became something of a legend, a warrior prophet. However, one night as Madawc sat around the fire with some of his men, he stood up, dropped his pipe, and left. When one of the men stopped him and asked where he was going he said, \"The Ancients have called me to guard Mt. Arreat. So, I must go.\" Pushing past the man, Madawc began his long trek south to the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Arreat\"&gt;Mt. Arreat&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile in training, &lt;a href=\"Talic\"&gt;Talic&lt;/a&gt; provided instruction to Madawc, instructing him on how to use his fury to his advantage.\nVigil's End.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; launched his assault on Mount Arreat, he was able to bypass the Ancients due to a relic provided to him by the traitor &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; that pursued the Lord of Destruction weren't so lucky, and thus had to defeat Talic and his &lt;a href=\"Madawc\"&gt;fellow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Korlic\"&gt;guardians&lt;/a&gt;. The Ancients were bested, and thus endowed the heroes with increased power, warning them that Baal was already inside, threatening the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, and that only the heroes could stop him.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nMadawc appears in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". He is the only one of the three Ancients to use ranged attacks. He uses &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Weapons\"&gt;Throwing Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Double%20Throw\"&gt;Double Throw&lt;/a&gt; even if &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Weapons\"&gt;Throwing Weapons&lt;/a&gt; is a Mastery.

Taking heed of the events, the Ennead and Ammuit declared that no mage clan would ever summon another &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; had to stay out of mortal affairs however. In the midst of this period, the third clan, the Vizjerei, rose to greatest success. Operating under close scrutiny, the Vizjerei ranks soon included thousands of active &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23-264\"&gt;-264&lt;/a&gt;, the truth became known to the Ennead, as one of their sources within the Vizjerei reported seeing a ritual of summoning in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Assassins were assigned to target key Vizjerei members, where the Vizjerei targeted key Ennead and Ammuit figures in retaliation. The situation further deteriorated where a heated meeting in the &lt;a href=\"Al%27Raquish\"&gt;Al'Raquish&lt;/a&gt; erupted into a battle that resulted in multiple deaths. With the violence coming out into the open, the Ennead and Ammuit stormed the main Vizjerei academy at &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the dust cleared, the academy had been leveled, and not a single Vizjerei mage was left alive.\nThe battle was over. But the Mage Clan Wars had begun.\nOpen War.\nAs battles raged across &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Ruling%20Council\"&gt;Vizjerei Ruling Council&lt;/a&gt; fled &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;, went into hiding, and began consolidating its forces. Vizjerei summoned giant demons to guard their estates. &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; declared its neutrality and escaped the conflict unscathed. Over the next seven years, the combined Ennead and Ammuit forces won several victories against isolated Vizjerei pockets before directing the entirety of their combined might against the Vizjerei's main force. Regular soldiers were used by the Mage Clans. During the height of the war, the Vizjerei began feeling the stress of long struggle. One Vizjerei faction resolved to create an army of demon-possessed victims, and the peaceful &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; people of &lt;a href=\"Teganze\"&gt;Teganze&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be the ideal subjects. Over the course of a few decades, as Umbaru were taken by Vizjerei and turned into &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;, the once peaceful Umbraru-Vizjerei relations had turned into outright war. Over the next two centuries, the khazra would continue to plague the Vizjerei.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; scholar &lt;a href=\"Brast\"&gt;Brast&lt;/a&gt;, the area that is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Sands\"&gt;Desolate Sands&lt;/a&gt; was created during one of the battles in the war, as explosive energies devastated the entire area.\nAfter seven years of war, the Vizjerei were hopelessly outnumbered and on the verge of defeat. Thus, they played their trump card\u2014summoned demons. In an instant, the tide turned as creatures of the Burning Hells cut their way through the Ennead and Ammuit ranks, allowing the Vizjerei to drive their foes all the way back to Viz-jun.\nThe Tale of Bartuc and Horazon.\nAlthough the Vizjerei were willing to utilize demons to achieve their goals, differences of opinion existed as to how this would be carried out. The siblings &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;, both Vizjerei mages, exemplified this. Horazon believed that while demons were a great source of power, they had to be bent to one's will. The process of breaking a demon's will was a great delight to Horazon. In contrast, Bartuc grew to sympathize with the demons. With no small amount of influence from them, he believed that demonkind would be best understood through an outright alliance with them, so their secrets could be shared freely.\nNonetheless, Bartuc continued the war, earning the title of \"Warlord of Blood.\" Demonic corruption spread through the Vizjerei and the hellspawn he summoned lacked any kind of control, and destroyed everything in their path. Bartuc was not dismayed though\u2014he viewed demons as humankind's masters, and that loyalty to them would be genorously rewarded. Horazon, however, realized that Bartuc's path would only lead to ruin. Even if the Vizjerei won the war, there would be nothing of civilization left, that the clan's only legacy would be death or enslavement to the Burning Hells.\nThe Battle of Viz-jun.\nIn the final stages of the war, as victory seemed assured, the Vizjerei Council resolved to remove Bartuc from command due to his acts of depravity. With the philosophical schism of Horazon and Bartuc coming to a head, the Vizjerei fell into civil war, as Bartuc turned his forces against his own people. He reguarly used the tactic of moving his forces in a circular pattern, trying to cause as much destruction as possible. He would raid undefended villages, cutting off support for walled towns before moving against them. After many hard fought battles, Bartuc's contingent gained the upperhand, and he set his armies against Viz-jun. Demons were unleashed upon the city, tearing through both men and the city's walls. Corpses piled up in mounds, and a red haze obscured the battlefield. The Vizjerei summoned their own demons to battle Bartuc, but they ended up turning on their summoners, and they found themselves unable to banish them from the mortal realm. The Vizjerei outnumbered Bartuc's army 10:1, but they lost one third of their number during the battle, and if not for the \"lesser clans\" that followed them, they would have been wiped out. But ultimately, the end of the war would be decided by Horazon and Bartuc themselves.\nThe battle between the siblings took place just outside the towering gates. Horazon, appearing at the eleventh hour, rose to answer Bartuc's challenge. The cataclysmic battle that resulted brought the walls of the city down around them. In the midst of this, the hero &lt;a href=\"Telranden\"&gt;Telranden&lt;/a&gt; led a charge that saved many lives. Yet the city was leveled, and the death toll numbered in the hundreds of thousands. And yet the brothers battled, realizing too late that they had both been played for fools by demons. Yet as the smoke cleared, Bartuc lay dead, with Horazon standing over his brother's corpse.\nThe war was over.\nAftermath.\nThe grieving Horazon was aware that as long as the agents of the Burning Hells had access to Sanctuary, the corruption of hearts and civilizations would never cease. Following the battle, he crafted for himself the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, a place where the agents of Hell could never find him. For their part, the Vizjerei resolved to forevermore spurn &lt;a href=\"demonic%20magic\"&gt;demonic magic&lt;/a&gt; and instead focus their studies on &lt;a href=\"elemental%20magic\"&gt;elemental magic&lt;/a&gt;. To further ensure that a tragedy of this magnitude would never be repeated, the &lt;a href=\"Viz-Jaq%27taar\"&gt;Viz-Jaq'taar&lt;/a&gt; were formed, an order of mage slayers known as \"assassins.\" Furthermore, a small number of academies were set up to faciliate the training of future Mages, so that the indiscretions of the Vizjerei could be avoided. A number of mage lords became wanderers after the war's end, trying to \"rediscover what was real\" (i.e. re-evaluate what they knew about magic).\nYet it was too little too late. Once, mages had been revered in eastern culture, but faced with the events that had occurred, the people of Kehjistan turned against them. Many mages were exiled, or even executed, and while the Vizjerei survived as a group, they were but a shadow of their former selves. With the exception of the Yshari Sanctum, the mages' holdings and bastions were pulled down and burnt by the angry citizenry, along with all the knowledge they had collected. Laws were passed against the use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately, the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Age of Magic&lt;/a&gt; was replaced by what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Age of Faith&lt;/a&gt;. Some magics from this period were lost to history.\nLegacy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of of the most merciless &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s slain in the wars became spell-casting &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, bound in servitude to Hell even thousands of years later.\nThe role the Druids played in the wars soured their relationship with their kinsmen.\nKehjistan would never regain the glory it had possessed prior to the wars, and much of the land was left bristling with untamed magical energies. While much of this dissipated over time, some had effects upon the landscape and creatures of the land's jungles. Trees and vines would grow to unusual size, rivers and swamps would appear overnight, and once innocuous creatures would gain dangerous abilities with an appetite to match.\nThe demons the Vizjerei summoned to guard their estates continued to patrol the deserts of Kehjistan. After years of patrolling the desert sands, the demons' hides became thick as stone and caked with grit. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Over a thousand years&lt;/a&gt; later, these demons could still be found wandering the desert, with only the glowing runes on their skulls belying their origins. \nEven over a 1000 years after the war's end, there existed stories of corrupt Vizjerei who had once again turned to Hell as a source of power. But likewise, memories of the Vizjerei's actual summoning of demons faded, and some were attributed to more mundane events, or regarded as fabrications. According to senior &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, the events at Viz-jun 'stained' the fabric of reality in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, said stain remaining even over a millennium after the conflict's conclusion. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; claimed something similar, that the results of the war made it easier for demons to manifest themselves upon Sanctuary.\nBecause of their actions in the Mage Clan Wars, the Vizjerei never escaped the stigma of their summoning of demons. Even by the 13th century, some still called them \"demon worshippers.\""}

In what would become known as &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, the land was rife with nodes of magical energy, and eventually, humans with arcane abilities began to sense these forces. Over time, they gathered in groups and settled in these special areas, eventually forming the Mage Clans, the most prominent of which were the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ennead\"&gt;Ennead&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Ammuit\"&gt;Ammuit&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of their formation, the clans were ethnically and culturally distinct societies with their own laws, customs, &lt;a href=\"artisan\"&gt;artisan&lt;/a&gt;s, and merchants. Each clan was defined by its adherence to a particular school of magic. While only the clan's mage caste studied this vocation, each clan's discipline nonetheless pervaded all corners of society, evidencing itself in things such as art and regional vernacular.\nThe burgeoning power of the clans allowed them to gain political influence over Kehjan. The &lt;a href=\"Al%27Raqish\"&gt;Al'Raqish&lt;/a&gt; was formed to rule alongside the kingdom's monarchy and its powerful guilds. Despite the violent feuds and deep-seated prejudice that existed among the clans, the council thrived for generations. Eventually, the rulers of Kehjan became puppets for the clans.\nThe Sin War.\nThe Vizjerei had always believed in the existence of spirits, yet were unable to communicate with them. They studied the practices of the &lt;a href=\"Druids\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt; and the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, hoping to replicate their successes with experiments and empirical research. It was through the one and only\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Jere%20Harash\"&gt;Jere Harash&lt;/a&gt;, a Vizjerei Sorcerer, that this goal was realized, but at the cost of alerting the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s existence, however.\nThe Vizjerei discovered the means of summoning &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and agreed to keep these beings a secret. After being summoned, the demons returned to the Burning Hells and informed their brethren of humans, ultimately reaching the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s themselves.\nThe actions of the Vizjerei inadvertently caused the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;, culminating into the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. While the Triune and &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; vied for followers, the Mage Clans squabbled, coming to the verge of war. Ergo, many in Kehjan flocked to either the Triune or Cathedral in preference.\nThe Age of Magic.\nIn the decades that followed the Sin War, the Kehjan renamed itself as \"Kehjistan,\" in order to distinguish itself from past events. As the kingdom started anew, the Mage Clans reasserted the control they had previously held, but took the lessons of the Sin War to heart\u2014no Mage Clan would ever again summon demons into the world, and Heaven and Hell were to stay out of mortal affairs forever. As before, the Vizjerei, Ammuit, and Ennead remained the three most powerful clans, though of the three, the Vizjerei remained the most powerful. Although the details of the Sin War were lost, it was understood that blind faith and religiosity had not averted disaster, and before long, the prevailing opinion emerged that it was mankind's blind embrace of religion that had set the war in motion. Reason and practical research became the norm of the East, and the Al'Raquish governed Kehjistan in cooperation with the royal line in &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was when the Vizjerei once again began returning to the summoning of demons from the Burning Hells, with the intent of controlling the demons and using them to subdue all the other clans, that an unsigned letter, presumed to be from an Ennead official, was found within the ruins of an Ammuit academy near &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. The letter mentioned evidence of five high-ranking Vizjerei conjurers performing a ritual of summoning in the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. After having previously declared that no mage clan should ever summon demons, and having corroborated against the clan, the Ennead and Ammuit clans sent for assassins to eliminate key members of the Vizjerei Clan. In return, the Vizjerei paid them back in their own coin, and the conflict escalated further in the Al'Raqish, which resulted in multiple &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;s. What followed was the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nThe Mage Clan Wars.\nThe Mage Clan Wars started as a war with a coalition of Ennead and Ammuit forces on one side, and the Vizjerei on the other. Hopelessly outnumbered, the Vizjerei found themselves on the verge of annihilation. Unleashing the one weapon they had available, they did so\u2014demons. Horrific creatures spawned of Hell cut their way through the Ennead and Ammuit forces, and they were driven back to Viz-jun. However, corruption spread through the Vizjerei ranks, and at the final battle at Viz-jun, the city was destroyed, hundreds of thousands left dead (&lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;, who had turned the demons against the Vizjerei among them), and the Mage Clans shattered.\nThe Age of Faith.\nWith the destruction of Viz-jun came the end of the Mage Clan system of government in Kehjistan. Mages, who had once been revered, were now reviled, and at times killed on on sight. Many fled the cities to eke out an existence in smaller towns, or alone in the mountains and deserts. The Vizjerei swore off summoning forever, and the &lt;a href=\"Viz-Jaq%27taar\"&gt;Viz-Jaq'taar&lt;/a&gt; were formed to police the clans. However, the Age of Magic had ended, and what followed was the Age of Faith. The angry citizenry of Kehjistan looted the Mage Clans' holdings and tore down their bastions of power, with the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; being the sole exception, due to its remote location. However, the vast arcane libraries and innumerable tomes of the Mage Clans were destroyed, and laws were passed forbidding the use of magic. The Mage Clans remained, but only in a pale and diminished form. Over the centuries, the population of the Mage Clans steadily dwindled.\nRevival.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, the Mage Clans experienced a reversal of fortune. The &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Consortium\"&gt;Trade Consortium&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to make their city a beacon of learning, worked to unite the clans and make the Yshari Sanctum a home of arcane knowledge. In the years that followed, the sanctum became a place of learning and growth for the various clans. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; was of the opinion that the sanctum was the greatest symbol of Mage power and unity since the Age of Magic. However, an underground movement spread within the sanctum. Dissatisfied with their rigid instructors, rebellions students took on the mantle of \"&lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;\" and sought out dangerous and forbidden magics.\nKnown Clans.\nThe following clans are known to exist/have existed. Their branch of magic is listed as known:\nWhile not formal Mage Clans, it is also worth noting the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, who have their own branch of magic (&lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;), but were never assimilated into the clans due to their seclusion. Additionally, while also not a Mage Clan, the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; were composed of various Mage Clan members. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Mages\"&gt;Royal Mages&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; are another group of Mages, but are unrelated to the Mage Clans proper.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", the player can use a &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", the player can use a &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zann%20Esu%20Clan\"&gt;Zann Esu Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo IV.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the player can use a &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;/Sorcerer."}

In addition to their slow melee attack (Maggot Brood itself attacks with its massive claws), they can hurl a volley of 5-10 putrid Maggots attached to their backs. Each Maggot is a separate unit (capable of attacking with its mandibles), and explodes in a short-ranged blast of &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage when killed, with a very brief delay.

To make pathfinding much easier, follow these steps:\n1. Imagine a clock in the center of the map. The hour hand is pointing towards the \"tunnel\" which leads to the room with the entrance.\n2. Imagine the clock's hour hand going counter clockwise, 1/4th of a turn.\n3. The hour hand of the clock will now be pointing towards the direction of the room with the exit.\nAnother way to think of it is this:\nWhen the hour hand of the clock is pointing towards the room with the enterance, it will be pointing towards one of the corners of the screen (\"Corner A\"). When it is pointing towards the exit, it will be pointing towards the corner to the LEFT of \"corner A\".\nThis trick works for many areas in Diablo 2, such as the durance of hate (but clockwise) and the countess' tower (also clockwise)."}

Of what is known as fact is that in her youth, Maghda was a member of a group of witches that operated in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that she met &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;. The two became close, sharing certain traits in an uncanny manner. The cult had been floundering prior to their arrival, so Magdha convinced Adria to poison the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; so they could take control. Afterwards, they reforged it into a dangerous new order that practiced torture and &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; summoning. It is said that these witches were fueled by the belief that they were destined to become mortal heralds of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears later, the two had a falling out and Adria left the group. Years after the event, Adria claimed that Maghda had become too complacent. Her departure nearly tore the cult apart and left Maghda wracked by jealousy and rage. Fuelled by her dark emotions, she redoubled her efforts to contact the Burning Hells. At some point, they made contact with &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Lies, and they pledged themselves to his service. Under Maghda, the Coven expanded its influence back into the East, in the deserts around &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;.\nSword of the Stranger.\nWith a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Falling Star&lt;/a&gt; crashing into the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; stirred around &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside the fall were three pieces of a &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; that had splintered off from the fireball. As per her master's interests, Maghda was intent on retrieving them. However, &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; was also searching for them. After they killed some of cultists and retrieved the first shard, she appeared before them as a ghostly apparition, mocking them, and letting slip the location of the second shard at the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Temple\"&gt;Drowned Temple&lt;/a&gt;. In truth, this was intentional, as Maghda wanted the heroes to unseal the temple for her, before she sent in her minions to strike. \nThe Nephalem gained access to the temple, and found the second sword fragment. Maghda's apparition again appeared before them, mocking The Nephalem. However, she noticed the presence of &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; beside them, whom she recognised as being &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter. Perturbed, Maghda ordered her forces to launch their ambush, but were again defeated.\nThe third piece resided in the village of &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;. This time, Maghda and the Coven beat their foe to the sword piece, and burnt the town and slaughtered its inhabitants in the process. Appearing as an apparition to the Nephalem, she revealed that she had captured all three pieces as well as the Nephalem's allies\u2014Leah, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Stranger&lt;/a&gt; who had been found in the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20House\"&gt;Cain's House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Maghda and her cultists constrained their foes. She ordered Cain to use his &lt;a href=\"Horadric\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; arts to reforge it, or he could see Leah die, torturing the scholar for good measure. Unleashing her &lt;a href=\"Magic%23Demonic%20Magic\"&gt;demonic&lt;/a&gt; powers, Leah killed the other cultists, leaving only Maghda standing. She disappeared with the Stranger as her captive. Cain later succumbed to the wounds Maghda had inflicted on him. Maghda fled to the highlands. Around this time, she ordered that &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; be informed of the existence of Leah, whom she knew to be Adria's daughter.\nMaghda was pursued by The Nephalem, who entered &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt;, fighting their way through her cultists. She ordered them to hold The Nephalem off, while she prepared their demise in the manor's depths. There, she summoned &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt;, and set it loose. &lt;a href=\"The%20Chosen%20%28Necromancer%29\"&gt;The Chosen&lt;/a&gt; reflected that Maghda must have become desparate to summon such demons. Regardless, The Butcher was defeated, but Maghda was able to escape.\nShadows in the Desert.\nAfter the events in Khandruas, Maghda entered &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the deserts around &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. She headed for &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt;, blocking the road behind her. &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; engaged in pursuit. Belial ordered her to set a trap at the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, where she was planning to sacrifice &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Davyd\"&gt;Captain Davyd&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; to her master. The Nephalem pointed out that Belial had used Maghda as bait to draw them away from Caldeum, a revelation to which Maghda didn't react kindly to, yelling that Belial would never betray her. The ambush failed, displeasing Belial even further. Maghda was shaken by The Nephalem's claims that Belial had shaken her.\nFinally, The Nephalem caught up with Maghda in her &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20the%20Witch\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt;, where she and the Coven had been torturing and massacring the villagers. Maghda gloated that while the Nephalem had hunted her, Belial's &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; had kidnapped Leah. The two did battle and Maghda was killed; the death of Cain was avenged. After her death, Maghda's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was tormented.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nMaghda's activities in the period between \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" will be touched on in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". She will appear in the game itself.\nDiablo III.\nMaghda appears as a boss in &lt;a href=\"Act%20II%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Unlike most bosses, she has not one, but three sets of tactics, one for normal fight in &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt; and two more for her Uber / Cursed Chest fight.\nIn her normal fight, the battle is a large arena filled with impassable pillars and pits. The battle starts after a short cinematic once the player enters a Coven circle in the middle.\nIn patch 2.4.1 PTR, she used to drop &lt;a href=\"Wings%20of%20Kokabiel\"&gt;Wings of Kokabiel&lt;/a&gt;.\nUber Appearance (The Merciless Witch).\nMaghda is one of the six Boss Monsters of Diablo III to have an Uber appearance: The Merciless Witch, Soulless Heathen. She fights alongside the Uber version of King Leoric, King of the Dead, and can drop the &lt;a href=\"Writhing%20Spine\"&gt;Writhing Spine&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Regret\"&gt;Leoric's Regret&lt;/a&gt; upon defeat.\nShe will have no enrage timer in her Uber form.\nIn 2.4.1 PTR, she used to drop &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Culsu%27s%20Wings\"&gt;Lord Culsu's Wings&lt;/a&gt;.\nChest / Shrine Fight.\nIn this fight, Maghda will only use Spit and Swarm of Flies abilities, but needs to be killed in 45 seconds.\nOn Torment difficulty, Maghda has no Enrage timer, but unless killed quickly, her Corrupted Vessels will overwhelm the player in time, as it is nearly impossible to kill them all before they become possessed on adequate difficulty.\nPersonality and Traits.\nMaghda was a malicious and fanatical individual, unopposed to sacrificing her followers in order to achieve her goals. She was devoted to the Coven, and practiced in the arts of witchcraft. She was devoted to Adria. Adria considered herself to be more powerful than Maghda, but noted that did not necessarily make her the greater of the two. That while she brought raw power to their partnership, Maghda brought insight. She had the ability to project an apparition of herself and communicate through it.\nMaghda had very pale white skin, draped in an elegant purple dress and headdress. Two butterfly-like creatures clung to her shoulders, providing her with ability to hover above the ground.\nMaghda displayed a sadistic streak and would often taunt her foes. She also displayed a gullible streak when she refused to believe that Belial would betray her."}

Its drawback is that the staff must be equipped to be used. Usually, it is less expensive to recharge a staff than to buy the same number of full mana potions."}
{"id": "8056", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8056", "title": "Magic", "text": "Magic (or Dubhdroiacht in &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;ic) is an essential part of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and the planes surrounding the world.\nLore.\nMagic is an ambient and extremely powerful but fickle and unpredictable force. It can exist in a form of raw energy. The manipulation of magic can be studied and learned, but never fully mastered. Westmarch's Rift-Runners devote considerable study to so-called \"waking invocations,\" spells that have been loosed from their creators' control and yet persist. Enchantments exude an aura that can be sensed by many, but years of training are required to properly exploit the &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; that pervades &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Some magical items' auras are more noticeable than others. Magic carries a scent upon the air and can \"crackle\" in it, akin to ambient energy.\nSome scholars use natural manifestations to explain the workings of the universe. In a common archetype, the physical world is likened to the sky while the &lt;a href=\"Ether\"&gt;ethereal realm&lt;/a&gt; of magic is set as the ocean. Following this line of thought, spells are much like the turbulence that occurs where the two interact with each other. The level of connection varies by month and can have different effects.\nBecause of the &lt;a href=\"Anno%20Kehjistani\"&gt;cycles of time&lt;/a&gt;, each phase of the year has a unique effect on magic, including the creatures of Sanctuary and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, destructive spells are more potent but harder to control during the month of &lt;a href=\"Kathon\"&gt;Kathon&lt;/a&gt;. Healing spells and elixrs are are the most potent during &lt;a href=\"Ostara\"&gt;Ostara&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Esunar\"&gt;Esunar&lt;/a&gt; is the best time to create amulets or perform enchantments on objects. Latent magic, if left untamed, can have mutagenic effects on flora and fauna. \nMagic can be used to create barriers to keep &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s at bay.\nMany fools attribute natural events to magic if lacking a different explanation for the phenomena they've observed.\nExcess energy from one spell can be absorbed by another.\nPractitioners.\nThe ability to practice magic is not universal among &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. Only the strongest of humans can harness anything more than the most basic of magical effects, and even then, much energy is lost in the transition between the physical and ethereal realms. The more flawed one's mastery of magic, the more effort must be made into utilizing it. Some humans, however, are born with magical power beyond their ability to control. Try as they may, some of humanity's greatest heroes often leave destruction in their wake because of this.\nSome &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; are capable of wielding magic, as well as some demons (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Imp\"&gt;imps&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;s can also wield powerful magic.\nMost followers of magic hail from the East, and have a diminished presence in the West. Of note, &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; is rife with nodes of magical energy. However, artifacts discovered in &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt; suggest that magic has been used by the &lt;a href=\"Xian\"&gt;Xian&lt;/a&gt; for millennia. Because magic is so difficult to master, it is traditionally taught under strict conditions in a collection of magical academies. However, &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;some individuals&lt;/a&gt; forsake such restrictions, believing that as long as the reward of such power is worth it, the risk is irrelevant.\nHistory.\nThe use of magic on Sanctuary appears to stem as far back as the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; attempted to preserve the mortal realm by limiting the immense powers of the nephalem through the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. The stymied effects of this remained true on humanity.\nA time existed before magic was formalized into strict disciplines, but this time came to an end not long before the emergence of human civilization. 100 years after the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;, the cultures of the land formalized the study of magic, leading to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;. The three clans of most prominent note were the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ammuit\"&gt;Ammuit&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Ennead\"&gt;Ennead&lt;/a&gt;, the Ammuit focussing on transmutation of matter and enchantments, the Ennead on illusion and manipulation, and the Vizjerei on summoning and conjuring. It was the Vizjerei's actions that would alert the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; of the existence of Sanctuary by summoning demons into the mortal world.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, the magical energies wielded by angels and demons threatened to tear the world apart. After the conflict, which was rationalized as a clash of faiths, the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Age of Magic&lt;/a&gt; began as people turned to the Mage Clans for guidance. At the height of the age, magic was celebrated openly; performed on stage and public square in dazzling displays. However, with the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, this age came to an end, and people turned to faith as the basis for their lives. Numerous tomes were destroyed, laws were passed against the use of magic, and while some mage clans survived, they did so in diminished form. Some magics from this period became lost to history.\nThe time of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be the greatest age of magic, when untold discoveries in the arcane arts were made. These powerful mystics used every ounce of power at their command to preserve humanity. Although the Eastern mage-clans keep watch over vast libraries of magical tomes, it is suspected that a great part of this knowledge was lost when the last of the Horadrim died.\nBy the late 13th century, the Mage Clans had regained some of their influence thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Consortium\"&gt;Trade Consortium&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. In order to make their city a beacon of learning, the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; was constructed, to be stored with arcana and act as a place of learning and growth for the various clans. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; was of the opinion that the sanctum stood as the greatest symbol of mage power and unity since the Age of Magic.\nItems.\nAny object imbued with magic exhibits an aura that is easily noticed. To determine the exact nature of this enchantment, however, requires intense study and an extensive knowledge of arcane materials and symbols. While none have mastered the ability to memorize a spell of this magnitude, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; developed a means for the untrained to discover the secrets of an ensorcelled object by using a rare crystal that is extremely sensitive to magical auras. This sensitivity makes it very fragile, however and the crystal will shatter if it is brought too close to an enchanted item. The very act of identifying such an object also destroys the crystal. Scrolls and staves have been crafted that can be used to identify magical auras. By using special inks and dyes that contain tiny grains of these crystals, the stability of the crystal is maintained until it is used to examine the enchanted object.\nThroughout the ages, &lt;a href=\"artisans\"&gt;artisans&lt;/a&gt; have relied on magic materials to enhance and create powerful items.\nVarious magical items exist. These include &lt;a href=\"amulet\"&gt;amulet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;s, and gems. Precious gems and metals make excellent foci for magical enchantments. Although most of the knowledge of creating such talismans has been either been long lost or is jealously\nguarded by the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;, rings and amulets of power may still be discovered. The primary drawback of enchanted jewelry is that multiple pieces seem to interfere with each other. For this reason, only one ring may be worn on each\nhand, and but one amulet may be worn about the neck.\nThe Vizjerei discovered that magic could be channeled through a &lt;a href=\"staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;. The process of creating such a staff is time consuming, but even a Vizjerei apprenctice can recharge a staff by channeling magic into it. Only those skilled in magic use can use more powerful spell staves.\n&lt;a href=\"Wands\"&gt;Wands&lt;/a&gt; store magical energies within them.\n&lt;a href=\"Scroll\"&gt;Scroll&lt;/a&gt;s prepared with magical inks can create a focus for spells. Such magical scrolls provide the reader with the ability to cast a spell that they normally may not know, without expending any mana. Very powerful spells cannot be used by the untrained, however, for the cryptic symbols upon them are difficult to comprehend. The act of casting the spell drains the scroll of all magical power and causes the parchment to crumble to dust instantly.\nOne form of magic use that is still strong in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; is the brewing of &lt;a href=\"Potions\"&gt;elixirs&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, most magic is in the form of enchanted items and elixirs.\nMagical devices can provide &lt;a href=\"teleport%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;teleportation&lt;/a&gt;\u2014this includes &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;town portal scrolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Shrine\"&gt;Shrine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"well\"&gt;well&lt;/a&gt;s carry magical effects.\n&lt;a href=\"Rune\"&gt;Rune&lt;/a&gt;s are inscribed with magical glyphs.\n&lt;a href=\"Charm\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt;s are items that grant magical enchantments.\nSchools of Magic.\nThe devotees of magic are a segregated lot. They are as leery of students of rival\ndisciplines as a layperson is of all arcane practitioners. Schools of magic include:\nArcane Magic.\nArcane Magic is used by &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s. They use their own bodies as a conduit for this magic, allowing them to control light and time, &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;, create powerful illusions, deflect oncoming attacks, and cast this energy in &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;projectile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Orb\"&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;. New practitioners of magic learn control with a single arcane missile. The dream of just making more follows apprentices on their journey to mastery.\nTruly powerful Wizards are able to turn this energy inwards, using it to augment their abilities. A relationship exists between arcane magic and time. An \"arcane realm\" is said to exist.\nHowever , excess channeling of arcane power can corrupt the body.\nAstral Magic.\nA type of ancient magic enhanced by the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; and stars is practiced by the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt;. This branch appears to be called \"Asterism.\"\nBlack Magic.\nBlack Magic can be imbuned in seeds. It is not discriminating about which it entraps.\nBlood Magic.\nBlood Magic is a type of magic that involves the use of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. The use of this magic can result in &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Golem\"&gt;constructs&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Marsh\"&gt;Blood Marsh&lt;/a&gt; is a nexus for this magic. The &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; can use this magic by using their own blood to power their spells. This usage of blood is required to power their most potent spells. Blood magic is also used by &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; manifested her blood magic using &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s runes.\nDark Magic.\nDark Magic is an ancient, chaotic form of magic. It's chaotic nature makes it to corrupt the surrounding fauna and flora. It is/was used by the peoples of the south of Sanctuary, the nobles of the &lt;a href=\"Fahiran%20Empire\"&gt;Fahiran Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt;. \nThese destructive magics can damage groups of enemies with clouds of acid, gouts of flame and swarms of locusts. Curses and hexes may be cast also, including debilitating poisons and bolts of spirit energy that steal life and vitality. Witch Doctors draw their magic from the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Unformed Land&lt;/a&gt;. However, dark magic also appears to be associated with Hell.\nDark magic can be used to forge necrosis-warding threads breathe longevity into a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the mortal's longevity. However, dark magic 'taints' those who use it, and leaves them vulnerable to demonic possession. This damage can affect both the body and soul. Furthermore, dark magic can corrupt the land itself, such as the case of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemonic Magic.\nDemonic Magic is a type of magic. Demons can be summoned to the physical plane through this method. Blood and human flesh can be used to bolster this magic, with pillars of flesh and bone to anchor effects. Use of demonic magic taints the blood of humans using it. Through the process of summoning, a demon can possess the shell of a human.\nCenturies ago, when using demonic magic, it was common to invoke lesser demons and subdue them in order to gain their power. Fooled by these &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Imp\"&gt;creatures'&lt;/a&gt; small stature, sorcerers underestimated their powers and often summoned them to serve as familiars. Once lulled into trusting these demons, the master would find their will subjugated by that of their \"servant,\" who would then vivisect him and create numerous homunculi from the pieces. &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; detailed the preferred method of summoning demons. One should never attempt to summon a demon alone. Instead, the summoning should be conducted in a group consisting of three, four, or seven individuals (representing the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;combination of the two&lt;/a&gt; respectively).\nOf note, magic was used to create the demonic &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Fiend\"&gt;Winged Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDivination.\nDivination is a type of magic used to uncover hidden knowledge; especially of the past, future and a distant location. The &lt;a href=\"Taan\"&gt;Taan&lt;/a&gt; practice this magic by peering through the &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Realm\"&gt;Astral Realm&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrees can also be used for divination as they can show visions of their pasts, or their deaths. &lt;a href=\"Druids\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt; also practice divination. Under the stars and new &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;, devotees often see new patterns in the night sky, hinting at things yet to come.\nForces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; have their own forms of divination, which usually involves sacrifices. Secrets can be unveiled either through the death-ash of a burnt sacrifice, or through &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruspex\"&gt;haruspex&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt; had a ritual where mutilated sacrifices were drowned in brine.\nElemental Magic.\nIn Elemental Magic, base elements are molded into whatever forms are needed. Weather manipulation is the most impressive form of this branch of magic. The &lt;a href=\"Zann%20Esu%20Clan\"&gt;Zann Esu Clan&lt;/a&gt; pursue the use of elemental magic as per their quest for \"perfect\" magic. Likewise, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt; have practiced elemental magic since the end of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Demon\"&gt;Lightning Demon&lt;/a&gt;s have also demonstrated the power of weather manipulation.\nBranches of elemental magic include:\nElectric Magic.\nElectromagnetism exists on the threshold of the ethereal and physical realms. While it is very efficient to transform mana into electrical energy, it is extremely difficult to control. The power of lightning is that it sees nothing but targets. The caster is able to shield themself from the effects of these spells, but any creature - friend or foe - may be struck. It requires confidence to wield the uncontrollable power of lightning, and something closer to madness to dress oneself in it. Additionally, the use of this branch of magic includes skills such as &lt;a href=\"telekinesis\"&gt;telekinesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ation. At the peak of its use is weather manipulation.\nFire Magic.\nFire lies at the edge of both energy and matter, so it is a simple matter to shape mana into magical flame. Magical fire requires no earthly source. These flames will burn as long as mana feeds them. The Horadrim were skilled enough to create torches that burn with an eternal flame, but those abilities have been long lost. However, a possibly similar device exists in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Light%20of%20Grace\"&gt;Light of Grace&lt;/a&gt;, which through magic, is able to draw warmth from its surroundings to increase its luminescence.\nFire can be used as a projectile, and weapons may be &lt;a href=\"enchant\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt;ed with its power. However, fire is an unpredictable, destructive force, and even for an experienced spellcaster, its use can be uncooperative. Under this branch of magic is the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, which is summoned from the core of the mortal world.\nIce Magic.\nIce is a powerful elemental force. Some Zann Esu argue that cold is the most versatile of the elements; it preserves even that which it destroys. It can be used as both a projectile and means of defense. Winter apparently has a power of its own.\nWind Magic.\nWind is one of the natural elements of Sanctuary. It can be used to create cyclones, storms and vortexes. Wind magic enhances fire magic and ice magic to create firestorms and blizzard.\nHoly Magic.\nHoly Magic (a.k.a. Divine Magic) is gifted to mortals by the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s can call upon this magic. This includes the use of &lt;a href=\"aura\"&gt;aura&lt;/a&gt;s, of both &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Auras\"&gt;defensive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Offensive%20Auras\"&gt;offensive&lt;/a&gt; natures, as well as various &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Skills%20%28Paladin%29\"&gt;combat skills&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20%28Crusader%29\"&gt;Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, as used by &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s, is a form of divine magic, and is fueled by their devotion to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith.\nBy combining this magic with fire, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Bolt%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Holy Bolts&lt;/a&gt; may be cast, though may also be cast as &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Bolt\"&gt;pure&lt;/a&gt; forms of Light.\nNatural Magic.\nNatural Magic is an ancient type of magic. It is used by &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, and was called upon by &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; followers during the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;. It can call on the elements of fire and wind.\nElemental Magic.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Skills\"&gt;Elemental Skills&lt;/a&gt;\"\nYears of study and a life lived in harmony with nature have provided the Druids a unique empathy with the world around them. These skills represent the Druids' ability to influence the forces of nature. Expertise in these skills allows them to strike at enemies from a distance, assault whole groups of enemies at once, and even protect themselves from the elemental attacks of others.\nThese elemental abilities include fire, ice, lightning and wind, yet sources differ from elemental magic. E.g., fire is called upon from the earth itself (whereas elemental magic involves shaping mana into fire), and the wind is called on directly for aid.\n&lt;a href=\"Tempest\"&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt;s also used elemental magic to harness water, wind and lightning. Unlike druids, they do not wield this power in harmony with nature, but use tongues of their &lt;a href=\"Ksathra\"&gt;forgotten&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehrwen\"&gt;empresses&lt;/a&gt; to twist the elements in unnatural shapes.\nShapeshifting.\nThis is perhaps the most astonishing of all the talents granted to the Druids. Shapeshifting allows the Druids to manipulate their own flesh and form, taking on characteristics and capabilities of the beasts they have sworn to protect. Druidic warriors follow two paths: the path of the bear, and the path of the wolf. Some shapeshifting skills are available only to a single animal form, while others are common to both wolf and bear forms.\nSummoning.\nLong ago, the Druids confided in prayer their sacred charge to the supreme spirits of Nature. The spirits were moved by their plight and answered the Druids' call for help. Over the many years since then, the spirits have contributed in many ways to the Druids' cause, even offering up soldiers to serve in their campaign. A Druid educated in the language of the Natural spirits can appeal to them, and they will provide him with valuable companions. These companions fall into three groups: spirit animals, sentient vines, and minor spirits of Nature. &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Circle\"&gt;Witch Circle&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Sharval%20Wilds\"&gt;Sharval Wilds&lt;/a&gt; have a long history of summoning &lt;a href=\"Qlnae\"&gt;Qlnae&lt;/a&gt; as familiars.\nNecromancy.\nNecromancy, otherwise known as the Art of &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, the Art of the Son, Death Magic, or the Dark Arts, is a school of magic. &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s possess necromatic abilities, as do some &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAmong mortals, necromancy has long been abused, and is a reviled practice. It is considered a \"dark\" art, and people believe that the use of necromancy attracts the attention of demons (or outright summoning them) and puts Sanctuary at risk. This is not true however. In point of fact, necromancy involves &lt;a href=\"Summoning%20Spells\"&gt;Summoning Spells&lt;/a&gt;, which can summon &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s, and even &lt;a href=\"revive\"&gt;revival&lt;/a&gt;. Other necromatic abilties are based on the use of &lt;a href=\"Poison%20and%20Bone%20Spells\"&gt;poison and bone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"curses\"&gt;curses&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt; was the first &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; to discover necromancy.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, among mortals, only the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; had access to necromancy, which they gain by drawing on the power of &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt;, Because of their use of necromancy, many people shun the priests. By the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Kiss%20%28Cult%29\"&gt;Mother's Kiss&lt;/a&gt; (a cult dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;) also practiced necromancy. They believed that by practing \"the Art of the Son,\" they would become closer to the Mother of Sanctuary.\nNecromancy gains its power from that of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; itself. Magical expenditure when it comes to raising the dead is not set. For instance, one could spend the same amount of energy summoning 100 mindless skeletons as a single astute one. Necromancy does not need to be directed to take effect; the mere proximity of a practitioner of such dark arts can rouse the dead and disturb those &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s who have earned their rest.\nPreservation Magic.\nPreservation Magic was wielded by the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. Artifacts can be imbued with this magic, and can keep &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s) alive for extended periods (if not indefinitely), even when suffering grievous harm.\nPrime Magic.\nPrime Magic is wielded by the &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt; and Priests of Rathma. Prime energies flow through all living things, and practitioners of necromancy can curse the fate of a victim by manipulating these energies. In the case of the Askari, their use of this magic appears to consist of calling on their deities to empower them with supernatural abilities and to harness their natural spiritual energies.\nShadow Magic.\nShadow Magic, a.k.a. Shadow Energy is used by &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. This consists of apocryphal magics, allowing Demon Hunters to cloak themselves in darkness, confound others attacks, and slip between shadows to sneak up on their prey. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s train in the use of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Disciplines\"&gt;Shadow Disciplines&lt;/a&gt;, which involve obfuscation and the honing of psychic abilities. These disciplines do not involve the casting of actual spells.\nOf note, Demon Hunters can tap into their \"inner demons\" to empower themselves, or even manifest it as a summon.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; can also use shadow magic to create constructs or illusions."}

The conflict lasted many months as the pirates settled in for a long siege.\"\n\"During the battle, supplies ran short, and the Amazon archers found themselves without ammunition. Realizing that their defense rested solely upon the ability of the archers to keep the corsairs at bay, the priests of the city prayed to &lt;a href=\"Athulua\"&gt;Athulua&lt;/a&gt; to aid them. In answer, Athulua infused the minds of the Amazons with the power to harness their &lt;a href=\"prime%20magic\"&gt;natural spiritual energies&lt;/a&gt;. One by one, the archers melded their determination and will into shards of physical force that they then unleashed from their bows by the thousands, firmly routing the corsairs and driving them back to sea. \"\nGeneral Information.\nEven if users run out of arrows during combat, they can still fight until they run out of &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; by using this skill.\nLeveling up Magic Arrow reduces the mana cost.

They are denoted by their name being colored , as opposed to a normal item's white name color. When a Magic item is dropped from a chest or monster, it initially appears as &lt;a href=\"Unidentified%20Items\"&gt;not identified and unidentified&lt;/a&gt; (in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\").\nWhen you identify a Magic Item, you will see certain words added to the item's name, either &lt;a href=\"prefix\"&gt;prefix&lt;/a&gt;es (Such as \"\"Brutal\" Short Sword\"), &lt;a href=\"suffix\"&gt;suffix&lt;/a&gt;es (\"Axe \"of Frost\"), or a combination of both (\"Glowing\" Ring of \"Craftsmanship\"\"). Each prefix or suffix represents one magical property on the item. However, multiple prefixes or suffixes can't appear on one single Magic Item (For more on that, see &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt;). This means that a Magic item can have a maximum of two affixes. There is a 1/4 chance of a Magic item having both a prefix and a suffix, a 1/4 chance of only a prefix, and a 1/2 chance of only a suffix. In Diablo I, unlike other games, affixes can actually be \"negative\", lowering attributes (such as &lt;a href=\"Tin\"&gt;Tin&lt;/a&gt; affix lowering the chance to hit).\nAlmost every attribute that appears on Magic items can also appear on Rare items, but there are a few that are Magic-only (they will only appear on Magic items).\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", magic items do not need to be identified.

{"id": "11992", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11992", "title": "Magic find", "text": "Magic Find is the common term for items that possess the \"% Better Chance Of Getting Magic Items\" (&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;) or \"% Better Chance of Finding Magical Items\" (&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;). It is a magical effect that increases the likelihood that a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; will drop. Before high magic find penalties, it will scale up the chance for an enemy to drop a magical item linearly based on their drop rate. Magic Find is added across all items for your character.\nDiablo II.\nNote that this is based upon the monsters' chance to drop an item. If you find an item that gives 20% Better Chance of Getting a Magic Item, and a Monster has a 2% chance to drop a Magic Item, you will now have 2.4% chance of getting that Magic Item. So having 100% Magic Find does not guarantee a Unique/Rare/Set drops.\nMagic Find can provide a significant increase in the number of &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Items&lt;/a&gt; you find. Players that wish to find \"good\" Rare Items, and more Set and Unique Items will want to invest heavy in this magical bonus. Just remember, you can never have enough % Magic Find. Increasing your Magic Find Percentage will always help you.\nMaximizing Magic Find.\nA common comment is that with a lot of Magic Find, you won't be able to kill anything. Some classes such as spell casters (Sorceress, Necromancer, Elemental Druid) are more capable of sacrificing all equipment for Magic Find. You may wish to create \"Magic Find Characters\" to \"farm\" or find items then use those items on other characters. Still, melee classes (the Barbarian in particular due to the Find Item skill) can be very successful at treasure hunting.\nHere's how to get the most (1167%) out of Magic Find for yourself. This does not count the maximum possible with Hirelings, but you only receive that bonus when Hirelings make a kill. Add Magic Find to Hirelings to increase Magic Find even more. Some items are pretty rare making it difficult, but not impossible (especially with time and trading), to obtain the most Magic Find. Alternative \"poor man\" items are suggested.\n&lt;a href=\"Ist%20Rune\"&gt;Ist Rune&lt;/a&gt;s are generally socketed for maximum potential with +25% each, or +30% in weapons. Since acquiring many Ist Runes can be very difficult, perfect &lt;a href=\"Topaz\"&gt;Topaz&lt;/a&gt; gems can be substituted in helms or body armor with a minor loss at +24% each. Although much more rare than topazes and not as powerful, &lt;a href=\"Jewel\"&gt;Jewel&lt;/a&gt;s with the (+3-7%) and &lt;a href=\"Prosperity\"&gt;Prosperity&lt;/a&gt; (+5-10%) may also be used; with both affixes, an \"Emerald Jewel of Prosperity\" could be worth a maximum of +17%. You can add sockets via &lt;a href=\"Siege%20on%20Harrogath%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;a quest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube%23Diablo%20II%201.10%20recipes\"&gt;Horadric Cube recipe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo Immortal.\nMagic Find returns as a secondary stat in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", and is granted by &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt;s at Rank 5.\nDiablo III.\nMagic Find was relatively prominent in the initial release of the third game, similar to its predecessor. Since release, significant patch changes have shifted the focus from being based on items to being based on &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; tiers and &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt; levels. Higher difficulty increases the chance to find higher quality items, to the point where numerous s drop on each Greater Rift run of higher levels. Outside of Greater Rifts, &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s double Magic Find, and some levels of a &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Vision of Enmity&lt;/a&gt; have significantly increased Magic Find.\nMagic Find cannot appear as a random &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;item attribute&lt;/a&gt; any more, so the item &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; are the only sources that can still drop. Their bonuses, and even a maxed-out set of Magic Find gear from the earlier patches, are insignificant compared to the bonuses from current high level play, especially given the added combat power of newer gear.\nDevelopment.\nMagic Find initially worked similarly to \"Diablo II\". It could appear as an &lt;a href=\"Affix\"&gt;item attribute&lt;/a&gt; on many equipment types. Each &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; level increased Magic Find by 3%. 20% of any &lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;Follower&lt;/a&gt;'s Magic Find bonus applied to the player. A &lt;a href=\"Topaz\"&gt;Topaz&lt;/a&gt; socketed into a Helm provided increased Magic find. All of these combined had a hard cap of 300% increased Magic Find chance.\nWhen in a party, the Magic Find chance improved by 10% for all players with each party member beyond the first. Before Patch 1.0.4, Magic Find was averaged among all party members, for example one member wearing gear granting 100% Magic Find chance and the other wearing no Magic Find gear would result in both having 50% bonus to Magic Find.\nPatch 2.0 preceding the release of \"\" altered much of the game, including the loot system and Magic Find:\nPatch 2.1 added &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s with their accompanying level system, allowing access to even higher difficulties of play, with the accompanying bonuses to Magic Find.\nPatch 2.4.2 changed &lt;a href=\"Topaz\"&gt;Topaz&lt;/a&gt;es to grant &lt;a href=\"Resource%20Cost%20Reduction\"&gt;Resource Cost Reduction&lt;/a&gt; instead of Magic Find when &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed into &lt;a href=\"Helms\"&gt;Helms&lt;/a&gt;."}

Each different property provides a bonus to one &lt;a href=\"Character%20Attributes\"&gt;character statistic&lt;/a&gt;, divided into two categories: Primary, increasing direct combat power, and Secondary, benefiting minor combat mechanics or overall progression. &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic Items&lt;/a&gt; have one or two properties, while higher quality levels can have up to six, with several exceptions.\nFor the most part, the properties on a newly dropped or crafted item are randomly chosen, with a pool of possible properties for each item type. The exact bonus amount provided by each property is also randomized within a certain range. &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; allows changing one property on an item to new random values or to a different property entirely.\nNumber of properties.\n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic Items&lt;/a&gt; have up to two magic properties, while &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt; have four to six, up to a maximum of 4 Primary and 2 Secondary properties. &lt;a href=\"Off-hand\"&gt;Off-hand&lt;/a&gt; items are an exception to this rule; they have a guaranteed extra property which does not count against those maximums. Any mix of Primary and Secondary properties is possible within those limits.\n&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt; items are guaranteed to have at least six properties. They usually follow the same 4/2 distribution, but two variations are not uncommon:\nBonus amounts.\nThe stat bonuses for each property on an individual item are chosen randomly when it drops or is crafted. The minimum and maximum possible stat bonus is determined based on item type, &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; or crafted item level, and quality tier. &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt; Items share the lowest possible ranges of values, while &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt; items have higher ranges. The highest maximums are achieved by &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Item\"&gt;Ancient Item&lt;/a&gt;s, which have about 30% larger values. Finally, &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Item\"&gt;Primal Ancient Items&lt;/a&gt; do not increase the maximums further, but they \"always\" provide the \"maximum bonus possible\" for every single property.\nDifferent item types not only have different possible properties, but also different value ranges for a given property. However, for each possible bonus, item types can usually be formed into groups that do share the same value range for that bonus. Some type/bonus combinations have particularly high ranges, making those bonuses particularly desirable on that item type.\nMagic properties that add absolute (rather than percentage-based) bonus damage add a random amount from a range on every hit. The minimum and maximum of this range is itself randomly determined when the item drops, as with other properties, but they are \"not\" independent; items with higher minimum added damage tend to have a higher maximum as well, though this is not guaranteed.\nDevelopment.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" initially used a system similar to its predecessor, with a clearly prefix- and suffix-driven setup, and items potentially having higher levels depending on the game zone and difficulty they dropped in. These concepts were made obsolete with the increased focus on &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; for itemization, and simplification of item levels and reorganization of how properties were determined in the &lt;a href=\"Loot%202.0\"&gt;Loot 2.0&lt;/a&gt; system."}

One of these angelic soldiers made a bold attack and struck a fierce blow that caused the foul blood of Mephisto to rain upon the ground. Each drop that fell seared through the crust of Hell itself and formed powerful demons shaped from molten rock.

In his nervous excitement he accepted and \"was lead through the golden gates of the palace.\" There they were offered a \"great feast of steak and wine\", with \"dancers as entertainment.\" At a point, he drank a \"wine that didn't taste good.\"\nLater, the whole palace faded away and he found himself in the &lt;a href=\"Domain%20of%20Horror\"&gt;Domain of Horror&lt;/a&gt; feasting on &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; flesh and &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;.

Her compassion as a healer extended to all of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;kind, if not the forces of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly Life.\nThere was a time when Malah thought she was destined to become a &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;. However, her &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;powers&lt;/a&gt; never developed beyond the simplest of spells. Instead, she pursued the path of a healer (taking an oath of compassion, able to heal almost any wound with time and energy. She accumulated a lifetime of experience in this role.\nThe Lord of Destruction.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; lay siege to &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;, she did her best to help the many wounded and dying. She was plagued, however, by the fear that there might be no ultimate recovery for her people or &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, there was a shortage of medical supplies, and any who might supply Harrogath demanded large amounts of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the siege, she lost her last living child, &lt;a href=\"Bannuk\"&gt;Bannuk&lt;/a&gt;, to a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;. Grief and rage both affected her, though she was able to admit that Bannuk's quick death was a blessing. At some point, &lt;a href=\"Larzuk\"&gt;Larzuk&lt;/a&gt; asked her for twenty of her finest sheepskins. He said he would fill them with hot air and float like a cloud above the battlefield to spy on Baal's legions. She refused, and wondered if the siege had driven him mad.\nTowards the end of the siege, she overheard &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anya\"&gt;Anya&lt;/a&gt; arguing about the death of Anya's &lt;a href=\"Aust\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;. The day afterwards, Anya was gone.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; arrived at Harrogath, Malah was greatful for their presence. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;one of Bannuk's friends&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Isendra\"&gt;Isendra&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;. She asked her if, after the siege, she might be able to teach her some magic.\nAs the siege continued, she told the heroes about what she'd seen in regards to Nihlathak and Anya's argument. She warned them not to trust Nihlathak, stating that she believed him to be responsible for Anya's disappearance, and that Anya was still alive. The heroes found Anya, and Malah gave them a &lt;a href=\"Malah%27s%20Potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; to free her.\nUltimately, Baal was defeated, but not before he was able to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. She concluded that if &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; said it had to be destroyed, so be it. The world would be forever changed, but who could say it wouldn't be for the better?\nThe Worldstone was destroyed, but at the cost of devastating the surrounding area.\nIn-game.\nMalah is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in Harrogath, in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMalah is involved in the quest.

A dark and sinister servant of Hatred, Malic can be said to have been one of the most powerful human servants of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s. Malic makes an appearance in all three novels of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28novels%29\"&gt;Sin War trilogy&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nMalic joined the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; as a simple acolyte, but worked his way up through the ranks by dedication, perseverance - and the occasional murder of his rivals. He soon became one of Lucion's most trusted servants, even dubbed as his favorite. \nThough Malic probably knew more about the dark secrets of the Triune than any mortal, his beliefs were still not entirely the truth. Lucion led Malic to believe it were the Three who had created &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and through it, all life. However they were betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, whom they thought to be their ally - and cast out of the realm they had created. The Triune was merely trying to bring back to the Three to their rightful place. Malic, being obsessed with a thirst for power, understood that, as a reward for his service, he would wield powers unfathomable even by the Mage clans of &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;. \nGranted a greatly increased lifespan by his master, Malic sought to capture &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt; after his powers were noticed by &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt;. However, his initial attempt failed due to the unexpected presence of the demoness &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; who, disguised as the noblewoman &lt;a href=\"Lylia\"&gt;Lylia&lt;/a&gt; lent her powers to Uldyssian, allowing him to overcome the summoned demons and &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Warders\"&gt;Peace Warders&lt;/a&gt; with ease. \nMalic was granted a second chance however; this time &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt; transformed the high priest's arm into a demon limb. Trusting the priest it was in fact a weapon, the demon limb was in reality a last resort: a way to remove Lilith's disguise, revealing her true form to Uldyssian. \nThis time Malic received additional aid as he was given a band of vicious &lt;a href=\"morlu\"&gt;morlu&lt;/a&gt; to do his bidding. Disguising himself and his morlu as notable citizens of &lt;a href=\"Partha\"&gt;Partha&lt;/a&gt; and friends of Uldyssian, Malic managed to ambush the farmer and his friends at their resting place during the night. However, his plans were once again thwarted as he faced off against Lilith. The demoness managed to use the demon limb against him; Malic was flayed alive, resulting in a swift death. \nMalic made a reappearance in the second book of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sin%20War%20%28novels%29\"&gt;Sin War trilogy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scales%20of%20the%20Serpent\"&gt;Scales of the Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. His spirit was summoned from his ashes by &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt;, who bound the spirit inside one of Malic's remaining bones. Malic's spirit served as a guide for Uldyssian during his travel through the labyrinth beneath the great Temple of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;, just before the final showdown with Lilith.\nThe Ravenous Specter.\nThis was not the end of Malic, however. Just before Uldyssian confronted Lilith, Malic convinced the farmer to throw his bone into the darkness - stabbing an unfortunate priest called &lt;a href=\"Durram\"&gt;Durram&lt;/a&gt; in the forehead. This did not only kill the priest, but also allowed Malic's vile spirit to possess the body. \nExactly how Malic managed to escape the crumbling Temple of the Triune remains unknown. After it's destruction Malic vowed to track down the one man ultimately responsible for his death: Uldyssian. As he raced through the jungle, his spirit started burning out the host's body, as the wrong-ness of his spirit was rejected by the host. Malic decided that the only body strong enough to contain his spirit would be that of Uldyssian. \nOn his quest to obtain Uldyssians body, Malic left a trail of dead as his spirit constantly needed new vessels to inhabit. Though the act of possessing a person (which killed the host) went faster with each subsequent attempt, the bodies started to burn out at an increasing rate. Black lesions would form all over their bodies, until they eventually became charred husks. In his desperation, Malic made a pact with both the Lord of Terror &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself and the renegade Inarius. Malic managed to possess &lt;a href=\"Amolia\"&gt;Amolia&lt;/a&gt;, a high ranking sorceress working for the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Clans\"&gt;Council of Clans&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to murder the entire council and blame the act on Uldyssian. When this plot ultimately failed, Inarius allowed Malic to possess one of his most trusted servants, &lt;a href=\"Oris\"&gt;Oris&lt;/a&gt;. In his guise of Oris Malic lead the final charge of the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; against the Edyrem army. \nIn the final battle, Malic possessed the body of &lt;a href=\"Jonas\"&gt;Jonas&lt;/a&gt;, one of the captains in Uldyssian's army. Through Jonas, Malic attempted to possess &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt;, which would in turn enable him to get close to his target - Uldyssian. But Malic's evil plans were at last thwarted as the undead &lt;a href=\"Achilios\"&gt;Achilios&lt;/a&gt; intervened, saving Mendeln. Mendeln then managed to oust Malic's spirit, forever banishing the High Priest to the afterlife.\nTraits and Powers.\nMalic is described as being a cunning and sinister human being. \nAs a reward for his service, Malic was granted several boons. His lifespan was greatly increased; he had lived twice as long as a normal human being. Malic was also granted special sight, as he could see in the dark as if it were day. Malic also possessed the power to heal himself; control (lesser) demons and conjure diversions. When in contact with other living beings Malic possessed the ability to control their every move. After acquiring the demon limb, Malic gained the ability to 'steal' a person's flesh. This allowed Malic to disguise himself as that particular human. "}

They made their lairs in &lt;a href=\"Malignant%20Tunnels\"&gt;underground tunnels&lt;/a&gt; from which they would emerge to plague the surface. There was no cure for Malignancy save &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThere is evidence that the Malignant, or some kind of Malignant antecedent, existed as early as the first half of the 13th century. During the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Inquisition\"&gt;Zakarum Inquisition&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;Church of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; carried out experiments in &lt;a href=\"Karamat%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Karamat's Reach&lt;/a&gt; on Malingnant/Malignant-like creatures using &lt;a href=\"Cages%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Cages of Binding&lt;/a&gt;. Their goal was apparently to separate \"darkness from &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;.\" The experiments ended with Cages strong enough to always kill the creatures when used on them.\nThe origins of the Malignant in their most recent form can be traced back to the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; came to a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; in the Peaks, her words driving the townsfolk man, causing them to turn against the two &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; priests present, &lt;a href=\"Varshan\"&gt;Varshan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cormond\"&gt;Cormond&lt;/a&gt;. Varshan refused to abandon his flock, and Cormond fled, only to return with a &lt;a href=\"Cage%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Cage of Binding&lt;/a&gt;, sometime after Lilith's &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. He used it on Varshan, hoping to remove his corruption, but instead, the corruption burst out of him. It consumed Varshan, both body and &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, turning him into the first Malignant.\nThe Malignant roamed the land with infectious turmoil, killing at random without mercy. &lt;a href=\"Cormond\"&gt;Cormond&lt;/a&gt; found a way to rip the dark power out of the Malignant and use it to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's advantage in destroying them. To this end, he allied with a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, but one by one, they were killed by the Malignant. Bereft of other options, he wrote to , begging for aid.\nThe Malignant spread from the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. With each passing day, they encroached on &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s. Cormond requested to hold them at bay while he worked on finding a cure. They later spread to &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of Varshan, the death knell for the Malignant was sounded, as without their progenitor, they would start to diminish. Ultimately, the Malignant were wiped out.\nIn-game.\nMalignant were &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;Elite Monsters&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player slew a Partly Corrupted Malignant Monster, a &lt;a href=\"Malignant%20Heart\"&gt;Malignant Heart&lt;/a&gt; would appear, and by interacting with it, a Fully Corrupted Malignant Monster, an empowered version of the Elite the player just defeated, would rise alongside other minions. If the player defeated the Fully Corrupted enemy, a &lt;a href=\"Caged%20Heart\"&gt;Caged Heart&lt;/a&gt; would drop."}

Once the &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; of Wisdom, he became the &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;. \nBiography.\nOrigins.\nAs with all angels, Malthael was born from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;. He was among the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s, and among the five who best represented the five virtues of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; (in his case, wisdom). Alongside &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;, Malthael formed the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; to lead angelkind. He served as the Council's leader (and its eldest member), and through it, led angelkind as a whole.\nThe Great Conflict.\nAs with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; and its leaders, Malthael participated in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt; and played a crucial role in it. \nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;, when the angels were young, Malthael was the one who found the Eye of Anu in &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt; and named it the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. All of angelkind swore to defend it.\nWrath.\nIn one &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Battlefield\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; against the forces of Hell in Pandemonium, Malthael operated in sync with the rest of the Council, as they fought &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic forces led by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. Malthael easily deflected the demons' attacks right back at them and used his weapons to immobilize &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself. However, &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;\u2019 hotheadedness led to the Lord of Terror being brutally struck down rather than being taken prisoner as Tyrael and Auriel intended to, which would have been beneficial to the war effort. Malthael remained silent the entire time.\nThe Sin War.\nNot all minions of &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; were content to be bound by the Great Conflict. The result was that under the leadership of the angel &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and demon &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, a number of rogues stole the Worldstone and created their own realm\u2014&lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Malthael became consumed with discovering where the artifact had disappeared to, and as the Archangel of Wisdom, was tortured by his inability to find it.\nThe coupling of angel and demon would lead to the rise of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. Following Sanctuary's creation, while it was originally hidden from the High Heavens, Malthael's mood darkened. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would later speculate that the existence of the nephalem clouded Malthael's vision or opened his eyes to a new truth, or that there was a connection between the nephalem and Malthael's chalice that the angel became aware of. Towards the end of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, Heaven became aware of the existence of Sanctuary, and in the final battle, the forces of Heaven, Hell, and the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; clashed against each other. Malthael watched on, and beheld the existence of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the Angiris Council convened to discuss Sanctuary's fate and that of its inhabitants. Malthael abstained from voting, but the end result was that Sanctuary and its denizens would be allowed to exist, free to choose their own path.\nWisdom's End.\nMalthael disappeared after the of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Just prior to this, he had apparently taken a greater interest in humanity. His departure broke the unity of the Angiris Council. Some speculated (correctly) that he haunted the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Pandemonium\"&gt;Halls of Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;, seeking answers to the unknowable mysteries of life and death. Malthael did wander these halls, but in madness, as humanity obscured wisdom from his vision. Adria speculated that Malthael knew that Tyrael was responsible for the Worldstone's destruction, and knew why he'd been forced to carry out the action he did. Perhaps, in his \"last gasp of wisdom,\" Malthael had realized that no matter what the angels did, Hell would always find a way to control humanity. That the Angiris Council's quest to preserve order was doomed to fail, and thus, he abandoned it.\nAfter Diablo's &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt; in his siege of the High Heavens, a now mortal &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; took Malthael's place as the Aspect of Wisdom. Malthael saw these events, and had seen the events that had led up to them. He had seen the actions of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, a human who had embraced evil. He had beheld the latent power of the nephalem hero. He had seen that hero defeat the Prime Evil, an act that in all his years of war in the Eternal Conflict, he had never been able to match. Faced with such power, and beholding humanity as an abomination, Malthael resolved to become the embodiment of Death. While he had been unable to vote for humanity's destruction at the end of the Sin War, Malthael now saw wisdom in the eradication of humankind.\nMalthael discovered a whirling vortex of human souls within the heart of Pendemonium Fortress, where the great Worldstone once rested. He transformed this into a Soul Prison and harnessed the spirits' energy to become the Aspect of Death. With the Lords of Hell defeated, he reasoned that humanity was the most powerful \"demonic\" force left now, as per their ancient nephalem heritage. With humanity's eradication, Heaven would stand alone, victorious in the Great Conflict. He established the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; as his base of operations.\u00a0Imperius's lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Balzael\"&gt;Balzael&lt;/a&gt;, fell in league with Malthael. He also came to be joined by &lt;a href=\"Urzael\"&gt;Urzael&lt;/a&gt;, who shared Malthael's views on humanity. The angelic &lt;a href=\"Death%20Maiden\"&gt;maidens&lt;/a&gt; that Urzael had brought with him also pledged themselves to Malthael's cause. Malthael also manipulated the &lt;a href=\"Templar%20Order\"&gt;Templar Order&lt;/a&gt; sect in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; to act as a distraction in Sanctuary so that his &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;wider efforts&lt;/a&gt; would not be detected.\nStorm of Light.\nIn the aftermath of Diablo's assault on Heaven, Malthael, going by the moniker of \"the Guardian,\" was kept informed of events by &lt;a href=\"Balzael\"&gt;Balzael&lt;/a&gt;. He was told of how the Black Soulstone was corrupting the Angiris Council, just as he planned. The Council was discussing the fate of Sanctuary, and it was Malthael's goal that the stone be given enough time to corrupt the Council so that they would resolve to unleash the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; upon the mortal world, eradicating humanity. However, Tyrael's act of reforming the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; in a bid to retrieve the stone threw his plans into jeopardy. That, and the Templar Order sect he'd influenced in Westmarch was scattered by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, its members killed or imprisoned. The stone was taking too long to sway the Council against humanity, so Malthael altered his plans. He was aware that Tyrael had found &lt;a href=\"Corvus\"&gt;Corvus&lt;/a&gt;, which would make for a useful stronghold. Although its enchantments denied entry to non-mortals, Balzael believed Malthael would overcome that problem. At the Pools of Wisdom, Malthael informed Balzael to let Tyrael and the Horadrim take the stone. Once it was out of Heaven, he would take the stone for himself and enact a new plan, one that would still lead to humanity's end. The plan worked, and the Horadrim retrieved the stone.\nIn Sanctuary, Malthael possessed one of the &lt;a href=\"Norlun\"&gt;captive Templars&lt;/a&gt;, and killed the others that had been imprisoned with the man. Malthael used his powers to extinguish the torches of the cells and reap the souls of the other prisoners. He then moved down into the catacombs that would take him to Corvus. And to the Black Soulstone.\nReaper of Souls.\nNot long after Tyrael took on his former aspect, Malthael re-emerged, now embodying the aspect of death. Within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Tomb of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, he confronted his erstwhile brother and a group of Horadrim, who were in the process of containing the Black Soulstone. Malthael effortlessly slew the Horadrim members and devoured their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s in the process (minus &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt;). While he was able to defend himself against Malthael's initial onslaught, Tyrael could not harm Malthael and was also incapacitated. Seeing that Tyrael's soul was free of demonic taint (unlike those of humans), he did not see Tyrael as his enemy and ultimately decided to spare his life. After casting Tyrael aside, Malthael then approached the stonewith intent on bending its powers to his will, and bringing an end to the Great Conflict once and for all. Tyrael (powerless to stop Malthael), declared that the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; would stop him. Malthael paused his approach and turned to face his mortal brother; responding that no one could stop death, before shattering the restraints and claiming the Soulstone for himself.\nAfterwards, Malthael led his &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. By the time &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; re-emerged to confront him, his plan to eradicate humanity was near completion.\nBoth Tyrael and the Nephalem were baffled as to why Malthael had forcefully taken the Black Soulstone. As the Nephalem fought to save what was left of Westmarch, Tyrael deciphered a sliver of the Black Soulstone that had been broken off and left behind. Eventually, the Nephalem tracked Malthael's location to the Pandemonium Fortress while Tyrael finished deciphering the Soulstone sliver. Much to the horror of his foes, Malthael was fundamentally altering the Black Soulstone to consume and contain\u00a0all demonic essence in Sanctuary. This meant that humanity faced annihilation as their demonic heritage would be torn from their souls by the stone and their bodies ripped apart. Malthael continued his work from the heart of the Pandemonium Fortress, continually feeding off the increasing souls of the dead and growing more powerful with each passing moment.\u00a0\nIn an act of betrayal against his fellow angels, Malthael led his Reapers to attack the Pandemonium Gate in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the Nephalem from following him. Doing this drew the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; into conflict with him, particularly &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, who was shocked to learn of Malthael's betrayal. Although Imperius did not care whether Malthael wanted to destroy humanity, he did agree that Malthael had to be stopped and sent his angels to aid the Nephalem against Malthael in Pandemonium.\u00a0\nAs the Nephalem fought their way through the &lt;a href=\"Battlefields%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Battlefields of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and gained entrance to the Pandemonium Fortress, Malthael taunted the hero, claiming the eradication of humanity had already begun. The Nephalem, now empowered and wielding the forces of Death itself, confronted Malthael at the heart of the fortress. Malthael proved to be an incredibly powerful adversary, displaying masterful prowess with his weapons as well as bombarding the Nephalem with waves of undeath. To bring the battle to an end, Malthael summoned the Black Soulstone into the fortress and shattered it, consuming the essence of Diablo. While this granted Malthael a massive boost in power, he was still ultimately defeated by the Nephalem. Malthael's defeat was shown to be a painful, agonizing one; coupled with a blinding explosion of energy that destroyed the roof of the fortress. As he fell to the floor below, the souls of all he had consumed erupted from his body, and his body slowly disintegrated. This included Diablo himself who, thanks to Malthael's actions, was now free.\nLegacy.\nMalthael's actions had a lasting impact on both Sanctuary and Heaven. On Sanctuary, entire populations had been decimated, and &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; ravaged. Malthael's actions had eradicated 50% (or even 90%) of the human race. The carnage led to religious schisms, famine, and war amongst mankind. Even several decades after his defeat, humanity's lot had not improved. Heaven likewise suffered greatly at the hands of the Reapers, and after Malthael's defeat, shuttered their gates.\nAt some point during or after Malthael's genocide, Tyrael learnt of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Soulsmasher\"&gt;Soulsmasher&lt;/a&gt;, a weapon supposedly crafted by Malthael. He suspected that the weapon was crafted as part of an early attempt to free human souls for his consumption. He was left to wonder how long Malthael's madness had gone unnoticed by those closest to him.\nRumors persisted that Malthael once took part in a game of chance with a mortal, the mortal winning a &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Bargain\"&gt;pair of breeches&lt;/a&gt;. As the clothing drew out the life of all those close by, the winner brought about the demise of his entire household. &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; reflected that if the story was true, Malthael was a sore loser.\nEven &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;fifty years&lt;/a&gt; after his defeat, the legacy of Malthael's actions could still be felt in Sanctuary.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nMalthael will appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo III.\nMalthael is the main antagonist of \"\".\u00a0He serves as the &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;Act Boss&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Act%20V%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt;, and defeating him ends the storyline offered by the expansion.\nHe is referenced in item flavor text for the &lt;a href=\"Soulsmasher\"&gt;Soulsmasher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Bargain\"&gt;Death's Bargain&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips and Other Additional Information.\nWhile players are fighting through the streets of Westmarch, there is a chance that any of the still-living &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Soldier\"&gt;guardsmen&lt;/a&gt; of the city, when corrupted by the Reapers, will be turned into a Shade of Malthael. Though these roughly maintain his appearance, they do so with a darkened hue, and only make use of his whirling ring attack. Other than this, the Shades are of little threat, usually having some more &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; than the average &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20Soldier\"&gt;Revenant Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe final battle with Malthael occurs on a relatively small circular platform. There are two health wells to the west and east. The battle is divided into three phases. The following abilities are ones he uses during the whole fight:\nPhase 1: You Will Be The Last of Your Kind.\nAdditional ability:\nPhase 2: The End is Inevitable.\nThere is no cutscene or any event upon reaching the second phase of the fight, but the player will have reached this phase if Malthael utters that \"The end is inevitable\" (occurs after Malthael suffers at least 25% of his total Life in damage). For this phase, his Death Shroud and Soul Nova abilities are replaced with the ability to summon minions and to invoke Skull Spiral:\nNote that if you keep close to the edge to avoid the souls, it is possible to get pinned down, so it's best to have a skill like &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt; ready.\nOnce Malthael's health is low enough (somewhere below 50%), all remaining Exorcists die. In a cutscene, Malthael shatters the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; and absorbs it into his body. This starts the final stage.\nPhase 3: Not the Only Weapon.\nSkull Spiral and Summoning abilities are replaced with Soul Sweep, and Death Shroud can be used again.\nOtherwise, the main difference is the larger amount of Death Shrouds: Malthael can now spawn them two at a time.\nPerhaps due to his insane Life (7 billion at Torment VI (70) for \"soloing\" heroes), Malthael has no enrage timer (there have been precedents of fighting him for up to 3 hours on Torment VI difficulty). However, this fight is more of a survival battle, not a DPS race, as the amount of damage that will be inevitably taken is insane. A high degree of &lt;a href=\"Toughness\"&gt;Toughness&lt;/a&gt;, especially against that of Cold damage, coupled with a source of independent damage (like pets), kiting and/or damage absorption is seen as the better choice rather than a pure glass cannon build. The best moment for using the damage &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s, if any, is when Malthael first prepares his Soul Sweep attack, as for a few seconds, he is extremely vulnerable (provided one manages to get behind him in time). If playing alone, be sure to equip your &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;s with items that make them more durable (generally, a great deal of Cold resistance, if one does not have access to the legendary follower items that prevent them from dying), otherwise the amount of damage they will inevitably receive will keep them incapacitated for the whole fight.\nSome tips to keep in mind for surviving the Soul Sweep: if Malthael suffers a penalty to &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;, the area covered by the shards will be larger than normal. If Malthael suffers a big debuff to his attack speed, the damage will eventually become \"unavoidable\". If possible, avoid slowing his attack speed for this reason. Fortunately, this is one of the few times slowing down an opponent's rate of attacks will prove rather detrimental. Also, if at all possible, try to avoid using a movement skill like &lt;a href=\"Furious%20Charge\"&gt;Furious Charge&lt;/a&gt; \"into\" Malthael's position if at all possible. The reason for this is because \"all\" the fireballs fired off will hit the Nephalem, causing massive damage.\nEven the Angel of Death has his weaknesses, however. Since most of the damage dealt is Cold, a Talisman of Aranoch will give a player some protection. As Malthael himself also possesses a greater degree of Life than even &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s of his level, if there ever was a time to use a &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos%27s%20Wedding%20Band\"&gt;Bul-Kathos's Wedding Band&lt;/a&gt;, he would be the best candidate for its drain.\nUpon death, Malthael drops a\u00a0guaranteed\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Wraps\"&gt;Reaper's Wraps&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0recipe (if the player doesn't have one yet). Upon the very first kill, he also drops one &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; item in &lt;a href=\"Campaign\"&gt;Campaign&lt;/a&gt; mode (can be reset by starting anew). Before patch 2.0.6., he also\u00a0had a chance to drop the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Fear\"&gt;Reaper's Fear&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0ingredient.\nBugs.\nIt is possible to be permanently stuck at the edge of the platform, unable to move normally, which is especially deadly combined with Malthael's Drain Soul and Death Shroud attacks. This is especially risky for Hardcore characters, as chances of surviving the fight in that case are negligible.\nDevelopment.\nMalthael's presence in \"Reaper of Souls\" was designed/dictated by &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Mosqueira\"&gt;Josh Mosqueira&lt;/a&gt;. He wanted Malthael, as the game's antagonist, to balance out against the game's new protagonist (the &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;).\nHeroes of the Storm.\nMalthael also appears as a playable character in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMost of his lore and \"Diablo III\" abilities make a comeback, though heavily reworked.\nHe was considered for inclusion in \"Heroes of the Storm\" from the beginning, but his place for the original release was taken by &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther.\nMalthael has a presence in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Chess\"&gt;Diablo Chess&lt;/a&gt;\". He represents the rook piece.\nPersonality and Traits.\nMalthael was a gaunt figure, adorned in black robes and armor. As the Archangel of Wisdom, he was once an intelligent and noble being who was said to cherish all life. However, he came to be regarded as melancholic, evasive, and even frightening, and was an enigma even to his own kind. He rarely spoke, was slow to anger and could be ponderous and slow to act, but was revered by other angels for his insight. When he did speak, his voice was said to have enraptured other angels through its melody and the wisdom it conveyed. However, as his demeanor darkened, his voice became chilling and could even provoke thoughts of foreboding and feelings of angst. &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; was one such example, Malthael's voice filling him with thoughts of permanent, empty death. Malthael saw humanity as an \"abomination\" that shouldn't exist.\u00a0In &lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;his writings&lt;/a&gt;, Malthael revealed that he started hearing strange voices (the sound, as he himself titled it) calling him to Pandemonium. After learning about the potential and power that humanity had within itself, he concluded them to be abominations, as he thought that their ability to have free will was not natural in the order of things between angels and demons.\nAdria had a degree of respect for Malthael; far more than for other angels. Speculating that he saw the folly in the Angiris Council's attempts to maintain order, she stated that \"for that, at least, he has my respect.\" However, Malthael's ability to see the true nature of things made him (in her view), unpredictable, unknowable, and dangerous.\"\nAs the Angel of Death, Malthael became even darker, callously murdering those who opposed him and seeing things in black and white. He saw virtue only in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and had no interest in the concept of the &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt;. He was willing to destroy humanity by any means necessary and even went so far as to betray his angelic brethren. His wings, once bright and purple, had become white and wispy, skeletal in their appearance. The method of his transformation was different from other corrupted angels such as &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nWisdom was once Malthael's aspect, thus, he was bound to see all things. He so derived this ability from &lt;a href=\"Chalad%27ar\"&gt;Chalad'ar&lt;/a&gt;, the Chalice of Wisdom. This ability was reduced, if not outright removed by apparently the mere existence of humanity, at least after the Worldstone's destruction. While Malthael was slow to anger, he was still a peerless combatant. Wielding a pair of sickle-like &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotel\"&gt;shotels&lt;/a&gt;, he was able to deflect enemy attacks with only the slightest use of force.\nAs the Archangel of Wisdom, Malthael was one of the most powerful angels in existence. As the Angel of Death, Malthael's power only grew stronger. In this new aspect, Malthael demonstrated the ability to rip souls, possess mortals, absorb &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, and rot bodies by creating a dense fog with his wings. He was also extremely in-tune with souls, and was able to sense any demonic taint within them.\u00a0In addition, Malthael managed to attune himself to deathly shadow, becoming partially phased out of reality and therefore immune to all physical or magical harm, even to blows of angelic blades. The only being that could have possibly strike him down was the Nephalem, and only after they claimed a part of the soul power Malthael used to bind the forces of Death. After consuming the demonic essence within the Black Soulstone, Malthael was able to channel the Great Evils' energies against his foe(s)."}

Some &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Shrines and a certain Spring&lt;/a&gt; may refill the Mana pool as well.\nThe Mana cost of a spell may (but is not guaranteed to) change with the spell level. Generally, it can drop up to 50% of its base value (with some exceptions).\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", mana slowly regenerates by itself. Maximum mana and its regeneration rate can be affected by certain item attributes, &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Warmth\"&gt;Warmth&lt;/a&gt;, for example), and certain .\nSome &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s' attacks, like &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s abilities or the &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Mage\"&gt;Finger Mage&lt;/a&gt;s' strikes, for example, may &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;drain mana&lt;/a&gt; from the character(s), leaving them completely drained in battle.\nWith enough points, some skills' mana cost may be reduced to zero, making a skill completely free to use. Most spells and skills, however, consume more Mana as they grow more powerful.\nMana Generating Item Modifiers.\nThe following modifiers can be found on items, most often on in the form of es and es. &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; do not have a mana pool, however, and thus, will not grant the player nor themselves any bonus to &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Regeneration\"&gt;Mana Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; from these either.\nDiablo Immortal.\nMana was initially present in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", though it was later removed and replaced with a cooldown system instead.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", only &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s have Mana due to balancing reasons. In exchange, the classes have alternative resources that have different ways of regenerating (for example, the &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, which generates points for every Primary attack that he/she lands).\nA Witch Doctor's inborn connection to the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Unformed Land&lt;/a&gt; allows them to tap into a deep well of spiritual energy, called Mana. A Witch Doctor may have up to +450 Mana from items (+600 with ), and +42 Mana Regeneration (+7 more from &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Spiritual%20Attunement\"&gt;Spiritual Attunement&lt;/a&gt; grants 10% maximum Mana, and 1% Mana regenerated per second, while other active and passive skills may recover Mana on kill (or from &lt;a href=\"health%20globe\"&gt;health globe&lt;/a&gt;s), change Mana costs (from -10% to +30%), recover it when activated, refund Mana when cast, or even increase effective Mana regeneration (up to 30%). makes &lt;a href=\"Firebomb\"&gt;Firebomb&lt;/a&gt; generate an additional 100-125 Mana when cast. &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; levels may grant +200 more Mana. &lt;a href=\"Rush%20of%20Essence\"&gt;Rush of Essence&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that it causes each Spirit spell cast to restore a fixed amount of Mana, regardless of its cost, effectively making these spells free to cast as a result.\nSince the Mana recovery rate is low in relation to other resources, Witch Doctors may easily run out of it in battle. However, they may choose to discharge all of their most powerful spells at once, and pray that it would be enough. The alternate way is to rely on &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt;, which do not have a Mana cost.\nDiablo IV.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", Mana is the class resource of the , used to fuel her .\nMost spells either have a moderate (10-40) Mana cost, or a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, but rarely both. is unique in that it does not have a Mana cost per se, and instead passively triggers every time enough Mana is spent on any other spells.\nMana is replenished over time, and not generated by &lt;a href=\"Skill_Trees%23Diablo_IV\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Arc%20Lash\"&gt;Arc Lash&lt;/a&gt; is an exception.\nSome focus on restoring Mana (&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Resonance\"&gt;Burning Resonance&lt;/a&gt;), or reducing the Mana costs (&lt;a href=\"Align%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Align the Elements&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Sorceress can also replenish her Mana by collecting Crackling Energy that is created by certain &lt;a href=\"Ball%20Lightning\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;."}

Usually, it is less expensive to recharge a staff than to buy the same number of mana potions.\nMana is cast when the spell is triggered, but only grants the Mana filling effect if the casting animation is completed. &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and other slow casting characters might find this one impossible to use when in melee combat, since the monsters will keep hitting them and interrupting their casting animation."}

She is a Blood Knight and acting chaptermaster of the chapter &lt;a href=\"Thys\"&gt;Thys&lt;/a&gt;, \"having walked the dunes over a lifetime\". As a novice, she has dispatched the fallen. As a chaptermaster, she has presided over nearly a hundred rituals of induction, of which she has also stated, \"the failures outnumber the successes\".\nIn Bellon's memory, she has single-handedly resurrected and inducted him into her order. It is noted she has implied that she has gone through the same fate as his, when he stated to her, upon resurrection, she was basically conscripting him when he is serving another. After fighting the thralls in the location of his bounty, Bellon requested to see his wife, Cathrien. She allowed him but ordered him to do so quickly. When the two arrived at his home, she stayed outside while he entered, but after he accidentally killed Cathrien while confronting Edelard on his fraudulent sigils and plans to sabotage due to overhearing him, she rushed inside and attempted mitigation. However, he blamed Cathrien's horror and the whole ordeal on her and succumbed to his curse. She sentenced him in response. \nAt some point, she has brought and kept his keepsake in her chapterhouse.\nOver a century later, Mariki appears in a camp Bellon has brainwashed in Shassar Sea, and dispatches his remaining thralls which the has not. She reveals the abomination, summoned by the camp earlier, to be Bellon, and recruits them in destroying him via his keepsake, giving information about Blood Knights in the process. Inviting them into her chapterhouse, she strikes his keepsake but to no avail and thus proposes two cenotaphs that are capable. Just then, Bellon breaks in, so she instructs the hero(es) to take the keepsake further inside for destruction, while she stays behind and fights him. When the hero(es) comes back, having relieved his memory instead, she has trapped him in a dome, as the two realize he is clinging to the curse. Bellon overpowers the dome, leading to a final fight, in which Bellon expresses desire for vengeance while she apologizes for mistaking him. After thralls invade the chapterhouse and are slain by the hero(es). she transforms into an abomination, overpowers and binds him. Under her guidance, the main character destroys Bellon's keepsake. As Bellon dies, she vanishes along with him, but her keepsake is left behind.\nThe main character opts to place her artifact on the table where she has attempted to destroy Bellon's.\nCharacter.\nClad in Blood Knight armor, Mariki has medium long white hair and pale skin, red irises amongst black sclera with veins spread out from her eyes, as typical of the knights. She speaks with a notable accent.\nShe often uses red magic out of her hand for psychokinetic and defensive purposes, to close and seal doors without touching them, trap a being into a dome, or restrain one with magical binds. She has also used it to form a portal. Possessing considerable strength, she can overpower multiple thralls at once, although unable to successfully defeat Bellon on her own.\nHer keepsake is bright and appears violet, mixed with other light colors.\npersonality.\nFor all classes of shard-seekers, she is helpful and informative while behaving closer with Blood Knights. Besides addressing Blood Knights as a cousin, she is more open with her comments toward the pledge and the Annulet's wish toward Thys. In alignment to her role as an acting chaptermaster, she is not only knowledgeable but also assertive and leading. In the present, she gives out orders and delegates tasks while focusing on Bellon herself. In the past, she was forceful on measures to take with Bellon's condition post-induction, with a disregard for his wellbeing. For her status, Thys' knights show deference to her.\nAs the quest progresses, she becomes desperate and despaired. After realizing Bellon clings to his curse, she is truly apologetic over inducting him and views his induction as a mistake. For various reasons, whether it be guilt, devastation, a greater interest in upholding the order or vanquishing Bellon, she transforms into an abomination and allows the destruction of his keepsake to swallow them both. The act is self-sacrificial in nature, as it fulfills his vengeful motive which has become known to Mariki while condemning her to fall. As Blood Knights do not tolerate the fallen and Mariki has declared herself one, she subjects herself to the destruction, a sign of her loyalty to the order and the pledge."}

He fled, finding refuge in a small hostel along with other outcasts and fighting nightmares of the attack, doing his best to stay awake, smoking opium while he did so. But Diablo, in the guise of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, stopped at the same hostel, and the place was quickly destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s that his presence called up. Being the only survivor, Marius was compelled to follow the Wanderer.\nThe pair traveled east, over the &lt;a href=\"Tamoe%20Highlands\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and into the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. As they walked, the Wanderer spoke of his past, how he had once been a great &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, how a dark and secret burden now weighed heavily upon them. It was a long and arduous journey, but finally, they came within sight of their destination\u2014&lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. Making camp, Marius found himself able to sleep again, for the first time in weeks. Yet he dreamed. Dreamed of memories that were not his own.

Finding it, and against his better judgment, Marius entered the tomb with his companion. As they made their way through the gloom, he sensed the changes in the Wanderer as Diablo's spirit gained control. Reaching &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo rushed forward to release Baal but was intercepted by a newly arrived Tyrael. As the demon and &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; fought, Tal Rasha's crazed spirit pleaded with Marius to release him. Marius pulled Baal's &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; that contained the demon's essence from Tal Rasha's ribcage, releasing Baal from his prison. Before being overwhelmed by his foes, Tyrael charged Marius with going to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; and destroying Baal's soulstone at the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;; he ran out of the tomb as Baal joined the battle against Tyrael.\nPathway to Madness.\nFollowing Tyrael's instructions, Marius traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; and gained entry to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt; There, in its &lt;a href=\"Durance%20of%20Hate\"&gt;depths&lt;/a&gt;, he found the three Prime Evils gathered, summoning &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;the portal&lt;/a&gt; he had been instructed to go through. He watched as the Wanderer lost what was left of his humanity, completing his transformation into &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, who passed through the gate into Hell. Horrified by what he had seen, he could not bring himself to step through the gate.\nHaving failed to enter Hell, Marius fled to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. There, driven to the brink of madness, he was arrested and confined to a sanitarium. His mind shattered, he carved the accounts of his experience into the floor of his cell with his own fingernails. Baal's soulstone also ravaged his body, giving him an aged appearance. A small measure of comfort existed in that word reached his ears at some point of Diablo's defeat, and that his soulstone (along with &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s) were destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne day, Marius received a cloaked visitor\u2014Tyrael. Marius, consumed with guilt, related his account to the angel, from the moment he first encountered the Dark Wanderer to his current position. Tyrael assured him that all would be forgiven if he handed over the soulstone, an offer that Marius gladly accepted. What was less heartening was the revelation that his visitor in his cell was not Tyrael, but in actual fact, Baal. Marius broke into tears before Baal \"rewarded\" Marius for his service, killing him and setting the sanitarium ablaze.\nLegacy.\nMarius's failure to ensure the destruction of Baal's soulstone would have dire ramifications for Sanctuary. Ultimately, Baal was defeated, but not before the corruption and subsequent destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; visited the burnt out sanitarium where he had been killed, and was able to read the story Marius had inscribed on the walls of his cell, despite the damage that Baal's fire had inflicted. Marius's charred corpse still remained in the cell.\nTwenty years after his death, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt; came to a head, with a revived Diablo invading the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. A vision of Marius was used by the Prime Evil to demoralize Tyrael. However, when the angel refused to kneel, the vision was replaced by one of Baal's lieutenants, whom Tyrael and his allies summarily defeated.\nGame Effect.\nDiablo II.\nMarius makes no appearance in the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" game engine, but does serve as the game's narrator.\nDiablo Immortal.\nMarius is referenced in the flavor text of the &lt;a href=\"Wicked%20Wanderer\"&gt;Wicked Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cosmetic%20set\"&gt;cosmetic set&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo III.\nA vision of Marius appears in &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of Diablo's attempt to demoralize Tyrael. When Tyrael successfully fights back the guilt, the vision is replaced by one of Baal's lieutenants, who attempts to stop Tyrael and the nephalem using more conventional means.\nQuotes.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Marius/Dialogue\"&gt;Marius/Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;\"\nPersonality and Traits.\nMarius was heavily scarred by his ordeal from surviving the attack of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s hellspawn at Rogue Monastery, constantly plagued by nightmares and visions that forced him to stay awake. Marius was easily manipulated by both Diablo and Baal on separate occasions.\nReferences.\n "}

Martial Arts skills come in two forms, &lt;a href=\"Charge-up%20Skill\"&gt;Charge-up Skill&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Finishing%20Moves\"&gt;Finishing Moves&lt;/a&gt;. A Charge-up Skill is an attack that adds a \"charge\" for each successive hit within a short time frame. While each Charge-up attack deals normal damage, the charges continue to accumulate until triggered or until the time limit runs out. To trigger the accumulated charges, strike a monster with either a normal attack or one of the Finishing Moves. A Finishing Move doesn't just trigger the release of the accumulated charges-it also adds a powerful effect of its own. Furthermore, by building up a succession of different Charge-up Skills, Assassins can generate a potent combination of effects. Assassins are specially trained in the use of exotic Claw-class weaponry, and some of their skills can be used only when armed with these weapons. \nUsage Notes.\nYou can use any one or two-handed weapon with &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Strike\"&gt;Tiger Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cobra%20Strike\"&gt;Cobra Strike&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Strike\"&gt;Phoenix Strike&lt;/a&gt; which means you can combine those skills with a Shield and a good one-handed weapon if you choose.

The resulting minion (type still determined by the corpse's origin) deals more damage than multiple Revived would, but will not be as good in blocking enemy pathing. However, the Necromancer can still raise multiple such minions: up to 10, each composed of up to 10 corpses. This item will prefer the strongest monster to become the mega-revive when selecting a group of different creature corpses.\nSimple math suggests that, at perfect roll and 10 corpses, this affix boosts the damage of Revive by 60%. Raising a minion from a single corpse will still yield a boost, as the damage increase is calculated as 100% + ([125% to 150%] x number of corpses). Multiple casts will still raise a single minion each.\nAt absolute perfect scenario (&lt;a href=\"Bones%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Bones of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, perfect roll, 100 corpses raised as 10 x 10 minions), it will make a total of 10 x 2.5 x 10 = 2500 times the effect of a single Revived monster, permanently.\nWhen paired with the Purgatory rune, the mega-revived monster will drop the same number of corpses that were used to create it on death."}

Like Fire Wall, it leaves a trail of fire hazardous to foes; however, it is considerably weaker than Fire Wall. Although it is useful in the early stages of the game, this skill becomes less effective and a little more dangerous to use as enemies become tougher to kill and deal more damage.\nOnce cast, Blaze creates a wall of fire behind the Sorceress for every step she takes. Most effective in small rooms where enemies will be forced to follow you, as well as situations where a Sorceress needs to escape from pursuing enemies, Blaze is not a very direct offensive move. Specializing in Blaze is a dubious choice given its low damage and cumbersome use, but it is not necessarily useless if unlocked early: for example, &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; can be kited and taken down with this skill due to the former's negative Fire Resistance, their lethal close combat attacks and the layout of their chambers (although doing so may take quite some time due to mediocre damage of the skill).\nWhile Blaze is active while moving, it cannot be cast on the move, making the Sorceress stop briefly to cast it. Once cast, though, it does not require any actions or Mana expense until it wears off.\nBesides damaging enemies, Blaze increases &lt;a href=\"Movement%20Speed\"&gt;Movement Speed&lt;/a&gt;, making it an alternative to a .\nOther.\n&lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; displays this spell in the final cinematic of Diablo II.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Walkers\"&gt;Fire Walkers&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" are the closest equivalent to this spell available to players.\n&lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;Elite Monsters&lt;/a&gt; in Diablo III can have a &lt;a href=\"Molten\"&gt;Molten&lt;/a&gt; modifier with functionality very similar to this spell."}

Generally, its damage type is &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt;. Bleed is based on the &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt; effect from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo III.\nA chance to cause bleeding can roll as a Primary affix on a &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"quiver\"&gt;quiver&lt;/a&gt;. It is an 'on hit' effect, subject to &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;Proc Coefficient&lt;/a&gt;, that can trigger on any damaging attack.\nBleed usually inflicts a percentage of weapon damage, mostly anywhere from 300%-400%, over 5 seconds. It cannot &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;critically hit&lt;/a&gt;, but increases damage proportionally to the Critical Hit Chance / Damage ratio. It also fully benefits from Physical damage increasing traits. Legacy items could sometimes roll a fixed amount of damage over time, but as of Patch 2.0, most Bleed effects depend on weapon &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike other 'on hit' effects, Bleed has a very high chance to occur, up to 39% at level 70, and may considerably increase total damage. The tradeoff is that a chance to Bleed is a Primary affix, while other chance on hit affixes (which tend to trigger &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; effects) are Secondary.\nSome skills, like &lt;a href=\"Rend\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Palm\"&gt;Exploding Palm&lt;/a&gt;, are treated as Bleed effects, even if they deal damage of any type other than Physical.\nNote that generally the same Bleed effects (same rune and same character) on the same target do not stack, so applying the already active Bleed effect to that the same target will only renew its duration.\nThe only case in game where Bleed classification is relevant is the &lt;a href=\"Pain%20Enhancer\"&gt;Pain Enhancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20gem\"&gt;Legendary gem&lt;/a&gt;, which (at rank 25+) grants increased &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt; for every bleeding enemy in close proximity. This \"does\" include enemies suffering from conventional Bleed on weapons and quivers, Exploding Palm, and Rend, in addition to the gem's own Bleed effect.\nDiablo IV.\nBleed returns as a mechanic of the class. Most Warlord skills apply it upon dealing damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Gushing%20Wounds\"&gt;Gushing Wounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cut%20to%20the%20Bone\"&gt;Cut to the Bone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Thirst\"&gt;Blood Thirst&lt;/a&gt; talents are specifically designed to enhance Bleed effects. Ironically, despite most Bleeding skills being of Warlord tree, all three of these talents are located in the Berserker tree instead."}

Legions of the undead had laid siege to a small convent of nuns who were the keepers of a sacred relic, the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Ghrab%20Thaar\"&gt;Hammer of Ghrab Thaar&lt;/a&gt;. Suspended over a fiery chasm within the convent, the sisters knew the Hammer to be a powerful vessel of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and vowed never to allow it to fall into the hands of evil. With no weapons of their own, and no one to defend them, the nuns sacrificed themselves to destroy the hammer. Rather than let the undead despoil the church and the relic, they took the hammer and plunged themselves into the fiery chasm. At that moment, a powerful force of Light washed over the undead legion, striking them down where they stood. Since that time a well-trained Paladin is able to tap the remnants of this released energy, whirling a magical hammer to strike down his adversaries, especially the forces of the walking dead. \"\nGeneral Information.\nThis skill sends out a &lt;a href=\"piercing\"&gt;piercing&lt;/a&gt; glowing Hammer that spirals outwards from the front of the caster upon activation. The Hammer spins clockwise around the place it was cast, making a wider and wider arc until disappearing when it reaches its maximum range. Blessed Hammer has the ability to damage multiple enemies if it hits them. The Paladin may summon as many Hammers at a time as he can with &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cast%20Rate\"&gt;Cast Rate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis spell is the signature move of the infamous &lt;a href=\"Hammerdin\"&gt;Hammerdin&lt;/a&gt; build. Synergies increase its damage potential, reaching well above the 10,000 damage range. Added to the fact that not many monsters are immune to Magic, it was easy to spam the skill repeatedly and fill an entire room with Hammers in seconds, dealing tons of damage to anything inside. The build's high damage output and powerful Area of Effect ability causes Hammerdins to be feared in PvP servers.\nThe skill gives the +50% damage bonus not only vs undead (as stated explicitly in skill description in both D2LoD and D2R), but also vs Demons. This can be verified in Missiles.txt file; the dParam2 value is 50, and it's described as \"bonus dmg% demon\". The value can be easily tested as actually working by bumping the value noticeably and 1-shotting any act boss.\nDevelopment.\nSince patch 1.13, it no longer ignores Demon and Undead immunities.\nSkill Progression.\nBonus skill damage to undead and demons: +50%"}

Disorient)\u00a0is a type of &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; effect in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;. Monsters very rarely use it (probably the only known example is &lt;a href=\"Lysa\"&gt;Lysa&lt;/a&gt;), but player skills often have it as a side-effect, and some items give a chance on hit to Blind target.\nDiablo II.\nIn Diablo II, Blind merely reduces accuracy of the enemy attacks, bringing their chance to hit to 5%. Other abilities, however, are unaffected.\u00a0\n&lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dim%20Vision\"&gt;Dim Vision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raven\"&gt;Raven&lt;/a&gt;s apply an effect that reduces the victim's vision radius and prevents them from using ranged attacks and most spells (but does not impair their melee combat capabilities).\nDiablo Immortal.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", Blind can be caused by obscuring the enemy's vision of with a flash of light or a field of darkness.\nSandstorm, a variant of the 's skill blinds enemies caught within its range by obscuring their vision. Monsters affected by this effect have the icon of an eye above their heads. Melee fighters continue to attack the same position if they were attacking when afflicted, even if the player moves out of the location. If they were not attacking, they roam about aimlessly until they recover. Ranged fighters suffer a hit to their accuracy. \nWhen affecting the player, it reduces &lt;a href=\"accuracy\"&gt;accuracy&lt;/a&gt;\nOther effects like the 's , and the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kir%20Sling\"&gt;Kir Sling&lt;/a&gt; cause Blind through a flash of light. This causes enemies to wander about in a daze for some seconds. Players are only affected if they were facing the Blind effect.\nDiablo III.\nWhile a Blind effect lasts, affected targets cannot move (technically, they wander around aimlessly in a very short-ranged circle, but do not count as &lt;a href=\"Immobilize\"&gt;Immobilize&lt;/a&gt;d), are unable to attack and use active abilities, but the ongoing effects are not dispersed, and passive abilities are not suppressed. Channeled attacks of the monsters are also interrupted, so Blinding a monster while they prepare any charged-up attack will nullify that.\nBlind is fully effective against all enemies, even against &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt;. It is potent enough to interrupt the bosses' attacks, up to an including the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Lightning%20Hose\"&gt;Red Lightning Hose&lt;/a&gt;. However, some Boss special attacks cannot be interrupted (like &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;'s Meteor Strike in Phase 3, &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s Soul Sweep or &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;'s Blood Rain).\u00a0While these bosses, technically, are not immune to Blind, some of their special attacks are scripted events rather than actual abilities, and therefore do not depend on player's actions.\nCrowd Control resistance reduces the duration of subsequent Blind effects."}

With the invocation of this spell, entire hordes of enemies are left chilled or dead, drowned in a hail of ice. Wretched survivors of this wintry storm can do little but crawl and lament their fallen kin before they, too, succumb to the cold. \"\nGeneral Information.\nBy far the most offensively powerful Cold Spell, Blizzard deals large amounts of damage over a rather large area of effect, and is therefore chosen as the staple skill for builds such as the &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Sorceress\"&gt;Blizzard Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;. Enemies reached may be &lt;a href=\"chilled\"&gt;chilled&lt;/a&gt; in addition to damage.\nEven though it is extremely powerful (especially with &lt;a href=\"synergies\"&gt;synergies&lt;/a&gt;), Blizzard does have some drawbacks. For one, although it can stack on top of itself to deal major damage, it has a considerable &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; that stops it from being cast in quick succession; it is therefore important to have proper aim with Blizzard, which sometimes may be difficult as the shards of ice are sometimes difficult to gauge in position.\nAlso, Blizzard deals its damage over a period of 4 seconds. Some enemies, if they're quick enough, can dodge Blizzard altogether, although they will most likely suffer at least one hit. Moreover, the damage of Blizzard does not start immediately, but with a brief delay.\nBoth Blizzard and &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Orb\"&gt;Frozen Orb&lt;/a&gt; are effective crowd control spells. It is simply their methods of effect that differ, Blizzard being a traditional AoE spell, Frozen Orb a projectile.\nBlizzard may not be able to hit targets that are standing close to walls/pillars/etc."}

Since its release of \"Warcraft\" in 1994, it has been one of the most successful game development studios in the world. Its headquarters are based in Irvine, California. The company has a history of largely overshooting release dates; however, many Blizzard fans see this as somewhat of a blessing in disguise, as Blizzard has a reputation for producing classic games that are played for years to come. Blizzard also has a reputation for taking fierce legal action against anyone who reverse engineers their software, copies their game concepts, or publishes third-party server software that is compatible with all of their games.\nOverview.\nBlizzard Entertainment was founded in February, 1991 as \"Silicon &amp; Synapse\" by Mike Morhaime, Allen Adham and Frank Pearce. The company developed games like \"Rock &amp; Roll Racing\" and \"The Lost Vikings\" (published by Interplay Productions). In 1994, the company briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios, before finally settling on Blizzard Entertainment after it was discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed. That same year, they were acquired by distributor Davidson &amp; Associates for under USD$10 million. Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped their breakthrough hit \"Warcraft\".\nBlizzard has changed hands several times since then; Davidson was acquired by a timeshare company called CUC International in 1996; CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called HFS Corporation to form Cendant Software, in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger; Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, including Blizzard, to French publisher Havas in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by Vivendi. Blizzard is now part of the VU Games group of Vivendi Universal.\nIn 1996, Blizzard acquired Condor Games, which had been working on the game \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" for Blizzard at the time. Condor was renamed &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt;, and has since developed hit games \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", and its expansion pack \"\". Blizzard North was located in San Mateo, California.\nBlizzard launched their online gaming service \"&lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;\" in December 1996 with the release of their action-RPG \"Diablo\".\nOn November 23, 2004, Blizzard released World of Warcraft, which has grown to become one of the most popular MMORPGs in history.\nOn May 16, 2005, Blizzard announced the acquisition of Swingin' Ape, a console game maker, which is now \"Blizzard Console\", currently working on \"Starcraft: Ghost\", but in March 2006 (last mentioned on the website on March 30, 2006) they announced that \"Starcraft: Ghost\" was on indefinite hold.\nOn August 1, 2005, Blizzard announced the consolidation of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt; into the headquarters in Irvine, California.\nA few months after the closure of Blizzard North, Bill Roper, Erich Schaefer and his brother Max Schaefer co-founded which developed ' (on July 19, 2008 it was announced that due to continuing financial hardships at Flagship Studios, Mythos would be going on hiatus) and ' released in the fall of 2007.\nBlizzard is currently a division of Activision Blizzard, Inc. as a result of a merger that was announced on December 7, 2007. The merger was completed on July 9, 2008. For much of the decade that followed, Activision and Blizzard effectively remained separate entities. However, in the years leading up to 2018, Activision has reportedly begun to exert more influence over Blizzard, including the sale of Activision games in the Blizzard store. (Former) staff members expressed concerns over the level of Activision's influence and cultural shifts within the company. The cancellation of \"https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Project_Titan Titan]\" was the catalyst for Activision exerting more control over Blizzard, pushing cost-cutting and faster release dates.\nIn February 2019, Blizzard underwent a round of layoffs, though announced that it would be expanding its development staff. Teams for some of its IPs, including \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", were expanded. From the late 2010s to 2022, Blizzard experienced a round of departures, with many employees going on to form their own development studios.\nBlizzard was purchased by Microsoft in October, 2023. In early 2024, it laid off 1900 employees.\nOrganization.\nAfter the release of \"World of Warcraft\", Blizzard split its development staff into numerically designated teams (e.g. the development team for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" is &lt;a href=\"Team%203\"&gt;Team 3&lt;/a&gt;. \"Strike teams\" also exist\u2014not attached to any particular project, but exist to give feedback to the game-specific teams. A \"design council\" also exists, a gathering of all of the game directors and lead designers throughout the company. The existence of strike teams dates back to the development of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". As of August 2017, most of Blizzard's development is focused on supporting its existing IPs, but has a \"pipleline\" of new IPs. As of November 2018, Blizzard's current model is to continue providing support for existing IPs, but spin-off new teams from existing ones once they reach a certain size to work on new projects.\nIn August 2024, it was reported that Blizzard formed a new team to focus on AA games based on its IPs.\nPersonnel.\nNotable Blizzard personnel include:"}
{"id": "9699", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9699", "title": "Blizzard North", "text": "Blizzard North, formerly known as Condor, was the Bay Area division of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, known for the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" series. The studio was originally based in Redwood City, California, and then moved a short distance away to San Mateo, California, with Blizzard proper being based in Irvine (in southern California).\nHistory.\nCondor.\nCondor was founded in 1993 &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Max%20Schaefer\"&gt;Max Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;. The name \"Condor\" came from Project Condor, a game developed in secret by employees of a digital clip art company that went under. They each had a different name for the company, but Condor was the most common second choice, hence why they settled on it.\nWhile the idea for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" existed early on, publishers refused Condor's pitches, as the game would be PC exclusive, and the genre was seen as being too niche. In its early years, Condor worked as a work-for-hire studio, and struggled to stay afloat. Their long-term goal was to be able to develop PC games.\nIn order to stay afloat, the company developed a number of sports games and the Sega Genesis version of \"\". Sunsoft offered them work on an Aerosmith game, but Brevik chose to work on \"Justice League\". While showing off the Genesis version, they came into contact with Silicon &amp; Synapse, who had developed the Super Nintendo version (the game's publisher had not informed Condor of the separate publishing scheme). Silicon &amp; Synapse would later be named Blizzard Entertainment, and after the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", which Condor offered beta services for, came back into contact with Condor to hear their pitch for Diablo. Blizzard liked the pitch, and offered to publish the game. The game received a $300,000 budget. To bolster its finances, Condor worked on sports games on the side.\nBlizzard North.\nCondor was purchased by Blizzard about six months before the release of Diablo in 1996. The announcement came in December, 1995, that Blizzard was interested in acquiring Condor. They decided to join Blizzard proper as they had been impressed with the release of \"Warcraft II\", and given its widespread release, were impressed with Blizzard's distribution of its game. The deal was finalized in February, 1996. Condor was renamed \"Blizzard North,\" but was allowed to keep its autonomy. The renaming of the studio as \"Blizzard North\" was for name recognition\u2014Blizzard South wanted its subsiduary to have its name, and North wanted the Blizzard name as it wanted to be associated with Blizzard proper in light of the successful releases of the first two \"Warcraft\" games. The renaming raised some eyebrows in Condor, as some saw the renaming as a sign of a loss of independence. People within Blizzard North began to refer to Blizzard Irvine as \"Blizzard South,\" though in reality, \"Blizzard South\" was just Blizzard proper. Ultimately, Blizzard North answered to Irvine.\nDuring the development period, Condor had been on the brink of insolvency several times, but the game's success guaranteed their stability. 3D0 made a counter-bid that would have offered more, but Condor chose Blizzard as the company cultures were more similar.\nStructurally, Blizzard North was considered an independent studio from Blizzard South, but also reported to them. There was never a real structure on how Blizzard North had to operate in regards to its parent company. The relationship between the two studios was often contentious, but more often than not, at least up to the release of \"Diablo II\", Blizzard North was usually able to have its way. While Blizzard South was known for its \"StarCraft\" and \"Warcraft\" series, Blizzard North developers believed that \"Diablo\" was just as responsible for the company's success, yet resented being treated as subordinate.\nWhen interviewed, &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Householder\"&gt;Matt Householder&lt;/a&gt; stated that by the late 90s/early 2000s, he felt that Blizzard North and South had developed an \"insurmountable philosophical chasm.\" In his view, North was more freeform and exploratory, while South was more linear, less welcoming of random chance. Bug fixing was a point of contention between the two companies, as South believed that games should be near-perfect on release (i.e. most bug fixing done prior to launch) while North was more willing to fix bugs post-release. &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; proposed several times that Brevik and the Schaefers join him in Irvine so they could work together, but they refused. \n\"Diablo\" proved to be incredibly successful, and their 2000 sequel, \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" was even more so. An followed the year after.\nDisbandment.\nAfter the release of \"Diablo II\", Blizzard North split into two groups. The first worked on \"Lord of Destruction\", the second to work on ideas that never materialized such as \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Junior\"&gt;Diablo Junior&lt;/a&gt;\". By this point, Blizzard North had grown to a company of 60 employees, but was still using a \"flat\" corporate structure. Tensions were developing within Blizzard North, not only between its founders, but also its staff, with some employees refusing to work with one another. After the release of \"Lord of Destruction\", the two group split again applied\u2014one group would work on \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%202.5\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", the other on &lt;a href=\"Starblo\"&gt;Project X&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 2003, Blizzard North was in crisis. Two years had passed since the company had released a game. The staff were fractured, its offices were in chaos, the development of both \"Diablo III\" and Project X (now \"Starblo\") was stalled, and it could be years until either were released. By this year, rumors were floating that Vivendi (which owned Blizzard) was looking to sell its videogame division. Another rumor stated that Microsoft was looking to buy said studios. The leaders of Blizzard North was miffed that they'd only learnt of this at the same time as the public, and when asked what was going on, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Roper\"&gt;Bill Roper&lt;/a&gt; (who was a liaison between South and North) didn't have an answer. In June 2003, the four Blizzard North executives, frustrated with the rumors, wrote a stern email to Vivendi asking for financial protections, better communication, and inclusion in the sale process. If the corporation wouldn\u2019t acquiesce to their demands, they wrote, the four executives would resign. The email hadn't been sent as a bluff, but as a means of showing Vivendi how serious they were. However, Vivendi accepted their resignations. \n&lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; stepped in after the departures of Brevik and the Schaefer brothers. He told North that there would be staff layoffs, that \"Starblo\" would be cancelled, and North's attention would shift to \"Diablo III\". North's staff had to interview for their own jobs, and executives from Irvine probed each Blizzard North employee about the studio\u2019s problems, potential solutions, and what they wanted to see the company do next. By the end of the process, Blizzard North had lost a third of its staff. \n&lt;a href=\"Rick%20Seis\"&gt;Rick Seis&lt;/a&gt; took Brevik's spot, but it was clear he didn't have the same clout Brevik had. By this point, South had become frustrated with North's laid-back ethos in regards to bug fixing. During the week, Morhaime and Allen Adham asked Brevik if he would stay on, but he refused. The parting of ways for Blizzard North staff was a mixed blessing\u2014some employees liked others more than others, and a number of employees followed Brevik and the Schaefer brothers to Flagship Studios. For those left behind, they felt they had a clean slate after the chaos of the last two years. On Morhaime's part, while he had never intended to send Blizzard North's founders packing, he'd still accepted their resignations without pushback. It had become clear to Blizzard South that North had become too toxic and unproductive to remain intact, hence the restructuring.\nBlizzard North continued working on \"Diablo III\", albeit under close supervision from Blizzard South. Those who survived the culling were left with the impression that this was their last chance to prove that the project was still viable. However, in the summer of 2005, Blizzard South decided to close Blizzard North. At Irvine, Blizzard's executives had evaluated \"Diablo III\" and decided that the company's creative leaders had to supervise more closely. By this point however, \"World of Warcraft\" had most of Blizzard's attention, and nobody at Blizzard had the desire or time to move to San Francisco to oversee the game's development. Morhaime told the staff that the development of the game would be moved in-house to Irvine, and that most of the team would be able to re-apply for their jobs, but would have to move to southern California to keep working at Blizzard. Only a few joined &lt;a href=\"Team%203\"&gt;Team 3&lt;/a&gt; in development of Blizzard South's &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; of \"Diablo III\". \nAftermath.\nA few employees Blizzard North members including &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Sexton\"&gt;Eric Sexton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michio%20Okamura\"&gt;Michio Okamura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Woo\"&gt;Steven Woo&lt;/a&gt;, organized to launch a new company, Hyboreal Games. In 2018, many Blizzard North staff were working at Echtra Games.\nNotable Members.\nThroughout its history, Blizzard North was predominantly male in terms of staff composition. It had 12 members by the time it began work on Diablo I. This had reached 14/15 by the time of the game's release. This increased to 24 at the start of development of Diablo II, and had grown to 40 by 2000. Notable members included:"}

Blizzard is the most damaging of all &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Spells\"&gt;Cold Spells&lt;/a&gt;, with a large area of effect. Since it deals damage over time that is longer than its &lt;a href=\"Casting%20Delay\"&gt;Casting Delay&lt;/a&gt;, it can be stacked on itself: however, Blizzard does not deal all its damage immediately, and therefore is an inferior \"panic button\" compared to spells such as or Glacial Spike. Although it can certainly handle crowds, it takes practice to aim properly, and when completely surrounded a Blizzard Sorceress may find it easier to use Glacial Spike to escape.\nBlizzard Sorceresses deal hell-viable cold damage, and is one of the highest cold-damage builds in the game. However, she is quite frail, relying on careful positioning or teammates to stay alive. In hell difficulty, cold immunes are nearly invulnerable to her: due to the large amounts of synergies blizzard has, this build cannot diversify her damage without losing a significant amount of potential cold damage. She works best with a diverse party, or when twinked with a &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Rupture\"&gt;Cold Rupture&lt;/a&gt; sundering charm in \".\"\nSkills.\nMain skills:\nSynergies and prerequisites:\nUtility skills:\nThe Blizzard Sorceress usually maxes out Blizzard. However, she also has three other synergies: Ice Bolt, Ice Blast, and Glacial Spike, all of which give a rather large +5% bonus to Blizzard. They also benefit each other with synergies, so maxing them out makes all of them effective in battle. Due to the casting delay of blizzard, the sorceress can \"weave\" casts of Glacial Spike or Ice Blast between casts of blizzard to maximize damage. Glacial Spike deals area-of-effect damage that guarantees freezing on non-immunes, while ice blast deals higher single target damage.\nA Blizzard Sorceress has several options:\nEither way, a Blizzard Sorceress will benefit from equipment that gives +Cold Skill damage like &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Fathom\"&gt;Death's Fathom&lt;/a&gt; or +Blizzard Skills like &lt;a href=\"Snowclash\"&gt;Snowclash&lt;/a&gt;, or reduces enemy &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Resist\"&gt;Cold Resist&lt;/a&gt;.\nGear.\nGear is listed from best to budget options.\nHelmet: \nWeapon:\nBody Armor:\nShield: \nWearing either the full or partial &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Wrappings\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Wrappings&lt;/a&gt; is also effective for this set, particularly for magic finding.\nParty Play.\nBlizzard Sorceresses benefit tremendously from &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s running &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; aura, such as &lt;a href=\"Avenger\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Fist%20of%20the%20Heavens%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fist of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, to maximize their cold damage and lessen their dependence on Cold Mastery. \nThe Blizzard Sorceress is often the bane of &lt;a href=\"Summonmancer\"&gt;Summonmancer&lt;/a&gt;s; it is generally not a good idea for them to be on the same team, since a Blizzard Sorceress will ultimately shatter a majority of her enemy's bodies, destroying them before a Summonmancer can revive or use &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt; on them."}

{"id": "24430", "revid": "154566", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=24430", "title": "Blizzball Sorceress", "text": "A &lt;a href=\"Blizzball%20Sorceress\"&gt;Blizzball Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; or Blizzballer is a &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; focused on &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Spells\"&gt;Fire Spells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Spells\"&gt;Cold Spells&lt;/a&gt;. It is an alternative to the more popular &lt;a href=\"Meteorb%20Sorceress\"&gt;Meteorb Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; build.\nAt a glance, here is the skill setup:\nStandard advice for stats: Strength and Dexterity at minimum for equipment, Energy a few points if absolutely necessary to get by in the early game, Vitality for the rest.\nArguments for this skill setup (particularly the controversially low mastery levels) are below, in the section &lt;a href=\"%23Analysis\"&gt;#Analysis&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nYou have two timered skills and two spammed skills. The combination of having two of each type allows you to maximize your damage regardless of typical monster immunities; the only problem you'll encounter is against Fire Immune Cold Immune monsters, which are all unique or super unique monsters (and are thus quite rare, occur only as individuals, and generally can be \"parked\" out of your way).\nAgainst monsters that are not Fire Immune or Cold Immune, first cast on approaching monsters, then spam &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ball\"&gt;Fire Ball&lt;/a&gt;. This is your main combination of spells. Blizzard stops opponents in their tracks and the Fire Ball deals significant damage in a small area.\nAgainst Fire Immune, use Blizzard and &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Spike\"&gt;Glacial Spike&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgainst Cold Immune, use and Fire Ball.\nWhen partied with a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; or another build that needs significant number of corpses (a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Find\"&gt;Magic Find&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Find%20Item\"&gt;Find Item&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps), you can use the Meteor-Fire Ball pair to leave corpses, and only use Glacial Spike in emergencies or against fire immunes.\nAnalysis.\nWhy the low &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Mastery\"&gt;Fire Mastery&lt;/a&gt;?\nAt its first level, Fire Mastery provides a healthy +30% bonus to all Fire spell damage. At subsequent levels, however, it only increases damage by +7%.\nGenerally, you will mainly use only Fire Ball among your fire skills. Each additional point in Meteor gives a +14% bonus in damage. Thus, for your main attack spell, adding points in Meteor benefits your damage more.\nYou will only use two fire spells, Fire Ball and Meteor itself. When you upgrade level 19 Meteor (average 899.5 damage, ignoring synergies) to level 20 Meteor (average 987 damage, ignoring synergies), you get a 9.7% increase in damage, again better than the 7% increase promised by Fire Mastery. The relative percentage increase is even better when upgrading a level 1 Meteor to level 2.\nFinally, +skills will increase the bonuses of Fire Mastery. However, +skills on Meteor will not increase the synergy on Fire Ball. It is thus more valuable to place points in Meteor, since low Fire Mastery bonus % damage can be fixed elsewhere.\nThus, for maximizing damage (and leaving further points for the cold spells), Fire Mastery should be kept at 1 point.\nWhy the low &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Mastery\"&gt;Cold Mastery&lt;/a&gt;?\nA similar argument to the above holds for Cold Mastery, but not as strictly.\nCold Mastery provides -20% resist for the first level, plus a subsequent -5% resist for each point.\nWhen monsters have 0% resistance to cold, then minus resistances is exactly equivalent to +% damage. Your main cold spell, Blizzard, gains +5% also from Glacial Spike, but again this bonus can be increased with +skills in Cold Mastery but not in Glacial Spike, making it more vital to put actual hard points into Glacial Spike.\nHowever, once monsters have non-zero resistance to cold, minus resistances is more powerful than +% damage. This tips the balance towards pumping Cold Mastery instead of Glacial Spike.\nGenerally, in the early game, monsters have 0 or even negative resistance to cold, so increasing Cold Mastery is not as vital. Later in the game, however, you should certainly consider increasing Cold Mastery instead of Glacial Spike."}

{"id": "8331", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8331", "title": "Block", "text": "Blocking determines your chance to defend against physical melee and ranged attacks delivering physical &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. Unless specifically stated otherwise, it requires a &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; of any type to be equipped in order to work, naturally.\nDue to the nature of this mechanic, heroes that are built to take the brunt of attacks, like &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Templar&lt;/a&gt;, are most likely to make extensive use of it. Other &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; may find themselves using shields more for the &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt;es offered rather than outright blocking attacks.\nDiablo I.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", the chance to block is based on the hero's &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and is not capped (so players can, in fact, get a 100% chance to block attacks).\n&lt;a href=\"Faster%20Block%20Rate\"&gt;Faster Block Rate&lt;/a&gt; is naturally given to &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Hellfire%29\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to quickly recover after a successful block. Other classes must obtain a shield with this affix (like ) if they wish to block effectively. Otherwise, they run the risk of leaving themselves vulnerable to harm while recovering.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", there is a 75% Cap on the % Chance to Block.\n75% Chance of Blocking will stop 75% of physical attacks from hitting but if a player is running, the Total Blocking percentage is reduced to 1/3rd of its original value, with a cap of 25%. If the roll of the dice denies a true block, or if the player can't block at all, then and only then, are &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;Skills&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Avoid\"&gt;Avoid&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Block\"&gt;Weapon Block&lt;/a&gt; checked for blocking.\nYou are always eligible for a block check unless you are already in the middle of blocking animation or in the middle of \"struck\" animation. All other animations, from regular attacks, to &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt;, to casting spells, will override the block animation. The blocking will still occur, but no block animation will be played and no block sound will be heard.\nProbability of blocking is calculated as follows:\nTotal Blocking = (Blocking * (&lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; - 15)) / (&lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; * 2)\nChanging the formula around, to calculate dexterity needed for 75% block at a specific character level:\nDexterity = ((150 * Character Level) / Displayed blocking on shield) + 15\nNote that displayed blocking will vary between different shields, &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt;, and is affected by the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shield\"&gt;Holy Shield&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nA character is prevented from doing anything else while blocking. The delay caused by blocking can be shortened with a &lt;a href=\"Faster%20Block%20Rate\"&gt;Faster Block Rate&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; cannot block, not even an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Iron Wolf&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", the system is simplified: it works against all types of &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt;. Much like it was in the original \"Diablo\", Chance to Block is not capped, although for anyone who is not a Crusader, their blocking chance with a shield may never legitimately exceed 85% (20% base chance, along with a +11% bonus chance from an affix, plus another 54% from &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; items). Another new mechanic to the blocking system is the shield's Block Amount, a value that is also static (though the amount blocked depends on that of the shield itself, with Legendary shields blocking more damage). Each blocked attack deducts a random number within the Block Amount's range from the unsaved damage taken. None of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem's&lt;/a&gt; core attributes have an effect on either blocking values. Some skills, however, may further modify either of these values, or grant a special effect that occurs when an attack is blocked (for instance, &lt;a href=\"Punish\"&gt;Punish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Your%20Ground\"&gt;Hold Your Ground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renewal\"&gt;Renewal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sword%20and%20Board\"&gt;Sword and Board&lt;/a&gt;). In the case of the Crusader's &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash\"&gt;Shield Bash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Shield\"&gt;Blessed Shield&lt;/a&gt; skills, a shield's Block chance also directly increases damage dealt.\nAny and all damage that comes from a &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Over%20Time\"&gt;Damage Over Time&lt;/a&gt; source cannot be blocked by shields, making it useful against Block-oriented monsters, such as &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Scavenger\"&gt;Primordial Scavenger&lt;/a&gt;s, but also making the player vulnerable to such damage even if they have a character who is dedicated to making the most out of maxed-out Block chances.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brother\"&gt;Blood Brother&lt;/a&gt; sword utilizes a block mechanic, even if no shield is taken, or, if coupled with a shield, boosts both its own and shield Blocks. It can add up to 20% additional Block chance to the normal cap, potentially bringing it up to 100%.\nSome items, like &lt;a href=\"Akarat%27s%20Awakening\"&gt;Akarat's Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Lantern\"&gt;Justice Lantern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Tower\"&gt;Ivory Tower&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Coven%27s%20Criterion\"&gt;Coven's Criterion&lt;/a&gt;, add special effects on a successful block, or improve functionality of blocks.\nDiablo Immortal.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", Block gives the player a chance to negate of damage received. The &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; stat, when sufficiently high, can increase the Blocked damage. The frequency at which Block occurs is determined by a new stat; Block Chance. &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be blocked."}

Use of &lt;a href=\"demonic%20magic\"&gt;demonic magic&lt;/a&gt; can taint the blood of humans casting it.\u00a0Attacks from some demons can also taint a human's bloodstream; as the corruption takes hold, the color of the blood will change. Fresh blood is a necessary component in demon summoning. Demon blood contains 'life essence' that allows perception of far distant events. Dry demon's blood left on armor can react adversely to water, causing the armor to be destroyed in a flash of green light, after generating sulphur/blood-scented smoke.\nAt least in the culture of &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, are seen as a sign of being cursed, if not proof of being a demon.\n&lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt; is carried in blood, and can be siphoned from it.\nThere is a saying in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; that \"blood calls to blood,\" referring to the bonds of kinship that exists between blood relatives. This bond exists even if their social one is severed or damaged.\nHuman blood is useful in demonic rituals. The blood of khazra is similar enough to that of humans (per their shared ancestry) that it can be used in these rituals to similar effect.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Spiritborn\"&gt;Spiritborn&lt;/a&gt; culture, it is believed that is through one's blood that the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; flows into being, that one's blood carries the voice of one's ancestors, along with their emotions.\nIn-game.\nFor most enemy types in all three games of &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;\"Diablo\" series&lt;/a&gt;, a pool of blood beneath a corpse is a clear indication of the creature being dead (nearly all death animations of monsters having blood involve bleeding).

Demons possess all colors of blood, including black, brown, green, blue, purple and even white. Some forms of &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; retain blood (it usually becomes darker or turns green), while others do not need it.

In addition, they can often be found sleeping inside Iron Maidens (possibly their incubation pods), but will quickly awake and attack when &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; is close enough.\n&lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Roach\"&gt;Tomb Roach&lt;/a&gt;es often accompany Disciples in battle.\nVidian himself summons several greatly empowered Disciples dubbed \"Favorites of Vidian\", who appear much larger than their brethren.\nHematic Apostle.\nSimilar to Disciples in their appearance, Apostles prefer to attack from distance. Armed with &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;, they, apparently, are capable of using &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn combat, Apostles will hurl fireballs at the enemy, hitting a small area for high &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage. The fireball does not fly in a straight line, and can go over other foes, obstacles and walls.\nVisually, their robes are of darker color, and their hands are more human-like, only the head and torso being distorted.\nHematic Zealot.\nZealots are among the most dangerous minions of Vidian. Appearing much like Disciples, they have bloated, brightly-glowing yellowish tumors on their head, which allows them to be easily distinguished.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Suicide%20Minion\"&gt;Suicide Minion&lt;/a&gt;s, they will not attack the Nephalem directly. Instead, upon approaching, they explode with deadly force in a small radius. Damage is high enough to kill an adequately-equipped foe in one blast.\nKilling them only awards &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and loot if they die from wounds before having a chance to explode.\nWretched Host.\nWretched Hosts are referred to by &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; as a late stage towards \"ascension\". They appear as broken, torn apart humans with rotten skin, tentacles holding them together and becoming their weapons.\nWhile in battle, Hosts are quite durable and can attack with their appendages in melee. Still, their real weapon is the charged-up attack that marks several spots on the ground with green glow. After a few seconds, a swarm of glowing &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Roach\"&gt;Tomb Roach&lt;/a&gt;es will erupt from the Host and explode at the marked areas, dealing heavy &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nTo compensate, Hosts move and attack very slowly, making it easy to outrun them and the impending Roach blasts.\nReborn.\nThe rarest and easily most deadly of Vidian's servants, Reborn are no longer humans on the outside, but rather look much like Vidian himself.\nThey gain the ability to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; at will and fire barrages of energy bolts, which are very hard to dodge."}

Like other Golems, it loyally attends its master, pursuing and attacking his enemies in close combat. The gruesome strikes from its skeletal limbs &lt;a href=\"Life%20Steal\"&gt;steal life&lt;/a&gt; from enemies, converting a portion of its dealt damage into a life bonus that heals both it and its master. Although its damage is relatively limited, especially at higher &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulties&lt;/a&gt;, its sizable life steal percentage affirms its role as a formidable healing unit.\nBlood Golems are useful for specialized Necromancers that fight on the front lines unescorted by a regular Skeleton force. Their ability to confer plentiful healing to negate their master's increased exposure to damage is very useful to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Dagger\"&gt;Poison Dagger&lt;/a&gt; Necromancers, whose low physical damage limits the viability of &lt;a href=\"Life%20Steal\"&gt;Life Steal&lt;/a&gt; items to sustain them on the battlefield. However, the availability of &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt; to offset this disadvantage, coupled with the otherwise limited utility of Blood Golems in large troops where their master is rarely in jeopardy, makes them less frequently employed than other Golems under the Necromancer's command.\nThe Blood Golem's life steal is completely based on its own damage, rather than the total amount of its target's hit points. Furthermore, only damage directly dealt by the Golem counts towards its life steal. For example, if it may take advantage of a damage return effect like &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;, any extra damage served by these effects does \"not\" grant any bonus life.\nThe Golem gains 70% of the life it steals while its master gains the remaining 30%. Any excess life that the Golem steals for itself but cannot use is instead passed on to the Necromancer. Similarly, surplus life stolen for the Necromancer that he cannot use overflows to the Golem. Any residual bonus life that neither party can use is wasted.\nThe Blood Golem can also be summoned with charges of &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon\"&gt;Bloodmoon&lt;/a&gt; (level 15) or &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Death Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; (level 22).\nSkill Progression.\nAttack Rating: 60\nDefense: 120\nKnown bugs.\nDue to an error in &lt;samp&gt;SkillDesc.txt&lt;/samp&gt;, which has existed since Diablo II and is still present in Diablo II: Resurrected, the value of Defense shown is based on the total Iron Golem skill level instead of the base Iron Golem skill level. However, the actual calculation uses only the base skill level, which means the actual value will be either equal to or lower than the one shown.

The &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; ignored the killings, even as fear mounted alongside the &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and townsfolk fought to end the corruption, but it was too late, and entire villages were killed or turned, along with the adventurers who had tried to aid them. Other citizens were kidnapped to be used in dark rituals. People were enslaved so that their blood may be harvested and/or be turned into new vampires.\nThe plague-like campaign reached epidemic proportions, and spread across the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Seekers\"&gt;Blood Seekers&lt;/a&gt; and their vampire forces were ordered to conquer &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Innocents were imprisoned, and pandemonium spread.\nWhile was able to slay a number of Zir's Blood Seekers, this apparently did nothing to stem the Harvest. Indeed, not long after their assassinations, the Blood Harvest surged in scale. &lt;a href=\"Erys\"&gt;Erys&lt;/a&gt;, a vampire hunter, commented that she'd never seen slaughter on such a scale, and theorized that Zir's army was making its \"big push.\" That it was gathering the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; required to ensure the vampire lord's ascension. The Cathedral of Light still refused to engage the vampires in the field, and their doors remained shut to the world. Erys ordered the Wanderer to seek out Zir's army and kill as many minions as they could. While she didn't trust the Wanderer, she reasoned that if Zir's army succeeded, they were all damned anyway.\nUltimately, the Wanderer succeeded in routing Zir's forces. Erys feared that Zir would rally his remaining legions to gather the blood he needed. The Wanderer killed Zir before this could happen. However, in light of Zir's death, &lt;a href=\"Erys\"&gt;Erys&lt;/a&gt; feared that his strongest &lt;a href=\"thrall\"&gt;thrall&lt;/a&gt;s would vie for his throne, and that the killing would continue. Ultimately, thanks to the efforts of numerous &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, the Blood Harvest was stopped. It was declared that those who gave their lives to stem the vampiric plague would never be forgotten.\nThe events of the Blood Harvest caught the attention of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell's&lt;/a&gt; legions, prompting them to regroup, prompting a display of force through a new &lt;a href=\"Helltide\"&gt;Helltide&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nBlood Harvest was a gameplay feature of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", as part of \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Season of Blood&lt;/a&gt;\".

Their preferred weapon is the polearm, which they use in tandem with their supernatural strength, speed, and vampiric powers. While no weapon is beneath a Blood Knight, it is said that only the polearm is truly their equal.\nBlood Knights prefer to operate in the shadows, given the widespread distrust of them due to their vampiric origins. They are ruled by &lt;a href=\"the%20Annulet\"&gt;a council&lt;/a&gt;, which maintain the lifeblood of their order and work tirelessly to stockpile magical artifacts.\nThe Blood Knights refuse to relegate Sanctuary to their own doomed fate\u2014it is their home too, and they will fight till the bitter end for it. They must.\nAbilities and Curse.\nBecoming a Blood Knight grants one increased strength, speed, night vision, and the ability to smell &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; from miles away. All new Blood Knights must acclimatize to their new abilities, as their hearts pump faster to accommodate, and pushing their limits might cause it to burst. Of note, Blood Knights are able to turn into &lt;a href=\"Abomination\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;s; monstrous forms that increase their speed and strength beyond even their natural form. They can shift in and out of their humanoid and Abomination form as circumstance allows. However, this can be done only for short periods at a time as they can get lost in the bloodlust of that form. Pain is a good means to center themselves.\nUnfortunately, choosing to become a Blood Knight is still delaying the inevitable. While their physical transformation into a thrall is halted, all Blood Knights constant mental battle with their curse to stay human. Once they lose touch with their humanity, they succumb to their vampirism, and turn into an unholy &lt;a href=\"Abomination\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;. This can be caused by great emotional distress or the apathy and depression developed over long period in service. Before that happens, Blood Knights strive to do enough good to attain for the evil they will commit once they succumb. \nThanks to the curse, Blood Knights are functionally immortal, even if thralldom awaits them. The lifespan of a Blood Knight varies wildly, and some have even lived for centuries. However, there is no way for a Blood Knight to know how long their lifespan will be; every day could be their last. \nIn a bid to preserve their humanity \u2014 and prolong the end of the curse, Blood Knights carry an object with sentimental value from their time as mortals. This keepsake is preserved in a &lt;a href=\"censer\"&gt;censer&lt;/a&gt;, which is attached to a chain wrapped around their arm. The keepsake is a memento of the last place where they were truly human. Every morning, noon, and night, a Blood Knight carries out an ablution with the keepsake, to hopefully keep the darkness inside them at bay. However, it has been indicated that this ritual is nothing but hearsay\u2014a tradition passed down by the Blood Knights over centuries that may not actually have an effect.Older blood knights are at high risk of losing themselves. Some try to mitigate this with obsessive focus on a ward they protect. But even then, the fate of thralldom still awaits them. Blood Knights have various enchanted equipment that can warn a Blood Knight once their curse's end draws near, or to constrain a feral Blood Knight. Blood Knights will hunt down their own if they succumb to the curse, or otherwise falter in their oath.\nBecause of their curse, Blood Knights hunger for &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. This hunger must be controlled as feeding on innocents feeds the curse, which feeds on the Blood Knight in turn. &lt;a href=\"Lizbeth%20Iparrine\"&gt;Lizbeth Iparrine&lt;/a&gt; recommended that Blood Knights drink the blood of their foes, effectively solving two problems at once. This also imparts a Blood Knight with part of the vampire's power.\nThere are other downsides to the thrall's curse however\u2014Blood Knights' eyes are blood-red, and veins pulse along their faces (as one would expect, this makes people uneasy around Blood Knights). However, some Blood Knights revel in this fear.\nEvery Blood Knight knows that their time in this world is limited, and will do all they can to aid the mortal realm in what time is allowed for them. For Blood Knights, this is a question of moral balance\u2014can they do enough good in the time they have to make up for the horrors they will inflict as a thrall? However, the Blood Knights are willing to carry out monstrous acts if it suits their purposes. To ensure the human and vampiric sides of their mind remain in harmony, many Blood Knights enter the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Plane\"&gt;Crimson Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation.\nBlood Knights operate from discreet &lt;a href=\"chapterhouse\"&gt;chapterhouse&lt;/a&gt;s, with their headquarters being the Gea Kul chapterhouse. Every Blood Knight is assigned to a chapterhouse, which can pertain to a chapter or settlement of the same name. Presumably, chapters' pledges are universal: searching out thralls and dealing with knights succumbed to their curse.\nWhenever a knight quarters in their chapterhouse, they are given equipment; &lt;a href=\"Made%20to%20Wander\"&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt;, said to be \"one of a kind\", \"graces\" its owner with the farthest roaming assignments.\nApparently, there is a warning of some sort for a knight heading to an area occupied by another from a different chapter, but this has fallen out of practice.\nInduction and Vows.\nBlood Knights use their powers to locate vampire bite victims and perform a ritual on them before they fully transform into a &lt;a href=\"thrall\"&gt;thrall&lt;/a&gt;, but the swiftness at which the curse takes hold often claims the life of the afflicted before the saving ritual can be performed. In keeping with sacred tradition, Blood Knights offer the afflicted a choice: take &lt;a href=\"Fernam\"&gt;Fernam&lt;/a&gt;'s pledge in blood\u2014all that remains of my life, weighed against the darkness\u2014or meet a merciful end by polearm. A number of individuals choose the first option, but may end up faltering later. \nWhen possible, would-be Blood Knights are carried to the nearest chapterhouse for induction. However, the survival rate of the induction ritual is low, and some of the survivors are feral with hunger. At the Gea Kul chapterhouse, they are given &lt;a href=\"Bright%20Arrival\"&gt;a blessed mantle&lt;/a&gt; that is said to increase their chances of surviving the ritual. However, some Blood Knights believe it may accelerate the curse.\nSurvivors of the ritual are expected to sever almost all ties to their mortal lives and swear to the order, after which they are taken to the nearest chapterhouse to be taught to keep the curse at bay. Before that, they are permitted to say their final goodbyes to family, and to take a keepsake of sentimental value.\nBefore completing training, a Blood Knight vows on their blood \u2014 at least nine vows, in service to the order.\nMost Blood Knights swear an oath to slay their accursed comrades should they turn.\nHistory.\nAccording to tomes quilled by &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s scribes centuries ago, the first Blood Knight was a man named &lt;a href=\"Fernam\"&gt;Fernam&lt;/a&gt;. He was assigned to protect a lord in the city of &lt;a href=\"Gea%20Kul\"&gt;Gea Kul&lt;/a&gt; who was infatuated with vampires and their immortality, and wished to find a cure for &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The experiments went on for years, but the lord's &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and scholars failed to deliver. Eventually, the lord ordered a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; captured and brought to the catacombs beneath his castle. The vampire broke free, slew the lord, and most of his guard. Fernam was gravely wounded during his escape, and was infected with vampirism.\nFortunately, the lord\u2019s top Mage\u2014a premier scholar on the subject of vampirism\u2014had performed a ritual on Fernam to stop the spread before he was transformed into a feral, mindless thrall. The Mage was successful in keeping him alive, but instead of granting immortality, Fernam unexpectedly inherited some of the vampire's power.\nThe Mage had been mortally wounded in the scuffle, and with his dying breath, taught Fernam how to perform the ritual that saved his life. At any moment, Fernam could succumb to his newfound darkness and transform indefintely into a vampiric thrall. After cheating fate, Fernam took his lord\u2019s wealth and moved into the catacombs below the keep. This would become the first training ground for future Blood Knights. He passed on knowledge of the curse-suspending ritual that saved his life along with the way of his preferred weapon, the polearm.\nBy the 13th century, the ranks of the Blood Knights had grown from solely Fernam, who had mysteriously disappeared, and been replaced by a council. At some point, the order was shown a series of visions by an artifact depicting the cataclysmic potential of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. c. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Knights fought against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, fighting in the open.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nThe is a playable &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo IV.\nBlood Knights will not be a playable class in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". While \"Diablo IV\" has &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s as a monster family, this was a case of coincidental development."}

It is a massive, swampy stretch of land with many caverns, split by rivers and tributaries often utilized for passage and trade. It is a hotbed of &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;, and venomous creatures can be found in the marsh.\nHistory.\nIn ancient times, the Blood Marsh hosted &lt;a href=\"Corvus\"&gt;Corvus&lt;/a&gt;, a city inhabited by &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. With the dampening of their powers by &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;'s tampering with the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, the city fell into decline. In time, the marsh's secrets were forgotten.\nIn &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;recent times&lt;/a&gt;, the marsh has taken a turn for the worse. These effects are demonstrated in changes in the marsh's flora and fauna. The bogans have recently grown more aggressive, defending their territory with increasingly insidious traps and fortifying their hovels with crudely constructed watch towers and palisades. Furthermore, what was once a verdant wetland has quickly evolved into a repugnant quagmire that grows less habitable by the day. Shortly after the defense of &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, rumors began to circulate of a &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;powerful force&lt;/a&gt; in the area. As the marsh was a hotbed for blood magic, it was feared what this force might be able to &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Golem\"&gt;exploit&lt;/a&gt; this primal power. Further adverse effects were observed due to the coming of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; entered the Blood Marsh to deal with Adria. The ruins reacted to their presence, as per their &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; birthright.\nIn-game.\nThe marsh appears as a zone in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDevelopment.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood\"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt; is the central theme of the Blood Marsh from a development point of view, including that of bloodlines. The developers conceived a festering swampland containing ruins, with ruins of an ancient civilization. This developed into the Blood Marsh, with the environment representing its blood motifs."}

Moreina herself led them, and after arriving in town, she found two allies: &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, prince of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;.

Eventually, they reached the horror in the labyrinth's darkest depths: Diablo, Lord of Terror. After a mighty battle, the demon was felled.\nAfter Diablo's defeat, Moreina returned to her order. However, she carried something dark within her; a silent madness that ate away at her once noble heart. &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; sensed that something was wrong with her, and feared (correctly) that she'd encountered an evil force at Tristram. However, she took no action. It was a mistake that cost the order dearly, as, taking on the name of \"Blood Raven,\" Moreina fell into the league with &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evil\"&gt;Lesser Evil&lt;/a&gt; took over &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Blood Raven assaulted her fellow Rogues in the battle, and at some point, was made &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. While the Sisterhood was forced to flee into the wilderness, Blood Raven established herself in the monastery graveyard, raising deceased Rogues as &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s.

The main difficulty in the battle is her mobility: she is very fast and will rarely stay in one place for too long.

In time, their vines were bound to her thoughts, and they spread across the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt; to steal &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;the living&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost prominent among the vines was the Blood Rose, located near the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Ruins\"&gt;Sanguine Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, and the source of corruption that had gripped the forest. It collected the blood that was spilt within the forest, and fed it to the Countess. As long as it continued to feed her blood, the Countess could not die, and the corruption would never end. The Blood Rose itself resided in its own pool of blood.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;, having ambushed a group of Rogues in the Sanguine Ruins, took their captives to the Rose so that they might be drained of their blood. However, the Bloodsworn were killed by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;, and the Blood Rose itself seemingly slain. However, &lt;a href=\"Lakrii\"&gt;Lakrii&lt;/a&gt; offered herself to the creature, and after draining her of her blood, was revived, forcing the hero(es) to do battle against it once more. However, it was again slain, this time permanantly.\nIn-game.\nThe Blood Rose is a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". It is found in the Sanguine Ruins during the \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Resurrection\"&gt;Blood Resurrection&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;, specifically in the &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20the%20Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Lair of the Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt; sub-zone. It is immune to &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;. It has two phases, the second triggering after Lakrii's offering.\nIn the first phase, it has the following attacks:\nAt the start of the second phase, Bloodsworn will attack the player, and the Blood Rose will lob blood projectiles into the air, landing across a wide radius. Standing close to the creature seems to be the best way to avoid these attacks, or alternatively, reaching the small gaps in-between their lines of fire. This is in addition to its earlier attacks bar summoning Dark Creepers. The Blood Rose also utilizes a \"strangling creeper\" attack over an area of effect. Standing in this area will cause one's health to be drained, in turn increasing the Blood Rose's HP. One can stand outside the circle, or keep attacking the creature, provided the damage the player inflicts is greater than what the Blood Rose gains in turn.\nLater in the second phase, &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt; will dispatch &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Bloodsworn Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;s to attack the player, along with regular Bloodsworn."}

After being asked the reason for their help, it replied that it was because it sensed that they would play a key role in stopping Lilith, but that a time would come when they will be enemies. It then gave them a blessing to help navigate their way out of the nightmare.\nAs Lilith drew closer to Mephisto's &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cathedral of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloodied Wolf appears to the Wanderer in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Realm of Hatred&lt;/a&gt; and offers to transport them across the hellfire barrier, directly to the cathedral. &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; (who was with the Wanderer) recognized the wolf as Mephisto, and was shocked that they would trust a &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;. The stalled her argument by reminding them that time was short and the fate of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; depended on them stopping Lilith from absorbing his essence.

Their members were known for their black &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Countess, the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of fallen Bloodsworn was returned to her upon their demise, aiding her in &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; as much as in life. This was likely made possible through the use of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt;. The Bloodsworn performed rituals to honor her.\nThe strongest of their number were stationed inside the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt;, where they guarded their mistress.\nHistory.\nWar in the Dark Wood.\nThe Bloodsworn were formed in the period after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Lakrii\"&gt;Lakrii&lt;/a&gt;. She led numerous other members of the Sisterhood away from their order to form their new group, and they committed various atrocities, attacking all who ventured into the Dark Wood. As such, the Dark Wood, once a shortcut for merchants traveling through Khanduras, became too dangerous a journey to take. Westmarch requested that &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s clear out the Bloodsworn so that the route might be usable again. \nThe Bloodsworn became known to Westmarch, which regarded them as insurgents. It offered &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill Bloodsworn. The kingdom concluded that if the Bloodsworn were to be defeated, it had to be on their own ground. It offered bounties to adventurers to storm the Forgotten Tower and kill the Countess.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloodsworn razed &lt;a href=\"Blackstone%20Village\"&gt;Blackstone Village&lt;/a&gt; to the ground, summoning &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Creeper\"&gt;Dark Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s to infest the ruins, while collecting the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of every man, woman, and child. A small girl, &lt;a href=\"Alyssa\"&gt;Alyssa&lt;/a&gt;, survived, thanks to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;. The Bloodsworn attempted to take their lives as well, but were repelled by a group of Rogues led by &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt;. The Rogues gave chase, but the Bloodsworn ambushed them, wounding many and driving them back. Inside the den, they presented the blood that they had collected to &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt;, who told them that this still wasn't enough. The den was cleared out by the hero, but Lakrii escaped, and the Bloodsworn were still active.\nThe Sisterhood attacked the Bloodsworn in the Forgotten Tower, however, the Bloodsworn fought back ferociously, causing the attack to falter. At around about the same time, the Bloodsworn ambushed a group of Rogues in the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Ruins\"&gt;Sanguine Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, killing most of them while taking the survivors to the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt;, which would drain them of their blood. The Bloodsworn failed to stop their foe(s) from slaying the creature, though not before Lakrii sacrificed herself to the creature, reviving the Countess fully in the process.\nWhen the Shard-seeker attacked the Forgotten Tower, the Bloodsworn tried to hold them at bay, but despite the urgings of their mistress, they were slain, with the Countess herself defeated as well. The Sisterhood remained in the Dark Wood to ensure that the Bloodsworn did not return.\nThe Bloodsworn Hunter.\nThe Bloodsworn's attack on Blackstone Village inadvertantly sealed their doom. While they believed to have wiped the town out, there were a few survivors who fled to &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where they resolved to better themselves, in order to seek revenge. At least one of these villagers was trained as a Rogue; an individual who became known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Bloodsworn%20Hunter%20%28Character%29\"&gt;the Bloodsworn Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. The cultists were wiped out, and the Hunter scoured the countryside of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; for any surviving Bloodsworn. \nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nThe Bloodsworn are a 'family' of &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

The armor revolves around the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, protecting him against all attacks. Although enchanted, the armor does take damage and will eventually crumble. \"\nUsage.\nBone Armor is a useful defensive skill, particularly early in the game. &lt;a href=\"Daggermancer\"&gt;Daggermancer&lt;/a&gt;s may benefit most from this skill as they have face melee damage as often as they fight ranged monsters, but any necromancer can benefit from the damage reduction.\nBone Armor can be extremely helpful in absorbing Physical Damage, preventing attacks from potentially killing users. The shield does not have a limit on how much damage it may absorb \"per attack\", but the total amount of damage soaked \"per cast\" is limited.\nAdding points into Bone Armor increases the armor's damage limit by 15 for each level - as much as its synergies: &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wall\"&gt;Bone Wall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison\"&gt;Bone Prison&lt;/a&gt;.

They are easily identified by their brightly-colored spiked bodily armor with horned helmets. They appear as small and incredibly agile demons with remarkably long arms. Their bright missile attack is also distinctive and easily seen.\u00a0\nSubjugators may appear as very dangerous opponents, but actually they are harmless if the player is careful. These demons are very quickly moving, keeping their distance from players. Their melee attack is slow and therefore not too dangerous, but instead Subjugators prefer hurling very slowly falling firebombs at the player. Like &lt;a href=\"Lacuni\"&gt;Lacuni&lt;/a&gt; grenades, these dark missiles deal very high damage, but are in flight for quite some time, so unless a player is &lt;a href=\"immobilized\"&gt;immobilized&lt;/a&gt;, it is very easy to dodge these. However, being hit by more than two in a row can easily kill an average hero. Note that Subjugators may throw their bombs over walls.\nWhile Subjugators are very weak in close combat, they have a unique ability to mount their &lt;a href=\"Armaddon\"&gt;Armaddon&lt;/a&gt; beasts. Whenever one is available, a Subjugator will hop over the beast's back and remain immune to damage until the beast is killed (adding their own attack to the mount's, potentially being able to &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt; a hero and then launch a ranged attack for greater effect). When the beast dies, the Subjugator dismounts it unharmed and can fight on as normal.\nSeveral Subjugators can be found in &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt; in ."}

The figure of a Succubus is perfect and smooth, with milky skin, coupled with demonic bat wings and a smooth, thorny dress. While capable in combat, Succubi prefer to seduce mortals with subtle machinations, only to kill them and drag their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. The separation of the soul is usually carried out through &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, a dagger in the dark, or some other easy betrayal to separate the soul from the flesh.\nSuccubi possess an incessant craving for &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;, especially that of human men. For millennia, succubi have taken pleasure in enslaving thralls by twisting their desires into soul shattering compromises. Once bound to a succubus service, no captive breaks their bond without losing their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. Legends exist of women dressed in scarlet, dancing through forests or stalking alleys at night; a sign that Succubi are on the hunt for their next victim. Before they strike, many Succubi warn their victims of their true nature\u2014a glimpse of demonic wings, a hint of sharpened teeth, a flash of a forked tongue...anything that will seem dangerous to humans. However, their victims rarely flee, for while lust is a Succubus's weapon, it is the thought of tasting something forbidden that truly ensnares their victims. The allure of pleasures beyond mortal flesh is a sweet honey that drowns out any sense of caution. This allure goes down to the physical level, as wearing bits of a Succubus's wings, teeth, or other body parts as jewelry makes it easier for the wearer to seduce anyone.\nIn open combat, Succubi take to battle with a passion and a joy not often seen in demons. They are fast and mobile in combat, preferring to weaken their prey from a distance with a diabolical curse. Once their prey is weakened, the Succubi move in for the kill, slashing viciously with their long, curved talons. Gathered in a clutch, a Succubi pack can send nigh inexhaustible streams of destructive magic sufficient to overcome most foes.\nVariants.\nVariants of Succubi exist, including the following:\nHistory.\nThey served as the handmaidens of &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; theorized that she was responsible for their creation, sculpting these demons into their forms. She taught her minions the art of seduction. Later, their use was perfected by &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Succubi were present below the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. They were thought to have been wiped out in the battle that followed, but &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;two years later&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; unleashed his personal harem of Succubi during his assault on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. These Succubi were among the most zealous minions of their master. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Twenty years&lt;/a&gt; later, Succubi were again seen on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, among &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Army of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, and later, during &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nSuccubi appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; uses Succubi as his personal guards below &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. They are then encountered in the later levels of the game. Originally Hell Spawn were Demon type but were then changed to &lt;a href=\"Animals\"&gt;Animal&lt;/a&gt; type in .\nSuccubi attack using the spell &lt;a href=\"Bloodstar\"&gt;Bloodstar&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike the spell players can learn, it does not consume their health. The projectile's color corresponds to the different colors of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. As the succubi have no melee attack, they flee if the player closes in on them, making them infamously troublesome for melee attackers, especially the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;. Succubi appear in three other variations: Snow Witches, Hell Spawn, and Soul Burners, whereas\u00a0Succubus\u00a0is the regular form.\nDiablo II.\nSuccubi appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", specifically in . Their appearance has changed slightly, and they actually utilize their wings for flight. They are clothed, and have a stabbing tail.\nThe Succubus' infamous curse returns, this time under the moniker of \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Mana\"&gt;Blood Mana&lt;/a&gt;.\" However, they will only cast it on players that have greater than or equal mana to life. If the opposite is true, Succubi will cast a &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Curse\"&gt;curse that halves defense&lt;/a&gt;.\nBesides normal Succubi, there are four other variations: Vile Temptresses, Stygian Harlots, Hell Temptresses, and Blood Temptresses.\nDiablo Immortal.\nSuccubi appear as enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". They are found in the &lt;a href=\"Domain%20of%20Horror\"&gt;Domain of Horror&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Realm of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;. They're also seen as minions of powerful demons and retain their iconic blood stars. However, blood stars now inflict &lt;a href=\"Burn\"&gt;Burn&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nSuccubi are back in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" as handmaidens and daughters of &lt;a href=\"Cydaea\"&gt;the Maiden of Lust&lt;/a&gt;. They can be found in different areas of &lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;IV&lt;/a&gt;, respectively in the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt; and in most areas of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. Their appearance is different from that in the first two games, but like in Diablo I, they literally fight completely unarmored.\nAs seductive and deadly as usual, the Succubi possess their signature &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Star\"&gt;Blood Star&lt;/a&gt; attack. Prior to patch 2.2.0, it used to apply a curse on damaging hit, reducing Armor by -35% for 5 seconds. Because of that, the Succubi used to be support attackers, not too deadly by themselves, but they did make it much easier for all other monsters to kill a hero, especially towards classes that rely on Armor instead of all resistances as their major form of protection.\nSuccubi are fragile, and killing them is only problematic if they are hiding behind their more resilient allies. The damage of a Succubus's attacks is low, but their Blood Star homing projectiles are moving erratically with changing speed, making them rather unpredictable for avoidance, and may make slight changes to trajectory to home at enemies. Avoid large groups of other monsters accompanied by the Succubi, or separate them for easier dispatching. Remember Succubi can fly over the impassable terrain and even have a 'backflip' move that frequently allows them to escape melee combat.\nThere is a mini-event in &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20the%20Cursed\"&gt;Tower of the Cursed&lt;/a&gt; involving several Keep Guards mind-controlled by the Succubi as they are being prepared to be sacrificed to &lt;a href=\"Cydaea\"&gt;Cydaea&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the death of their tormentors, these guards join the hero to help with clearing the rest of the tower. Sadly, though, they cannot last long against the monsters in the tower, especially Champion/Rare packs.\nDiablo IV.\nSuccubi return as enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Bony knobs protruded from their thick hides, giving them added protection against melee weapons. They were mutated &lt;a href=\"Baal%27s%20Minion\"&gt;Minions&lt;/a&gt;, turned into their new form by &lt;a href=\"Overseer\"&gt;Overseer&lt;/a&gt;s. Once the Suicide Minion reached its target, it died in a horrid explosion, causing massive damage to its target.\nIn-game.\nThe Suicide Minions can be found loitering around with their more controllable brethren. They can also be created by &lt;a href=\"Overseer\"&gt;Overseer&lt;/a&gt;s by inducing &lt;a href=\"Minion%20Frenzy\"&gt;Minion Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; on Baal's Minions. They can also be encountered without an Overseer in the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20Keep\"&gt;Worldstone Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuicide Minions are not tough to defeat, often being killed in a single blow. They are easy pickings for ranged characters. But their real strength and probably their claim to fame is their highly dangerous kamikaze-like Blast. This blast can seriously damage a player, especially given that it can knock the player back and cause a stun effect.\nThey can be avoided however, they do not damage Minions and &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; and can be easily killed by them. There is also a more risky way to get rid of them. When a Suicide Minion spots you, run away and stand still until it is very near you but not within its blast range. Then quickly run away. This causes the Suicide Minion to stop where you were and blast right there. But this method runs the risk of inviting more monsters on your chase which can be quite frustrating.\nIf the player kills the Suicide Minion before it blows up, it gives a massive amount of &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; (no experience is obtained if the minion detonates on its own). This provides an interesting game mechanic forcing the player to think before engaging these loathsome beasts. Whether the player tries to kill them to reap the experience bonus or gets blown up along with the Suicide Minion is entirely the player's choice. You will know if you killed it when you do not suffer the &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; that occurs if it blows up by itself.\nA good tactic for obtaining the experience that a Suicide Minion offers involves the Barbarian's &lt;a href=\"War%20Cry%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;War Cry&lt;/a&gt;. Simply use the skill as the Minion gets closer, and then kill it while it waits out its Stun time. If the player allows War Cry to reach the appropriate skill level, the Stun duration will be long enough for you to use your preferred attack enough to kill the Minion before it explodes.\nThey have a tendency to have default look when a minion is changed by an Overseer. They get their colors when player exits the screen they are on and returns back, or when town portal is used, and then player returns.\n\"Technical Note: First three Suicide Minions spawn with heads of Greater Hell Spawn and Greater Ice Spawn probably because the last 2 suicide minions aren't used, so you can't really see Suicide Minions with the 2-horned heads of first three Minions. Also the colors of Berserker Slayers and Consumed Ice Boars are swapped an an oversight.\""}

All the other values are skewed by those +10% as well (i.e. show +15% per level, when in reality the bonus is +25% per level). This is because, while the \"Life: x\" description uses correct (par7 * lvl) + ln12 calc, but the \"Max Life +%\" uses just ln12, completely ignoring the self-synergy bonus. \nInternally (in Skills.txt, SkillDesc.txt etc.), this skill is known as \"Summon Fenris\".

{"id": "6699", "revid": "32489973", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6699", "title": "Summonmancer", "text": "The Summonmancer (a.k.a. Zookeeper, Overlord, Skelemancer, Skeletor, Lord of Mages, Summoner) is a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20Builds\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; that relies on a large number of minions to overwhelm and deal damage to enemies. The role of the player in this build is to support his army by inflicting enemies with &lt;a href=\"curses\"&gt;curses&lt;/a&gt;, replacing fallen minions and by casting &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt;. When partying with other players, the Summonmancer enhances their strengths by casting appropriate curses on enemies and distracting foes with his minions.\nThe Summonmancer build is quite effective thanks to the synergies added in . Prior to this patch, maxed out skeletons were weak. The Summonmancer frequently relied on &lt;a href=\"revive\"&gt;revive&lt;/a&gt; monster skill because the monster's life scaled with the amount of players in the map. If there were eight players, the summoned monster's life would be eight times greater.\nSince version 1.10, skeletons and skeleton magi became much more effective. With an &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenaries\"&gt;Offensive mercenary&lt;/a&gt; from giving an &lt;a href=\"aura\"&gt;aura&lt;/a&gt;, the skeleton army became quite powerful. It is even able to last until in &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt;, although Hell is generally the point at which having optimized equipment becomes necessary.\nThe Summonmancer had certain complimentary skills. This build can generally get away with no &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;, so points will go towards enough &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; to use equipment, enough &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; to use for max block (roughly 193), with all remaining points spent on &lt;a href=\"vitality\"&gt;vitality&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt; curse might seem good for this build, it will not make his minions last long. In Hell mode Act V, the minions die from enemies, so skeleton mastery and items that give +skill are needed to keep them alive. &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt; is a great curse for a summoning necromancer when fighting Act bosses because it decreases the boss' damage output by slowing them down and in some cases, allow their attacks to be interrupted. Using a good blocking shield with high dexterity is recommended - the percentage-based block chance scales naturally, unlike skills such as &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Armor\"&gt;Bone Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Summonmancer provides an excellent meat shield. If the Summonmancer has maxed out skeleton skills, and the proper plus-skill equipment, they can have 13+ skeleton warriors and 13+ skeleton mages (Thirteen is a typical average although up to seventeen has been proven possible, with a fully optimized +26 to summoning skills with grand charms). This vast number of minions acts as a multi-faceted tank, absorbing the damage. Since there are so many minions, it is easy for companion players to avoid getting hurt.\nA drawback in online play of a Summonmancer is the lag, giving it the alternate name of the Lagromancer because of the amount of minions on screen forces all computers synchronized to slow down to the speed of the slowest computer. This is a less of a problem now, for three reasons. First, there were early bugs that caused serious slowdown with lots of minions but they were fixed. Second, computers are much faster now than in Diablo 2's early days. Third, patch 1.10 reduced the number of skeletons by about a third while scaling up their power. Most players do not have problems with the large number of skeletons, as they contribute greatly to the party and in their current numbers, are generally much less than the enemies the party faces. It should also be noted, that too many minions/spells/projectiles at once affects Frame rate, which when low enough, simulates lag.\nCore Summonmancer Starting Guide.\nWhen starting a new Summonmancer, put your first skill point into &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Skeleton\"&gt;Raise Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and your second into &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt;. Pump Raise Skeleton while putting any extra into &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Mastery\"&gt;Skeleton Mastery&lt;/a&gt;. At level 6 learn &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt;. Put the rest of your points into Raise Skeleton, then Skeletal Mastery. Initially, it was thought you would get greater returns per skill point by pumping Mastery. However, this is no longer the case. It is much more efficient to put points into Summon Skeleton first until it hits level 20 base skill points. At the same time place one point into the following utility skills as they become available: &lt;a href=\"Terror\"&gt;Terror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dim%20Vision\"&gt;Dim Vision&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt; (which will be your primary curse against bosses in Nightmare and Hell), &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Resist\"&gt;Summon Resist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Revive\"&gt;Revive&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith respecialization added to the game, the summoner starting guide is an excellent guide for any starter necro since leveling with a summoner is gear independent and easy to do solo.\nCore Skills:\nNon-expansion Summonmancer.\nDue to some of the limitation of classic Diablo II gameplay (mainly the lack of a powerful &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;hireling&lt;/a&gt; and items), creating a skeleton army becomes considerably more difficult, especially in &lt;a href=\"The%20Harrowing\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt;. That is why the Necromancer has to use an extra skill to kill his first few monsters. This is best done with &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spear\"&gt;Bone Spear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spirit\"&gt;Bone Spirit&lt;/a&gt; - spare as many skill points for these as possible.\nAnother option is using the &lt;a href=\"Confuse\"&gt;Confuse&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Attract\"&gt;Attract&lt;/a&gt; curse, which causes monsters to fight each other. This is a more difficult strategy, yet it requires spending fewer additional skill points than Bone Spear/Spirit.\nOnce the skeleton army is up, gameplay proceeds the same way as in Expansion.\nFurther development.\nThings to avoid:\nSummoner Necromancers are quite gear independent. Often, a player stacks all the +skill gear, summons their army, then swap to magic find gear. Minions may get lost due to the lower maximum number of minions, but the remaining minions are still the level they were summoned at and should be strong enough to deal with nearly any monster in the game.\nGear.\nA Summonmancer generally relies on items with a lot of +skill bonuses, which enable him to create more powerful skeletons."}

In this game there were no special modifiers however they had some features that didn't return in the second game: apart of preset locations most of them would be found in a random spot of the Dungeon Level they are set to if their base monster appeared, they had custom set statistics/resistances, and some of them were set to use different monsters AI.\nDiablo II.\nSuper Unique Monsters are somewhat harder to kill than normal uniques. Some of their base monster types are unique; some show up as normal enemies in areas later than those where the super unique is encountered, like the &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brutes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Treehead%20Woodfist\"&gt;Treehead Woodfist&lt;/a&gt;, some have the look of other variants like &lt;a href=\"Bonebreaker\"&gt;Bonebreaker&lt;/a&gt; in Act 1 which is resembling a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Dead\"&gt;Burning Dead&lt;/a&gt; from Act 2.\nIn this game they are always found in Preset locations (locations that don't have a randomized layout or have only a couple of variants), or Preset fragments (special map fragments that always spawn in a particular location and only once).\nAll the &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;Act Boss&lt;/a&gt;es are Super Uniques. Some Super Unique Monsters are associated with &lt;a href=\"Quests\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;, though most are \"not\" required to be killed to complete the specific quest(s) (excluding Act Bosses, that is).\nDue to their nature, some Super Unique Monsters will have complete &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;Immunity&lt;/a&gt; against certain &lt;a href=\"Sorceress_%28Diablo_II%29%23Skills\"&gt;Spells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;Skills&lt;/a&gt;. They have a set amount of minions (or no minions), always with 1 more minion on &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and 2 more on &lt;a href=\"Hell\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. They have only their set bonuses on &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt;, but gain 1 random unique bonus on &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and 2 on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey use the same color palettes as Uniques though not randomly as they are always set to a particular one. Some monster types don't have a palette file so they don't use the random palettes and the Super-Uniques don't use the unique look specified in the code: &lt;a href=\"Council%20Member\"&gt;Council Members&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thresh%20Socket\"&gt;Thresh Socket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frozenstein\"&gt;Frozenstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bonesaw%20Breaker\"&gt;Bonesaw Breaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pindleskin\"&gt;Pindleskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snapchip%20Shatter\"&gt;Snapchip Shatter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lister%20the%20Tormentor\"&gt;Lister The Tormentor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey have all the bonuses of Uniques but have these additionally:\nDiablo I.\nThis is a list of all Unique monsters present in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;.

It is a minigame inspired by action survival games such as \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Survivors\"&gt;Vampire Survivors&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIt is currently running from July 12, 3 a.m.\u2013July 19, 3 a.m. server time.\nGameplay.\nSurvivor's Bane is a top-down action survival game where you must defend against endlessly spawning enemies while collecting the experience orbs they drop to earn new skills. Eventually elite monsters and bosses will spawn that drop equipment. The character automatically uses all of its available skills so you only need to control the movement.\nEach run of Survivor's Bane resets the character progress, and you must re-earn all the skills and equipment. Every level up presents a random choice of skills which could be a new skill or an upgrade to an existing one. Elite monsters drop Skill Orbs that also offer a skill choice. The final upgrade of each skill is a choice between two different effects. Rare Elite monsters and bosses drop Equipment upgrades, which are initially new pieces, then upgrades to existing ones. The character has 6 slots for skills and 6 slots for equipment, once the limits are reached, new pickups will only be upgrades. If all skills are maxed out, further level-ups and elite group kills will instead drop some coins and scrap materials to be used in the regular Diablo Immortal game (this seems to have a cap of 15 drops, which can be reached in endless mode with both modifiers active). However after equipment is maxed out, further item upgrade drops will do nothing. At one point, a horde of &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s appears, challenging the player to kill as many as possible before they can teleport away, and rewarding lots of equipment in the main game.\nHealing Pools spawn around the map and are the most common form of healing. Treasure chests may also spawn containing scrap materials and gold. Other randomly spawning objects are Conduit Shrines which let you strike nearby enemies with lightning, and Disintegration Shrines which create 5 very powerful beams in front of you that can cut through masses of enemies.\nThe game can be paused, and in fact pausing is automatic while on the skill/equipment upgrade screens.\nWhen playing on mobile, both landscape and portrait orientation can be used, and there is a rumble effect when taking a large amount of damage.\nLevels.\nThere are 3 levels, with the bottom two being unlocked by beating the one above them.\nSkills.\nSkills are not restricted to your character's class, skills from all classes may show up randomly. The starting skill is based on your class:\nEquipment.\nEquipment stats are randomized, the item of the same name may have a different attribute in a different run:\nIn addition, each slot has a common bonus:\nThe values separated by slashes are those applying at different equipment upgrade ranks from 1 to 4 (max).\nAchievements.\nAchievements reset every season.\nBuffs.\nOne or two random buffs can be activated at the beginning of Endless Mode. The buffs can be re-rolled up to 2 times.\nModifiers.\nCan be activated in Endless Mode. Both modifiers can be active at the same time.\nRewards.\nAdditional rewards can be claimed after completing a certain number of tasks:\nHistory.\nIn the February 21 2024 update, various skills were given damage bonuses on upgrade and Bone Spear's alternative max upgrade was changed to drain health based on your current rather than maximum health.\nIn the April 8 2024 update, a popup indicator was added every 50 kills to indicate that the rewards have increased. The victory screen shows the number of bonuses earned, and the Random Item, EXP and Gold have a chest icon to indicate that their quantity is based on the number of bonuses earned. The same update added Buffs and Modifiers. Portals between levels in Endless Mode were changed to activate automatically after 10 seconds instead of having to step into them.\nThe Seal of Triumph rewards were added with the April 19-26 2024 run of the event (the first time it was part of &lt;a href=\"Event%20Center%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Event Center&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Manifest\"&gt;Nightmare Manifest&lt;/a&gt; update made the following changes:"}

The general idea is that skills not only grow in power as players invest more and more skill points in them, but also enhance \"other\" skills, in most cases by increasing damage or some other stats.\nExample is that a &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; putting skill points in will also increase damage of her &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ball\"&gt;Fire Ball&lt;/a&gt; by 14% with each point, including the first. Note that only hard points (actual skill points put into the skill) add Synergy, not the skill bonuses from items. \nSome synergies have mutual synergy, each providing synergy to the other; for example each point in Fire Ball will also increase the damage of Fire Bolt by 16%. The amounts given to each skill may or may not be equal. Sometimes, upgrading a skill via Synergy may prove \"more\" effective than putting skill points in it. A good example of such skill is . Each point in this skill increase damage absorbed by 10 points, whereas its synergies by 15 points.\nIn a manner of speaking, this system allows the characters to increase the power of their skills far beyond the normal Level 20 limit (actual maximum of hard points in one skill). It also discourages more diversified, \"hybrid\" builds, as player needs to invest skill points not only in build's main skill, but also its synergies.\nSynergies are applied to all forms of skills: native, class-specific from items, &lt;a href=\"oskill\"&gt;oskill&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Charged%20item\"&gt;charged&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suffix_%28Diablo_II%29%23Proccing\"&gt;procced&lt;/a&gt; (chance to cast), &lt;a href=\"aura\"&gt;aura when equipped&lt;/a&gt;. The synergy source requires hard skill points though.\nThe Skills needed for the respective synergies can be seen at the very bottom of every skill's information in the Skill Tree."}

Shortly before that point, she was escorting some travelers through the &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Valley\"&gt;forest beyond the monastery&lt;/a&gt;. During the journey, they were caught in a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; and the travelers got pinned. Though they yelled for her, she couldn't help them, so she left them and fled. Burdened with guilt, she told her mentor of the incident and he replied \"perhaps it was your calling to leave them.\"\nLater,as part of her training, her mentor told her to go to the &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Valley\"&gt;Misty Valley&lt;/a&gt; on a pilgrim, in order to choose a &lt;a href=\"Sahptev%23Known%20Deities\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; she would dedicate herself to. Confused about how to go about it, and nervous from her past trauma, she asked a passing &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to escort her. The first altar Szandra made an offering turned out to be sanctified to the gods of chaos. Immediately after, the altar lit with unnatural flames. Seeing the flames briefly resurfaced her trauma. After getting her wits, she went in search of another altar.\nThe next altar was for the gods of order. Immediately after she made her offering, the altar lit with unnatural flames. &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Soul\"&gt;Phantoms&lt;/a&gt; of the travelers she abandoned formed in the flames, accusing her for their deaths. Before they could hurt her, her companion dispatched of them. Shaken by the incident she fled, with her companion following her. \nShe eventually stopped at a broken altar \u2014 an altar to &lt;a href=\"Ytar\"&gt;Ytar&lt;/a&gt;, from the ruins inscribed on it. Before she could depart, the altar lit with unnatural flames. Tired of her antics, her companion demanded an explanation. The trauma of recounting the incident and being surrounded by flames caused her to have a mental break. As she wallowed in distress, her darkness formed into a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Clone\"&gt;shadow of herself&lt;/a&gt;.\nFortunately for her, her companion immediately started battling it. As the shadow grew weaker, Szandra's mind became clearer. After her shadow was defeated, Szandra came to an epiphany; she would follow Ytar, and the flames that followed her were Ytar's hand reaching out to her.\nIn-game.\nSzandra is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

Tabri witnessed firsthand how Vataos operated, how those who refused to follow his orders were executed.\nTabri finally had her falling out with Vataos during a raid on &lt;a href=\"Bratisa\"&gt;Bratisa&lt;/a&gt;'s oasis. Vataos wanted the people flayed alive and trussed up to convince the other oases to pay their tribute. Tabri refused the order, arguing that it would lead to retribution. In front of their men, Tabri stabbed her sword into the amber sands and walked away. Before Vataos could have her flayed that night, Tabri fled.\nA few others\u2014including Zov, fled with Tabri and would later form the Amber Blades. Her relationship with Zov was uneasy. Over the years, she encountered many &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who sought to speak with the Blades, before daring to enter Shassar's chambers and tombs. According to Tabri, \"each of them wound up the same.\"\nThe Light of Fahir.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the Blades' &lt;a href=\"Tabri%27s%20Encampment\"&gt;encampment&lt;/a&gt; came under repeated attack by the &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt;. After one that left a number of guards injured, Tabri led a cadre out into the desert to confront the panther-men. She was aided by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;, who slew the lacuni alongside her. She appreciated their aid, but could offer none in return. She pointed out that the Blades were barely holding on against the lacuni and &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Scorpions\"&gt;Sand Scorpions&lt;/a&gt;, and told them to leave the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt; before the sands took them. They departed, while she tended to the wounded. She her way back to the camp, where later, Zov presented her with the pelt of a slain lacuni &lt;a href=\"Alvas\"&gt;pack leader&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed that he and the hero(es) had slain it, but Tabri saw through his lies, noting that only the hero's/heroes' hands had &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; on them. She ordered them to hang the beast's skin at the camp's gate as a warning to any lacuni that might attack. She told the Blades to keep up their patrols; to not be complacent despite their victory. Afterwards, she talked to the hero(es), who informed her that they were searching for the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;. Tabri was willing to help them get there, if in return, they obtained the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;Scepter of Fahir&lt;/a&gt; for her. With the scepter in her possession, she would be seen as the rightful ruler of Shassar. She ordered Zov take them to see &lt;a href=\"Peth\"&gt;Peth&lt;/a&gt;, and gave them a gem as a sign of the pact they'd made.\nAfter the hero(es) departed to find the first piece in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Chamber of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, Tabri headed to the &lt;a href=\"Sereth\"&gt;Sereth&lt;/a&gt; outpost to wait for them. The hero(es) arrived, and handed her the scepter piece. She told them that the head of the scepter was buried alongside Fahir in his &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt;, and warned them that things would get more difficult.\nWhile Tabri's allies raided the tomb, the outpost was attacked by the Sand Scorpions, led by &lt;a href=\"Vataos\"&gt;Vataos&lt;/a&gt; himself. The two dueled, and Tabri was able to wound him. However, Vataos disappeared in a puff of smoke before Tabri could deliver the killing blow. The hero(es), having returned, gave Tabri the scepter piece they'd found in the tomb. Expressing regret for doubting them, Tabri gave them a map that would lead them to the third and final piece. Afterwards, the Blades brought the &lt;a href=\"Tomi\"&gt;lone straggler&lt;/a&gt; from the attack before her. She told the bandit that to Vataos, he was already dead, but that there was a place for him in the Amber Blades if he wanted it.\nThe straggler accepted, and he, Tabri, and other Amber Blades traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Chamber of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, where they found that the hero(es) had already retrieved the final scepter piece. With the scepter in hand, Tabri declared that she had the right to rule Shassar, and through it, a symbol the land's people could rally behind against Vataos. The Amber Blades knelt before her, as she declared \"let a new light shine upon the Shassar Sea.\" Later, talking to the hero(es), she upheld the bargain they had made earlier, by ordering &lt;a href=\"Peth\"&gt;Peth&lt;/a&gt; to lead them to the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;. She bid them farewell, and told them that she might call upon their services again.\nCurse of the Scepter.\nAfter the departure of the Shard-seeker, Tabri declared war on the Sand Scorpions. She tried to strike against Vataos using the power of the scepter, but the Blades were forced to retreat into the Library of Zoltun Kulle. At some point, she disappeared during the dead of night. She wrote &lt;a href=\"Tabri%27s%20Letter\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tabri%27s%20Will\"&gt;letters&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Peth\"&gt;Peth&lt;/a&gt;, declaring that she was going to face Vataos, and named Peth the new leader of the Amber Blades if anything happened to her. By this point she was suspicious of Zov, and ordered Peth to keep and eye on him.\nTabri used a &lt;a href=\"Terminus\"&gt;Terminus&lt;/a&gt; to enter a &lt;a href=\"Obliterated%20Realm\"&gt;realm beyond Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, but was followed by Vataos. The two fought, and Vataos was able to claim the scepter. It was at this point that the Shard-seeker arrived, who defeated Vataos, and took back the scepter.

While slow of foot, these beasts deliver a palpable hit when engaged at close range and can absorb a fair amount of damage. Tainted are perhaps an even greater threat when wounded, however, as this is when they retreat and direct orbs of lightning at their enemies. Able to breathe electricity, Tainted are not creations of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, though stronger Tainted are more affected by their influences.\nIt is said that the &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Clan\"&gt;Moon Clan&lt;/a&gt; herded these creatures in Hell, as their natural immunity to lightning allowed safe handling of these demons.\nIn-game.\nTainted possess the ability to hurl spheres of lightning at their foes. They move slowly because of their hulking forms. The Tainted prefer to use their melee attack to strike any adventurers that step close into their paths and when wounded, they retreat and use their &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Globe\"&gt;Lightning Globe&lt;/a&gt;s. They have a natural resistance to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=\"immune\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to it on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tainted come in five different varieties: &lt;a href=\"Misshapen\"&gt;Misshapen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disfigured\"&gt;Disfigured&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tainted\"&gt;Tainted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Afflicted\"&gt;Afflicted&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Damned\"&gt;Damned&lt;/a&gt;.

They also choose to spit lightning with 60/70/80% chance if they reach certain health thresholds depending on variant. They never spit lightning over their \"hurt\" threshold on &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt; difficulty.\nA &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; Tainted is &lt;a href=\"Pitspawn%20Fouldog\"&gt;Pitspawn Fouldog&lt;/a&gt;.\nStats.\nTainted (third variety) are an Tainted type that can spawn in: \nThey switch to mostly ranged attacks at 80/50/50% health.

{"id": "1451", "revid": "1321964", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1451", "title": "Tal Rasha", "text": "Tal Rasha was a powerful &lt;a href=\"Horadric\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, and the original leader of the order. He became the host for &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Destruction. Few &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s have been able to reach the same levels of fame that he has.\nBiography.\nEarly Life.\nIn his youth, Tal Rasha visited the court of &lt;a href=\"Coshumat\"&gt;Coshumat&lt;/a&gt;. He gave him the title \"the Halfwit Count,\" as he ruled over starving fiefs, yet refused bread and succor to those who did not impress him. Coshumat kept a retinue of ten burly show fighters he called the &lt;a href=\"Eminents\"&gt;Eminents&lt;/a&gt;. As Tal Rasha arrived, they had just finished with a man who begged relief for his village after a poor harvest. The count asked him to endure thirty strikes from the Eminents, and watched attentively as they beat the man unconscious with the flats of their swords.\nThe Hunt for the Three.\nThe Horadrim were formed at the behest of the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, given the task to hunt the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; that had been &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;banished&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Tal Rasha was made the group's leader. This included the responsibility of inducting recruits.\nTal Rasha was among the Horadrim that bound their &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"vessels\"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;. As the Horadrim could not conquer &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, these vessels would store their memories for future Horadrim.\nAt some point, Tal Rasha stored most of his power inside a &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Unwavering%20Glare\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Binding of Destruction.\nOf the Three Brothers, Baal was the second Prime Evil found, who took refuge in the city of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; for three days. Tal Rasha ordered the Horadrim to wait so that no innocents would be caught in the crossfire. The Horadrim finally confronted Baal after he left the city. Tal Rasha confronted Baal alone before Kulle and the other Horadrim arrived. Together, they were able to incapacitate Baal and use the soulstone against him.\nAccounts differ on what happened next. The main account states that during the fight, one of Baal's attacks shattered the sacred soulstone that was supposed to imprison him. Tal Rasha however, subdued the raging demon lord and, gathering the largest of the soulstone's shards, trapped Baal's destructive essence within it. Another states that it was the inability of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; (another member of the Horadrim) to properly handle the stone in battle, which lead to its breaking. \nIn truth, the first account appears to be more accurate, as Kulle and Tal Rasha wielded the soulstone together, but Baal shattered it, before escaping through a portal. Tal Rasha &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed after him, while ordering Kulle to lead the Horadrim into the valley below to meet up with him. They found Tal Rasha and Baal locked in mortal combat, and joined the fray. In a second battle against the Lord of Destruction, Baal was subdued, and imprisoned within the soulstone fragment. However, the fragment could not contain Baal's essence forever, and there wasn't enough time to reformulate it. \nTal Rasha was unperturbed, stating that all they had to do was obtain another soulstone. Kulle, annoyed, pointed out that only an &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;'s weapon could cleave the Worldstone, and even then, there was no way they could make it to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; before Baal escaped. Tal Rasha stated that Tyrael would have answers, and promised Kulle that Baal would not roam free again.\nWhile accounts again differ as to whether it was Tal Rasha or Kulle who made the suggestion, the idea was put forward that a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; body might be able to contain the demon's essence by fusing a shard to their body. Unfortunately, the host would be left to wrestle with the demon for all eternity. But an instant later, Tal Rasha stepped forward to volunteer. It was at this point that Tyrael appeared, leading the Horadrim to an old &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;burial chamber&lt;/a&gt;. A binding stone with &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s of containment was built, and Tal Rasha ordered his brethren to chain him to it. Kulle asked Tal Rasha whether he was certain of this path three times\u2014once when Tyrael first led them through the subterranean tunnels, once when they began to shape the binding stones and forge the chains, and a third time after the work was finished. Tal Rasha answered that he was\u2014better in his mind that he should suffer rather than the millions who would if Baal was allowed to run rampant.\nTal Rasha uttered a prayer to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; as the manacles were closed around his wrists. When he opened his eyes again, Tyrael was there, holding the soulstone. Tal Rasha told him he was ready.\nAs the Mages looked on in sorrow, Tyrael jammed the soulstone shard into Tal Rasha's heart, sealing his fate. The pain was excruciating, and part of him wanted to call out for the others to help him. He bit his tongue until his mouth was full of blood, his body shaking and rattling in chains, the presence of Baal already affecting him. Already, he could feel Baal pushing at his mind and body, scouring for weaknesses and shaking the foundations of his soul. Sorrowfully, the Horadrim sealed the chamber and departed.\nDueling with the Demon.\nOver the centuries, Tal Rasha was left to wrestle with Baal's spirit. Legends of his tomb spread. &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt; was able to find and record its location.\nTal Rasha's physical form began to wither away as hunger and thirst took their toll. He was left a hairsbreadth shy of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, and his deteriorating body was no longer entirely his. Baal, controlling Tal Rasha's body, struggled to escape, but could not break free of the bonds.\nTo break Tal Rasha's mind, Baal kept showing him the moment where he and Kulle had bound him to the soulstone fragment, but subtly reworked it, introducing shades of doubt and fear to make Tal Rasha doubt himself. Always, Tal Rasha saw through the illusion, but each time, it took him a little longer to realize that it was falsehood. In Tal Rasha's mind, Baal mocked him, telling Tal Rasha that his mind was crumbling, and that eventually, it would be reduced to ash, and the Lord of Destruction freed. Deep down, Tal Rasha knew this was true. Only a few years had passed since his imprisonment, and what were a few years compared to the eternity that awaited him? Baal promised to break Tal Rasha down bit by bit. Over the years, Baal kept playing the same vision over and over, always with new falsehoods to make Tal Rasha doubt his own memory, and while the Mage was able to see through them, it took him a little longer to see through Baal's lies each time.\nBaal created a new vision within Tal Rasha's mind. Here, Tal Rasha had sacrificed himself to contain Baal, but his life had been returned to him, and having returned to the Horadrim, he had dedicated himself to a monastic life of contemplation and wisdom. In the vision, Tal Rasha wrote an account of his sacrifice, but after removing the quill, he saw that the words on the parchment were not the same words he had written. The words stated that Tal Rasha had become a shadow of his former self. Soon, his mind would be gone, and his body subject to Baal's will. In horror, Tal Rasha saw his hand had turned dark red, clawed, and scaly, his face transforming likewise. In the vision, he called for help, and heard Kulle's voice from outside the door. Kulle explained that Tal Rasha would be contained until the Horadrim knew they could trust him again, but until that happened, Tal Rasha would be left to record his history and slide it under the door.\nTal Rasha continued to write, believing himself to be a demon, but has his mind wandered, he continued to doodle, and when he looked at what he had drawn, he saw his human face looking back at him. The vision began to fade, and he realized that the candelight in his cell was the flickering light that illuminated his tomb. Tal Rasha told Baal that he had again failed to break him. Baal called him a fool and a waste of time.\nThe years passed, and Tal Rasha lost track of them. Decades, centuries, he could no longer tell how long he had been in the tomb, nor did he know how much longer he could endure Baal's mental assaults. Baal became more inventive, manipulating and pushing Tal Rasha's mind more and more effectively, making him more malleable. With every vision, Baal was able to tell what element had affected Tal Rasha the most, and was able to tailor the next vision accordingly.\nAt some point, Tal Rasha realized one of his hands was no longer restrained, that the chain that bound it had become loose. He was tempted to tug it out, to allow himself to die, but he was resolved to keeping Baal contained as long as possible. He knew that if Baal realized that the hand had come free, the Lord of Destruction would wrest control of Tal Rasha's own hand, tug the soulstone shard free, and release himself. Despair welled in Tal Rasha as he wondered how long he could keep this a secret. Baal, for his part, could tell that Tal Rasha was trying not to think of something, but couldn't identify it. He pushed his way through Tal Rasha's mind.\nIn this, Baal walked into the mental trap Tal Rasha had set for him, as Baal believed he was freeing himself by using Tal Rasha's free hand to remove the soulstone, but instead, was only doing so in the mental vision Tal Rasha had conjured for the demon. In the vision, Baal was freed once the shard was removed, and sought to exit the tomb. He threw open the doors, but found himself back in the same tomb. He opened the doors again, found himself outside, only to be assaulted by a horde of &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Bovine\"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt;. Rattled, Baal entered the mirror image of the tomb, where he made his way back to Tal Rasha, realizing that the Mage had tricked him. Despite his perpetual agony, Tal Rasha smiled, having briefly turned the tables on the demon, even if, in reality, the entire ordeal had only lasted a few moments. In so doing, he had preserved a tiny piece of himself.\nBut then within him, Baal raged. His smile extinguished, and Tal Rasha began to scream.\nThe Release of Destruction.\nThe Tomb of Tal Rasha was eventually found by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; who, under the guise of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, sought to free Baal. By this time Tal Rasha's essence had been consumed by Baal, which also gave the Lord of Destruction insight into Horadric knowledge. As the Wanderer, Diablo entered the tomb, but was confronted by Tyrael. As the two battled, Baal called out to the Wanderer's companion, &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;, begging him to release him. Marius was compelled to do so, and plucked the soulstone from Tal Rasha's chest. This freed Baal, who now had control of Tal Rasha's body. By the time Baal reached &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, no trace of Tal Rasha's physical form remained, and his physical form was destroyed as per the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nHorazon considered Tal Rasha to perhaps be foremost among the Horadrim.\nSupposedly, Tal Rasha penned some memoirs, but if so, they were lost. The &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anajinn\"&gt;Anajinn&lt;/a&gt; searched for them.\nA &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Iridescent%20Loop\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; once owned by Tal Rasha was recovered in the sands outside &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. The discoverer was unware of its true value and sold it to &lt;a href=\"Rakhaan\"&gt;Rakhaan&lt;/a&gt; for a meager handful of coins.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\n&lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Wrappings\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Wrappings&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"item%20set\"&gt;item set&lt;/a&gt; that can be obtained in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mummy\"&gt;Greater Mummies&lt;/a&gt; and their variations can be heard uttering \"Tal Rasha.\"\nDiablo Immortal.\nTal Rasha appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" in the \"&lt;a href=\"Destruction%27s%20End\"&gt;Destruction's End&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". He is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; that players fight alongside as they relive the defeat of Baal during the Dark Exile.\nTal Rasha plays an active role during the second Baal fight.

One of the &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; recipes, Archive of Tal Rasha, is named after him.\n&lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 14 features Tal Rasha-themed portraits.\nDiablo IV.\n&lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Iridescent%20Loop\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Iridescent Loop&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"malignant%20ring\"&gt;malignant ring&lt;/a&gt; available in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nTal Rasha dedicated his life to justice and the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. He had a strong sense of justice, and possessed a virtuous streak; his memory duplicate claimed that Tal Rasha never once lied to anyone who deserved honesty. He had a suspicion of those in power, noting \"if a king's subjects starve, he is no king, and that anyone who wielded power should be accompanied by moral fortitude. He noted that \"realms with fewer aristocrats have fewer demons.\"\nDespite his magical power, Tal Rasha was likewise humble on this front. He noted that for all of magic's power, not everyone could wield it, while something as simple as bread was vital to everyone. He considered the other Horadrim to be his superiors in virtue and wisdom.\nDespite this, Tal Rasha's apparent virtue was not always welcomed. &lt;a href=\"Fara\"&gt;Fara&lt;/a&gt; espoused the opinion that his act of attempting to seal Baal was selfless, but perhaps foolhardy; a similar opinion was shared by Zoltun Kulle, who was exasperated by Tal Rasha's stubborness and naievete. He considered Tal Rasha a \"selfless, noble fool,\" and noted that he never questioned Tyrael's directions. He did however, concede that Tal Rasha's leadership had held the Horadrim together. &lt;a href=\"Caldesann\"&gt;Caldesann&lt;/a&gt; was similarly disdainful, calling Tal Rasha \"a mushroom,\" but conceded that Tal Rasha was at least tough.\nTal Rasha clothed himself in garments of subtlety and power, like the rest of the Horadrim, but to a greater extent.\nAbilities.\nTal Rasha was one of the most powerful Mages that ever lived; even by his own humble admission, Tal Rasha considered his power to be equal to that of the Horadrim (an understatement, all things considered). He had the ability to teleport, could generate shields, and was powerful enough to even hold his own against Baal in single combat."}

However, the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadric mage&lt;/a&gt; Tal Rasha selflessly volunteered to serve as the soulstone's extension; he would bond with the demon before being stabbed with the remaining shard of the soulstone, hoping to use his body as an extension of the soulstone Baal had fragmented. The soulstone acted as a lock that prevented Baal from leaving the Binding Stone.\nTal Rasha's body was set upon the Binding Stone inscribed with magical runes that no mortal could decipher. His spirit was left to wrestle with Baal's for all eternity. Eventually, Baal gained the upper hand, but could not free himself from the Binding Stone as he was too weak and first required the soulstone in his chest to be removed.\nIn-Game.\nAfter entering the zone, players are immediately beset by &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;Act Boss&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt; spell is restricted in this zone: It can be used to teleport around the two individual rooms, but not through the wall leading to the inner chamber in either direction, even after Duriel is killed.\nAfter the player defeats him, the chamber opens up and the player can further explore &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Chamber&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; is present near the &lt;a href=\"Binding%20Stone\"&gt;Binding Stone&lt;/a&gt; and will open a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; after being spoken to. There is no sign of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, however.\nThough there are no additional monsters in the Chamber, the area is littered with large, black caterpillar-like insects. Walking over them produces a sickening crushing sound.\nYou cannot exit the chamber through the entrance. You can only get out by using a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; or Tyrael's portal.\nTrivia.\nA pair of murals, unique to this zone, are on either side of the entrance to the inner chamber. They depict a man in chains with a pointed red stone above him and blood dripping from his body. This illustrates the binding of Tal Rasha and the imprisonment of Baal within him using the Binding Stone and the shattered soulstone, though Baal's soulstone is yellow while Diablo's is red."}

This set can only drop at &lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; difficulty.\nPieces.\nThe set consists of seven pieces, six of which are required to complete the set. Only the source is a Wizard-specific item.\nSet Bonus:\nThe first bonus only triggers from attacks that hit enemies (not objects), hitting the location of the damaged enemy. If any solid impassable obstacles are between the Wizard and the target, the closest visible location will be blasted. These free Meteors fully benefit from all enhancements (including &lt;a href=\"Nilfur%27s%20Boast\"&gt;Nilfur's Boast&lt;/a&gt;), skill rune depends on the damage type that caused it: Star Pact (Arcane), Molten Impact (Fire), Thunder Crash (Lightning) or Comet (Cold). Note that Star Pact meteor will not benefit from current &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power\"&gt;Arcane Power&lt;/a&gt;, and will not consume any of it. Interestingly, , even though it deals no damage, will summon the Cold version of the Meteor when it hits an enemy. In return, many item special effects (like that of ) will \"not\" trigger Meteors.\nThe second bonus triggers every time the Wizard attacks (even if they don't hit anything), each damage type adding one stack with independent duration (only being refreshed by subsequent hits of same &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage\"&gt;elemental damage&lt;/a&gt; type). The 25% resistance bonus is not multiplicative to other similar modifiers. Each resistance bonus stack has a separate duration, and landing hits with multiple damage types does not prolong the others. Being \"hit\" by enemy attack gives no bonus to resistance.\nThe final bonus is especially deadly when coupled with &lt;a href=\"Convention%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Convention of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Exposure\"&gt;Elemental Exposure&lt;/a&gt;. Damaging hits do not refresh the duration of stacks other than their own damage type, and only different damage types add new stacks, to a maximum of four at a time (one per damage type). Damage increase is multiplicative to other modifiers. At 4 stacks, any attack of elemental damage type \"different from that of the previous cast\" will add 2 seconds to the remaining duration of \"all stacks\", up to their original duration of 8 seconds, therefore one needs to quickly alternate between different spells to keep the buff up and running.\nFor both second and third set bonuses, one stack is given per cast, not per enemy hit, even if the cast did not hit anything. Meteors from the first bonus will not count as attacks: they are considered parts of the casts that summon them. Damage that occurs passively or semi-passively without actual casts will also be ignored: one must actually cast a spell for it to benefit from these set bonuses.\nDevelopment.\nPrior to 2.4, the second bonus would instead increase the Wizard's resistance to the element of the attack they used. Considering that Wizards only use 4 damage types, &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; not included, its usage was, at best, situational."}

The only key to unlock Tal Rasha's Chamber would require the possession of Horadric Staves, which they guarded fiercely. In order to further confuse any would be adventurer, the Horadrim placed the tomb amongst six False Tombs.\nIn game.\nThe Tomb appears as the generic desert dungeon in &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Tomb can be seen in the third &lt;a href=\"cinematic\"&gt;cinematic&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;.

At a young age, Talic had already mastered several of the Barbarian skills. He grew up hearing legends of Mount Arreat, even though the &lt;a href=\"Kae%20Huron\"&gt;Kae Huron&lt;/a&gt; mountain range wasn't even visible from the waters he grew around. At some point he took a wife, who gave birth to his child.\nAt the age of 19, there was a knock on Talic's door; it was the town elder and an old woman. They entered as his wife and young child sat at the table. The woman was introduced as , the seer for &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;. She came to bestow upon Talic the ultimate task of protecting the sacred gates to Mt. Arreat. His reward for accepting such service would be eternity atop the mountain. While it was an honor beyond comprehension to be chosen for such a role, he would never be able to return home, nor see any of his family again. Talic rose from his chair, standing a head taller than the seer, and told her fiercely, \"I won't go.\" He had refused. He told the seer to choose another. Kala looked at him and said the choice was not hers to make. The &lt;a href=\"Ancients\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt; had spoken to her of a young warrior in the West named Talic. That was who they wanted, that was who they chose. Talic stared long at the seer. Then, finally, he nodded slowly in agreement, turned to his wife and child, kissed them goodbye, and journeyed to Mt. Arreat.\nWhile in training, Talic provided instruction to &lt;a href=\"Madawc\"&gt;Madawc&lt;/a&gt;, instructing him on how to use his fury to his advantage.\nVigil's End.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; launched his assault on Mount Arreat, he was able to bypass the Ancients due to a relic provided to him by the traitor &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; that pursued the Lord of Destruction weren't so lucky, and thus had to defeat Talic and his &lt;a href=\"Madawc\"&gt;fellow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Korlic\"&gt;guardians&lt;/a&gt;. The Ancients were bested, and thus endowed the heroes with increased power, warning them that Baal was already inside, threatening the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, and that only the heroes could stop him. Talic died, either in the battle, or as a result of the destruction of Mount Arreat.\nLegacy.\nTwenty years after his death, Talic's scabbard was recovered by the armorsmith &lt;a href=\"Vendel\"&gt;Vendel&lt;/a&gt;. The scabbard was stolen by a &lt;a href=\"Scavenger\"&gt;Scavenger&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; was able to recover it and return it to the smith.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nTalic is one of a trio of &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt; that the player must defeat at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Passage\"&gt;Rite of Passage&lt;/a&gt; quest in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". His attacks mainly focus on the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; skill of the Barbarian, constantly moving in a destructive frenzy. He also focuses on &lt;a href=\"Concentrate\"&gt;Concentrate&lt;/a&gt;, a more focused and deadly attack. This makes him quite hard to target with missile weapons or skills due to the speed at which he moves. As such, it is best to counter with area-of-effect skills to damage him while he performs Whirlwind. He is usually the second to be defeated, after the much easier Madawc.\nDevelopment.\nTalic has an unused blue color palette due to his lack of palshift.dat file.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Talic and his fellow Ancients can be summoned by the 's &lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Call of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; ancients ability. His scabbard can be found in &lt;a href=\"The%20Scavenged%20Scabbard\"&gt;The Scavenged Scabbard&lt;/a&gt; event.\nDiablo IV.\nTalic is mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" in the flavor text of &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Red%20Fervor\"&gt;Ring of Red Fervor&lt;/a&gt;.

He is suspicious and hard-hearted, focused on the port's trade prospects more than anything else.\nBiography.\nAs a young man, was earnest and grew up in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; as part of its nobility. During a high banquet, Talva publicly admonished &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Brownrigge\"&gt;Lady Brownrigge&lt;/a&gt; on the poor state of Port Justinian. He admonished her for devoting her farmland to winemaking while her crofters drank filthy water. His earnest appeal \"moved\" &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt;,who appointed Talva as the next magistrate of the port. This decision annoyed the nobility, and earned him the moniker \"Silvertongue\".\nUnfortunately, he arrived to a failing port beset by threats of &lt;a href=\"Crimsonblade\"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fetish\"&gt;fetish&lt;/a&gt;es and the occasional &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Namari\"&gt;nearby ruins&lt;/a&gt;. This made him to be bitter towards King Justinian and the nobility of Westmarch, claiming that his actions at the high banquet were a once-in-a-lifetime mistake.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, he was approached by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;an adventurer/group of adventurers&lt;/a&gt;, who were searching for the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Namari\"&gt;Temple of Namari&lt;/a&gt;. Concluding (incorrectly) that they were working with &lt;a href=\"Jin\"&gt;Jin&lt;/a&gt;, he told them how to find the temple, but commented that the swamp would likely kill them before they got there.\nLater, Port Justinian was attacked by a horde of &lt;a href=\"Fetish\"&gt;Fetish&lt;/a&gt;. The same hero(es) that Silvertongue had encountered earlier saved him from the &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s. Getting down to it, he asked what they wanted in return. They answered with information on three beacons that had been taken from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Namari\"&gt;Temple of Namari&lt;/a&gt;. He told them that one beacon had been purchased by an explorer years ago, but that he'd never made it off the island. The other was in a village to the east. On that note, he suggested that they talk to &lt;a href=\"Cadeus\"&gt;Cadeus&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, a portal spewing out &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s appeared near the eastern entrance to the port. The adventurer(s) arrived to warn that the skeletons were just an advance force, and that the real army was on the way. Talva complained about how they always seem to arrive with monsters, but evacuated the area and put a blockade on the path. The adventurer(s) were able to save the day and Talva, while thankful, advised them to seek better investment elsewhere.\nSince the attack that ruined the port, Westmarch City Westmarch reduced the provisions sent to the port. Things became more dire in the port, and food was hardly enough. Talva began to exile people who didn't contribute,or disrupt the operations of the port.\nTalva had to borrow from the &lt;a href=\"Crimsonblade\"&gt;Crimsonblade&lt;/a&gt; to keep the port afloat. He hoped to be able to repay from exporting wine extracted from the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Grapes\"&gt;Swamp Grapes&lt;/a&gt; he planted the previous spring. Unfortunately, the Crimsonblade asked for their money before enough wine was produced to be exported.\nIn-game.\nTalva appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" in Port Justinian. He features during the \"&lt;a href=\"Welcome%20to%20the%20Jungle\"&gt;Welcome to the Jungle&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Raid\"&gt;Blazing Raid&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s."}

He planned to go back and raid Veszta's house for treasure; as she was regularly given gifts in the form of jewelry by &lt;a href=\"Eperke\"&gt;Eperke&lt;/a&gt;; the village's jeweler. The only problem was that the village was now infested with khazra.\nIn order to combat this problem, he needed an experienced adventurer to guard him. Posing as a mourning fiance, he tricked &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;a passing adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to escort him to the village. They were able to reach Veszta's house, after clearing the area of khazra.\nAfter searching the house they found out that the cellar was buried under rubble, therefore had been untouched by khazra. With his goal in hand, he prepared to search the cellar, which doubled as Veszta's grave, for any loot.\nUnfortunately, the cellar was haunted by Veszta's spirit, which then attacked him. Fortunately, the adventurer was able to drive the wraith away. After that, the adventurer took Veszta's ring from Tarkal and returned it to her cellar, which caused her to pass on in peace.\nIn-game.\nTarkal introduces the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal%20Side%20Quests\"&gt;side quest&lt;/a&gt;; \"&lt;a href=\"More%20Than%20Love\"&gt;More Than Love&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

There she met &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; on a quest to enter the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Unformed Land&lt;/a&gt; in order to stop a &lt;a href=\"Dravec\"&gt;fallen monk&lt;/a&gt; from giving a &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; shard to &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;a demon&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe sent them to retrieve the Iceburn Tear, which would help her \"reduce the bite of the fangs of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.\" With the help of the stone, she was able to transport the hero(es) to the Unformed Land.\nAfter the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Souls\"&gt;Twin Souls&lt;/a&gt;, she promised to follow the hero(es) into the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Realm of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; after she settled some issues.\nRealm of Damnation.\nAfter settling her issues, Tassi journeyed into the Realm of Damnation. There, she was caught unaware by the population of demons in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; and was surrounded. Luckily for her, she was saved by the hero(es) who were alerted to her plight by &lt;a href=\"Kyrel\"&gt;Kyrel&lt;/a&gt; Because of that incident, Tassi began looking for better ways to kill demons en masse.\nLater on, she was saved by the hero(es) and &lt;a href=\"Idahir\"&gt;Idahir&lt;/a&gt; from possession by a demonic skull. Since she was not able to find a sustainable method of killing demons en masse, she devised a way to use the &lt;a href=\"Iceburn%20Tear\"&gt;Iceburn Tear&lt;/a&gt; to freeze demons from within.\nDuring her time in the Realm of Damnation, she noticed Hell Portals opening in the realm, from which demons exited, praising the name \"&lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;.\" While she didn't know what the name meant, she wrote to the Shard-seeker, advising that they should close the portals before this \"Azmodan\" arrived.\nThe Unmaking.\nC. &lt;a href=\"timeline%231274\"&gt;1274&lt;/a&gt;, Tassi had left the Realm of Damnation, and was at Bitter Hearth when &lt;a href=\"the%20Unmaking\"&gt;the Unmaking&lt;/a&gt; began. She followed the other defenders to fight against the hordes of demons.\nIn-game.\nTassi appears during the Frozen Tundra questline in \"Diablo Immortal\".

Seeking a state of total purity, Anu cast all evil from itself. However, these elements could not exist in a state of separation, and coalesced to form a new being: Tathamet, a seven-headed dragon that was the sum total of all Evil. Though separate entities, Anu and Tathamet were bound within the Pearl that contained them. There they warred against each other in an unending battle for ages uncounted.\nThe Birth of Hell.\nTathamet, along with Anu, died in the final battle they had against each other. Tathamet's blackened, smoldering husk spiraled into the lower darkness of reality. From his putrid flesh arose the realms of the Burning Hells, and the race of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s that arose from them like maggots from a corpse. Additionally his seven heads spawned the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;. The strongest of his maws gave birth to the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, while the four lesser heads gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragon Reborn.\nUncounted ages later, Tathamet, in some sense, returned to the face of Creation. &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Terror, was able to combine the essences of the other six Evils into his own body, becoming a singular Prime Evil. While he was defeated by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and his spirit returned to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo remained a singular Prime Evil and, through the destruction of the stone at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, was released into Creation once more. Eventually however, the other Evils were able to separate themselves from Diablo."}

He can often ascertain what emotional weakness might allow the barbarian to goad an opponent into a fight. A Barbarian taunting an opponent into a blind rage hopes to capitalize on the mistakes enemies may make while so angered. It is this ability that causes Barbarians to have a poor reputation as drinking partners. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nWhen activated, Taunt forces the surrounding monsters to immediately attack the Barbarian in melee, ignoring all other targets and priorities. Even if the monsters have ranged attacks or spells, they instead try to approach the Barbarian in close combat and attack with their basic melee blows while under the influence of Taunt.\nWhile it may not seem potentially useful when playing solo (with mobs naturally being hostile anyway), Taunt also decreases the attacker's &lt;a href=\"attack%20rating\"&gt;attack rating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. This can also be useful with more than one person in game; using this, a Barbarian can force enemies to attack him and no one else, allowing &lt;a href=\"hirelings\"&gt;hirelings&lt;/a&gt; or casters like the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; to make their moves freely and from relative safety.\u00a0\nThe Barbarian can also use this skill to lure each monster out of their group for easier killing, such as with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, it can be used to prevent fleeing enemies from escape.\nTaunt does not\u00a0work on other players in PvP, as well as &lt;a href=\"Berserker\"&gt;Berserker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Possessed\"&gt;Possessed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fanatic\"&gt;Fanatic&lt;/a&gt;, or other creatures immune to &lt;a href=\"Terror\"&gt;Terror&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Confuse\"&gt;Confuse&lt;/a&gt;, nor &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monster\"&gt;Super Unique Monster&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Champions\"&gt;Champions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Mage\"&gt;Oblivion Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Putrid%20Defiler\"&gt;Putrid Defiler&lt;/a&gt;s are also immune to effects of Taunt.\nIt also does not stack with other effects that alter the monsters' behavior, like the mentioned &lt;a href=\"Curses\"&gt;Curses&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 3"}

The general idea is\u00a0\"forcing\u00a0\"the enemy to attack the designated target, usually the caster, for a short time.\nWhile this effect may seem unimportant and even useless (if not suicidal), it is actually vital for crowd control in groups of two or more players. Barbarians and Crusaders are generally much tougher than other classes, and can easily take several hits without much risk, while giving their glass-cannon allies time to safely attack from distance, without distractions and interruptions. In addition, Taunt also forces the target to remain in melee combat, effectively preventing the enemy from escaping.\nTaunt is especially effective against ranged attackers, for they are forced to engage in melee combat too.\nObviously, this effect does not work on players. In Diablo II, &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;Elite Monsters&lt;/a&gt; are immune to Taunt. In Diablo III, however, Taunt affects Elites normally. In both games, &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; are immune to Taunt.\nIn single player game, Taunt can be used to get the enemy attention away from &lt;a href=\"hireling\"&gt;hireling&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;s (or, on the contrary, away from the player and towards Kormac the Templar), while preventing fast enemies from retreating.\nA Taunted enemy will immediately stop all current actions, reset its targeting priorities and attack the designated target as it can. While the effect lasts, the enemy may not switch to another target, unless the Taunt effect is overridden by another Taunt. The enemy will try to approach the target in melee range, if possible (and if they have any melee weapons at all). However, Taunt does not prevent the enemy from using special abilities and ranged attacks, though these will always be directed at the target if possible.\nThere is also a\u00a0Lure\u00a0effect of similar functionality, as it forces the enemy to move to targeted location, ignoring other priorities. This is considered Taunt as well, although it is mostly used to force the enemy to move into the area of effect damage location, or a trap.\nCrowd Control resistance reduces the duration of subsequent Taunts and Lures.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", taunt works by planting a totem or creating a clone/illusion that monsters are forced to attack. It is used in sy legendary variants of , , and skills."}

Some left Blizzard, some were transferred to work on \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" or the nascent \"Overwatch\", and some remained to work on patches for \"Diablo III\" while planning \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".

People would arrive at work, play \"Diablo III\", have lunch, head home, etc. As some of the \"Summer Camp\" team moved to the Hades team, the pressure grew on Mosqueira to make decisions so they'd have something to do. However, Mosqueira became harder to track down, coming in to the office only two or three days a week, which hampered some of the designers\u2019 progress as they waited for feedback.\nIn December, 2014, members of Team 3 provided consultation with Bungie on the development of \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.destinypedia.com/The_Taken_King\"&gt;The Taken King&lt;/a&gt;\", as Activision had noticed similar complaints leveled at \"Destiny\" as the original version of \"Diablo III\".\nProject Hades was cancelled in 2016, leading to another split in Team 3. One group began work on \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Necromancer\"&gt;Rise of the Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;\", while the other began work on \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".

It is powerful in the initial stages of the game but quickly loses effectiveness. Though each hit may not do much, there are lots of them, and the number of missiles increases with skill level.\nFew Teeth, if any, will hit from a long range, and only a single projectile per cast can strike the same enemy (so it cannot be used to inflict more damage at point blank), but Teeth can be a very effective PvP skill if used wisely, since it's almost certain to hit the target at high levels.\nIf given enough synergy and skill points, this skill can be used as effective crowd-control, due to the temporary stopping effect when the teeth hit, wide coverage and range. With good casting speed and highly invested synergies (quite applicable as &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spear\"&gt;Bone Spear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spirit\"&gt;Bone Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s also benefit from them), the skill can last well until Hell.\nDiablo III.\nIn the third game, this skill makes a comeback as a &lt;a href=\"skill%20rune\"&gt;skill rune&lt;/a&gt; for ."}

They can hit foes to the left and right, but not behind the caster. One bolt will always hit the designated cast point or foe.\nIt will hit every monster in a straight line until finishing its course on a solid wall. At higher levels, it is quite damaging and the automatic-targeting range is expanded, launching a stream of lightning towards nearly every enemy in the vicinity.\nThis spell is, effectively, the one that can deal the most damage per cast. Range is calculated without regard for walls or other obstacles, and range increases with more points in the spell, as does the damage per bolt. The game's engine will only display 255 sprites at once, and since each bolt from the Chain Lightning creates quite a few sprites, numerous \"gaps\" appear in the bolts. As a result, some strategy is required to use Chain Lightning effectively.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Infravision\"&gt;Infravision&lt;/a&gt;, players might know where the monsters are around them, whether they are on the other side of a wall or not. If yes, one should stand against that wall (so that bolts do not target enemies they cannot hit).\nThe damage from each bolt is calculated multiple times per bolt, as they appear to move past. Each bolt does a hit check each 0.05 seconds, for a total of [Spell Level/2] + 6 times per bolt. Damage is not &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;able.\nDamage Calculation:"}

Although Chain Lightning may not be the most damaging of spells (compared to other synergizing spells such as or ), and the inconsistency of its damage can be frustrating, Chain Lightning has the advantage of a significantly lower &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; cost, as well as the speed with which the spell does its damage.\nThe CL Sorceress will obviously max out Chain Lightning. However, she has a choice of three other synergies: Charged Bolt, Lightning, and Nova, all of which give +4% more damage to Chain Lightning. There is also &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Mastery\"&gt;Lightning Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, which when maxed, will give an amazing 278% bonus to all &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spells\"&gt;Lightning Spells&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on which of these skills a CL Sorceress decides to max, she can do one of two things:\nEither way, she will benefit from +Lightning Skill damage equipment like &lt;a href=\"Eschuta%27s%20Temper\"&gt;Eschuta's Temper&lt;/a&gt;, or equipment that lowers the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Resist\"&gt;Lightning Resist&lt;/a&gt; of enemies.\nAs a lightning sorceress, your mercenary will likely be your best friend- if you set him up right. The primary reason lightning sorceresses are so powerful is because they can do ungodly amounts of damage in less than a second (a good bolt of Lightning can do higher than 50,000 per shot with the right gear and build) and that they can have virtually no monsters resistant to them. Your key here is an \" runeword Polearm class weapon\" equipped to your \"mercenary\". Infinity automatically runs Conviction (a Paladin aura that drops resistances significantly- nearly always breaking immunity past level 10), so your mercenary will make all your enemies (or at least most, some Super Unique monster might still be immune) as defenseless as a Normal level Carver in Act I. With an Infinity, as long as you do a few thousand damage per hit of Lightning or Chain Lightning, you'll be able to kill just about anything, even in Hell mode.\nIf you can't afford more skill-boosting gear (like Lightning Skill Grand Charms (Sparking prefix), try to get items with FCR (Faster Cast Rate), so that you increase your amount of shots over time, effectively increasing your net damage."}
