The chalice contains living light that can never be depleted, and allows its user to see things with flawless objectivity. By peering into its depths, Malthael could see the web of connectivity that binds all things as one.\nIt is said that Malthael stared into the chalice for years on end while in the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Pools of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, his quarter of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; believed that it was from these pools that Malthael drew from to fill the chalice.\nAfter the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, Malthael departed from Heaven, though he left Chalad'ar behind. After taking on the Aspect of Wisdom, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; entered the realm to take Chalad'ar into his care. However, the chalice was not forged for a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; mind, and Tyrael continued to struggle to tame his energies. Sometimes, the chalice awoke the raw power of his mortal emotions, throwing him into states of confusion, fear, and anger. Other times, an icy cold surrounded him, chilling his body. Tyrael found himself transfixed by the inevitability of his own mortality and of the &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; that awaits all things. However, at other times, Tyrael was able to derive positive effects from the chalice. At times, it imbued his mind and body with a profound sense of confidence, power, and euphoria, and allowed him to appreciate the connectivity of all things.\nThrough use of the Chalad'ar, Tyrael was able to face the truth of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, that as long as it remained in the care of the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;, it would bring about the downfall of both &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Only humanity could be trusted to safeguard the stone, he concluded. It was a conclusion he later reflected was obvious, but he had hidden from the truth, only for Chalad'ar to painfully strip away his delusion. Such is the price of wisdom, he reflected."}

It went through four iterations with many prototypes of possible , spanning from before the game was released and continuing through the development of \"\". It ultimately led to &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Chest\"&gt;Cursed Chest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Shrines\"&gt;Cursed Shrines&lt;/a&gt;, and several other concepts from its various versions ended up in other gameplay features.\nThe information about Challenge Mode's development was shared with the public primarily from the \"&lt;a href=\"Evolution%20of%20Cursed%20Events\"&gt;Evolution of Cursed Events&lt;/a&gt;\" talk by Senior Developer &lt;a href=\"Zaven%20Haroutunian\"&gt;Zaven Haroutunian&lt;/a&gt; in connection with &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; 2016.\nOverview.\nChallenge Mode had shifting goals and styles as \"Diablo III\" went through different phases of development. Part of its purpose was to explore the boundaries of what is possible and fun beyond standard Diablo gameplay, without an exact plan in mind.\nThe original idea for Challenge Mode formed before the game's release. Dubbed \"Challenge Mode 1.0,\" the goal was to deliver more content using existing assets. Events such as &lt;a href=\"Caravan%20Defense\"&gt;Caravan Defense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Double%20Trouble\"&gt;Double Trouble&lt;/a&gt; were designed for this mode. Several components which did end up in Cursed events were present in these prototypes (particularly Caravan Defense), such as an objective progress bar and waves of attacking enemies. Feedback from within the team was generally positive, but also apathetic \u2014 the events didn't feel special, new, and exciting. Zaven Haroutunian stated \"that wasn't good enough for us\", sending them \"back to the drawing board\".\nAfter \"Diablo III\" had shipped, the mode was redesigned into \"Challenge Mode 2.0\". The goal was now to create unique gameplay developed for the future of the game, taking live player feedback into account. Events for this iteration had more of a \"minigame\" feel, such as &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Defense\"&gt;Goblin Defense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grotesque%20Bowling\"&gt;Grotesque Bowling&lt;/a&gt;. Internal team feedback was again positive, but claimed that these events ignored the core gameplay of \"Diablo\" (i.e. the lack of &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; use and loot). It also wasn't fun when playing without any &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt; in single-player games; Haroutunian called it \"completely boring\".\nWhat followed, dubbed \"Challenge Mode 3.0,\" was a doubling down of the 2.0 concepts, namely the idea of multiplayer-focused PvE challenges as competitive mini-games, with a focus on skill-based gameplay (e.g. target acquisition and evading attacks/hazards). &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Reavers\"&gt;Soul Reavers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barrel%20Breaker\"&gt;Barrel Breaker&lt;/a&gt; are events implemented from this period. This time, feedback was negative, as while the events were fun with friends, it wasn't enjoyable when playing with strangers via matchmaking. The gameplay often became an \"AoE fest\", winning felt random, and the classes were unbalanced for the types of events being produced, so it did not feel like a fair test of skill.\nIt was noted that \"Challenge Mode\" had become a misnomer, since it implied it would be a completely new way of playing the game. It was renamed as \"Nephalem Trials,\" with a \"reset\" to pull back on the miningame style and put the focus on cooperative gameplay, with &lt;a href=\"leaderboard\"&gt;leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;s to create competition instead of directly in the event itself. &lt;a href=\"Fleshpit%20Grove\"&gt;Fleshpit Grove&lt;/a&gt; was implemented as an event in this phase of development, bearing a close resemblance to the eventual &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Chest\"&gt;Cursed Chest&lt;/a&gt; event &lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Grove\"&gt;The Cursed Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Reaction was positive, but the idea was not implemented in the final game as distinct challenges with leaderboards due to a lack of competitive depth. While technically cut from the game as a separate Mode, almost all Nephalem Trial events were integrated into &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; in the form of Cursed Chests and &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Shrines\"&gt;Cursed Shrines&lt;/a&gt;."}

Both lava and blood have scorched the cathedral's exterior over the ages. It is an enormous cross-shaped building that resembles a shattered cathedral. Piles of skulls conceal the bottom of the walls, and inside, skulls lie scattered on the floor and are piled in cracks in the walls. Light comes from the glowing lava and from huge torches set in the floor, with &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s chained around them. The Sanctuary is accessible from the River of Flame; statues mark the path. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; wondered if they were the eyes of Diablo himself.\nAfter parting ways with &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; resided in the Chaos Sanctuary.

It is hidden by five seals, and the Sanctuary itself is filled with numerous elite &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. Players should note that the nearest &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; is found in the &lt;a href=\"River%20of%20Flame\"&gt;River of Flame&lt;/a&gt;, which divides the Sanctuary from the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;City of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree of the five seals release a &lt;a href=\"super%20unique%20monster\"&gt;super unique monster&lt;/a&gt; with a group of boosted minions. These are:\nBreaking the last seal while all the super uniques are slain will kill off the rest and summon Diablo.\nPatch 1.10 also granted the Chaos Sanctuary status as a treasure class level 85 drop zone on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, so if one is doing Diablo runs, clearing out the monsters might prove beneficial. Ironically, Diablo himself and the seal monster packs are not TC 85 and thus cannot drop the highest possible treasure class items, The Sanctuary is well known for housing some tough enemies. Before the 1.13c patch, &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knight&lt;/a&gt;s had the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt; curse, giving melee characters a serious disadvantage. In patch 1.13c, the curse was removed from the knights (not just those in the Chaos Sanctuary). Be wary that even without Iron Maiden these knights are strong and may come in a large pack (even in normal difficulty) sometimes composed of 6-8 knights and a group of Abyss knights, don't forget to re-stock potions when needed.\nThis area is also known to hand out one-hit kills even to players with very high health values on Nightmare and Hell difficulties. This may be due to a glitch in the game that allows all of the player's health to be drained to zero with one hit, thus killing the player. This is considered highly annoying, especially on higher difficulty levels where you lose experience points. Bring lots of &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Scroll of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; and cast them before coming into the area again, thus saving the player a long run from the &lt;a href=\"River%20of%20Flame\"&gt;River of Flame&lt;/a&gt; waypoint."}

Core Stats) are a set of values that determine a variety of different statistics that make each character in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Series\"&gt;Diablo Series&lt;/a&gt;. \nEvery time your character gains a level in the first two games, you receive five points to spend on your Character Attributes. In \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" you can also boost your attributes by drinking &lt;a href=\"Elixir\"&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;s. In \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" you are rewarded with 5 attribute points by completing the quest . In later games, base attribute increases happen automatically, and the vast majority of the contribution to attributes comes from &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; or other external bonuses rather than base stats from leveling.\nIn each game, the set of attributes has been redesigned somewhat, particularly between the second and third games. However, most games have included &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;, and a magic-oriented attribute as core stats. Beginning with \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", each class is associated with one or more &lt;a href=\"primary%20stat\"&gt;primary stat&lt;/a&gt;s, core stats that directly benefit them much more than other stats.\nIn addition to the core stats, characters have numerous \"secondary stats\" such as &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Defense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo.\nIn the original \"Diablo\", the attributes were:\nThe damage increase from attributes (also called character damage) is determined by your class and level. It is not affected by the damage on your weapon or by having +% damage modifiers on your weapon. The +50% damage bonus vs. specific monster types depending on your weapon, and the +200% damage to demons bonus on do apply to it.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"Diablo II\", the most notable change was the revamping of the Skill system that led to the replacement of the earlier Magic attribute with the more general Energy attribute.\nRegardless of class, Vitality is often the character's most invested stat; Strength and Dexterity are mostly invested just to reach equipment requirements. Vitality is arguably the most useful stat due to the low base health that characters have, as well as the fact that health is much more effective than armor in terms of staying alive.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", each &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"primary%20stat\"&gt;primary stat&lt;/a&gt;, one of Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence, where increases to that attribute directly increase damage done by the character. Each of those stats also has a secondary effect, some form of damage mitigation, which applies to all classes. The fourth core stat is Vitality, which simply increases &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; and is not a primary stat for any class.\nMost &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; provide bonuses to one primary stat as well as Vitality, although both have a chance to be absent. As a result most characters have a high primary stat and Vitality, while the other two core stats - which are primary stats for other classes but not their own - remain near their starting values. The maximum core stat bonus from an item is 500 for most types of &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;; however, &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"amulets\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gloves\"&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; items (including &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"helms\"&gt;helms&lt;/a&gt; can roll up to 750 of each stat. &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons may roll up to 1125. &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Items\"&gt;Ancient Items&lt;/a&gt; increase these limits further.\nAside from items, &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon Points&lt;/a&gt; and some s can be used to increase core attributes, and some &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Active skills&lt;/a&gt; do so temporarily. &lt;a href=\"Gems\"&gt;Gems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Augment\"&gt;Augment&lt;/a&gt;ation of items can grant even more core stat bonuses.\n\"Diablo III\" characters also have numerous secondary attributes, divided into \"Offensive\", \"Defensive\", \"&lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Resource\"&gt;Resource&lt;/a&gt;s\", and \"Adventuring\" categories. Standard item bonuses modify some of these values directly, while many skills and powers interact with them too.\nPrimary stats on items.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Smart%20Loot\"&gt;Smart Loot&lt;/a&gt; system causes most items that provide a primary stat bonus at all to use the stat of the character it dropped for, rather than other classes' primary stats. \"Off-class\" items still drop, but at much lower frequency. Items never mix stats for different classes, either randomly or by &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nThe original version of had a bonus to \"all core stats\" in addition to the standard primary stat bonus. This made it the only non-Ancient one-handed weapon that could grant as much as 923 to a core stat. It has since been updated to have the standard selection of stat bonuses only.\nDiablo Immortal.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" continues the &lt;a href=\"primary%20stat\"&gt;primary stat&lt;/a&gt; concept of \"Diablo III\", where each character &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; gains damage from a specific stat. This time classes are grouped into only two categories, physical and magical, corresponding to &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time in the franchise, &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; is not a stat, and there are two new stats, &lt;a href=\"Fortitude\"&gt;Fortitude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willpower\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll core attributes are summed for a single total &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Rating\"&gt;Combat Rating&lt;/a&gt;, which is compared to an opponent's rating to determine damage scaling. The non-primary stats grant secondary benefits to all classes. Typically the primary stat that does not match a character's class will be 0, since it grants no benefits over any other stat, and will not appear frequently on &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; dropped for that character.\nSecondary Stats.\nThe effects of secondary stats usually depends on a core stat, or the opposite secondary stat of an enemy. Items like &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vessels\"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt; provide bonus secondary stats.\nDiablo IV.\nFor the first time in the series, \"Diablo IV\" did not use &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; as a stat, instead using &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; to determine base health, with many bonuses to total Life available. It made &lt;a href=\"Willpower\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"primary%20stat\"&gt;primary stat&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the other three from previous generations. All core stats are now primary stats for at least one class, increasing &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; damage done by that class. Each of them also increases &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; generation for a different set of classes, so that every class has a primary \"and\" a secondary core stat to focus on. Finally, they all increase various secondary attributes for all characters regardless of class.\nTrivia.\nThe three non-Vitality attributes of the first three games (&lt;a href=\"primary%20stat\"&gt;primary stat&lt;/a&gt;s of the third game) correspond to classic RPG archetypes: Fighter (Strength), Rogue/Archer (Dexterity), and Magic User (Magic/Energy/Intelligence). Until \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the franchise did not have a stat matching the final classic archetype, a Cleric or religious magic user. Instead, religious or spiritual characters were divided among the other three types, based on the form of fighting they employed most rather than defining them by their source of power - for example, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s tend to use Strength, s Dexterity, and &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s Intelligence.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" condensed the attribute correspondence down to two archetypes, physical (Strength) and magical (Intelligence). \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" then expanded to finally include a form of the fourth archetypal stat, &lt;a href=\"Willpower\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt;, the primary stat for s."}

Unlike its predecessor, upon leveling up in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", players receive one or more of the following:\nAt level 70, one always gains access to \"all\" skills and runes, and the skill set may be changed at any time, so characters are never at risk of leveling improperly.\nIn addition, with each level gained, a player's hero's primary stat grows by +3, their Vitality by +2, and all other stats gain +1. Also, item &lt;a href=\"requirements\"&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; are tied to character level very closely.\nWhen leveling up near monsters, at first one sees a yellow light enveloping their character, healing them to full, and then when it dissipates, all nearby monsters explode into pieces. The maximum level in Diablo III is 60 for classic players, while its &lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls%20%28game%29\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; increases that cap to 70.\nLevel requirement of an item may be reduced by up to 40 by an appropriate secondary affix. &lt;a href=\"Gem%20of%20Ease\"&gt;Gem of Ease&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to reduce required level on a &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; to 1. &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; can be used to reduce level requirements of an item to 1.\nCharacter level makes all content in game, including &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Items&lt;/a&gt; that drop, scale with the player's own level, so they are always on par with the game. However, if joining the game created by another player, one may actually face foes of different level, as scaling will be performed on the original game creator's character. \nIf desired, a character may use it to perform nearly instant leveling to 70 by joining a game of level 70 characters on high &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. After that, all they need to do is to stay in the same location where fighting is underway, leveling at the speed of light without even moving. To make the process even more hilariously easy, one may equip a weapon with the previously mentioned Gem of Ease.\nDiablo IV.\nThe Character Level in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" goes up to level 100. The &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20Board\"&gt;Paragon Board&lt;/a&gt; unlocks at level 50."}

This is vital in that when all else fails, it is faith that will carry the Paladin through to victory. Warriors of faith never shirk from combat, but rush forward with heads down and shields up, allowing their glory to carry them into the thick of battle to deliver the first blow.\"\nGeneral Information.\nCharge causes the user to rush towards the enemy, quickly closing the gap between them. The force of such a charge is so great that it usually only takes one or two charges to eliminate most enemies, especially if the user has many points in &lt;a href=\"Might\"&gt;Might&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigor\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt; (+1375% weapon damage with all 3 skills maxed out). One major disadvantage is the high mana cost, which can be offset with enough\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Steal\"&gt;Mana Steal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the description says that the attack is a shield bash, a shield is neither required, nor is its damage taken into account if the user has a weapon equipped. One can even use Charge with a &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapon.\nBesides damaging monsters, the Paladin can use this skill at will to rush over to the location clicked on, although this is quite costly in terms of Mana. Charge may be used to flee from fights or to dodge or even outrun\u00a0&lt;a href=\"projectiles\"&gt;projectiles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttempting to use this on an enemy already within melee range causes the user to perform a regular attack instead, but the mana cost for using charge normally still applies.\nIt is possible to use Smite to push melee range enemies far enough that Charge can be used properly against them.\nSpeed.\nCharge defaults to a &lt;a href=\"movement%20speed\"&gt;movement speed&lt;/a&gt; of 9 &lt;a href=\"yards\"&gt;yards&lt;/a&gt; per second. This speed is not modified by Faster &lt;a href=\"Run/Walk\"&gt;Run/Walk&lt;/a&gt; items, but is affected by skills such as &lt;a href=\"Vigor\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as slow effects and armor weight.\nWhile the minimum rate for Run/Walk is limited to 1 y/s, Charge does not have a limitation, therefore, if slowed below 0 y/s, you could Charge in reverse.\nBugs.\nSometimes Charge skill causes the user to become locked in place for extended periods of time. This may be fixed by pressing the \"W\" key to swap weapons.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 9"}

While each Charge-up attack deals normal damage, the charges continue to accumulate until triggered or until the time limit runs out.\n&lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s have Charge-up Skills, but they are more important to the Assassin, as she also has &lt;a href=\"Finishing%20Moves\"&gt;Finishing Moves&lt;/a&gt; which can significantly enhance the effect.\nTo trigger the accumulated charges, strike a monster with either a normal attack or a Finishing Move. Different Charges can stack, meaning that one can maintain charges from multiple skills provided they refresh each stack of charges before they time out. Each finishing attack consumes one charge from every accumulated charge-up skill.\nCharge-up Skills.\nAssassin.\nThe Assassin can mix and match charges, for example:\nYou attack a target twice with a level 13 &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Strike\"&gt;Tiger Strike&lt;/a&gt; gaining two charges, using a Finishing Move now will give you +680% Damage. If you instead attack an enemy with a level 11 &lt;a href=\"Cobra%20Strike\"&gt;Cobra Strike&lt;/a&gt; gaining 1 more charge for the maximum of three, then attack with a Finishing Move you will now gain +680% damage and 90% life stealing.\nDruid.\nPower-up skills of Druids work slightly differently: each charge empowers the skill it uses, making next cast stronger. There's no need to trigger it: the skill simply grows in power when continuously used, stacking up to 5 times, but charges still fade if the skill is not cast within reasonable time. Unlike Assassin's Finishing Moves, Power-Up casts do not \"consume\" charges when used."}

The caster is able to shield himself from the effects of these charges, but any creature - friend or foe - may be struck. Greater understanding of this spell allows more of these Charged Bolts to be formed, and their existence will be maintained for a longer period of time.

They were present since the 1st Diablo game where staffs would have charges of spells.\nThis was continued to a lesser extent in Diablo 2 though it was no longer a standard feature of staffs, and is instead found in rarer items.\nUnlike weapons which give bonuses to the skill (allowing them to be cast using mana) charges do not use mana and instead use the charges on the item.\nIn the 1st Diablo game, the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; could use &lt;a href=\"Staff%20Recharge\"&gt;Staff Recharge&lt;/a&gt; skill to restore current charges at the cost of reducing the maximum charges. Taking staffs to &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; could (at the cost of gold) restore current charges without reducing the maximum. This is the same relationship the warrior's &lt;a href=\"Item%20Repair\"&gt;Item Repair&lt;/a&gt; skill had to paying &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt; to do it.\nIn the 2nd Diablo, since there were no skills to do it, these charges were simply restored in Town as part of the repair cost.\nIn Diablo 2 they are &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Suffix%23Charged%20Items\"&gt;charged item suffix&lt;/a&gt;, certain &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique Items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Naj%27s%20Puzzler\"&gt;Naj's Puzzler&lt;/a&gt; which is the only &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Item&lt;/a&gt; to have charges.\nCharged Items allow the wielder to use a specific skill, regardless of &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;Character Class&lt;/a&gt;, but only a limited number of times.

Shields utilized by player must have a high chance to block, high defense and high resists. Many Paladin-class shields cover all of this, so it should be no problem finding one of these. However, if a player wants extra damage and does not spend much time close up (which he shouldn't, as he is a charger) they should not use a shield and instead use a two handed weapon.\nArmor.\nArmor that give high defense and resistances are optimal for Charger.\nBoots.\nAs with most other melee classes, &lt;a href=\"Gore%20Rider\"&gt;Gore Rider&lt;/a&gt; is a nice choice of boots. But as with most builds, the shoes aren't the most important part of their equipment.\nOther Items.\nAll items that give bonus to life, mana, resists and other needed stuff are worth considering."}

When &lt;a href=\"Lyndon\"&gt;Lyndon&lt;/a&gt; attempted to flirt with Eirena by asking her how did she become so good at 'charming' others, she took his words literally, saying that she practiced this spell times beyond count.\nIn-game.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Conversion\"&gt;Conversion&lt;/a&gt; skill functions similarly to Charm.\nCharm is a &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al effect in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", mostly used by Eirena (as well as &lt;a href=\"Lysa\"&gt;Lysa&lt;/a&gt;). The other notable Charming effects are those of &lt;a href=\"The%20Tormentor\"&gt;The Tormentor&lt;/a&gt; staff, &lt;a href=\"Henri%27s%20Perquisition\"&gt;Henri's Perquisition&lt;/a&gt; mojo and &lt;a href=\"Overwhelming%20Desire\"&gt;Overwhelming Desire&lt;/a&gt; amulet. s can also use it, via &lt;a href=\"skill%20rune\"&gt;skill rune&lt;/a&gt;s of skills like . s can intimidate their foes into submission as well, with &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Resonance\"&gt;Skull of Resonance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Overwhelming Desire amulet causes charmed enemies to take 35% more damage. This effect is not shared by other charms, even if Overwhelming Desire is equipped.\nFor gameplay purposes, Charm makes the affected enemy briefly fight on the caster's side, attacking their foes and unable to perform any offensive actions against the caster (and their allies). If Charmed while there are no other enemies around, the victim will just stand idle or follow the caster. While charmed, the other enemies will see the victim as a hostile target, and the caster's allies may still attack that target at will. Target's special abilities and skills may still be used, and will benefit the caster, or at least bring them no harm. This way, Charm is a more potent effect than &lt;a href=\"Confusion\"&gt;Confusion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; resistance reduces the duration of Charm. &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;es are immune to it.\nUnlike Confusion, Charm could initially affect players as well as monsters. In the released game, it can no longer affect players, even if they somehow manage to put such an effect on another player in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;."}

Her parents managed to hide her in the surrounding wilderness area before they were slaughtered. By chance, members of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; found Charsi and took her into their care. &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; then told Charsi what had happened to her parents.\nShe became a member of the Sisterhood, using her immense physical strength to forge the Order's &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;weaponry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, wielding the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Malus\"&gt;Horadric Malus&lt;/a&gt; to carry out her work.

She believed that her real family was among the tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, she just wanted to get out and explore the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sightless Eye.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt; fell to &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, with many &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Corrupt%20Rogue\"&gt;corrupted and turned&lt;/a&gt; to her side as a result. Charsi, and the other members of the Sisterhood, fled the &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt;. In the chaos of retreat, Charsi left behind the Horadric Malus. She and the survivors established an &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;encampment&lt;/a&gt; in the wilderness of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. She was the youngest survivor of Eastgate. While in the camp, she continued to forge weapons and armor, taking satisfaction in the knowledge that they were helping to end the evil that plagued the land.\nSome newcomers arrived in the camp, among whom was &lt;a href=\"Gheed\"&gt;Gheed&lt;/a&gt;. Charsi liked him, and the stories of adventures that he told to her. She even let him guard her &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore notably, a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the camp, and slew Moreina &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Blood Raven&lt;/a&gt;, who had fallen to Andariel's corruption. Charsi thanked them for putting her former friend to rest. The heroes are also be able to retrieve the Malus from Eastgate, and slay Andariel herself. Charsi wished them all well before they headed east.\nWestmarch.\nAfter the reclamation of Eastgate, Charsi became discontent with her life in the Sisterhood, apparently inspired by the heroes she had aided. She decided to leave the Sisterhood. When she left, &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; gave her an amulet that would open a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;, in case she ever needed to find her way home.\nCharsi became a blacksmith in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Charsi's earlier deeds made her \"a legend,\" and business was good. Adventurers would bring material from the city's &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rift\"&gt;Elder Rift&lt;/a&gt; to her &lt;a href=\"Charsi%27s%20Smithy\"&gt;smithy&lt;/a&gt;, giving her a steady income. She never entered the rift herself, however.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the city, and asked her and &lt;a href=\"Piri\"&gt;Piri&lt;/a&gt; to greet a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; who he was expecting. Charsi was unable to leave her &lt;a href=\"Charsi%27s%20Smithy\"&gt;smithy&lt;/a&gt;, but Piri directed the hero(es) to her. Upon their arrival, Charsi directed them to Cain's workshop, promising that she'd give them a tour of Westmarch later.\nCharsi met the Shard-seeker outside Cain's workshop, learning that they hadn't destroyed the shards. They told her that they were headed for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;, and at their request, Charsi took them to see the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rift\"&gt;Elder Rift&lt;/a&gt;.

The two assisted Vic after he was accousted by some bandits.\nWhile the Shard-seeker was away, the city's was activated. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s entered the Rift and brought materials back to Charsi's smithy.\nThe Shard-seeker returned from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;, and brought the regards of &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt;, much to Charsi's joy. She took them to see the Challenge Rift, and told them to meet her at her smithy when they were done. There, she gave them a belt in thanks for them aiding the Sisterhood.\nLater Events.\nCharsi became aware of the &lt;a href=\"Domain%20of%20Horror\"&gt;Domain of Horror&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Deceiver\"&gt;Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s that lurked within it. She offered a &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; to adventurers to enter the realm, slay the Deceivers, and bring their weapons to her. She hoped that studying them would aid in the fight against Hell. Similarly, she offered payment to those who could deliver her &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Steel%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Ashwold steel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Shard-seeker was away, Charsi met &lt;a href=\"Rayek\"&gt;Rayek&lt;/a&gt;. The two of them built the &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt;. Later, they came to Charsi to obtain some &lt;a href=\"scoria\"&gt;scoria&lt;/a&gt;, in order to reinforce the device. Charsi obliged, giving them the last of her supply.\nCharsi was among the friends that saw Deckard Cain off when he departed from Westmarch in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;.\nC. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231273\"&gt;1273&lt;/a&gt;, Rayek gave Charsi the blueprint for a strange device for her to build for him.\nReign of Enmity.\nCharsi was still alive duri of the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, but she had left Westmarch.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nCharsi is the blacksmith in the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt; in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", and is highly skilled at shaping, crafting and &lt;a href=\"repair\"&gt;repair&lt;/a&gt;ing weapons. During the chaos of the attack by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; on the Rogue Monastery, she was forced to leave her most important forging tool behind, the . Fortunately for her, however, the hero returns the to her after defeating . With it, Charsi will imbue any &lt;a href=\"Normal%20Items\"&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; of the player's choice as a token of thanks.\nCharsi is very good-natured, and described as a \"sweet girl\" and \"young and innocent.\" She is highly accepting of the hero upon his/her entrance to the camp. She has a cheerful tone and is willing to help out a great deal. She shows a certain fondness toward most, even &lt;a href=\"Gheed\"&gt;Gheed&lt;/a&gt;, but feels that &lt;a href=\"Warriv\"&gt;Warriv&lt;/a&gt; is \"too quiet.\"\nHer ancestry is &lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;. She is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;, evidenced when she refers to the Rogues as \"our sisters.\"\nDialogue.\nGossip about Charsi.\nSome of the other locals give their thoughts concerning Charsi.\nDiablo Immortal.\nCharsi is a vendor in Westmarch in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". Players are first introduced her during the \"&lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Request\"&gt;Cain's Request&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;. She later guides players through the city in a series of mini-quests. She will fight the &lt;a href=\"Brigand\"&gt;Brigand&lt;/a&gt;s in the \"&lt;a href=\"Diamond%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;Diamond in the Rough&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, but deals minimal damage.\nShe is the provider of the \"&lt;a href=\"Weapons%20of%20War\"&gt;Weapons of War&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Steel\"&gt;Ashwold Steel&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt;, and introduces players to the &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; in its questline, beginning with the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Helliquary\"&gt;Opening the Helliquary&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nCharsi can refine &lt;a href=\"Scoria\"&gt;Scoria&lt;/a&gt; for the player, converting it into &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Scoria\"&gt;Hellfire Scoria&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nNaive but ebullient, Charsi takes great pride in her work, able to \"fashion any weapon of war.\" She loves hearing stories of adventure. &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; described Charsi as being \"young and innocent,\" but noted that her \"&lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;\" gave her the yearning for adventure and danger. &lt;a href=\"Gheed\"&gt;Gheed&lt;/a&gt; noted that Charsi has no business savvy.\nCharsi is aware of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;, and is committed to the fight against it."}

Clearing a Cursed Shrine with perfect score (all 5 waves) is guaranteed to summon a Radiant Chest.\nDiabolic Hoard.\nKilling any &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; that is a &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; target will summon a Diabolic Hoard chest. These look like much larger Radiant Chests and have a higher guaranteed loot threshold, particularly with more &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiabolic Hoards are also found at the end of a chain of &lt;a href=\"Visions%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Visions of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, \"dropping\" from a special &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt;. It contains a significant amount of loot, scaling with the number of Visions cleared, and including a fairly large number of the crafting materials normally found from &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; reward caches (an equal amount of all five types).\nCursed Chests.\nCursed Chests are red versions of Radiant Chests, which cannot be opened until an is completed to de-curse the chest. The exact type of the event varies, but always involves killing monsters around the chest, often within a time limit. Some more difficult events have the potential to award a bonus chest for completing it fast enough. These events may appear as &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt;, but also occur throughout the world in general.\nMysterious Chest.\nMysterious Chests were added in patch 2.4.1, and may spawn in both &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; instead of any normal chest in a suitable zone (see list below), regardless of difficulty. They have a very low chance to appear (roughly 1%), but if they do, they are guaranteed (PC ONLY) to contain an aesthetic item (a set of Wings or a &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; weapon), one (same) for each player in the party. It is NOT guaranteed to drop one for every party member on console.\nVisually, they look like a normal chest (with the exception of one in &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20Throne\"&gt;Immortal Throne&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like a Resplendent Chest).\nThe item within the chest depends on the zone:"}

It is written in the \"&lt;a href=\"Sc%C3%A9al%20Fada\"&gt;Sc\u00e9al Fada&lt;/a&gt;\" that it was &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fiacla-G%C3%A9ar\"&gt;Fiacla-G\u00e9ar&lt;/a&gt; who agreed that in order to safeguard the Worldstone, their people would have to devote the entirety of their lives to the task. Their ideas on how to best approach the task differed however, and while G\u00e9ar took his &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;, Bul-Kathos gathered the Barbarian tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Tasked with defending the Worldstone, Barbarian culture was built around its defense. To better protect their lands, they adopted a nomadic lifestyle constantly moving around the Northern Steppes and possessing few permanent settlements.\nThe Samuren Empire and Worrusk.\n\"Note that the following events are not necessarily in chronological order.\"\nWorrusk.\nOriginally the Barbarians roamed the entire western continent of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. During a period of inter-tribal warfare, the Barbarian &lt;a href=\"Worusk\"&gt;Worusk&lt;/a&gt; was able to unite them and for a brief time, the Barbarians were united under a single king. The Barbarian kingdom stretched as far to the jungles of the south. Under his reign, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt; was formed in &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;. Even after his death, the Council remained as a governing body.\nThe Samuren Empire.\nAt some point the Barbarian tribes (or at least the &lt;a href=\"Oxen%20Tribe\"&gt;Oxen Tribe&lt;/a&gt; came into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Samuren%20Empire\"&gt;Samuren Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which was bent on conquering the north. The &lt;a href=\"Samurenian\"&gt;Samurenian&lt;/a&gt;s interred captured Barbarians in labor camps. The Barbarians ultimately prevailed, as &lt;a href=\"Raekor\"&gt;Raekor&lt;/a&gt; led them to victory, sacking the empire's capital.\nThe Coming of Rakkis.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231245\"&gt;mid-tenth century&lt;/a&gt;, a crusade was launched from the &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt; to bring the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith to the lands of the West. Battling against the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, the Barbarians lost control of much of the West. However, &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;'s forces could never conquer the Northern Steppes.\nVigil Continued.\nThe Children of Bul-Kathos kept themselves isolated from the rest of Sanctuary, and while they would permit some trade with the outside world, this would only occur at the border of their territory. All intrusions into the territory surrounding Mount Arreat were forbidden, and warriors from the northern tribes were quick to thwart any incursions from foes. Because of their savagery in battle, the people of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; frequently called them \"barbarians,\" and regarded them as bloodthirsty invaders. Regardless, the Barbarians stood ready, as the &lt;a href=\"Prophecies%20of%20the%20Final%20Day\"&gt;Prophecies of the Final Day&lt;/a&gt; declared that a time would come when &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; would surge forward, seeking to undo the works of &lt;a href=\"the%20Ancients\"&gt;the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Uileloscadh%20M%C3%B3r\"&gt;final conflict&lt;/a&gt;.\nUileloscadh M\u00f3r.\n\"Baal comes... and destruction follows him like a storm.\"\n\u2014 &lt;a href=\"Caldra\"&gt;Caldra&lt;/a&gt;'s final words\nWhen news of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s re-emergence at &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; spread, a small number of Barbarian warriors began roving the lands outside the Steppes, prepared for war and seeking information regarding the recent activities of the Prime Evils. &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;One of their number&lt;/a&gt; made contact with a group of other heroes, and the &lt;a href=\"Horadric\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; scholar &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. The group tracked Diablo from &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, and even the fires of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; itself. Diablo and &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; were defeated, but &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, the final &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;, remained unaccounted for. The Lord of Destruction headed north, building an &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; as he did so, intent on corrupting the Worldstone. The Prophecies of the Final Day had been fulfilled. Uileloschadh M\u00f3r had begun.\nBy all accounts, the Barbarians fought ferociously, living up to their reputation as Sanctuary's hardiest warriors. Yet it was not enough. At &lt;a href=\"Daken-Shar\"&gt;Daken-Shar&lt;/a&gt;, the Barbarian defenders were eradicated almost to the &lt;a href=\"Renit%20the%20Dark%20Stalker\"&gt;last man&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;, their capital, was sacked. Eventually, all that stood between Baal and the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Summit\"&gt;Arreat Summit&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; and its defenders. In desperation, the town's elders sacrificed themselves as part of a warding spell to create a protective barrier around the settlement. Only &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; survived.\nBaal's forces lay siege, and Barbarian defenders suffered for it. The heroes who had slain Baal's brothers arrived however, and did all they could to break the siege. However, their efforts were overshadowed by Nihlathak's actions, who had bartered the &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Relic of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; to Baal in exchange for Harrogath being spared. With the relic, Baal could scale Mount Arreat unopposed by its guardians.\nBoth Nihlathak and Baal met their end at the hands of the heroes, but Baal had already corrupted the Worldstone. To save humanity, the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; was forced to destroy it. Through his actions, humanity was spared damnation, and Baal's army destroyed, but the cost to the Barbarian tribes was horrific. The resulting explosion leveled Mount Arreat and devastated the surrounding area. Toxic clouds of ash and arcane dust fell over the Steppes, the damage so horrific that it became known as the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Aftermath.\nIn the years following Arreat's destruction, the peoples of Sanctuary began to understand the long and noble history the Barbarian culture once possessed, and became acknowledged. But with the destruction of the Worldstone and devastation of their homeland, many Barbarians lost faith. Some became aimless, haunted by their past, traveling from place to place without honor or direction. The majority of the Barbarians remained within the Dreadlands (the former Northern Steppes), but small groups from the &lt;a href=\"Oxen%20Tribe\"&gt;Oxen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Tribe\"&gt;Crane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Tribe\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; tribes left, intent on finding a new home. Some Barbarians left Arreat to battle evil, in in atonement for their failed stewardship. When Barbarian tribes left Mount Arreat, their forlorn songs could be heard across forests. More than anything, they sang of mourning.\nOf the tribes that remained in the Dreadlands, fortunes were mixed. Some tribes fell into regression, becoming akin to unreasoning beasts and, in some cases, even cannibals. Some still honored the harsh snows of Arreat's summit and prowled the outskirts of its &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;crater&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining enclaves in isolated fortifications. They recalled being handed axes and spears at an age when city children were clinging to their toys...and they burnt with shame at the failure of their people. These Barbarians strove to find a new purpose for themselves in a changed world, and would crush any who stand in their way.\nA number of scattered Barbarian clans remained on the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, but they were scattered and isolated. They battled against the remnants of Baal's army, but they could either stand united or die divided. It was feared that if these tribes fell, the Army of Destruction would again be able to threaten &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the Barbarians who left their homeland, &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; took note of the evil that had taken root in Sanctuary. They saw an opportunity to give the Barbarians hope, a reason to fight, and a reason to live.\nThe Great Enmity.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, a few Barbarians served the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. They had little fear of death, pain, or evil, believing their fate written by &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nCulture.\nBarbarians eschew the use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and technology, as they believe the use of such devices will only weaken their resolve. Barbarians have frequently expressed disdain for magic, and those who wield it. Renowned for their combat prowess and arrogant demeanor, Barbarians appear to be perpetually girt for battle. Through harsh conditioning, Barbarians excel in physical combat and can perform tremendous feats of strength. Their physical strength is further strengthened by the primal energies of the land, which they have learned to harness. Never shying from a brawl, mighty ground stomps, leaping attacks and crushing blows leave enemies dead in their tracks, and survivors cowering in fear. Barbarians are not hindered when disarmed in battle, their fists are viable weapons. Barbarians revel in the chance to test their might against worthy foes, forging their reputations in the blood of their vanquished enemies. \nWhen a barbarian rages, they don't lose control. They vow to end their enemy and consider nothing else until that end is achieved. Most Barbarians find their inner fury before adulthood. Those who come to their rages later in life often blame a hidden \"second self.\"\nBarbarians sometimes forego armor, as it causes gruesome wounds when struck by a heavy weapon (which they usually use). Barbarians of the Dreadlands were wont to brawl with one another, and even the faintest violence could beget escalation. To swing only once was considered an insult.\nThe Barbarians hunted &lt;a href=\"aurochs\"&gt;aurochs&lt;/a&gt;, and used their fur as clothing. Some believe that the Barbarians hunted the aurochs to extinction; that the reason for their size and strength is because the Northerners of old fed on aurochs flesh.\nPrior to the deeds of Raekor, Barbarian women, while still highly regarded as warriors, were still seen by their male peers as being inferior to men on the field of battle. Raekor's deeds, with her being the first female to gain the coveted title of warmaster, changed this perception. However, even by &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;1263&lt;/a&gt;, Barbarian warriors were primarily male.\nDuring their vigil, Barbarian trials began at childhood; skinning ferocious beasts, climbing windswept cliffs and carrying weapons heavy enough to make a southern soldier weep. They are trained in hand-to-hand combat from a young age. As a result, their combat and survival skills are unparalleled throughout Sanctuary. Exposed to the elements of their homeland, Barbarian skin has been toughened to match the resilience of leather, and can withstand attacks that would slay lesser mortals. It is said that Barbarians are incapable of feeling cold.\nBecause of the scarcity of food in their homeland, Barbarians are able to consume species of plants that would kill normal &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, Barbarians regularly scavenged the bodies of their falls, due to the scarcity of materials in their homeland. \nBarbarians appear to have a numbering system that is represented by runes. They have their own language. For instance, the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Army of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; was called \"Ahjad-Den.\"\nBarbarians practice marriage, the events being known for their rowdiness. \nA Barbarian practice called the Sorrowsong exists. These are apparently composed for those who have deceased or at the least, departed a tribe.\nAn individual not of Barbarian blood may still be given the honorific of \"blood brother,\" if they have ingratiated themselves with a tribe.\nReligion.\nBarbarians are a spiritual people, and their faith system is/was based around &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt; (the \"immortal king\") and &lt;a href=\"the%20Ancients\"&gt;the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, a trio of &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; spirits who guarded Mount Arreat. Per the tenets of their belief system, every Barbarian in life was expected to defend Mount Arreat. With death, however, they would be free from that duty, and be able to pass beyond. For some Barbarians however, death was not enough to end their vigil, and their spirits remained tied to the mountain, still bound to defend it. Barbarians believe(d) that if they fail(ed) to uphold their duty to Arreat, or are not given a proper burial upon its slopes, they will be denied a true warrior's death, and their spirits shall roam the land without honor for all eternity. To give one's existence to defend the mountain was considered the most honored of all sacrifices in Barbarian culture.\nBarbarians also maintain shamanistic beliefs in animal powers, which are represented through the use of totems. At least some Barbarians believe in animal spirits, and some believe in the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Spirit World&lt;/a&gt;. A \"Hall Beyond\" has been referenced in Barbarian culture, with the belief that those who face their end without fear will be able to keep their form in the Hall.\nFew Barbarians worship the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaponcraft.\nBarbarians are familiar with the art of weaponsmithery, a tradition which harkens back to &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt;. Barbarians are able to make use of weapons in ways that others simply don\u2019t possess the strength for. Heavily-muscled barbarians can also dual-wield normal weapons like swords and axes, barraging foes with multiple enchantments and weapon types at once.\nFor a time, the &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; was regarded as the pinnacle of Barbarian weaponcraft, though not long before the destruction of Mount Arreat, some Barbarian smiths perfected their axecraft to be the equal (or greater) weapon to that of the sword. Other tribes are dedicated to other types of weapons however, such as the &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Tribe\"&gt;Bear Tribe&lt;/a&gt; (the mace), the &lt;a href=\"Snake%20Tribe\"&gt;Snake Tribe&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Tribe\"&gt;Crane Tribe&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"polearm\"&gt;polearm&lt;/a&gt;). Barbarians are also capable of using thrown weapons, but few are known for their use of the &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. Each tribe tells tales of their greatest weapons. While these tales differ, each tribe claims a &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Tribes\"&gt;certain blade&lt;/a&gt; as their own.\nKnown Tribes/Clans.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, there were estimated to be 32 Barbarian tribes. Each tribe can trace its ancestry back to Bul-Kathos, and each sang epic sagas of their history. With the destruction of Mount Arreat, entire tribes were wiped out from existence. Each clan paints its &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s in a unique manner. Barbarians have a way of speaking when regarding members of a tribe (e.g. \"&lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Tribe\"&gt;Crane Tribe&lt;/a&gt;\")\nKnown tribes/clans include(d):\nIn-game.\nDiablo.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Hellfire%29\"&gt;Barbarian (Hellfire)&lt;/a&gt;\"\nA Barbarian class first appeared in \"\".

The spell actually defends against ranged attacks, turning aside arrow and bolt. Those seeking to engage the Sorceress shall soon feel the icy bite of their folly. \"\nGeneral Information.\nThe final Cold Armor spell learned by the Sorceress, Chilling Armor sends &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Bolt\"&gt;Ice Bolt&lt;/a&gt;s at attackers when they hit her with &lt;a href=\"projectiles\"&gt;projectiles&lt;/a&gt;. It does not synergize with Ice Bolt, however.\nChilling Armor is indeed useful when fighting ranged foes, but it also has some problems. The biggest flaw is the fact that Chilling Armor only defends against ranged attackers; when hit by a melee attack, Chilling Armor will not retaliate. Therefore, Sorceresses that plan on fighting in the fray (such as some &lt;a href=\"Enchantress\"&gt;Enchantress&lt;/a&gt;es) would find Shiver Armor much more useful, while Sorceresses planning on staying on the back line might find Chilling Armor better.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 17"}

At the time, he had expected to bounce between jobs in the comics, games, and film industries. However, the ability of the videogame medium to focus on multiple genres and generate a variety of ideas compelled him to stay in the industry.\nMetzen pioneered the idea of Blizzard's \"strike teams,\" which provided internal feedback to the company's development teams. This was part of an effort to keep the company's original development culture together.\nMetzen worked with Blizzard's cinematic team, and gave feedback on its storyboards. \nMetzen left Blizzard in late 2016, entering retirement. During this period, he briefly worked with Frost Giant Studios on the development of \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//stormgate.fandom.com/wiki/Stormgate\"&gt;Stormgate&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOn December 15, 2022 it was announced that Metzen had returned to the company to serve as a creative advisor for \"Warcraft\".\nDiablo Related Works.\nThe fictional universe of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" was created by both Metzen and fellow designer &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Roper\"&gt;Bill Roper&lt;/a&gt;. He developed the game's story. Prior to Metzen working on the game, there was little in the way of backstory or lore.\nMetzen also provided voice acting for some of the game's characters. \nMetzen continued his work on the \"Diablo\" series in 2000 on \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", where he worked on the game's story, script, and artwork.

Mount Arreat - where legend claimed it had been hidden - had exploded, its entired top ravaged. The destruction had been heard about even here in the far-away Westmarch. More to the point, the rumors among those with the sight gave starker credence to the horrific claim. It was said that one of the Prime Evils themselves - Baal, Lord of Destruction - had been the cause, and if so, the mortal plane was in for far worse to come. The Worldstone had existed since time immemorial, created, so the teachings of Rathma said, to keep the mortal world protected. Now, both the powers of Light and Darkness reached out to fully claim humanity, and in their battles against one another the two cosmic factions threatened to destroy what they desired. Somehow, all that tied into Zayl's own urge to come to Westmarch. Somewhere in this vast kingdom, the repercussions of Baal's heinous deed would soon be felt.\"(pg 19)\n\"\"'Twas cursed ones who took &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;Zayl's&lt;/a&gt; hand, slavering damned souls from a lost city called &lt;a href=\"Ureh\"&gt;Ureh&lt;/a&gt;\" \"(pg 81)."}

Even though it doesn't look like a very good &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because of its drawbacks and also its low base damage, it still has a major advantage nonetheless: the +% Damage vs Demons applies to the total damage of the character(s), not just to the weapon's damage, effectively tripling the damage they deal to Demons in melee. Furthermore, Civerb's Cudgel is useful to &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s against &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s on Hell &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; which are &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to their &lt;a href=\"Spellbook\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, and also since most of the monsters encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; levels are going to be Demons anyway. However it should be noted that Sorcerers are highly adviced to go with a more viable weapon choice, due to their insuffient &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Chance To Hit&lt;/a&gt;, a much needed bonus that Civerb's Cudgel lacks, and slow &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt;, which is another important modifier needed on &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, in order to reach higher breakpoints."}

Some time later, she heard news that Claeys had died.\nAs per the traditions of the &lt;a href=\"crusaders\"&gt;crusaders&lt;/a&gt;, she was to take up her master's armor, his name and mission.

He then told Eudoxie to retrieve his shield from nearby. After Eudoxie retrieved the shield, (which had to be cleansed of the darkness that had infested it), her mentor's echo gave her a final test \u2014 to defeat him; because having faith demanded that she believed in herself, not others.

The three heroes appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" under the monikers of the Dark Wanderer, the Summoner, and Blood Raven respectively.\nDevelopment.\nAt least two conceptions of the game's class system existed prior to the final version that was implemented in the game.\nIn the original design document, the player would be presented with a choice of class and race. 5-6 human races would be offered (hill people, forest people, etc.), each with advantages and disadvantages. The player would then have a choice of class, namely fighter, thief, or magician. All the characters would be able to use weapons and cast spells, but advantages would exist based on the nature of the class\u2014the fighter would gain more attacks, the thief would move faster and have stealth advantages, and the magician would be able to cast more powerful spells. The magician would be able to choose from one of four schools of magic. After making the choice, the game would provide the character with basic statistics in the form of strength, magical aptitude, dexterity, and vitality. The player could also choose a pre-set character, skipping the character creation process. The idea of sub-classes was also mentioned.\nA different take on the characters also existed prior to the game's release. It has been stated that it was originally intended that the game would only have a single class (represented by the warrior), where players could distribute attributes to their liking and thus take the character in whatever direction they wanted. The division of the character into the warrior, rogue, and sorcerer archetypes occurred late during development.\nIn the original design document for the game, the player character had a set backstory. In this version, the hero lost his family and home to raiders. With nothing left save vengeance, the hero would track them to a crypt with a labyrinth beneath it before descending into the depths.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", each class was made unique complete with unique skillsets for each class as well as many new gameplay options.\nDiablo II: Lord of Destruction.\n\"\" added two new classes complete with new ways to customize your old ones with &lt;a href=\"Class-specific%20Items\"&gt;Class-specific Items&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nCanonically, all seven heroes partook in the events of the game. The five heroes of the original game were working together by the time &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; was rescued, and the Assassin and Druid characters had joined them by the game's &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;fifth act&lt;/a&gt;.

The Sorceress has been identified as &lt;a href=\"Isendra\"&gt;Isendra&lt;/a&gt;, who trained &lt;a href=\"Li-Ming\"&gt;Li-Ming&lt;/a&gt;. The Paladin, identified as &lt;a href=\"Carthas\"&gt;Carthas&lt;/a&gt;, went to seal the body of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;host&lt;/a&gt;, as it was tainted by the demon's corruption, and was infecting its surroundings. He was eventually corrupted, and killed by a &lt;a href=\"the%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;group of hero(es)&lt;/a&gt;. The Amazon, identified as &lt;a href=\"Cassia\"&gt;Cassia&lt;/a&gt;, returned to &lt;a href=\"Skovos\"&gt;Skovos&lt;/a&gt; and became the war-matron. It has been speculated by the game's developers that the rest of the heroes also passed their skills on to the next generation. As of December 2013, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; is looking into the possibility of exploring the Diablo II classes in further short stories.\nDevelopment.\nThe idea of five classes was hammered out over several months. During development of the game, it was originally intended that the classes be archetypes (albeit with slight differences from standard RPG classes) that boiled down to the roles of fighter, rogue, and spell caster, based on a sub-class principle. The rogue would branch out into sisters of the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; order and hunters/rangers. The fighter would branch into a templar/paladin or berserker, and the spell caster into the sorceress or necromancer. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt; decided against the idea because multiple genders would mean animating a total of 10 models, that, combined with the game's component system, would make the task too large to undertake. The game's skill trees were effectively a way to formalize class pathways/builds, and make it easier for players to specialize their character. Development of the classes was carried out on the fly;balance concerns were addressed at the end of development.\nThe was intended to be implemented in the game's second expansion.\nAs part of the development for the of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Team%203\"&gt;Team 3&lt;/a&gt; looked at the classes of Diablo II, paying special attention to the parts of classes that might not have been as fleshed out thematically as they could have been.\nDiablo Immortal.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", classes are referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Adventurers\"&gt;Adventurers&lt;/a&gt;.\" Adventurers can join the &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt; factions. The classes' appearances can be customized to an extent; each class can choose their gender, and has access to the following options:\nAfter choosing the class's appearance, players can customize their class through &lt;a href=\"Yaira\"&gt;Yaira&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following classes are currently playable:\nClasses will be added to the game post-launch. The Blood Knight was the first class introduced to the game post-launch in July 2023. A second class, the &lt;a href=\"Tempest\"&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt;, was added in 2024. Other possibilities include the &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;. \nBoth genders can be chosen for each class.\nClass Change.\n\"Diablo Immortal\" features a class change feature. This is available through the &lt;a href=\"Shifting%20Flames\"&gt;Shifting Flames&lt;/a&gt; brazier in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. The system features the following:\nLore.\nThe player character of Immortal has been referred to in the singular, albeit allying with \"other mortal champions.\" Comments from &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Dunn\"&gt;Lieutenant Dunn&lt;/a&gt; establish that many adventurers are active during the time frame of the game, though aren't aligned with the main hero(es). As the storyline progresses, the player character is referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;,\" in reference to them carrying &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; shards (or often, seeking them out from foes).\nDevelopment.\nWhen choosing the game's classes, the classes of \"Diablo II\" &amp; \"III\" were looked at. Six were chosen from Diablo \"III\" as it was felt that they represented the franchise \"very well.\" When designing a class, cohesive design and narrative are carried out before developing artwork.\nDiablo III.\nWhen \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" was initially released, it had five unique classes\u2014like its predecessor. All five classes can be played as male or female characters.\nLore.\nThe hero(es) of Diablo III is/are referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;\". Details such as gender and class have been left ambiguous, though various characters are canonical representations of the game's playable classes in a narrative sense.\nDevelopment.\nScreenshots of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt;'s version of Diablo III depict a Paladin-esque class.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;'s version of Diablo III, the designers intended that each class correspond to a classical fantasy archetype. Blizzard wanted to do new classes as much as possible, or at least, do new twists on former archtypes. The Barbarian was the first class developed, and served as the baseline against which all future classes would be compared. Class skills and sets were designed before their lore, thus deciding which classes were added to the game was primarily a gameplay-based choice. The class design intended that there be 3-5 iconic skills for each class. &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;s will not be playable classes in the game due to them not being &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. It was decided that the classes be actual individuals with backstories, whereas the previous games had depicted archetypes rather than actual characters.\nDuring development, it was originally intended that the Barbarian be the same individual as the one from Diablo II. This led to issues in the game in that things had to be explained differently to the other characters (newcomers) as opposed to an experienced character. It was later decided that the Diablo III heroes should be unique to the game itself, and thus the characters were made separate.\nThe Amazon and Druid have been considered for inclusion in the game per the 'hero pack' model, but for now, they have been passed over in favor of the Necromancer.\nDiablo IV.\nLike the previous installments, \"Diablo IV\" launched with five classes:\nThe Blood Knight from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" will not be implemented as a class. \nExpansion Classes.\nAs of December 2023, the Paladin is the game's most requested class, but it will not be implemented in \"Vessel\", as the developers wanted to create a new class for the expansion. After the Spiritborn was officially revealed, Blizzard said that although they \"hear very loudly\" that the game is not providing a \"sword and board\" Paladin or Crusader fantasy, they explained that they \"wanted an opportunity to do something that was based within the region\" (Nahantu) that was being developed for the game in \"Vessel\". Blizzard has not ruled out classes returning from prior games.\nLore.\nThe player character of \"Diablo IV\" is \".\" Within the story, the Wanderer is always referred to in the singular. However, it has been implied that canonically, all the classes are working together, and that the characters are newcomers. \nCustomization.\nPlayers can choose a pre-set character design, or can customize the appearance of their character. There are over 8 trillion appearance combinations..\nCustomizable elements include the following:\nThe color of the character's skin, eyes, hair/facial hair, and body markings can be adjusted. Some elements will be class specific, to support the classes\u2019 unique backgrounds. For instance, each class has a unique hairstyle available to them. However, many customization elements will be shared between classes allowing more possibilities to mix and match. Despite the customization, the silouettes of the characters remains constant. For instance, a player can't create a skinny Barbarian, or a muscular Sorcerer. This extends to armor pieces; classes can use the same armor, but the armor's appearance will always correspond to the class, not the other way round."}

Snake Men) are serpetine creatures found primarily in &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nClaw Vipers are hideous snake-like creatures with arms and other &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;oid features. These creatures practice evil &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. They have also been known to kidnap travelers and sacrifice them to their dark gods. Those who choose to hunt these creatures should be warned that they are extremely fast and their touch has been known to sometimes chill their victims to the bone. The calculated coldness of their reptillian brains makes them fierce adversaries. They are fond of collecting magical artifacts.\nThere are many breeds of Claw Viper. Within Claw Viper society, there is a divide between greater and lesser Vipers, with the lesser members of their kin feeling the wrath of their more powerful counterparts. This separation is enforced by the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Magus\"&gt;Serpent Magi&lt;/a&gt;, who propagate a culture of fear. There appears to be some relation between the Claw Vipers and the &lt;a href=\"Viper%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Vipers&lt;/a&gt; that plagued &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;; the Claw Vipers are smaller than their kin.\nHistory.\nThe origin of these &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic monstrosities is cloaked in controversy. Whether they are the victims of a curse of a powerful &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; or the result of some &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;hell&lt;/a&gt;-spawned evolution, these beasts now serve in the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever the truth of their origins, it is certain that Claw Vipers are an ancient race; paintings on the walls of tombs near &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; show a Claw Viper dropping a severed human head while another human seems to worship it.\nSeveral hundred years before the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, the Claw Vipers erected an altar which caused the sun to go black. While the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; traveled eastward, the Claw Vipers once again shrouded the sun over Aranoch. However, a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; of heroes slew the Vipers and returned sunlight to the land.\nIn-game.\nClaw Vipers are encountered in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". They possess a &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; attack. This is potentially deadly as it prevents its victim from escaping and allows other Claw Vipers to swarm and attack en masse. They use a skill similar to &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, which deals a large amount of damage and knocks back its foe. They are able to move quickly and attack quickly using just their natural abilities. Claw Vipers are usually encountered in the tombs and halls within their &lt;a href=\"Claw%20Viper%20Temple\"&gt;Claw Viper Temple&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Snakes\"&gt;Valley of Snakes&lt;/a&gt;. They are immune to Cold in Hell Difficulty. Though their attacks are deadly, Claw Vipers lack defense and health, making them swift kills. They make a hissing noise that can be heard even if you can't see them.\nStatistics.\nClaw Viper (Variant) are an Claw Viper type. They can spawn in &lt;a href=\"Claw%20Viper%20Temple\"&gt;Claw Viper Temple 1-2&lt;/a&gt; alongside their more &lt;a href=\"Salamander\"&gt;powerful variant&lt;/a&gt;. \nThey deal &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Damage%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage with their tail."}

On the other hand the Guest Serpent Magi are the only Claw Vipers that become red upon charge, all other change their color to blue.\nTomb Viper Strategies.\nThis scourge of players primary attack is a poison missile similar to a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Javelin\"&gt;Plague Javelin&lt;/a&gt;, only capable of much more damage. Due to a bug, a percentage of their charge damage is included in the secondary cloud of poison as physical damage; the AoE cloud. This means that one could avoid the initial poison from the spear but still get damage of the cloud should his character run into it. The cloud isn't visible however, but will stay about five seconds after the initial spear's cloud vanishes. If the player does not move in this time, the second cloud will not affect them. Getting knocked back will also not trigger the second cloud.\nPhysical damage can be mitigated by equipping items with &lt;a href=\"Damage%20reduction\"&gt;integer physical damage reduction&lt;/a&gt;. Other way of countering their attack (for melee characters) is by moving close enough to the creatures so that they will melee instead of using their missile attack. Casting &lt;a href=\"Dim%20Vision\"&gt;Dim Vision&lt;/a&gt; on them will work as well as they won't attack something until they're aware of it. Another tactic, working on all guest monsters is to Save and Exit the game and try again, hopefully being able to avoid having them spawn again."}

Unlike &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Fists of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, this skill actually causes decent damage on its own. Against a single enemy, using this skill can damage it faster than Phoenix Strike's second charge can, and there's no need to worry about over- or under-charging (Phoenix Strike's first charge provides more damage over time, but it's fire-elemental which the enemy may be immune to.) The Nova and Charged Bolts both have a NextDelay of 4 frames, which prevents enemies struck by them from being affected by any other missiles with NextDelay, which encompass the second and third charge of Phoenix Strike as well, so combining this skill with those two charges from Phoenix Strike, while pretty, is not effective.\nDue to the above NextDelay, monsters directly adjacent to the Assassin are hit by the Nova, but not the charged bolts. A little further away, monsters are hit by the Nova \"and\" the charged bolts, since the Nova hits them more than four frames before the slower charged bolts reach them. Thus, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tail\"&gt;Dragon Tail&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks back several opponents around the Assassin, is the best finisher for a three-charge Claws of Thunder.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 4"}

The Clay Golem is the simplest form of this complex art, creating a servant directly from the earth to serve the Necromancer. The intense drain this places on the psyche of the caster only allows him to maintain a single Golem of any type at a time.\"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nClay Golem produces a mysterious being from the earth itself that follows the Necromancer and fights his enemies. The Golem advances on monsters and strikes them in hand-to-hand combat. Its strength lies in its remarkably high &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it excel at withstanding enemy attacks and drawing the attention of monsters to itself, thus protecting its master. Although its attacks deal insignificant damage later in the game, they greatly slow opponents (including &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;Act Boss&lt;/a&gt;es), further tempering threats to the Necromancer. Provided the Necromancer has other means of dealing damage, Clay Golems can act as the Necromancer's \"tank\".\nInvesting more points into Clay Golem slightly increases their damage and attack, but particularly their life and ability to slow opponents. Like Skeletons, a Clay Golem contributes to the Necromancer's excellent crowd control and exceeds at trammeling enemies with its slowing ability, particularly when aided with &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt; and a source of &lt;a href=\"cold\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; damage. An enemy slowed by each of these encumbrances can barely move, which greatly reduces its ability to cause damage. The effect is particularly apparent against Act Bosses, whose threat is distinctly curtailed when slowed. Clay Golems recover quickly and can sustain large amounts of damage before being destroyed. Even when destroyed, they can be easily replaced.\nClay Golems have three major drawbacks.

Clay Golems particularly benefit from the bonus life they receive from this skill, though the speed bonus is usually not very necessary, as Golems keep up decently well when following their master. Golem Mastery also grants a small bonus to all Golems' &lt;a href=\"attack%20rating\"&gt;attack rating&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkill Progression.\nDefense: 100\nKnown bugs.\nDue to an error in &lt;samp&gt;SkillDesc.txt&lt;/samp&gt;, which has existed since Diablo II and is still present in Diablo II: Resurrected, the value of Defense shown is based on the total Iron Golem skill level instead of the base Iron Golem skill level. However, the actual calculation uses only the base skill level, which means the actual value will be either equal to or lower than the one shown. This affects all Golems receiving the Iron Golem defense bonus."}

He can be seen as an important member in mixed parties, or where individual party members lack defensive output.\nThis build should put points into the following:\nExplanation.\nA Cleric is purely a defensive character and is not meant to go into the frontlines of combat. The Cleric's abilities help greatly with groups with one such skill being &lt;a href=\"Cleansing\"&gt;Cleansing&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the Cleric to have a mana-free &lt;a href=\"Prayer\"&gt;Prayer&lt;/a&gt; and giving the whole party reduced time in poisoned or cursed states. Another useful aura that also is a mana-free Prayer is &lt;a href=\"Meditation\"&gt;Meditation&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a boost to mana regeneration. The &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Bolt\"&gt;Holy Bolt&lt;/a&gt; skill can also be used to heal other party members, including &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt;, or can be used to damage monsters of the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; subtype. Salvation is a skill which is used when the monsters have the elemental attacks of &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Damage%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; (but not &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;) to raise one's resistances against them.\nSolo Play.\nClerics have trouble with solo play and greatly rely on the hireling that accompanies the player. The hireling provides the role of tank and also will be doing the most of the fighting for the Cleric. An &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Act 2 mercenary&lt;/a&gt; is the most effective, as it also gives the addition of another aura to the Cleric. A thorns aura from a hireling found in Act 2 on is effective when combined with the constant healing of the Paladin. Unless facing Champions with &lt;a href=\"Extra%20Strong\"&gt;Extra Strong&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Extra%20Fast\"&gt;Extra Fast&lt;/a&gt; (where a possibility of being overwhelmed exists), the hireling will slowly whittle the numbers down while the Cleric heals his hireling (and in the case of Undead, can also damage the enemy). Another spell which can damage the enemy is , though the holy bolts that come from Fist of the Heavens do not possess the healing effect.\nKeep in mind that sometimes the monsters will, instead of attacking the hireling, attack the Cleric instead. This requires the Cleric to be aware of his surroundings.\nDueling.\nThe Cleric is not a build meant for Player versus player as, for one, the Cleric is purely a defensive build, not an offensive build. For two, the build relies on having other people doing the damage and not the Cleric himself. Lastly, the hireling is very easily killed by other players, which is the Cleric's only means of offense."}

IE if a character is surrounded by monsters they can't just run in any direction to escape.\nGamers might be familiar with the term via the \"no clipping mode\" done by the IDCLIP cheat in the Doom FPS games.\nClipping necessitates either killing a monster or causing it to relocate (knockback, taunt, fear, etc) to be able to run through the space they were occupying.\nOne major problem with the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; in early editions of the game is that the Necromancer and his allies would experience clipping in respect to those minions, which meant that once he got a very large army, they would limit his movements greatly in tight quarters.\nNecromancers could not scare off their own minions with &lt;a href=\"Terror\"&gt;Terror&lt;/a&gt; so the only way to clear a path would be to &lt;a href=\"Unsummon\"&gt;Unsummon&lt;/a&gt; them, losing the mana (and perhaps corse/item) investment.\nThis was especially the case back when skeletons gave 1 skeleton per point in the skill, compared to later when the number was nerfed.\nThis was also a minor consideration for other classes' Mercenary (or the Amazon's Valkyrie) but not to the same degree.\nOne of the later patches changed this, so minions would not clip their owners or their owners' allies. They could walk right through them.\nThis isn't the case in PVP where minions do clip PVP enemies, allowing necromancers to use them as mobile barriers while running away from melee PVP foes."}

The result is a fairly durable melee fighter that can quickly dispatch large groups of enemies.\nStat Point Distribution.\nAs with any physical fighters &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vitality\"&gt;vitality&lt;/a&gt; are much more important than &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;. Strength and dexterity should be increased sufficiently to use high-end &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"javelins\"&gt;javelins&lt;/a&gt; (depending on a player's preference) and whatever other &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; the player intends on using. All other points should be placed in vitality. Energy can be left at base, as &lt;a href=\"fend\"&gt;fend&lt;/a&gt; does not cost a lot of mana, and a small percentage of &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Steal\"&gt;mana steal&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient to recover any spent using fend.\nSkill Point distribution.\nThe Fendazon focuses almost exclusively on the left side of the &lt;a href=\"Javelin%20and%20Spear%20Skills\"&gt;javelin and spear skills&lt;/a&gt; tree, as well as some &lt;a href=\"Passive%20and%20Magic%20Skills\"&gt;passive and magic skills&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrimary Skills.\nThese skills should be taken to maximum level\nSecondary Skills.\nThese skills do not need to be maxed out, but should have at least one level in them.\nValkyrie or No Valkyrie?\nThe &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; skill gives the Fendazon access to a very durable summonable tank. Normally any melee-oriented Amazon should have a Valkyrie to help dispatch enemies. But due to a glitch in the Fend skill any time the Amazon's attack is interrupted all subsequent attacks automatically miss, but the Amazon is locked in place during this time. (A similar bug exists with the skill.)\nBecause Valkyrie has &lt;a href=\"Evade\"&gt;Evade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Avoid\"&gt;Avoid&lt;/a&gt; as prerequisites the chances of the Amazon's attack being interrupted by one of these skills, and therefore nullifying the Fend attack, can have deadly consequences.\nEven a single point in Dodge gives the Amazon an 18% chance that their attacks will automatically miss. Assuming that a player has at least a few items that increase skill levels the chance to dodge increases sharply.\nUltimately the decision to take a Valkyrie or not depends on the player's preference. Some argue that a high-level Valkyrie offers enough protection and deals enough damage that the risk of encountering the Fend bug is justified.\nIf a player opts to take Valkyrie do not put more than one point in Dodge. Avoid and Evade can be taken additional times if desired, but one point is usually sufficient. Valkyrie itself should be maxed out. A level 20 Valkyrie with a level 20 Decoy for the synergy bonus will almost never die, and can deal impressive damage to enemies.\nIf Valkyrie is not taken then do not put any points in Dodge. Put the extra skill points in some of the elemental spear and javelin skills, or skills such as &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Missiles\"&gt;Slow Missiles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sight\"&gt;Inner Sight&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nEquipment.\nBecause the Fendazon is a melee build maximizing damage is important. Typically a &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; is desirable, as two-handed weapons deal significantly more damage. However, a &lt;a href=\"javelins\"&gt;javelin&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; combination makes a good backup, and offers more versatility. The choice is up to the individual player.\nEquipment that reduces damage (either by a percentage, or multiple gear that grants point damage reduction) can help mitigate the fend bug.\nWeapon.\nAny of the following spears make a good primary weapon:\nIf a player chooses to use a javelin (either as their main weapon, or as the secondary weapon) any of the following are good choices:\nShields are not crucial to this build. A high chance to block can cause the fend bug, so defence, damage reduction, and resistances are of higher priority than a high chance to block.\nBody Armor.\nThe following are good choices for body armor:\nHireling.\nA &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Desert Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; with either the &lt;a href=\"Might\"&gt;Might&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt; aura is ideal. Holy Freeze will slow enemies, making your entire party more durable, and helping mitigate the fend bug. Might will increase your offensive capability, allowing you to move through groups of enemies faster. The choice is left to the individual.\nPrior to Act II of Nightmare a Desert Mercenary with the &lt;a href=\"Defiance\"&gt;Defiance&lt;/a&gt; aura is a good choice.\nYour hireling should be equipped in the usual manner for a Desert Mercenary; armor that offers high defence and good resistances, and a weapon that does high damage and has abilities such as Crushing Blow. Ethereal versions of armor and weapons are ideal.\nTactics.\nCast &lt;a href=\"Decoy\"&gt;Decoy&lt;/a&gt; to lure enemies together into a tight group. Advance quickly and attack as many of the monsters as possible with &lt;a href=\"Fend\"&gt;Fend&lt;/a&gt;. If you start getting surrounded, retreat as being hit by multiple enemies runs the risk of falling victim to the fend bug.\nUse your hireling and/or Valkyrie to act like the decoy; they can draw enemies to them, and you use your high mobility and high attack speed to run in, and hit as many enemies as possible with each use of Fend.\nNever be afraid to fall back, cast a new Decoy, and advance again. Also, if you Valkyrie starts lagging behind cast it again where you need it to be.\nMonsters that are immune to life and mana stealing can be a nuisance. Let your hireling and/or Valkyrie handle these, and use Fend only to finish off monsters or lend support if your minions are taking too much damage.\nAgainst bosses, champions, and uniques a level 1 Jab (combined with equipment that grants bonuses to skills and abilities like Deadly Strike and Crushing Blow) can be very effective."}

One day, a vampire imprisoned in the lord's keep broke free, killed the lord, and gravely wounded Fernam during the escape, infecting him with vampirism. Fortunately, the lord's top &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a premier scholar on the subject of vampirism\u2014had performed a ritual on Fernam to stop the spread before he was transformed into a feral, mindless thrall. The Mage was successful in keeping him alive, but instead of granting immortality, Fernam unexpectedly inherited some of the vampire\u2019s power.\nThe Mage had been mortally wounded in the scuffle, and with his dying breath, taught Fernam how to perform the ritual that saved his life. At any moment, Fernam could succumb to his newfound darkness and transform indefinitely into a vampiric thrall. After cheating fate, Fernam took his lord's wealth and moved into the catacombs below the keep. He formed the order of Blood Knights, used the catacombs as a training ground, and passed on knowledge of the curse-suspending ritual that saved his life along with the way of his preferred weapon, the polearm.\nAt a point, Fernam made &lt;a href=\"Heir%20of%20High%20Regions\"&gt;a helm&lt;/a&gt; to symbolize his war against the darkness.\nLegacy.\nFernam later disappeared, and was replaced by a Blood Knight council. All Blood Knights take the same oath Fernam made\u2014\"all that remains of my life, weighed against the darkness.\"\nBefore he left, Fernam entrusted his &lt;a href=\"Fernam%27s%20Birthmantle\"&gt;birthmantle&lt;/a&gt;, stained with the blood of dozens of vampires, to his order. The mantle became a treasured artefact, and it was an affront for it to be worn outside a chapterhouse.\nAfter Fernam vanished, he was accused of vagrancy for not assisting his order. Replicas of his original helm were made, which saved enough Blood Knights from decapitation that it has acquired its own legendry status, and led to murmurs of the first knight watching over the chapterhouse still. \nTwo relics of Fernam are known to survive; the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Fernam\"&gt;Crown of Fernam&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fang%20of%20Fernam\"&gt;Fang of Fernam&lt;/a&gt;.

Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, of the venerated task put to their people to protect those mysteries, and of the &lt;a href=\"Prophecies%20of%20the%20Final%20Day\"&gt;prophecies&lt;/a&gt; regarding the &lt;a href=\"Uileloscadh%20M%C3%B3r\"&gt;dark times&lt;/a&gt; ahead. They both agreed that, in order to fulfill their sacred trust, their &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; must devote themselves to nothing save that charge. However, they disagreed on exactly how the people could best do this. Bul-Kathos believed that only by bringing the tribes together and training them in strict martial discipline could the tribes faithfully concentrate on their goal for generations to come. Fiacla-G\u00e9ar, on the other hand, believed that only through obtaining a spiritual oneness with the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;land&lt;/a&gt; they had sworn to protect could the people truly appreciate the importance of their role. Both agreed the other's philosophy had merit, and so around the time Bul-Kathos united the tribes, Fiacla-G\u00e9ar gathered together a small group consisting of the tribes' greatest warrior-poets and shamans and mysteriously retreated into the forests surrounding the area known as &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;. There he and his people created the first of the &lt;a href=\"Druid%20Colleges\"&gt;Druid Colleges&lt;/a&gt;. In preparation for the impending conflict, he taught his people the &lt;a href=\"Caoi%20D%C3%BAlra\"&gt;Caoi D\u00falra&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that when Vasily first taught beneath the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Oak\"&gt;Great Oak&lt;/a&gt;, a raven perched to listen.\nLegacy.\nVasily's history was later recorded in the \"&lt;a href=\"Sc%C3%A9al%20Fada\"&gt;Sc\u00e9al Fada&lt;/a&gt;\". A seaward facing statue of Vasily was erected in/near &lt;a href=\"T%C3%BAr%20D%C3%BAlra\"&gt;T\u00far D\u00falra&lt;/a&gt;. Roots from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Oak\"&gt;Great Oak&lt;/a&gt; growing at statue of Vasily will, on rare occasions, be found twisted back upon themselves, suffused with ferocious &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the story of the raven perching to listen to Vasily, many Druids revere ravens for their cleverness, loyalty, and foresight of dangers to come.\nIn-game.\nFiacla-G\u00e9ar-themed wings are available through &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 24 in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFiacla-G\u00e9ar-themed items can be found in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", including &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Companion\"&gt;Storm's Companion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vasily%27s%20Prayer\"&gt;Vasily's Prayer&lt;/a&gt;."}

With &lt;a href=\"Peyros\"&gt;Peyros&lt;/a&gt;' (the barbarian who was working at the battlements) help, they were able to use a catapult to destroy the portal.

These achievements can prove difficult, however; one mistake can throw the battle in the boss's favor, even with a lot of &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; levels. Typically, a character will use a &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;crowd-controlling&lt;/a&gt; build, with all skills aimed at keeping the boss &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stunned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slowed&lt;/a&gt; etc.\nThe main difficulty, however, is not even the damage itself: due to the game's mechanics, a follower can only do steady damage while the character is immobile, and standing still even for a few moments may be extremely dangerous, as without equipment, not only is a hero's &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; very low, but his/her degree of protection is virtually nonexistent. Some classes have skills (such as &lt;a href=\"Serenity\"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt;) to make them briefly immune to damage, though."}

By picking among the glands and entrails of the recently dead, a Barbarian warrior can sometimes scavenge enough ingredients to make a powerful healing elixir. Some Barbarians are skillful and fortunate enough to find ingredients for a potion that restores not only their health but their spirit as well. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nUsing this skill on the corpse of a monster that has not been affected by another corpse skill already grants a chance of the corpse generating a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation%20Potion\"&gt;Rejuvenation Potion&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The chance to find a potion depends of the skill level.\nAll levels of potions can be found, varying on\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0progression. Generally speaking, corpses in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Normal%20difficulty\"&gt;Normal difficulty&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0give Light (or normal Rejuvenation) potions, Act 2 on Normal give Normal potions, Act 3 on Normal to Act 2 on Nightmare give Greater (or full Rejuvenation) potions, and Act 3 on Nightmare and beyond give Super (or full Rejuvenation) potions.\nIf the check for the corpse having possessed a potion succeeds, the potion type is determined by the chances of finding each type:\nAs per the odds, the hero is more likely to find a Healing potion than the rest of the other potion types combined. This works in the favor of the Barbarian; since he heals the most health out of a healing potion, he is well suited to the skill.\nIn addition, one can use this skill on a corpse in multiplayer, and give the results of his searches to his party members. If one constantly tops his/her potions off, not only does it allow them more time out in the field before needing to use a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;, but their &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; profits also rise, due to not needing to buy as many potions. &lt;a href=\"Find%20Item\"&gt;Find Item&lt;/a&gt;, however, generates far more gold in the long term.\u00a0\nEarly on, reckless use of this skill can quickly deplete the user's mana pool: the 2 Mana cost, while not increasing upwards with levels, does not decline either.\nOne can also use this skill to deny corpses to resurrecting monsters (such as ), but when playing in a group, this can hinder other players, especially &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, from using their corpse-based abilities."}

It has less maximum damage potential than lightning but has a very consistent damage range, making it less unpredictable. Fire damages immediately, but some fire skills produce burning flames on the ground that can deal &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; to anything that stands in the flames. Fire is found in all the &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;s' dungeons as traps or just for environmental effect. But players must still take care to stand near burning bodies or piles, lest they themselves get burnt and add fuel to the fire.\nAlmost all kinds of &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; have resistances to fire. A very notable exception is the Maiden of Anguish, &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, who has a lowered resistance to Fire than others of her kind. In the setting, the majority of monsters have resistance or &lt;a href=\"immunities\"&gt;immunities&lt;/a&gt; to this elemental damage.\nFire is used by the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Vengeance\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Golem\"&gt;Fire Golem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; classes in their skills, making it one of the most used elemental damage types in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, mostly for its reliable damage range.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", Fire interacts with wind based attacks to create a firestorm. This temporarily grants bonus damage to the wind attack. Some fire attacks temporarily leave a patch of ground scorched, which damages any enemy that stands on it.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", all classes except s, as well as many monsters, use Fire damage. Many Fire skills ignite the enemy, dealing damage over time, leave deadly pools of flame on the ground, deal increased plain damage, or have larger than usual area of effect.

This is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Druid\"&gt;Wind Druid&lt;/a&gt;, except it's not as popular due to several factors. Firstly, the last fire skill, &lt;a href=\"Armageddon\"&gt;Armageddon&lt;/a&gt;, as a prerequisite, requires the last Wind skill, &lt;a href=\"Hurricane\"&gt;Hurricane&lt;/a&gt;, which, in turn, requires all the other Wind skills. So effectively, Armageddon's prerequisites are every other Elemental skill, which requires five skill points to invest in the wind skills. It's not much, but it makes a difference. However, the exceptionally high synergy bonuses can easily compensate for this, resulting in much higher damage. It's true that many monsters in difficulty are immune to fire, but &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Boulder\"&gt;Molten Boulder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt; still can do a good job.\nIf you like fire, don't hesitate to make a Fire Druid, they can be very fun to play - and it's much easier to handle the first few acts with fire than with wind because wind skills are more effective at higher levels. The Druid's fire skills are also some of the most visually-impressive effects in the game.\nBecause fire-based builds are difficult to use in Nightmare and Hell, any fire-based Druid will be primarily for play in Normal difficulty. In allied multiplayer games, the fire-immune monsters can be dealt with by your allies, still leaving a massive share for you in combat with other monsters. One effective version, however, uses a combination between Dire Wolves and Fissure. The wolves (plus mercenaries) are used to bog the enemy down, while the Druid casts Fissure, which does exceptional constant damage for its level. Hilariously, this is very effective against Act Bosses, and can be used to kill tough monsters like Duriel before they even harm the player, so long as the Druid remembers to summon more wolves as they begin to die.\nFire Skills.\nEach of the fire skills has different abilities and weaknesses. Knowledge of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each of the fire skills is important in letting you bring a Fire Druid through Nightmare and especially Hell.\nOne main weakness that all the fire skills have is that they can only be cast on ground. This makes flying monsters more difficult to handle, but see the section on Molten Boulder.\nAnother main weakness of all the fire skills is that they are timered, greatly reducing the utility of faster cast rate.\nFirestorm does an apparently small amount of fire damage, and appears difficult to reliably aim. However, note that the rated damage on the character screen and skill description are misleading; in particular, at higher cast rates, it is possible to deal up to 3 times the rated damage per second on an act boss. Also, at levels above 20, Firestorm's damage increases significantly. Finally, it has two synergies, each of which boosts Firestorm's damage by 23%.\nFirestorm releases 3 paths of flame. The center path is always a straight line towards the location you click, while the two side paths will meander pseudo-randomly. To maximize your damage, practice moving around and targeting different points until you can get at least one of the two side paths to converge with the center path on a nonmoving target monster. While standing toe-to-toe will assure both side paths will hit the monster, this is widely considered to be dangerous for a spellcaster. Fortunately, there is a significant chance of a side path crossing the center path at about a druid-length or so away from your target.\nFirestorm is weak against monsters with a small standing profile (imps and vampires), especially if they are moving fast (it will deal less than the rated damage). It deals reasonable fire damage against most other monsters if you can get at least one of the side paths to cross the center path under the target. It deals significant fire damage against act bosses, especially if you can get both side paths to cross the center path under the target.\nUnlike the other fire spells, Firestorm benefits significantly from faster cast rate due to its very short timer.\nThe main use of Firestorm is to kill act bosses or individual or small groups of slow, large monsters that you can immobilize easily. In general, it is better than Volcano against non-fire immune monsters, but requires greater skill to use.\n&lt;a href=\"Molten%20Boulder\"&gt;Molten Boulder&lt;/a&gt;.\nMolten Boulder rolls a slow-moving boulder in a straight line towards the targeted location. The boulder will knock back small and medium monsters. The knock back direction is always away from the druid, so if you move, the direction of the knock back will change - it's possible to outrun the boulder and have it knock back monsters it hits \"backwards\", i.e. in the opposite direction that the boulder is actually travelling. Monsters knocked back will be damaged with physical and fire damage, and if you don't move the druid, will very likely be hit again and again by the boulder, dealing significant amounts of damage. The boulder will leave behind a trail of fire, like in &lt;a href=\"Blaze\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt;.\nMolten Boulder will stop if it hits an obstruction or a large monster that it can't knock back; it will then explode, dealing physical damage and fire damage in a small area, and leave a flaming patch.\nThe explosion when the boulder hits the end of ground is the only way for a fire druid to reliably deal damage to water lurking monsters, and flying monsters that are flying over water, lava, or void but are near enough to ground for the boulder's explosion to hit them.\nMolten Boulder is weak in places with lots of obstructions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Field\"&gt;Stony Field&lt;/a&gt;, and is weak (but barely usable) against large fire immunes. It is excellent against non-fire immune small and medium monsters, and is at least reasonable against fire immune small and medium monsters. As mentioned, it is the only fire skill capable of reliably damaging water lurkers.\nAs one of the two fire skills that deal a non-trivial amount of physical damage, you need to practice using this skill in order to get past the in Hell Act I.\n&lt;a href=\"Fissure\"&gt;Fissure&lt;/a&gt;.\nFissure opens up several vents on the ground that deal damage. The pattern of opening vents is pseudo-random.\nIt's possible to cast two Fissures on top of each other, but it is recommended that you move the pointer slightly for the second cast. If you cast in exactly the same point both times, the same pattern of vents is opened, which is usually less useful against nonmoving crowds, and is less likely to affect moving monsters.\nFissure is powerful in two, usually non-overlapping cases:\nDue to the way that the game computes whether a fissure vent \"hits\", fissure deals very high damage in the above two cases.\nIn addition, a monster in hit recovery animation will \"not\" be damaged by fissure. This cuts down on fissure damage.\nIdeally, fissure is best used against a large, tight group of non fire immune monsters with large lives (so that the damage of the fissure will not put the monsters into hit recovery), or against a small moving group. Against a moving group, fissure is usually harder and riskier to use.\nParadoxically, due to the way that the game considers whether a fissure vent \"hits\", hitting a small, not so tightly knit group of monsters mixed with fire immunes and non-fire immunes will deal very high damage to the non fire immunes (to be vaguely technical, the vent \"missile\" has a timer that is reset whenever it hits a monster, with a large delay if the vent hits the same monster, but with a smaller delay if the monster is immune or if the vent hits several monsters at once, hence the increased damage in the case of tight groups or fire immunes. Each vent has a different sense of \"the last monster that got hit\", so moving monsters will be damaged more often by stepping on different vents).\nFissure is weak in small areas limited by non-ground (water, void, lava, forests, dungeon wall, etc.), since a vent might open in non-ground area, but fail due to the area not being on ground, reducing the vents actually opened.\nFissure is also useful defensively. Before going into unexplored territory, cast Fissure at the edge of the screen then walk to the edge of the fissure area. This lets you get some advanced warning of the presence of monsters if you listen for hits.\n&lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;.\nVolcano launches several fireballs from a designated target point. The fireballs land in a small area around the target point, but all of them pass through the designated target point. It is better to think of the volcano as targeting a single location and having a small amount of splash damage; it is location-based attack, not a wide-area attack.\nVolcano deals tremendous fire and physical damage to the designated location, and is optimally used for non-moving targets. It is also useful if you can cast them in doorways or tight places, where monsters have to pass in order to reach you or your minions.\nIt's possible to cast two Volcanoes in the same location, but this does not increase damage, because being hit by the rising fireball will prevent the monster from being damaged by another fireball for 10 frames, negating the effect of extra fireballs being launched. It helps to think of this as more of a \"refresh\" of the Volcano on exactly the same point rather than doubling the Volcano damage, unlike the case with Fissure.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Grizzly\"&gt;Grizzly&lt;/a&gt; minion is usually contraindicated, since they tend to knock opponents out of the Volcano's location.\nVolcano's fireballs can be blocked. Since act bosses usually have tremendously high block rates, this makes Volcano do less damage against them than expected. Firestorm is usually better against act bosses, but requires greater player skill to aim, unlike Volcano, which is just \"point and shoot\". Both are best utilized against non-moving monsters. Volcano, however, can damage fire immunes.\nAs one of the two fire skills that deal a non-trivial amount of physical damage, you need to practice using this skill in order to get past the in Hell Act I.\nGenerally, a workable strategy against the fire immune Fallen is:"}

A &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; learned in this art can summon a Golem constructed entirely from living flame. The Necromancer summons the Golem through accelerating particles of the air at an ever increasing pace. These particles then ignite and the Golem crackles into existence, seemingly out of thin air. \"\nGeneral Information.\nFire Golem kindles a flaming being into existence that answers the Necromancer's bidding. Like other Golems, it follows the Necromancer and assaults his enemies in hand-to-hand combat, striking them with its fiery fists. Its initially impressive fire damage rivals that of the Necromancer's Skeletons, although its killing power generally wanes at higher &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;difficulties&lt;/a&gt; as monster life and fire resistances inflate. Its real talent on the battlefield lies in its &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt; Aura, which blasts nearby monsters with pulses of fire. Although marginal, this fire damage attracts the attention of monsters struck by it, drawing threats away from the Necromancer and his allies.\nNecromancers who deploy large, mixed armies and fight in areas with few &lt;a href=\"Act%20boss\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; may find Fire Golems appealing. They cause more damage than &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt;s and require less micromanagement than &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;s. Against multiple opponents, the &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt;'s slowing abilities affect only a few monsters at a time, making it less worthwhile. Moreover, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Golem\"&gt;Blood Golem&lt;/a&gt;'s healing may be superfluous if the Necromancer himself rarely sees harm thanks to the large army he commands. Fire Golems release a large burst of fire splash damage when summoned or destroyed, allowing cunning Necromancers to bomb large mobs of monsters with well-timed spellcasting.\nAlthough powerful, Fire Golems have drawbacks. The mana cost to produce them is immense, costing the Necromancer a large portion of his mana orb. Fire Golems that frequently perish in combat can quickly become a cumbersome investment. They are also completely stonewalled by monsters who are Immune to Fire. The ability of Fire Golems to lure monsters to themselves can quickly turn maladaptive in some areas, like the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;Secret Cow Level&lt;/a&gt;, where its idle roving can attract large, unmanageable crowds of off-screen monsters. Finally, players have limited skill points to spend and can generally only afford to specialize in one or two Golems, making them compete with other Golems for a place in the Necromancer's outfit.\nFire Golems have a rare attribute known as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Absorb\"&gt;Fire Absorb&lt;/a&gt;. Fire Absorb converts a percentage of any &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage\"&gt;Fire Damage&lt;/a&gt; received into life gained. If maxed out, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Enchanted\"&gt;Fire Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; monsters might end up healing the Golem instead of harming it. This makes Fire Golems useful minions against fire-based enemies, although it may be unable to cause them any damage on its own.\nSkill Progression.\nHit Points: 1013\nDefense: 200\nAttack Rating: 120\nKnown bugs.\nDue to an error in &lt;samp&gt;SkillDesc.txt&lt;/samp&gt;, which has existed since Diablo II and is still present in Diablo II: Resurrected, the value of Defense shown is based on the total Iron Golem skill level instead of the base Iron Golem skill level. However, the actual calculation uses only the base skill level, which means the actual value will be either equal to or lower than the one shown.

Wall of Fire) is a spell in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGeneral Information.\nFire Wall summons a wall of flame that exists for a period of time. During this time, any being foolish enough to enter the flames will suffer Fire damage. The higher the level of the character, the higher the damage, and the higher the spell level, the longer the wall will last. Multiple firewalls do stack in effectiveness. Length of the wall does not change with levels.\nIt does deal damage to the character, if they enter it, which limits its effectiveness: one has to carefully position themselves and the enemy to keep the foes in the wall (most enemies do not attempt to escape the wall except for to chase the character). Most monsters will not advance \"into\" the flames, SPOILER! but this AI can be used against them: casting a Fire Wall in front of them, and then casting one on top of them, will make enemies stand and roast, since they're not smart enough to move backwards out of the fire. SPOILER!!! This is a very popular way to kill himself.\nThe spell can prove useful for a first time encounter with the first \"&lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;\" of the game, &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for this is that as the player is usually at a low level, even with the installed, even the toughest of heroes will have a hard time successfully surviving the Butcher's relentless and powerful attacks.\nAs multiple Firewalls can be stacked on top of each other, increasing the damage proportionally, this spell is very useful against monsters stuck on the other side of an obstacle.\nThe central sprite of the firewall (the casting point) does double damage. If Firewall damages the player who casts it, this damage is treated as a Trap (thus \"of thieves\" item will halve it) and is not &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;able. Each space in the flame hits every .05 second for the duration.\nDamage Calculation:\nLore.\n\"Magical fire feeds upon no earthly source, being fueled instead by the mystic energies known as Mana. While the heat of conjured flames may cause normal matter to combust and burn on its own, the flames themselves will burn as long they have Mana to draw upon. By carefully controlling the flow of Mana to a magical fire, its life-span can be extended well beyond that of a &lt;a href=\"Firebolt\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Inferno\"&gt;Inferno&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; were skilled enough to create torches that burn with an eternal flame, but those abilities have been long lost. With this spell, the caster creates a wall of eldritch flame that will burn until the Mana in that area has been exhausted. As knowledge of this spell increases, the rate at which Mana must be consumed can be better controlled and the Wall of Fire can be made to burn longer.\""}
{"id": "2968", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2968", "title": "Fire Wall (Diablo II)", "text": "Fire Wall is a &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLore.\n\"This skill allows the Sorceress to raise a barrier of flame to block her flanks from attack, creating a tactical advantage for both herself and her allies. Any creature unwitting enough to attempt to cross the barrier will feel the full force of these flames as they advance to their ruin. \"\nIn-game.\nFire Wall creates a wall of fire in a horizontal line in front of the caster. Its damage per second and its length increase with more levels. Fire Wall is arguably the highest damaging spell in the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;' arsenal. It deals massive damage, and if used correctly it can take down most foes instantly or fairly quickly. Multiple Fire Walls stack damage, though not too many can be stacked due to a short &lt;a href=\"Casting%20Delay\"&gt;Casting Delay&lt;/a&gt; and limited duration.\nSkill Progression.\nDuration: 3.6 seconds\nThe \"Radius\" (renamed to \"Range\" in \"\", i.e. wall length) values provided by the tooltip are invalid, because D2LoD had a bug which resulted in the length of the flames being always 4/3 yards bigger than described (base missile range was assumed 5 but was actually 7), which was then ported into D2R. Even if this bug weren't present, this value would still be only an approximation of what really happens due to difference in diagonal vs. horizontal/vertical walls; those values are very close to the \"range from tooltip + 4/3 yards\" value though.\nStrategy.\nDue to its low synergies, Fire Wall is often utilized in &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s (most notably the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Wall%20Sorceress\"&gt;Fire Wall Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;) since it can be easily combined with other skills without having to sink too many points into associated skills to maximize its damage potential. However, even though it doesn't synergize well, it is still incredibly powerful, especially with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Mastery\"&gt;Fire Mastery&lt;/a&gt;. The only problems are its rather limited mobility, its cooldown, and high Mana cost, and the fact that swift enemies and human players can often avoid it with ease.\nUsing Fire Wall on the other side of valleys, rivers and other obstacles can cause monsters to bunch up and take heavy damage. Laying down some Fire Walls, then leading monsters into it is a useful defensive application of Fire Wall. Another tactic to keep monsters within the wall is to run in circles around the areas of Fire Wall, until the Monsters within die. Monsters distracted by minions or party members can fall easy prey to Fire Walls. This works especially well with something like a &lt;a href=\"Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt; which attracts monsters. Some fast and erratically moving monsters, however, will generally avoid the Fire Wall.\nFrequent users of high level Fire Walls often learn to place the wall immediately next to their Sorceress, perpendicular to the direction of an enemy. With this orientation, the Wall actually extends directly toward the enemy, and the Sorceress is only a step a way from the Wall herself, thereby luring the enemy to walk down the entire length of the wall. &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt; can be used when the enemy nears the same end as the Sorceress to lead the enemy back along the Wall the other way.

As a result, the Fire Wall Sorceress can easily uphold her expertise with other skills.\nSince V1.13 the Fire Wall ability now has a synergy with both Warmth (4% damage per point) and Inferno (1% damage per point). As such it is no longer devoid of synergies. However the low boost granted by inferno and the usefulness of Warmth means it's still viable to use with other skills.\nWhen leveled up high enough, Fire Wall can do thousands of damage per second. The only problem is that Fire Wall, for one, deals damage over time in a set area. If an opponent is smart enough, they will avoid the Fire Wall and avoid death, or simply walk out of the fire without sustaining full damage from the spell. As a result, the Fire Wall Sorceress is not very useful in PvP, since most opposing players will simply step out of its way.\nAdditionally, most enemies in mode are immune to fire. Therefore, Fire Wall Sorceresses often choose to create a more versatile character:\nOne possible build is to combine the firewall build with an enchantress, creating a true party sorceress, buffing allies then using them as tanks to hold the enemy still. After maxing warmth, firewall, enchant and fire mastery there's still enough points to put into frozen orb or other low synergy skills. As such this build is a highly competent party build with decent solo ability, more than enough to walk through nightmare and with decent gear and a strong build can happily survive through hell alone.\nSince the Fire Wall Sorceress is often hybridized, finding equipment could be difficult; since Fire Wall is their spell of choice, finding + Fire equipment such as &lt;a href=\"Eschuta%27s%20Temper\"&gt;Eschuta's Temper&lt;/a&gt; is often preferred, but depending on what other spells are used, other elemental equipment or equipment that gives + to all skills may be more effective."}

When the Wizard receives fatal damage, they will have 1.25 seconds of invulnerability (cannot move or act during this time), be healed to full &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, and then ready to fight on. Any beneficial ongoing effects (i.e buffs) are retained: the character does not count as having died in the first place. This cooldown cannot be reduced by any means, only being reset by entering a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or in case of actual death.\nMeteor revival triggers \"before\" &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Anomaly\"&gt;Unstable Anomaly&lt;/a&gt; and other life-saving effects (as of 2.4.1).\nAs of patch 2.7.0, the Ignite effect has been heavily reworked: it is applied by &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; only, regardless of chosen rune and ignoring &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;Proc Coefficient&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; debuff is renewed with each application, but does not stack. It deals 3000% of total (with &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; skill bonus) damage \"per second\". This damage over time does not roll Critical Hits, but does take the player's Critical Hits Chance / Damage into account, increasing damage over time accordingly. \nOnce Ignite is active, it will no longer add to this &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; (additional Fire damage will not apply any more damage over time), but the debuff will last up to 5 minutes, or until either the Wizard or the victim die, renewing with every Disintegrate hit.\u00a0There is no limit of how many targets can be Ignited at a time. While ignited, the enemy will display a blaze, also showing a small fire vortex above the enemy's head when the effect is applied.\nNote that leaving the level or venturing too far (roughly 200 yards) from the victim stops the Ignite damage over time, and resumes it only when the Wizard comes back. Some monsters can remove it by disappearing: examples are the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Shadow of Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Demon\"&gt;Terror Demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Monsters that can turn invulnerable for a short time will take no damage while it lasts, but will not clear the ongoing Ignite burning.\nThe second bonus also adds a stack of Combustion per tick of Disintegrate (several of them per second, depending on &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt;), even if it does not hit anything. Stacks are added to the Wizard, not to the target. The Wizard can hold up to 50 stacks of Combustion, but the damage reduction is static, as long as even one is active. The stacks are \"not\" tied to enemies: instead, every tick of the attack period the Wizard loses one stack after one tick of not adding any to the pool. The cooldown of Teleport will be calculated based on number of stacks when it is cast, but no less than 0.5 seconds.\nThe last bonus empowers the Wizard even further: if even one enemy is Ignited, the Wizard deals more damage. Any non-Channeled skill with Fire damage will deal additional damage to the target, as long as it is resolved on the Wizard's behalf and comes from a skill: even a or &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; spells will qualify. The damage bonus is equal to 1 tick worth of Ignite multiplied by the current number of Combustion stacks. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; and other damage over time Fire spells work with the Combustion stacks, but will only deal extra damage the first time it damages each enemy with that specific \"cast\" (not tick of damage). Same logic applies to all other effects that leave lasting damage, such as : one bonus damage on a damaging hit per enemy per cast.\nThe damage buff and protection buff are multiplicative to other similar modifiers. The damage buff ceases to function if the Wizard is too far from a burning foe, but is restored once the Wizard gets back (and the Ignite effect resumes to deal actual damage)."}

If a &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; is nearby, each trail will target that monster and run through them until the fire dies out. The fire only lasts a few seconds at first (not reaching very far), but with increased skill points invested into this skill, the trails of fire can spread out much further.\nThe path of the two side fire lines is determined by your position and the position of your target. If you do not move and the target stays in position, then the paths followed by the two side fire lines will remain the same. Thus, if you can have a large opponent with a large amount of life locked in a particular location, you can shift your own position around until you find a spot where casting Firestorm will have all three lines hit that target.\nThis skill receives relatively high bonuses from its synergies: +23% damage for each point in two different synergies, reaching up to a +920% damage bonus from synergies. It can deal surprisingly high damage when used by a dedicated Fire Druid. Its weakness lies in the fact that Fire &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;Immunity&lt;/a&gt; is the most common immunity in &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe damage rated in the skill description is for per-second damage for a single line of fire, but the flame itself lasts about 2/3 of a second at any particular spot. Firestorm has a very short casting delay (&lt;1 second). Casting delay starts in the middle of the cast animation, therefore &lt;a href=\"Faster%20Cast%20Rate\"&gt;faster-cast&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; still benefit firestorm, but at only half the effectiveness.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 4"}

Not even &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s could give their offspring the immortality they themselves enjoyed. \nThe cultures the Firstborn fostered developed along very different lines. None of these cultures had writing involved at the time. &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt; believed (or at least claimed) that they embraced the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; completely.\nFirstborn erected &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Lilith\"&gt;altars&lt;/a&gt; in honor of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;.

Of those who remained, &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; sought to punish any who used their powers. In light of Inarius's tampering with the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, the nephalem diminished in power with each subsequent generation, eventually devolving into the mortal race known as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. However, the Firstborn appeared to have fared better than their descendants, and it is said that the Firstborn retained their immortality. However, the Ancients' powers were still diminished by the Worldstone's dampening effect. One group of Ancients led by Lord &lt;a href=\"Zir\"&gt;Zir&lt;/a&gt; reacted violently to this change of condition, and for their actions, were imprisoned in the underground &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;City of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is said that the Ancients took a guiding hand in the development of humanity before fading into myth.

These maps have a Fisher NPC that sells bait and exchanges any caught fish, and there are fishing spots next to them. However there are additional fishing spots on bridges and in some shore areas.\nAfter obtaining bait, the rod can be cast in a fishing area. A gauge appears at the top of the screen that is divided into 3 sections. The first section takes 1 minute to fill, the second one takes an additional 1 minute 30 seconds (2 minutes 30 seconds total) and the third one takes an additional 2 minutes 40 seconds (5 minutes 10 seconds total). Fish will randomly bite and can be reeled in or let go. Even if the fish is let go, the bait is used up. A bite will no longer disappear when the timer hits around 5 minutes. When reeling in a fish, a different gauge replaces the time gauge. A window randomly goes left or right on the gauge, and there is a marker that must be kept within the window. The marker normally moves left, and clicking moves it to the right. If the marker stays outside the window for too long, the fish gets away. The timer won't reset if the bite started before the 5 minute mark. The size of the window depends on the rarity of the fish, with rarer fish having smaller windows, which can be used as a clue if looking for a specific fish as any fish that is not the desired rarity can be let go to avoid restarting the timer.\nThe rarity of the fish depends on the section of the timer that was active during the bite: the first section results in a Common fish, the second one results in a Magic fish, and the third section results in a Rare or higher quality fish. If the bar moves to a different section while the bite is active, the fish will still be of the rarity corresponding to the section the bite started in.\nA player can carry up to 20 fish. Turning in fish rewards gold and equipment.\nThere is a small chance to fish up a chest that contains items and a &lt;a href=\"Normal%20Gems\"&gt;Normal Gem&lt;/a&gt;.

Both &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; and Spell Level increase damage, but not the radius. \nThe same spell is used by &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s in the deeper levels, if player approaches them in close combat.\nOn cast, it creates a small ring of energy around the caster that damages all nearby enemies. This damage cannot be &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;ed.\nDamage Calculation:\nThis spell may appear to be powerful, but it's hampered by bugs and does far less damage than displayed, especially when compared to the Mages' version. There are actually two spells cast; the first hits targets the left and below the character, while the second (less damaging) flash hits the three to the upper right.\nLike other timed spells, Flash hits once every .05 seconds, for a total of 19 attempts in just less than a second.\nBugs.\nFlash deals far less damage than the (very high) listed value. This is not due to a bug in the spell's function, but to incorrect listed damage.\nPut simply, Flash only deals strong damage to 5 of the squares in range; it hits for far lower damage to the other three adjacent squares. The three weak squares are illustrated by the image to the right (monster alive after cast were hit by weaker spell).\nLore.\n\"The Flash spell was created to fight the servants of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, whose minions prefer to surround their enemies and attack from all sides simultaneously. To properly form most incantations, the caster must be able to concentrate long enough to complete the necessary invocations and gestures. With this spell, the caster draws in as much Mana as possible as quickly as possible from the surrounding area and concentrates it into a single point within his own body. This Mana is then released in a single burst of raw energy that dissipates very rapidly \u2013 and very violently. While this spell is usable only in close combat, it is extremely potent and will strike creatures on all sides of the caster.\""}

The band aided a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; outside the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Blackstone%20Village\"&gt;Blackstone Village&lt;/a&gt;, fending off the Bloodsworn attacking them. Apart from Kashya, Flavie and the other Rogues engaged in pursuit, but the Bloodsworn ambushed them, wounding many Rogues, and forcing them to retreat. Flavie reported to Kashya, who ordered her and the other Rogues to pull back to their battle camp, before ordering a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diabloi%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; to pursue the Bloodsworn. Flavie gave them directions to their &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn%20Den\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;, warning the hero(es) not to underestimate their enemy. \nLater, Flavie and a group of Rogues led by Kashya assaulted the Bloodsworn's hideout at the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Bloodsworn fought back ferociously, and Kashya ordered Flavie to hed back to the camp and ask &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; for aid. On the way back, she saw the same hero(es) she'd helped earlier at the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Inifuss\"&gt;Tree of Inifuss&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Hemlir\"&gt;Hemlir&lt;/a&gt;. However, she arrived too late to prevent Hemlir's &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. She told the hero(es) about what was happening at the tower. They told her that as long as the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt; continued to exist, &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt; (leader of the Bloodsworn) could not be slain.

After completion of the quest, she warns them about the dangers ahead.\nFlavie will attack any monsters close to her.

Akara will tell the player of a cave filled with &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; that may possibly attack the camp, and requests that they be destroyed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Evil%20%28Area%29\"&gt;Den of Evil&lt;/a&gt; is located in the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Moor\"&gt;Blood Moor&lt;/a&gt;, just outside of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt;. The cave is noticeably dark and is home to , &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;Fallen Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Gargantuan%20Beast\"&gt;Gargantuan Beast&lt;/a&gt;s. A &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; Zombie named &lt;a href=\"Corpsefire\"&gt;Corpsefire&lt;/a&gt; is also located in the cave, usually at the end opposite of the entrance.\nNearing the end of the quest, the quest will update itself with how many monsters are left within the Den. Once all monsters have been cleared, the Den will be flooded with light, and the player will be able to claim his or her reward from &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt;. Along with earning her trust, the player receives one free &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Point\"&gt;Skill Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter patch 1.13, she will also give the option to reset all skill and attribute points, once per difficulty.\nCompleting this quest prompts &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt; to activate the next quest in Act I, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Blood Raven&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThis early in the game, the player's defenses are low and life is also low, so it is better to be prepared. Remember to attack Shamans first before attacking their minions, as they can resurrect Fallen Ones.\nIt is important to keep in mind that every monster in the Den must be slain for this quest to be completed, so make sure to be meticulous in the slaughter. Fallen Ones will often run and hide in corners, making finishing this quest somewhat troublesome.\nLike many quests in \"Diablo II\", the Den of Evil can be skipped entirely, as it is not necessary to finish the game. However, it is relatively safe, and its reward of one skill point is very valuable, so it is highly recommended.\nEaster Egg.\nAfter killing most of the creatures and having the quest notice pop up stating how many monsters are left in the den, if a &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; is left alive and resurrects more than five &lt;a href=\"fallen\"&gt;fallen&lt;/a&gt;, the quest counter will instead read \"Monsters Left: 666\"."}

This cavern has rocky dirt floors, the walls are naturally formed stone, and the only sign of civilization is the tripod-mounted braziers that light the musty cave.\nLocation.\nThe Den of Evil is the only side area in the Blood Moor. It appears as a cave decorated on the outside by certain symbols - most notably, the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt; banner indicating the nature of its inhabitants.\nThough the Den of Evil is a side area cave, it contains no &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;golden chest&lt;/a&gt; in it. This is probably because players are most probably starting the game at Level 1 when they start this quest. Hence, giving them the opportunity to get magic items at such low levels would lead to game imbalance.\nInhabitants.\nThe Den of Evil is inhabited by many groups of Fallen led by &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;Fallen Shaman&lt;/a&gt;.

It has the standard &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Golden Chest&lt;/a&gt; and Fallen Shamans with Fallen Ones seen in the second levels of other caves. It can be presumed it didn't make it in as to keep the first cave and quest location more simple for the beggining \"tutorial\" phase of the game.\nFurthermore before Cave Level 2 entry file (A1L14) there is an entry file named \"A1L13\", if used in a map it displays: Entering The Den Level 2."}

The landscape is torn by rifts and chasms, dark smoke still rises from some of the cracks in the surface. The bones of monstrous creatures, vast in number, are scattered across the surface of the land and embedded in it, numbering perhaps one hundred different species. No-one has been able to identify the creatures that these skeletons belong to. These, in addition to the skeletons of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; prisoners sent into the Sands to die, have been picked clean over the centuries by the elements as well as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Hawk\"&gt;Blood Hawk&lt;/a&gt;s and desperate &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Desolate Sands were once a tree-lined oasis of surpassing beauty, and the site of &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clan&lt;/a&gt; battles against the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; thousands of years ago. According to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; scholar, &lt;a href=\"Brast\"&gt;Brast&lt;/a&gt;, the current conditions were created when one such battle resulted in &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;explosive energies&lt;/a&gt; that devastated the entire area. Legend had it that there were no survivors from that battle, or at least none that ever left the land, that the magic twisted them, possibly into cannibals or worse, and that they slept beneath the sands waiting for darkness. Travelers were warned not to drink anything, nor sleep in the region.\n&lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; had a policy of sending prisoners convicted of treason to die upon the Sands, given nothing but the clothes on their backs. Insane Mages were also banished here. Over thousands of years of records, &lt;a href=\"Lysra\"&gt;Lysra&lt;/a&gt; was unable to find a single account of a prisoner surviving exile. Zakarum tried to end the emperors' policy of exile, but they had no luck, and prisoners were still sent into the area to die.\nIn-game.\nThe Desolate Sands are an area in \"Diablo III\"."}

We hope you enjoyed last quarter's dive into the playstyles of our final launch class, the Necromancer. That blog and our previous updates can be read here if you missed out.\nToday we'll be talking about some of what\u2019s coming to Diablo IV after the game ships. This is often referred to as a live service, and we have ambitious plans here. Our associate game director for live service, Joseph Piepiora, and our director of product, Kegan Clark, are here to talk details. Everything they describe is in addition to delivering the complete Diablo IV experience, the rich endgame features you expect at launch, and regular expansions that continue the story.\nMany of you enjoy the Seasons in Diablo II: Resurrected and Diablo III and have asked for more extensive season support. We agree one of the most fun ways to play Diablo is through Seasons, so we're making the first one available soon after launch and building a dedicated team to bring you up to four Seasons a year, each with major new features, questlines, enemies, legendary items, and more.\nDiablo IV's Seasons are modeled after those of Diablo III. When a new season begins, all the characters from the prior season are moved to the Eternal Realm, where you can keep playing, leveling up, and collecting loot. To play in the new season, you\u2019ll create a fresh character and experience the new seasonal features and content while leveling up alongside other players. This, along with capping paragon points in Diablo IV, ensures that your effort and skill\u2014measured by both dexterity and theorycrafting \u2014determine how powerful your character becomes. It also allows players who missed the last season to participate. This season design requires that all sources of character power come from playing the game, so you will not be able to pay for power in Diablo IV.\nYou can read about our monetization philosophy below, along with details on how the Cosmetics Shop and optional Season Pass support and enhance Seasons.\nWe hope you enjoy this update and look forward to your thoughts and reactions. Later this year, we'll be testing our endgame systems. We'll also be testing features that enable players who have completed the game's campaign to flag it as completed for new characters they create and allow characters on the eternal realm to contribute to seasonal progress. Finally, stay tuned for a winter blog.\nWe're grateful to have you with us on this journey. Thank you for playing the games we make.\n-Joe Shely,\nGame Director, Diablo IV\nSeasons.\nHello, Heroes of Sanctuary! My name is Joe Piepiora, the associate game director responsible for game systems and our live service. Today I finally get to talk about our high-level plans for Diablo IV\u2019s seasonal content updates. We are in the exciting position of delivering the high-quality, quarterly releases Diablo IV deserves.\nAs our game director Joe Shely noted earlier, we are pursuing a seasonal reset structure for our live game\u2014Diablo is a game about choice and possibility! We feel it is at its best when you get a clean slate to start from in a season, picking a class, customizing your build, and chasing down items that support it along the way. This affords us several advantages and chief among them is that we can really shake the box of Diablo IV with each season, creating unique experiences with each of our quarterly releases.\nNew Content.\nWe think it is important that players see that the game is changing in meaningful ways. Each season will be released with a fresh new gameplay feature and questline that introduces new challenges, mysteries, and possibilities into the level-up experience. This is something players should begin to experience before the end of their first hour of play. One of the benefits of our seasonal direction is that it enables fun, new ways to play throughout your character\u2019s progression.\nEach Season's new questline will reveal more of the world of Sanctuary and your character\u2019s place in it. Here, we get an opportunity to introduce new characters or revisit old ones while exploring the lore and content of the season.\nRefreshing the Meta.\nDiablo IV is a vast game\u2014we want to ensure that we are keeping existing content and features in a place where they remain fun and challenging to participate in. To that end, we will always be evaluating the state of the game to regularly revitalize older stomping grounds.\nOne clear example here is looking at the relative balance between classes, builds, and powers. Diablo is a game that is about creating exciting, overpowered builds, and while we don\u2019t want to balance the fun out of the experience, we don\u2019t want to create situations in which imprecise tuning squash creativity.\nWe will also be constantly adding new legendary and unique items, paragon boards, glyphs, and more that will continually refresh the meta and create new build opportunities.\nImproving the Game.\nWith each season we\u2019ll be looking into ways to simply improve the player experience. As a live product, we intend to hold Diablo IV to an exceedingly high standard. We are here to build a live game that we can be proud of, and the best way to do that is by engaging our players directly.\nBased on feedback that we receive, the team will identify quality-of-life features and polish work that can be done to improve the overall game experience and invite the community to vote upon their priority. While we cannot always flip a switch to tackle something immediately, you can rest assured that we will be active in improving the quality of the game experience for years to come.\nLive Events.\nSanctuary is a living world filled with people, creatures, and factions striving to meet their own ends. Attentive players should be on the lookout for new live events that will crop up each season. An example of a live event might be the warning of an impending invasion of the Drowned, which may last a weekend, or the arrival of a strange peddler amidst the crags of the Dry Steppes. These events provide gateways to new adventures and unique rewards.\nSeason Journey.\nAlongside our major season releases, we see the return of the Season Journey. Players are pushed to explore Sanctuary anew, earning limited-time rewards with each chapter of the Season Journey that is completed. Completing the Season Journey is quite a feat, with the final step demanding the character overcome an extremely difficult encounter with an especially deadly foe. With future Season Journeys, we are regularly adding pinnacle-level difficulty challenges for players to complete, proving their worth and earning unique cosmetic rewards besides.\nLike Diablo III, the Season Journey is free for all players. Completing Season Journey objectives also grants progress toward the Season Pass, a new feature with a battle pass-style progression that advances alongside the Season Journey, enabling players to earn even more rewards just by playing. The Season Pass has both free rewards (cosmetics, premium currency, and gameplay boosts) and paid rewards (cosmetics and premium currency only).\nSeason Pass.\nHey everyone, I\u2019m Kegan Clark, director of product for Diablo IV here to talk about our approach to live service monetization in Diablo IV. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, Diablo IV will be a full-price game with a Cosmetics Shop and Season Pass\u2014none of which provide any pay-for-power options. Our goal in designing our in-game purchases is that we want to create beautiful things which add value to players\u2019 experience of the game.\nThe scale of Diablo IV Seasons is much more ambitious than what we've done in the past on Diablo III, with a large development team dedicated to Seasons after launch. Diablo IV will be supported by an army of developers for years to come. With all the exciting plans we have for Seasons, we want them to be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of whether they buy anything from the shop. I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to finally share more with the community about our live service model.\nSeasons will add all-new gameplay, quests, challenges, meta changes, and quality-of-life improvements. The Season Pass recognizes players\u2019 dedication, with greater rewards unlocking as you play more throughout the Season. There will be a single track of rewards with Free Tiers that are unlocked just by playing the game and leveling, and Premium Tiers which provide no in-game power or advantage over other players. The Free Tiers of the pass will provide gameplay boosts to all players\u2014things which make the journey of leveling up a fresh seasonal character faster and more streamlined. In contrast, the Premium Tier rewards are focused on aesthetics, providing a huge value in the form of cosmetics and Premium Currency. Many of the rewards embody the seasonal theme, helping players show off their participation in that Season.\nLet\u2019s talk more about what players can expect:\nThe Season Pass has Free Tiers and Premium Tiers. Throughout the pass players can earn a variety of rewards for free, just by playing. At any point during the Season, players can purchase the Premium Pass to unlock the ability to earn Premium rewards tiers containing seasonally themed Cosmetics and Premium Currency.\nThe Season Pass awards cosmetics. Like the Shop, these don\u2019t affect gameplay. Additionally, certain cosmetic types are exclusive to the Season Pass.\nThe Season Pass awards Premium Currency. Players can spend this currency on cosmetics offered in the shop.\nThe Season Pass awards free Season Boosts. Boosts accelerate players\u2019 progress for the duration of the Season. For example, a Season Boost might accelerate XP earned to make leveling multiple characters within a season faster. Because they affect gameplay, Season Boosts are free rewards for all players. We want to be clear that players can\u2019t unlock Season Boosts more quickly through purchases--there is no way to unlock more boosts, or boosts at a faster pace, by spending money.\nPlayers can purchase Tiers-but they won\u2019t speed up getting Season Boosts. Players can\u2019t upgrade Season Boosts just by purchasing Tiers, because they\u2019ll also have to earn level milestones to apply them. All other Tier rewards can be unlocked instantly by purchasing Tiers. In other words, there\u2019s no way to shortcut getting Season Boosts by buying Tiers; they must be earned.\nThe Season Journey accelerates Season Pass progression. While any play style can progress through the Season Pass, min-maxers can focus on Season Journey objectives to advance more quickly.\nThe Shop.\nThe way we approached designing the Shop and the cosmetics within it was by thinking about the experience we want players to have. We want buying things to feel good--before, during, and after purchase. So, if players choose to buy something, it should be because they want to, not because they feel like they have to. It should also be clear to players exactly what they are getting before they choose to buy, with no unpleasant surprises.\nThe Shop\u2019s cosmetics build on top of the foundation of a huge variety of transmogs from weapons and armors players will find in-game. It\u2019s also important to us that the Shop is grounded within Diablo\u2019s world, so our cosmetics are holistic fantasies, the individual components of which can be mixed and matched with transmogs from armors acquired in-game for endless customization options.\nLet\u2019s talk more about what players can expect:\nThe Shop sells cosmetics for Premium Currency. Cosmetics give players even more options to customize the visual appearance of their characters. Nothing offered in the Shop grants a direct or indirect gameplay advantage. So, while many of these may look like powerful pieces of gear, they have no in-game stats.\nThe Shop is optional. Players can experience all core and seasonal gameplay features without spending money. Our goal is for players to enjoy going to the Shop, buy something when it catches their fancy, and walk away happy with what they bought.\nThe Shop is transparent. It\u2019s important that players know exactly what to expect before making a purchase. We\u2019ve built preview functionality that enables players to closely examine every detail of the cosmetic on their own characters before deciding to make a purchase.\nThe best-looking cosmetics aren\u2019t exclusive to the Shop. Diablo IV will ship with hundreds of transmogs unlockable from drops in-game, including dozens of armor sets of the highest visual quality. There are incredible pieces\u2014Unique and Legendary quality items\u2014for players to find without ever going to the Shop. The Shop offers more diversity of choices, not systematically better choices.\nArmor Transmogs in the Shop are usable on all characters of that class. Many of the cosmetics in the Shop are class-specific fantasies, which wouldn\u2019t necessarily make sense visually on other classes. Once you unlock a cosmetic from the Shop for a given class, you can use it on every character of that class on your account. There are special cosmetics exclusive to the Season Pass which celebrate the theme of the Season and look similar across all the classes.\nThe most important guiding principle behind the Shop and Season Pass is to create something players love, look forward to, and appreciate being part of the game. Cosmetics in Diablo IV create new ways for players to express themselves and never provide advantages in-game. Players will experience all the fun of Seasons, whether they spend anything or not. We intend to continue our dialog with players about Shop and Season Pass, and we\u2019ll always listen and seek out the community's feedback about it. It is our sincerest belief that we can work together with the community to keep Diablo IV a living, evolving world for many years to come! Thanks for reading, we\u2019ll be sharing more soon!\nClosing Thoughts.\nWrapping up this Quarterly Update blog, we want players to take comfort in knowing Diablo IV will continue to evolve its offerings post-launch. The introduction of new Seasons, alongside live events, and a returning Season Journey will work in tandem to breathe variety into the game, while also reinforcing its core principle: empowering players to experience Sanctuary as they see fit. We cannot wait for you to explore these systems in the future!\nDiablo IV Quarterly Update-June 2022.\nHello and welcome to the mid-year Diablo IV Quarterly Update. We hope you enjoyed last quarter\u2019s behind the scenes look at the art of Sanctuary and its Dungeons. That blog and our previous updates are available here if you missed out.\nI\u2019d also like to take a moment to congratulate Diablo Immortal on its launch. The Immortal team worked incredibly hard to bring Diablo to life on mobile, and it\u2019s exciting to have another way to enjoy Diablo.\nToday, we\u2019re going to look at the final launch class: the Necromancer. Now that it's been announced on the big screen, we can jump into some of the grittier details and mechanics of the class. You can think of this blog as a companion to that announcement, with our Lead Class Designer Adam Jackson doing a deep dive into the core playstyles of the Necromancer, some of its skills, and its unique class mechanic: Book of the Dead. We'll also look at a selection of the incredible armor and weapons that Necromancers can use.\nDiablo IV is committed to the principle of player choice. It shapes how we approach many of our systems, from character customization, to the density and layout of our open world, to the design of our classes and builds. As you'll see below, the Book of the Dead focuses on this idea of choice and what kind of Necromancer you want to be.\nWe hope you enjoy this update and look forward to your thoughts and reactions. Later this year you can expect to hear more about how we plan to support Diablo IV after launch, including our plans for Seasons. We're grateful to have you with us on this journey.\nThank you for playing the games we make.\n-Joe Shely,\nGame Director, Diablo IV\nGreetings, Heroes of Sanctuary!\nToday we are thrilled to announce that a fan favorite, the Necromancer, is once again returning to slay and subjugate their enemies with necrotic magics. We had a blast working on this iconic class, and we can\u2019t wait to get it into your hands.\nWe know that the Necromancer has a storied history in our franchise, and we are taking a lot of care to give players an experience that lives up to the hype. We have also spent a considerable amount of time making sure that fans of the Diablo II, Diablo III, and Diablo Immortal versions of the Necromancer see something familiar with what we have to offer while at the same time creating something unique for Diablo IV. Read on to see what the Necromancer is all about!\nClass Features.\nThe Necromancer has two different types of resources that they use: Essence and Corpses. Essence is their primary resource, which restores itself automatically at a slow rate. Using Basic skills on the Necromancer will also grant Essence, allowing them to cast their skills more often. Corpses, on the other hand, are the leftover remains of enemies who die near the Necromancer. These remains can be used to summon skeletal minions or to power various other skills, such as Corpse Explosion. In addition to appearing when enemies are killed near the Necromancer, Corpses can also be generated via various effects, giving you additional control over how often you want to interact with them. While there will be plenty of Corpses at a baseline level, we\u2019re aware that some players will want to lean into this resource, and as a result have included plenty of options to ensure that they are not left wanting.\nAs far as weapons and other unique gear, Necromancers use Swords, Daggers, Wands, Focuses, and Shields. In addition to these, they are also the only class that can use Scythes.\nAdditionally, what self-respecting Necromancer would be running around the world of Sanctuary without Curses? We\u2019re happy to say that you will be able to put these nasty debuffs on your enemies to your heart\u2019s content with skills like Decrepify and Iron Maiden making a return.\nPlaystyles.\nThe Necromancer has four high-level playstyles that players can choose between. These playstyles are Bone, Darkness, Blood, and the Army.\nBone\nBone skills are relatively physical in nature, and thus benefit more heavily from effects such as Critical Strike. These skills also benefit from having and spending large amounts of Essence, as they have various effects that can cause each of their individual attacks to be even more powerful.\nBone Spirit is back in Diablo IV, and it now has a unique twist that exemplifies what Bone skills are all about. Bone Spirit not only has a cooldown, but also consumes all Essence the player currently has. Once cast, a spirit of bone is conjured that seeks out the nearest enemy. Upon reaching them, the spirit will explode, dealing a high amount of damage to the target and all other enemies in the area. This damage is increased by a certain percentage per point of Essence spent, meaning that players who spend the maximum amount of Essence will deal a significant amount of damage to enemies hit. This skill can also be upgraded so that when it Critically Strikes its cooldown is significantly reduced, meaning that players who commit to generating lots of Essence while also having a high Critical Strike chance will get a lot of damage from this skill.\nAnother Bone skill that Necromancers will have access to is Bone Prison. When the player casts Bone Prison, they slam their weapon into the ground, calling forth a circular wall of Bone to surround the targeted enemy or area. Enemies cannot move through this space while the Bone Prison persists, which makes it incredibly versatile and able to be combined with many other skills, even those that are not themed around Bone. Bone Prison is great for blocking off hallways, trapping groups of enemies inside to set them up for an AoE attack, or for simply sectioning off a group of enemies to deal with later while you handle higher priority targets.\nDarkness\nDarkness skills use Shadow magic to overwhelm their enemies. These kinds of attacks tend to be DoT-based or attack multiple times in a short window, with various benefits and rewards being granted for damaging enemies in this way. Darkness skills also tend to have various debuffs and crowd control elements so that they can keep their enemies at bay while they die a slow, painful death.\nDecompose is a Basic Darkness skill that allows you to channel dark magic onto enemies, dealing damage to them while also generating Essence. Unlike other Basic skills, Decompose also periodically summons Corpses, making it much easier to ensure that you have a steady supply on hand to use for summoning Skeletons.\nAnother Darkness skill is Blight. Blight launches a ball of dark energy in a direction. Upon hitting an enemy or expiring, it deals an explosion of damage while leaving behind a defiled area, dealing periodic damage to enemies inside over time. This skill deals a high amount of damage to enemies who are standing in place, whether that\u2019s due to fighting your undead minions or to being contained via other skills like Bone Prison.\nBlood\nNecromancers can also use the power of Blood magic to siphon the life from their enemies. Not only do these skills tend to have defensive-oriented benefits, they also have many ways to turn that defense into offense for the player, empowering them and rewarding them for having large amounts of maximum Health as well as keeping their current Health total high.\nBlood Surge draws a small amount of blood from nearby enemies to the Necromancer that then expels a blood nova, dealing damage near the player\u2019s location. The damage of the blood nova is increased per enemy drained, which incentivizes you to be in the middle of a pack of enemies for maximum effect.\nAnother Blood skill is Blood Mist. Upon activation, the Necromancer disperses into a bloody mist, becoming temporarily Immune to all damage while draining the life of any nearby enemies that they pass through. This is a universally powerful defensive skill that can give you the time you need to regroup in those dire moments where you become overwhelmed.\nThe Army\nAs you would expect, Necromancers can summon the undead to do their bidding. We also allow players to specialize into empowering their army as much as possible, which includes various kinds of Skeletons as well as the classic Golem. One advantage to this method of playing is that it can easily incorporate the benefits of Bone, Darkness, or Blood skills, allowing you to have a great deal of customization to how you want to interact with your army.\nAs an example, we believe it will be perfectly viable to have a player pursue a Darkness themed army build with Decompose as their Basic skill to generate Corpses, as there is an obvious synergy there. However, if the player wishes to generate Corpses via other means, they can just as easily take a nostalgia trip to the year 2000 and just chuck Bone Spears at their enemies from a distance while opting for all of the Bone skill synergies that the Necromancer has to offer.\nWe went through a lot of iteration on how we want the experience of summoning the undead to feel for the player, and how much of their skill bar should be dedicated to this part of the class. To that end, we\u2019ve come up with what we feel is the best possible version to ensure that players have as much customization as possible over not only their army itself, but also in which other skills they want to use to support their own unique playstyle.\nIf a player wants to have the maximum number of summoned units possible then they will only have to dedicate two buttons to their skill bar: one to raising Skeletons and the other for their Golem. The Raise Skeleton button is a one-stop shop to raise all the different Skeletons a player can summon, and the Golem button is used to command the Golem to use a unique effect that is dependent on the type of Golem that is currently active. With this setup, we\u2019ve found a great balance between having the necessary tools for raising and commanding a Necromancer army while also leaving room for player expression in what additional skills they want to put on their bar.\nBOOK OF THE DEAD\nSpeaking of armies, what self-respecting Necromancer isn\u2019t wandering around with one? Well, actually, that might be you! While we absolutely have the full support you would expect to fulfill all your undead summoning needs, we are also giving some love to players who want a more independent playstyle.\nCue the Book of the Dead, the Necromancer\u2019s unique class mechanic. Right from the moment you log in, you will start with an extra skill on your bar\u2014Raise Skeleton. With this button, you will immediately be able to raise undead warriors to fight by your side. In addition to this, you will have access to the Book of the Dead. This is a space where you can customize your army (or lack thereof), with increasing options as you level your character.\nThere are three customizable summons in this space: Skeletal Warriors, Skeletal Mages, and the Golem. Each summon also has one of three specializations that you can choose from. As an example, you can have your Skeletal Warriors be Skirmishers, Defenders, or Reapers. Skirmishers are a more standard warrior but have increased damage and reduced Health, Defenders have bonus Health, and Reapers have slower attacks, deal damage in a AoE in front of them, and have a special wind-up attack that deals a high amount of damage. In addition to this, each specialized unit in the army has unique upgrades available to them, giving you even more customization over how each unit in their army functions in their overall playstyle. These units and upgrades will have synergies with the various playstyles mentioned above, as well as add other potential ways to play.\nIn addition to all this customization, we have also added the ability for players to sacrifice different components of their army for personal benefits. Next to each unit type in the Book of the Dead is an extra option to sacrifice the ability to summon that unit in exchange for a personal, permanent buff. These buffs are carefully designed and placed so that players can mix and match having none, some, or all the possible summoned units while still having relevant options to enhance their build.\nOur goal with this system is that there should be something for everyone to be excited about. There are relevant, powerful options to choose from whether players want to play with the full army, part of the army, or even for those who wish to forgo their army completely and play solo. We\u2019ve had a blast playing with this system so far, and we\u2019re excited to see the various combinations that you all come up with to push your Necromancers to the next level.\nFinal Thoughts.\nWe\u2019re so excited to be able to bring the Necromancer to Diablo IV, and we can\u2019t wait to get it into your hands. Whether you\u2019re a veteran player who\u2019s put in thousands of hours over many years, or a new adventurer in the world of Sanctuary, we hope you will have a lot of fun with what we\u2019ve been able to create.\nAs always, please leave us your feedback on what we\u2019ve shown you so far. While we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re on the right track, we know that the best ideas and the best games are created with input from the community. Thank you all so much for your patience, and for joining us on this epic journey through the world of Sanctuary\u2014we promise it will be worth the wait.\n-Adam Jackson,\nLead Class Designer, Diablo IV\nDiablo IV Quarterly Update-March 2022.\nHello and welcome to the first Diablo IV Quarterly Update of 2022. We hope you enjoyed last quarter's update on systems, itemization, and visual effects. That blog and our previous updates are available if you missed out.\nI'm struck by how much the game has evolved since our first blogs. It's difficult for these updates to showcase all the work our engineers, designers, artists, QA team, and producers have done--how do you show a bug that doesn't happen anymore, or explain how the planning in a burn-down chart resulted in a feature making it into the game instead of getting cut? While you can't see those things, you can see how systems like itemization and skill trees have evolved, incorporating your feedback and internal testing along the way. You can also see how much closer we're getting to our artistic and thematic targets of dark, low-fantasy gothic horror. And keep in mind the images you'll see today still represent a work in progress!\nMany artists need to work together to deliver Diablo IV with the top-tier visual quality we can be proud of and the promise of an immersive world you can wander through and enjoy getting lost in. The seamless game you play is a composition of many layers of art and visualization, from lighting, to environments, to props and interactives. Today we have artists from many of these layers here to talk about their craft and everything that goes into building the world of Sanctuary.\nWe hope you enjoy this update and look forward to your thoughts and reactions. We have exciting things to share this year, and we're grateful to have you with us on this journey.\nThank you for playing the games we make, and without further ado, artists!\n-Joe Shely,\nGame Director, Diablo IV\nChris Ryder, Art Director, Environments Diablo IV.\nThe team has been hard at work, and we're excited to take you behind the scenes on how we've developed the environments of Diablo IV. You will hear from our Associate Art Director, Environments, Brian Fletcher; Associate Lighting Director, Ben Hutchings; Lead Exterior Environment Artist, Matt McDaid; and Lead Props and Interactives Artist, Chaz Head. They will be sharing how they approach each of their distinct areas that ultimately come together to form the environment art of Diablo IV. While many of the locations we will be sharing are in various states of progress, this is an excellent opportunity to showcase the amazing work our teams are creating for the next installment of Diablo.\nThe environments of Diablo IV cover a lot of territory and visual real estate of the game: five distinct regions and hundreds of dungeons that you will experience. It is where all the monster-slaying, loot gathering, and exploration happens. Of course, none of this would be possible without the collective efforts of our talented designers, worldbuilders, engineers, environment artists, lighting artists, and technical artists.\nWe approach creating the environments of Diablo IV through a darker and more grounded interpretation than earlier installments. The aim is for believability, not realism. Believability comes through our use of materials and deliberate construction of architecture and artifacts you will come across as you play through dungeons and the open world. In addition, regional weather conditions, varied local biomes, and a sense of history set the foundation of how an object or place should look visually in a medieval world like Sanctuary. After all, Sanctuary is full of history, struggle, and conflict, giving us many opportunities to depict a diverse world full of compelling locations in a dark gothic-medieval setting. Even the wealthiest areas in Sanctuary are challenging to exist in. Leaning into these characteristics adds to the richness of the world. It gives us a springboard to elaborate on the space visually, giving it a sense of identity we can lock onto and build around. The atmosphere is almost tangible in places, with weather and lighting play a more prominent visual role in Diablo IV. When it rains, surfaces get wet, puddles form in ruts and hoof prints, the ground feels muddy, the atmosphere is heavy and damp. Contrast that by making your way into a hazy fire-lit tavern that instantly contrasts with the atmosphere outside, a rare place of refuge and warmth. We want to take you on a journey, hinting at a location's past or recent events. The satisfying part of our work is developing and jamming on a location's unique visual story, pushing and pulling the art until it becomes an iconic backdrop for combat, exploration finally screams Diablo.\nDiablo IV's art is built with modern techniques and utilizes physically-based lighting. As we handcraft locations across the Eastern Continent, we are mindful of our approach to support combat, navigation, narrative intent, and stylistic direction. To accomplish this, we filter concepts, locations, and final implementation through the dual pillars of \"old masters\" and \"a return to darkness.\" Using these pillars has been instrumental in keeping us consistent and aligned with the visual tone of Diablo IV. The \"old masters\" pillar gives us a lens to filter our art through, considering the techniques classical painters like Rembrandt used, with their controlled use of detail, tonal range, and expert use of color palettes. The \"return to darkness\" pillar is a through-line in everything from dungeons to lighting and embodies the idea that Sanctuary is a dangerous and dark medieval gothic world. Additionally, we play to the iconic Diablo game camera, choosing where to add or remove detail to help the readability of the gameplay space or accentuate visual interest as needed. It is a balancing act that results in a handcrafted look with a distinct visual style that expands on the lineage of Diablo.\nIt is exciting and inspiring to see the daily progress and hard work the environment art teams are creating. Let's jump into more specifics and hear from Brian, Ben, Matt, and Chaz on six locations we feel illustrate our approach and the concepts we keep top of mind when building the environments of Diablo IV.\nThe World of Sanctuary.\nMatt McDaid: \u201cI\u2019m excited to talk about the Open World of Diablo IV! We have 5 captivating zones to explore. Each region is fraught with dangers of their own kind. Many routes, and hidden corners to uncover. How you chose to make your way through this vast world is up to you. The Art and Design teams have constructed a contiguous world where you can roam from coast to coast, or high up into the glacial ridges. For the Environment Art team, we want to ensure each handcrafted location is distinct and immersive. Looking through the Diablo IV lens that Chris alluded to earlier, the Environment Art, Interactives, and Lighting teams strive to hit the tone that supports the \u2019return to darkness\u2019 pillar.\nSCOSGLEN COAST\nMatt McDaid: For the Scosglen coast the Environment Art team set out to tell the story of untamed, wild shorelines and headlands.As you transition toward the shores from inland, the coastal biome is first evidenced by the longer, more directional grasses that react to the driving offshore winds. The beaches are bleak and littered with seaweed, kelp and rotting carcasses. Rugged clifftops ascend high whilst promontories are carved by the continual pounding of waves below. Through the process of creating our biomes, the Environment Art team has set out to communicate that this coastline is rife with peril.\nFor the main settlements along the coast, it is important to us that they feel woven deep into the fabric of the coastline. Dwellings with deep-rooted foundations skirt the clifftops. In a futile attempt to withstand the harsh elements, these structures are comprised of whatever materials the locals could lay their hands on and are in various forms of disrepair. Stone walls, salvaged wood, and thatch for the roofs. A place of consolation for the brave fishermen that trawl these treacherous seas.\nFishing plays a significant part in the day-to-day life of these weary locals, so we\u2019ve latched on to that idea and placed emphasis on these villages being centered around fishing. By adding supporting elements like rudimentary docks and slipways, it really helps set the stage for the Interactives team to come in and layer on their culture kit throughout the area.\nChaz Head: Many of the props here are dynamic. The ships swaying in the ocean waves, the fish mongers\u2019 nets hanging to dry in the marketplace. Our main purpose here is to breathe life into the awesome architecture and terrain work. Our props and culture kits help provide that tangible real-world scale that the Diablo world represents.\nThe Drowned culture kit here is all interactable or breakable. When we set up these props, we push ourselves in terms of destruction. We use a constraint system to hinge specific pieces together. This allows us to orchestrate distinct, realistic and variable types of destruction.\nWe do our best to tell the story of what has happened here. The drowned dredging with them hoards from beneath the sea, littering their conquest with relics of long-lost cultures as they raid across the beaches of Sanctuary.\nBen Hutchings: As you explore Diablo 4\u2019s open world you\u2019ll experience a lot of variation in the lighting and weather \u2013 here in the Scosglen coast you can see the foggy, frigid atmosphere taking cues from highlands and moors. Across the game we\u2019re striving for a grounded and natural palette,allowing us to create visual space for gameplay that also achieves a gritty tone suiting the world of Sanctuary.\nOrbei Monastery\nMatt McDaid: The Orbei Monastery is an isolated and secretive feature in the rural Dry Steppes. While the Zakarum\u2019s presence has diminished, the Orbei Monastery carries evidence that places of worship for the Zakarum can still quietly function. Since the location here is in the desiccated plains of the Dry Steppes, we aim to push the notion of dusty grasslands with sparse vegetation. We\u2019ve made the conscious decision to add dark rocks that complement the pale blonde and rusty grasses. Poplar and Saxaul trees cling to the ground which really helps provide parallax movement on screen. This contributes to greater depth as elements in the foreground move quicker than those further back in the scene.\nTo help provide extra visual interest in the region, the Environment Art team created a Salt flats biome. Being able to have blue alkaline lakes skirted with salt-encrusted tufas, and vivid geothermal pools really helps add pockets of vibrancy to the Dry Steppes and create compelling natural landmarks.\nAgainst the efforts of the Zakarum worshipers, and like many of the buildings in Sanctuary, the Orbei Monastery is in a state of dilapidation. It is a goal of ours to visually communicate that whilst this place is in the early stages of ruin, it was once a prominent base of learning for the Zakarum monks. Compared to the native architecture in the Dry Steppes, the Zakarum architecture is more distinct and refined. These structures are adorned with ornate details, and often accompanied by elaborate statuary. Chaz will elaborate more on the interesting relics that can be found on the Zakarum estates.\nChaz Head: Many followers of Zakarum come to pilgrimage in Orbei Monastery. Caravans along the road reinforce this idea; making these wagons explode is always a fun time!\nAs you can see it has fallen on hard times. Much of the storage and keep-sakes of the Zakarum have been laid to waste. You can pick through the ruins of the abandoned monastery, perhaps there are still treasures to find?\nAs you venture outside the monastery into the geothermal region, many of its natural inhabitants to contend with. If you look closely, you will find their dwellings among the cliffs.\nKyovashad\nMatt McDaid: Our goal with Kyovashad is to really drive home the idea that this medieval settlement feels oppressive, frigid, and harsh. However, we still need to convey that this is a place of refuge afforded to those who reside within its boundaries. This is a militaristic settlement, so it is important that we give it a heavily defended presence straight off the bat. We believe it appropriate to provide a gradual buildup of smaller defense structures upon approach to the settlement. Doing this hints to you that something greater lies ahead. Upon reaching the gates you are confronted with steep stone, perimeter walls and a deep cavernous moat that wards off any unwelcoming visitors.\nUpon entering the town, you see the architecture typical throughout Fractured Peaks. Making use of the wood from the many forests in the region, structures here are clad with natural pine boards and birch shingles. As with most dwellings in Sanctuary these buildings are very much function over form.\nIn the video we can see a large portion of the southern end of Kyovashad, which contains the simplest of shelters. Some clinging to the town walls overlooking the glacial flow beneath. When you happen upon this area, we want you to draw similarities with slum-type encampments where densely packed living quarters are in abundance. The interactives team has done a fantastic job of really driving home that narrative with their culture pass.\nChaz Head: Kyovashad has many districts, with each one set dressed in unique culture kits. Here we have the slums where the downtrodden seek shelter from the extreme elements: we support this idea by layering details of frayed cloth, broken shelters, and general unhappiness. Can you believe this is an example of high-end living in Sanctuary?\nBen Hutchings: For this nighttime look at Kyovashad we can see the use of fog, soft shadows and bounce lighting to create a softness to the lighting. This softness is a core part of Diablo 4\u2019s lighting aesthetic \u2013 providing a natural and grounded frame.\nWe aim to give Kyovashad a thick and lived-in atmosphere with warm and earthy tones, giving it a sense of reprieve from Fractured Peaks cooler, frigid palette.\nDungeons of Sanctuary.\nBrian Fletcher: Dungeons are still that randomized content that you know and love from previous Diablo titles. However, we added new and exciting features that allow us to make even more dungeons across the world of Sanctuary than ever before. In order to support over 150+ dungeons, we\u2019ve had to shift the way we make environment art so that it's flexible enough to be used in multiple locations and not just in a single dungeon. We break it all down into what we call tile-sets. We would like to share with you a handful of our tile-sets, and a few ways we can mix and match them with props, interactives, and lighting to create dungeons that are varied, handcrafted and yet procedurally created. It takes a lot of hard work from many teams to make a Dungeon, and we are proud to show you what we have been working on.\nForgotten Places in the World\nBrian Fletcher: This tile-set is an example of how we have \u2018returned to darkness.\u2019 We want to take you deep underground to the darkest recesses of Sanctuary, where a mysterious (and gross) corruption has taken root. This ancient temple is a great place to push some primal horror vibes. The fixed camera is one of our best tools since it allows us to place assets in the foreground without blocking the playable space. Because we always know where you are looking, we can dial in and customize the layouts, vistas, and foreground elements to make sure there's a good composition. The spider legs are placed in specific locations for their unnerving silhouettes twitching in the background. Our dungeon design counterparts give us some great layouts to play with, which allow us to push the depth of each scene. We want you to have the impression that the dungeon goes on forever, and you\u2019re only seeing a small part of a large underground labyrinth.\nChaz Head: The props and interactives team seek to maintain the mystique and horror settings Brian described. Our hope for this culture kit is to make you feel uneasy whilst being rewarded for venturing forward. Nothing here should feel like it was crafted in Sanctuary by the people living on the surface. We were able to focus on different styles of shape language: monolithic and twisted. This is not a place you would want to explore alone!\nBen Hutchings: Here we can really see our embrace of Diablo 4\u2019s core pillar of a return to darkness\u2019. Our aim is to subtly lead you through the dungeon whilst revealing fantastically grotesque forms. In dungeons like this we focus a lot on silhouetting the player space and giving the scene a sense of scale and depth; this helps navigation and visibility but also shows the vastness of the environment.\nWretched Caves\nBrian Fletcher: The world of Diablo IV is incredibly large, utilizing numerous unique tile-sets to cover all the various zones, biomes, and cultures. In order to create so much high-quality content, we found clever ways to reuse our tile-sets and add enough variety to cover 150+ dungeons. All while providing fresh experiences each time. One way we can do that is by dressing up tile-sets with various themes. This next dungeon is a hidden druid resting site overrun with demons. As you travel through the dungeon, you'll see that it is covered with many druidic cultural items, such as talismans and charms. We place a lot of these items on a layer that can be turned on or off, depending on what the theme of the dungeon is. In one dungeon it's a druid burial site, in another, it's an uninhabited dark cave. Adding these sorts of details is a great way to add a lot of visual interest as well as visual storytelling. These assets were made by several teams, so this is a great example of many groups coming together to contribute to a final environment.\nChaz Head: We were able to expand on the Druid culture kit in this dungeon. In many ways the druid is an exciting return to the Diablo franchise, no less for Props and Interactives, expanding on this unique class by providing a full kit for its reclusive people. It would be easy to make the druid props fantastic, but we\u2019ve stretched ourselves to come up with fun ways to keep the culture kit grounded while not turning the druids into something they are not. I hope when you play Diablo IV, you get a sense of their magic while not betraying the dark and gritty world the druids reside in.\nFlooded Depths\nBrian Fletcher: New dungeon features such as seamless floor transitions or traversals are exciting, but my favorite new feature is what we call tile-set transition scenes. These are scenes that allow us to connect two different tile-sets together in the same dungeon. Imagine running through a crypt, only to find a hole in the wall that seamlessly leads you deeper into a vast underground cave network. All while keeping the randomized layouts that change with each dungeon run. In this final video we show two tile-sets joined together by a tile-set transition scene. The first floor of this ruined keep remains dry and fairly intact, but as you journey deeper into the dungeon, you'll discover that the lower levels have decayed from the endless floodwaters pouring in. This swampy ruin is perfect for the drowned to move in and fortify themselves deep below. You'll have to fight your way through their defenses and climb across the rope to transition deeper into the flooded ruined tile-set.\nChaz Head: I love this dungeon; it was one our first where we dialed in the style for props and interactives in Diablo IV. On the surface we have that definitive gothic medieval style fans love. Pikes, suits of armor and iron chandeliers. I hope this set reminds you of what Diablo means to so many of us. Part of that vision is the sense of danger of exploration; as you dig deeper things get gritty. As you descend you will encounter obstacles seemingly out of place. The drowned have invaded this ancient manor and dragged their obscene valuables across the floors. This gives us the opportunity to mix kits, and I hope you agree the mold encrusted assets are gross. Things should feel familiar but tainted by the sodden hands of the drowned hordes.\nBen Hutchings: It's exciting to be able to merge two distinct visual styles. Here we see the dark, foreboding hallways of the keep lead down into the putrid aqua tones of its depths.\nIn both we can see the same approach to lighting these dungeons, with different executions. The keep has an oppressively dark, very selective lighting scheme - hinting at paths through the corridors subtly with soft lighting. \u201dBy contrast, the flooded depths use putrid green and yellow tones to really give the dungeon a feeling of a damp, heavy atmosphere.\nThat was a quick overview of how we approach the environment art of Diablo IV. We love creating the stage for all the action while still delivering subtle visual cues that make Diablo games so iconic. Lastly, it's not too often that we get to share and appreciate the incredible work of our teammates and the progress of Diablo IV. We're glad you stopped by for a look and hope you are excited by what you see.\nThank you for joining us and keep an eye out for our upcoming blog update next quarter!\n-The Diablo IV Team\nDiablo IV Quarterly Update-December 2021.\nHello and welcome to the year-end Diablo IV Quarterly Update.\nWe hope you enjoyed October's deep dive into sound design, the atmospheric ambient tracks, and peeking behind the scenes of how game sounds are made.\nSince our last blog, we've been hard at work adding new content and systems to the game. We\u2019ve made big strides, with every build of the game containing a host of expanded content, new art, balance changes, and other iterations. In fact, the team is currently playtesting an internal release of the game that represents a significant milestone. We have much to share with you today as a result, so let's dive in.\nFirst, Lead Systems Designer Joe Piepiora will discuss updates to key elements of itemization. These include the return of +Skills on items, a new way to interact with legendary powers, and some early work on targeted drops. After that, grab a warm beverage and a comfortable chair as he walks us through Diablo IV's completely new end-game character growth system: the Paragon Board.\nNext, Lead Visual Effects Artist Daniel Briggs will describe the philosophy that allows our talented VFX team to create huge explosions and eye-popping skill effects while keeping the game clear and readable, even when there are many players and monsters on the screen at the same time. He'll also go into detail on how Diablo IV's new game engine has allowed us to make frame-by-frame combat more precise and nuanced, while leveling up our effects to take advantage of the new lighting system. Finally, feast your eyes upon a plethora of skills across all four announced classes that show off our skill-driven death system.\nWe hope you enjoy this update and look forward to your thoughts and reactions. We'll be back in the new year and are ever grateful to have you with us on this journey.\n-Joe Shely,\nGame Director, Diablo IV\nThe Itemization of Diablo IV.\nGreetings, Heroes of Sanctuary!\nWe are thrilled to once again dole out a whole heap of info on the state of systems and endgame in Diablo IV. I\u2019m Joe Piepiora, the Lead Systems Designer, and today I\u2019m going to share some details on two major features of Diablo IV: itemization updates and our plans for Paragon.\n+Skill Rank Affixes\nIn Diablo IV, the +Skill Rank affix returns. As players invest points in skills, they grow in potency, and finding items with +Skill Rank can speed that along. As a bonus, when the player equips an item with +Skill Rank for a skill they haven\u2019t learned, they will have access to that new ability. It\u2019s a great way to try out new skills before you\u2019re able to invest in them. Getting a lucky drop that nets you a skill you\u2019d like for your build ten levels before you would otherwise have access to it is a huge boost!\nAs Joe Shely discussed back in our December 2020 update, Legendary and Unique Items remain a core part of the Diablo item chase experience. We\u2019ve made a foundational change to Legendary items in Diablo 4 by allowing legendary powers to appear on multiple item slots. Now, if you\u2019re searching for a legendary power, like Martial Arts\u2014which enhances the Barbarian\u2019s kick ability\u2014you may find it on rings, chestplates, or helmets; there\u2019s no need to hunt for a specific item type any longer.\nNow, the real question is what happens when you find a power on an axe when you really wanted it on a ring? Or you found a great legendary amulet, but can\u2019t use the power? Well, that is when we get to introduce our new friend, the Occultist.\nThe Occultist can extract a legendary power from a Legendary item, crystallizing it into Essence while destroying the item in the process. That Essence can then be implanted into another Legendary item, overriding the power that was present in the item at that time. Essence material can also be stored and used at a later time.\nUnique Items cannot be modified in this way, keeping their fantasies intact\u2014and as their name implies\u2014unique.\nHunting for Items.\nSanctuary is a vast world, filled with forlorn trails through werewolf-infested forests, withered heaths crawling with cannibals, and fog-choked graveyards crawling with the restless dead. There are plenty of enemies and monsters for the hero to encounter. Each of these monsters seem to enjoy collecting certain types of items and will be somewhat more likely to drop those items than others. While bandits are fond of Maces, Crossbows, and Boots, if you\u2019re hunting for a new pair of Pants, you'd do well to kill some of the Drowned instead.\nIn past discussions, we\u2019ve received feedback that it seems deflating for so much of a character\u2019s power to be delivered through the gear that they have equipped. Customizing and planning a character feels less rewarding if it doesn\u2019t play a big role in how the character performs in combat. We hear you loud and clear, and in Diablo IV, we have placed a stronger emphasis on character power that is earned by all the little decisions you make while leveling up and exploring the world of Sanctuary. While we aren\u2019t talking about everything we have planned for character power today, I\u2019m happy to talk about one feature in particular, the Paragon Board.\nThe Paragon Board.\nIn Diablo IV, we have placed a heavy emphasis on build customization, ensuring that you can have plenty of control over how your hero grows. The Paragon Board unlocks for each class at level 50 and is a distillation of this focus. Your hero begins their journey through the Paragon system at the central starting tile of their class\u2019s intro board, and from there, you make selections radiating outward. Once your hero reaches a gate tile, you\u2019ll choose which new paragon board you would like to attach to at that location. The desired outcome is a personalized set of bonuses that will empower your hero and honor your dedication to their progression, that will remain fun to tweak and adjust over many playthroughs.\nThere is a lot to take in with the image below, so I\u2019ll walk through some aspects of what we\u2019re looking at here.\nThe Paragon Board is comprised of many fixed tiles. As the Barbarian earns experience, they will earn Paragon points, which are used to unlock a connected tile. There are a few varieties of tiles that I want to walk through.\nNormal Tiles\nThese tiles are straightforward, providing a small but meaningful stat boost. Normal Tiles are connective tissues that can be found throughout the board and are quite common.\nMagic Tiles\nMagic Tiles are found in clusters throughout the board and provide a potent, more diverse set of benefits. As you might expect, they are less common than Normal Tiles, but are still plentiful.\nRare Tiles\nRare Tiles offer significant boosts in power. Upon entering the Paragon Board for the first time, these represent great goals for players to chase, particularly once you\u2019ve narrowed builds down towards highly specific goals. Rare Tiles also have additional powers that unlock once the hero has raised an attribute to a sufficient level, requiring some choices to be made when plotting your path through the board.\nLegendary Tile\nAfter the first Paragon Board, each new board has a single Legendary Tile that can be found at its center. Legendary Tiles impart a new Legendary Power to the character that earns it.\nGlyphs and Sockets\nA Socket is a special tile that can contain a Glyph. Glyphs are items found throughout Sanctuary that, when embedded into a Paragon Board, confer various benefits based upon the number of active tiles within their radius.\nGlyphs can also be leveled up by delving into some particularly dangerous dungeons. Leveling up a Glyph extends the radius of their effect, allowing each one to draw power from or impart power to even more active tiles.\nGate Tiles and Board Selection\nA single Gate Tile lies at each edge of the Paragon Board. As you progress through the Paragon Board, you will eventually reach a Gate Tile, which upon unlocking will allow you to select a new Paragon Board to attach to your existing Board. Each of these boards has unique Tile layouts, new Magic and Rare Tiles, and a new Legendary Tile at the center.\nThe Paragon Board is extended from these Gate Tiles. Upon selecting from the Paragon Board list, you will be able to place the board down, connecting it to the newly unlocked Gate Tile. You may also optionally rotate that newly placed board.\nWe\u2019re hard at work on these and other features that we\u2019ll be able to share more about in future updates. Though for now that\u2019s all from the systems team. Thanks for reading and please share any feedback you have on social media, Reddit, or our forums! We\u2019ll see you in Hell!\nVisual Effects in Diablo IV.\nThanks for joining us! My name is Daniel Briggs, and I am the Lead Visual Effects Artist for Diablo IV. The VFX team gets to contribute to features across the entire game, but today we will focus on the work we do to support combat. VFX artists collaborate with designers and other art teams to create strong thematic identities for the hero classes and breathe life into monsters, in order to deliver the visceral, gruesome combat players have come to expect.\nVFX is an integral part of the combat experience for all Diablo games. With Diablo IV, we wanted to step up the fidelity of our effects using Physically Based Rendering (PBR), as well as better support the core pillars of gameplay: deep hero customization, itemization, and combat readability.\nVisual Effects - Philosophy\nEvery effect plays a role in the final composition of our game. It is important to understand the context of an effect, and how it best serves your experience.\nOne of our core values at Blizzard Entertainment is \u201cGameplay First,\u201d and this drives a lot of the artistic decisions we make while developing visual effects for the game. Moment-to-moment gameplay is the focal point within the composition of Diablo IV: it should draw your attention. To achieve this, we must consider things like player skills, monster telegraphs, traps, damage areas, and character states. The visual effects for each of these components must be readable in all areas and lighting conditions, so you can quickly understand what is happening and use that information to make informed decisions.\nIn the chaos of combat, you\u2019ll need to be smart\u2014seeing a Legendary item drop is exciting, but picking it up is not as important as reacting to a monster\u2019s attack that can one-shot Hardcore characters! Our goal is to balance the primary, secondary, and tertiary reads to help you understand what is happening. To do this, we reserve visually loud FX for powerful skills, like ultimate abilities, while weaker skills meld into the background. Each class has abilities that range from low to high in costs, cooldowns, and power. In tandem, classes have a range of visual intensity that increases with skill power.\nCombat Improvements\nTo enhance the feel of combat, we have made several improvements to the way damage is applied in our game. In previous iterations of Diablo, an area-of-effect (AOE) or melee skill would be a single area of damage that is applied on a single frame. Thanks to our gameplay engineers, we can now animate target areas (what we call payloads) over multiple frames, which allows us to line up the animated target areas with the animated VFX that play out.\nFor example, Whirlwind in Diablo III is a cylinder shape surrounding your Barbarian, which applies damage every couple of frames at a rate based on your attack speed. In Diablo IV, Whirlwind is an animated pie shape that animates with your character. AOEs expand outward with time, and melee swings match the motion of your weapon. Animated target areas improve accuracy to the way we apply damage in Diablo IV; it makes combat feel more impactful, and monster ragdolls more visceral. Animated payloads also add a subtle timing aspect to a variety of skills.\nAdditionally, we have revamped the way we apply hit effects to monsters, so impacts flow with the direction of a spell or melee attack. We use data defined in the animation and animated target area to find the most accurate place to hit a monster, and where to apply a directional physics force to the ragdoll. In so few words, if you hit a goat-man in the knee, the blood spray would come from his knee. The physics force applied to the goat-man\u2019s knee would send it flying as if you kicked the legs out from under him.\nVisual Effects - Casting and Receiving Light\nIn Diablo IV, we use a PBR (physically based rendering) lighting model, which means our materials look and react to light in a realistic way. This approach brings huge rendering improvements, but this can be counterintuitive to what a player might expect for class and monster abilities. As an example, think about what a campfire looks like in full daylight\u2014pretty lackluster, right? Next, imagine what a dust cloud or smoke plume would look like in the dead of night\u2014it'd be nearly impossible to see. To account for this, we\u2019ve built an engine and shader library that lets us break PBR rulesets in artistic ways. This ensures important gameplay moments shine through as clearly as possible while keeping immersive elements full PBR so they can realistically react to lighting.\nPrevious iterations of Diablo use primarily \u201cunlit\u201d particles, meaning they are not affected by the environment\u2019s lighting. These particles give you amazing control over what the art will look like: what you paint is what you get. The downside to unlit particles is that art may look too bright in a dark dungeon, or VFX color schemes may not feel cohesive within every environment.\nIn Diablo IV, we use lit VFX that meld into the environment\u2019s lighting, creating a more immersive experience. Using Whirlwind as an example (seen in the video above)\u2014in bright daylight, the blade reflects light from the sun. In a dark dungeon, it will reflect more subtle light sources, like torches. The dust kicked up by the skill is also lit by the environment, so it blends artfully into the world.\nIf we rely solely on environment lighting and follow true PBR rules, then gameplay readability is muddied, particularly in dark environments where a weapon swing would naturally be hard to see. To counteract this, many VFX have emissivity to cast light onto the environment. Several ultimates in our game will even allow you to change the weather and lighting of the environment for a limited duration. We strive for a healthy balance of gameplay clarity and thematic immersion.\nDynamic Player Skills.\nAt the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter what the art looks like if the gameplay isn\u2019t fun. One of the goals for creating player skills is to ensure that the System Design team has a variety of modifiers they can utilize to create meaningful skill trees, class mechanics, Legendary items, and Paragon Boards.\nChoices should affect more than your character\u2019s stats. Once we have a class skill we are happy with, the VFX team adds the ability for developers to dynamically change the size, intensity, and duration of a skill. The visual intensity of a skill will increase as you stack upgrades and items that increase the power of that ability.\nIn addition to these skill modifiers, we create variants of abilities that completely change the functionality of a skill or the damage type that it deals. These skill variants can be changed by the scale, intensity, and duration modifiers as well. This allows variants of skills to be affected by a wider range of legendary modifier groupings. Your skill tree/paragon decisions, along with the items you have equipped, will make your character look and play differently from other characters of the same class.\nEach of these ranges is handcrafted by an artist to ensure the art holds up at all supported sizes and intensities. We do not uniformly scale every piece of an effect when changing size and intensity; we modify things like spawn rate, velocity, emissivity, and color ranges to make certain the art still fits in the world of Diablo.\nWe want your character to look incredible as well! Our items are built in a way that allows us to easily apply weapon buffs to any weapon in the game. Not only will your legendary items do awesome things, but they will make your character look amazing as well. Here is an example where we apply the same fire and poison buff to several weapons in our game.\nSkill Driven Deaths\nSanctuary is a dark, gothic world filled with horrific monsters that do horrendous things. To survive in this bleak landscape, you must be merciless toward your enemies. We are bringing back a popular feature from Diablo III: skill-driven deaths. This system allows you to decapitate, bisect, freeze, shatter, eviscerate, and burn your enemies, to give a few examples.\nWith our new PBR pipeline, we can make blood, viscera, and gore even more realistic by having it react properly to the lighting of an environment. Every monster is built with a skeletal and muscular structure used for killing them in brutal ways. If your character is in the thick of combat, they will be covered in the blood spatter of nearby monsters. Over time, your character\u2019s armor will transition back to being spotless.\nThe Sorceress studies the art of elemental magic. They slow enemies with cold before freezing them solid and shattering them to pieces. They strike their enemies with stunning bursts of lightning, causing bodies to pop and sizzle. Enemies collapse to the floor and char to the bone as the Sorceress engulfs foes in fire.\nSome examples of death types that Sorceresses can trigger:\nFreeze/Shatter - Break frozen monsters into pieces\nChar - Singe the corpse of a monster with lightning\nBurn \u2013 Scorch the monster\u2019s flesh, leaving the remains of a charred skeleton\nThe Barbarian takes pride in their physical capabilities. Their arsenal of weaponry makes them deadly in close combat. With the power of their ancient bloodline, Barbarians crush foes into piles of gore or send them flying across the battlefield. Their brute strength is equally matched by their speed and ferocity as they unleash fury on the battlefield, dismembering limbs from all that stand in their way.\nSome examples of death types that Barbarians can trigger:\nCrush \u2013 Flatten a monster under the weight of a heavy object\nDecapitate - Remove a monster\u2019s head from its body\nCut In Half - Sweet :)\nBreak Lower Limbs- The monster\u2019s lower body is shattered, splitting several of their joints\nThe Rogue is dexterous; their attacks are methodical. Monsters are often oblivious to their presence until it is far too late. A precise stab from one of their daggers, or a well-placed arrow, is enough to bring most monsters to the floor. The Rogue finds the most opportune time to take on a fight, and they imbue weapons to gain an advantage. Shadow magic can make a superb distraction, but their shadow clones are as deadly as their blades.\nSome examples of death types that Rogues can trigger:\nEviscerate \u2013 Spill the insides of a monster\nShadow \u2013 Shadow energy deteriorates the life from a monster's flesh.\nFreeze/Shatter - Break frozen monsters into pieces\nPoison \u2013 The monster\u2019s skin melts off leaving a heap of muscle and bone\nFlay \u2013 Flay the skin from an enemy, leaving the muscle structure intact\nThe Druid is one with nature magic. They conjure storms and call down lightning on their enemies. They control the battlefield with gusts of wind as their animal companions tear the flesh from monsters. Druids manipulate the earth with nature magic, molding it to their will and bludgeoning enemies from afar. As their enemies approach, they see the innate power of the Druid, shapeshifting fluidly between an agile werewolf and a hulking werebear.\nSome examples of death types that Druids can trigger:\nRoadkill \u2013 The monster is crushed by a moving object, leaving a smear of blood on the ground\nDevoured\u2013 The monster's flesh is eaten away by a swarm of ferocious bites\nLightning Gib \u2013 Lightning causes the monster\u2019s body to pop, exploding into pieces\nMaul \u2013 The monster\u2019s skin is completely mangled, covering them in blood\nThat is everything we have to share with you today. It has been a dream to work on this franchise, and I\u2019ve really enjoyed the opportunity to share some of our development process with the community.\nThank you for reading our last quarterly update blog for 2021. I hope you found it exciting and interesting. We are actively listening to your feedback, and we strive to make Diablo IV the dark, gothic game we all want to play. Please continue to share your thoughts and provide feedback on social media, Reddit, and our forums!\nDiablo IV Quarterly Update-October 2021.\nHello, and welcome once again to a new Diablo IV Quarterly Update.\nI'm Joe Shely from the Diablo IV team. As a design lead who has been working on this dark, shared, open world action role-playing game from the beginning, I\u2019m honored to continue the vision of Diablo IV as its new Game Director, and I\u2019m humbled to represent the team pouring their hearts into this game.\nLike many of you, our team has been reflecting upon recent events. A lot has happened since our last blog and the hard work of practicing the values we aspire to must continue. In parallel with that important work, development of Diablo IV continues too.\nOver the past few years, we've assembled a strong team with incredible passion for Diablo IV. You, Diablo\u2019s fans, are a critical part of this team. With the help of your valuable feedback, we've steadily refined and deepened the game experience. We have ways to go, and while much has changed, our commitment to the game is unwavering.\nSanctuary should always be items glittering in dark dungeons. Tales of powerful heroes standing against the onslaught of hell. Lands where trials, treasure, and terrible monsters lie around every corner, equal parts familiar and boundless in its possibilities. Doing this world justice is a solemn responsibility. Today, we're taking a deep dive into the sound design of Diablo IV. Sound is a sometimes underappreciated yet integral element of the game's design, serving as a channel for communicating everything from incoming damage, to confirmation that a button press was registered by the game, to the intensity of a combat sequence. Try turning off the sound in a Diablo game sometime; you'll find your eyes have to work a lot harder to follow the action.\nSound also conveys the subtext of the world through which you adventure. It supports the rising and falling action of the campaign and immerses you into the ambient life of a region, transporting you into the game world. While you're reading through the blog, I encourage you to listen to the ambient tracks and pay attention to their effect on your heartrate and emotions. Try closing your eyes while listening to get a better sense of how much is being communicated.\nCrafting Diablo's sound requires science, art... and the occasional ball of fire. Sound Supervisor Kris Giampa and his team have fascinating insights to share in this behind-the-scenes look at how it all works.\nWe hope you enjoy this update and look forward to your thoughts and reactions. As promised, our next blog will cover endgame systems and visual effects. It's been a while since we looked at systems, and there's a lot we're excited to share. Let us know what topics you'd like to hear about in the future too!\nWe are grateful to have you with us on this journey. Thank you for playing the stuff we make.\n-Joe Shely,\nGame Director, Diablo IV\nThe Sound Design of Diablo IV.\nHello traveler, I\u2019m Kris Giampa, Sound Supervisor for Diablo IV.\nThe sound team has been steadily cranking away on the soundscape for a while now, and while we aren\u2019t ready to go in depth about the music side of Diablo IV quite yet, we wanted to start to give you some insight into some of the audio processes, content, and motivations behind the sound for the game.\nBefore we begin, we wanted to give you something to listen to while you are reading this quarterly update blog. Please enjoy the snowy, dark, and stormy ambience of Fractured Peaks below as you start on your journey.\nSound and music in games are the invisible glue that supports the storytelling and ties you to your character and their actions during gameplay. Creating sound for games is an exciting artistic endeavor that you can\u2019t see\u2014 only hear. However, you can feel it literally, with the soundwaves against your body depending on what you are listening back on. It\u2019s an amazing medium that can also affect how you feel emotionally while playing a game. A lot of the time it\u2019s subtle, and other times it\u2019s over the top, but always there to support the moment-to-moment gameplay. We hope you enjoy this dive into various aspects of the game\u2019s soundscape, and you\u2019ll have plenty more to look forward to and experience when you finally get to play it!\nNaturally, we want anyone and everyone who might be hearing impaired to enjoy the experience of Diablo IV as well. So, we are taking measures to broaden the experience to be inclusive for people with hearing or visual disabilities. There are various accessibility features underway that we hope to talk about more in the future.\nFor the Diablo IV soundscape we\u2019ve continued the tradition of gratifying combat, expanded upon the ambience to support the epic open world, continued to embrace the darkness in tone and gore while also trying to deliver a cleaner-yet-punchy audio mix that\u2019s adapting to the situations as you play.\nOne of the biggest goals we try to focus on as sound designers is to make the highest quality sounds to be triggered back in the game real-time and make them seem believable as well as grounded within the game world, tied to what you are experiencing. The randomness of audio playback is of the utmost importance when it comes to gameplay. If you think about real life, nothing is ever heard the exact same way twice due to your listening environment and the positioning of a sound source. Sounds never play back at the same exact sound pressure level along with the reflections within your environment and everything else happening around you at that moment in time. In essence, there are always subtle, real-life reasons as to why nothing ever sounds exactly the same. So, as sound designers for video games, we always strive to introduce subtle, randomized variation to not only the sound design itself, but also for when you hear it in the game. When we are doing our job correctly, it\u2019s something you tend to not notice and supports your immersion into the game world by backing up the incredible visuals, story, and end-to-end experience.\nAnother huge goal we have when creating audio for Diablo IV is to fill in sounds for just about everything that\u2019s occurring on your screen. Whether it\u2019s the world ambience, monsters idling offscreen, the tiny chunks of wood that are colliding off a wall when you break an object... everything should make a sound. We pour countless hours of effort into covering almost everything you see and don\u2019t see, while also keeping it subtle enough to not be distracting and just feel right. The devil certainly lurks within the details...\nHowever, just because we are filling in as much sound as we can, it doesn\u2019t mean you need to hear it every time. The playback engine within the game will not trigger too many instances of a sound if they are trying to play at the same time based on strict settings we create as basic rules. Because of the isometric camera view and being able to see so much on screen at once, we must limit how many instances of each sound will playback at any given moment. Once dialed in correctly, you tend not to notice that some instances were never triggered, and that helps with the clarity of the audio mix. It\u2019s a fine line we straddle during big moments with a lot going on screen.\nHow about we get on to more of the creative side of sound design? Naturally, there is no Diablo game without the heroes who do your bidding to vanquish the various evils that lie in your path. Let\u2019s talk about some of the fire-based Sorcerer skills that partly define the class...\nThe sound crew luckily gets to record all kinds of neat and unique sounds for the game so that we have plenty of sound source to edit from when it comes time to start sound designing. Sound Design is technically described as taking a recorded audio source, editing it, and processing it to be used in another medium. In the case of Sound Design for games, we\u2019ll record raw audio, re-process them, and edit it for our gameplay needs in various ways to achieve something that sounds clean, usable, and replayable for gameplay. The sound could be exactly what it was originally meant for or end up sounding completely different and used for something else entirely.\nSomething we always tend to need for a game like Diablo is, of course, fire! When time permits, we plan for some time to record sounds out in the field. For Diablo IV, one of the first big recordings we did as a team was a desert fire session before the lockdown for COVID-19. We traveled far from Blizzard HQ to record various types of fire sounds in the deserts of California, armed with multiple recording rigs and microphones. Thankfully, since it was wintertime, it wasn\u2019t too hot during the day and just a bit cold at night. While our main goal was to capture fire, we ended up capturing all kinds of other sounds we have used during production, like ambience, rocks impacts, foliage movements, wood impacts, door slams, wooden cabin creaks, metal impacts, and scrapes.\nSome of the fire recordings were then used specifically for the Sorcerer skills Firebolt and Inferno. For the skill Firebolt, we recorded sets of wispy and smoldering flame whooshes using a fire staff or a dried-out medium-sized log of wood and performed the sound in various ways around sets of microphones. Once we had a nice assortment of different types of fire sounds, we then edited and processed those fire whooshes into game-ready one-shot audio files for the casting and impact sounds, as well as longer loops for the projectile traveling through the air. It all comes together as one cohesive-sounding experience once we get it hooked up in the game to play back as the entire skill sound effect set for Firebolt.\nFor the Inferno Sorcerer skill, we then used other takes of the fire recordings and processed them to sound more aggressive and powerful for the larger skill. Just like Firebolt, there\u2019s a set of casting one-shot sounds, a set of loops, and another set of one-shots for when the snake form constricts its body. One cool thing about the Inferno skill is that while it\u2019s fire, it\u2019s fire that has taken the form of a snake. Because of this form, we are able to take some liberties on pushing it away from just fire sound design. We added some light snake-rattling SFX paired with a darker-toned ethereal end to the skill sound to make it feel a bit more magical. When all these pieces re-trigger in-game, it will always sound like the same skill, but be slightly different each time\u2014which increases the replayability sound-wise.\nDiablo games wouldn't be as fun if you didn't have monsters to slay. One of the most fun things about working on a Diablo game is the vast amount and variance of monsters that exist. This makes monsters ripe for both experimental and more traditional sound design, so let's dig into some monster sound design for foley and voice.\nThe combination of expert animation and AI brings life and personality to the creatures as they undertake their nefarious activities. When we start the audio process for a brand-new monster, I always recommend that the sound designers start by adding footsteps and foley (clothing or skin) to their movement animations. The moment the creature has footsteps and foley, the creature's cadence and rhythm of their movement really comes to life. It\u2019s at this point I consider that they are becoming grounded and attached to the world. This also dictates how vocal they might sound based on their patterns of movement.\nThe next layer that finishes the birthing of the creature into existence is their voice exertions. These are the grunting or yelling sounds of them exerting at the player as they attack, or the screams of pain as you take them out one-by-one. Each monster family can be quite different from the next, so depending on the type of monster, we might have intense sound design layers of animalistic-type sounds or even everyday objects that we will manipulate to sound like a screech or scream to create a layer within that final voice. Other times it can be simpler, as we\u2019ll hire creature voice actors to help create the core tone of the monster\u2019s voice that we can then build around with other sounds.\nIn the case of the Wood Wraith, it's almost fully sound designed from wood creaks and strains processed to extreme lengths and choosing the right sounds to convey emotion. The Wood Wraith was a blast to sound design as it\u2019s mostly freaky and creaky wood sounds, with a touch of very low-pitched human tone underneath it all.\nAnother monster we had the pleasure of working on is the disgustingly awesome Fly Host. This beast walks around birthing flies to attack the player. We ended up using some of our early gore session recordings where we ripped and smacked cabbages and melons, and stirred and squished mayonnaise, salsa and a delicious 7-layer dip into a not-so-great smelling slurry to make some great slimy and disgusting sounds to use in our sound design.\nOne of the audio pillars for Diablo IV is \u201cLiving Audio\u201d. What this means is that the soundscape is ever evolving and never static. This pillar is built deep into the sound design variations we create for all types sounds, including when it plays back real-time in the game\u2014 especially the ambience. Because of the importance of the massive open world, we wanted to give the ambience as much detail as possible and think of it on the same level of Hero sound design. Having the audio and the systems changing subtly over time is key to this pillar. We always want the subtle changes in ambience (that might not be very noticeable) less repeatable and feel more natural and immersive overall.\nThe World Building team has done an amazing job giving us huge amounts of inspiration in filling out the regions visually so that we can follow it up with immersive ambient audio.\nSince the player might be in the open world for a large amount of time, we wanted to support each exterior region with unique-sounding environments that also include subtle changes to the audio mix over time. To help achieve this, we use audio systems like real-time occlusion, high-quality reverbs, and environment reactive delay/echoes.\nWe\u2019ve provided some long-form recordings of in-game footage with a static shot where you can hear the ambience changing over time. Not only does this show some cool ambient sound design, but we also wanted to provide these to you for your tabletop RPG sessions, or even just to sit back and get lost in while working. The clips were recorded around 5-6 minutes and looped to be almost one hour.\nWhen it comes to the Diablo dungeon crawling-style ambience, we take a special delight in creating various and unique sounding experiences to heighten your immersion. Our approach to the dungeon ambiences is a bit less intense compared to the new open world, as we don\u2019t want to distract you away from a key part of what makes a Diablo game fun\u2014 dungeon crawling. This is one area where we can take more liberties in diving deeply into the hellish and creepy soundscapes while having the monsters onscreen to accompany the audible experience. For Diablo IV we are taking a more realistic approach to \u201cwhat you hear is what you get\u201d when within a dungeon. With long reverberation and sound occlusion, we want you to pay close attention to what might be just around the corner, mentally preparing you for the next pack of enemies.\nScattered around the dungeons are a plethora of gratifyingly great breakables. The Interactives team have been creating hundreds of amazingly detailed breakable objects in Diablo IV. For the amazing amount of detail they put into objects as they break, we in turn wanted to fill in every sliver and chunk of destruction you see with believable physics audio. Destroying objects in Diablo should sound just as gratifying and believable as taking down monsters. We put a lot of effort into making sure that all objects have an extremely gratifying break sound, while supporting the debris with tiny bits of audio to accompany the pieces that break apart and fly across a room. I\u2019m still amazed at the level of detail we have for the breakables in Diablo IV. One of my favorite things to do when I see a room full of them is to have at em\u2019!\nFinally, I wanted to talk a little about the isometric camera. It provides some interesting challenges when it comes to bringing all the elements of the game mix together. Because you can see battlefield at a certain angle out to a certain range, we have to make sure that the monsters existing on the screen are covered with audio, but have the overall mix not feel too cluttered, nor too empty. There\u2019s a lot of real-time juggling of sound playback based on priorities and importance to you, the player.\nFor Diablo IV we are able drive the real-time audio mix more than ever before. Because of the isometric camera view, we must trigger sounds on just about everything you see but focus your ears on the most important sounds you should be paying attention to. We've been carving away at audio mix states and an audio importance system that will allow certain important monster sounds to poke out when they are needed. Clarity of game audio mix is hard to achieve in a game where you can have multiple heroes as well as various amounts of monsters on screen, while having detailed ambiences means we need to craft different audible mix states depending on the situation.\nWe hope you have enjoyed this brief look into the sound design of Diablo IV. There\u2019s so much more to talk about, but alas, we will have to save it for another time. We welcome any feedback you might have about anything you have heard in the videos or learned about in this quarter\u2019s blog. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about the soundscape of Diablo IV!\nKris Giampa,\nSound Supervisor, Diablo IV\nDiablo IV Quarterly Update-June 2021.\nHello, and welcome once again to a new Diablo IV Quarterly Update! We hope you enjoyed the Rogue class announcement during BlizzConline. We had a blast creating the Rogue and open-world video segments, sharing them with you, and seeing your reactions. It was especially cool to share our updates as part of the larger Diablo family alongside Diablo Immortal and the all-new Diablo II: Resurrected (both of which I personally can\u2019t wait to play with you all).\nAs we transition back to a blog format, we will continue to spotlight different aspects of development. Today we\u2019re going to be focusing on Diablo IV character art\u2014player characters, monsters, and allies.\nArt is a critical part of what makes Diablo, well... Diablo. Our signature randomized dungeons would not feel like Diablo without the ominous lighting setting the mood as players uncover horrifying details around every dark corner. Combat only feels visceral thanks to carefully crafted animations and visual effects that make spells and abilities sing. And while stats might make or break an item, we often can\u2019t wait to get our hands on a piece of gear purely because of how incredible it looks.\nCharacter art is equally important as it encompasses two of Diablo\u2019s key elements: classes and monsters. The look and feel of the classes has always been one of Diablo\u2019s secret ingredients, each class instantly recognizable and imbued with a strong and unique personality. Diablo IV offers players more customization options than ever in a Diablo game, which makes achieving that result more challenging, but the outcome is well worth it. Your Barbarian is different from anyone else\u2019s but still feels undeniably like a Barbarian. With monsters, the focus has been on creating new foes and updating classics drawn from the pantheon of atrocities in our previous games, while using new processes and technology to their fullest.\nTo give us a better look at everything involved in this process, I now leave the rest of the update in the hands of our very own Art Director, John Mueller, and his team.\nWe hope you enjoy it and look forward to your thoughts and reactions! As always, let us know what topics you want to hear about in the future. Be sure to stay tuned, as we\u2019re planning to delve deeper into the topics of sound design and endgame systems later this year.\nThank you, and until next time!\n-Luis Barriga,\nGame Director, Diablo IV\nJohn Mueller, Art Director.\nHi all,\nWe are excited to do a deep dive on the character art for Diablo IV! This is a pretty exciting topic for our team, because so damn much has changed from Diablo III! You will get to hear from our Lead Character Artist, Arnaud Kotelnikof, and Nick Chilano, our Associate Character Art Director. They will be sharing a lot of cool visuals from our ongoing development related to character art that we\u2019re revealing here for the first time. There\u2019s a lot of \u2018work in progress\u2019 here; our goal is to give you an early look at content to get a sense of the direction we are taking. I don\u2019t have a lot of caveats, though, as at this point the work is a very good representation of what you will see when the game is in your hands.\nWhen it comes to the topic of character art, I can say we've had an epic journey during development, so let's pull back the curtain and take a look! First, I need to give a big shout-out to our amazing character art team, engineering team, animators, lighting artists, and technical artists\u2014without them, none of this would be possible!\nWhen I think back to the beginning, I think at the highest level, our goal was to make the characters in Diablo IV look as artistic and as hand-crafted as possible using the latest tools and techniques. Over time, our ambitions around what we thought we could achieve evolved and really solidified into what you see today. We wanted to use the latest tools and techniques, but we did have a concern about leaning into \u2018realism\u2019 in a way that wouldn\u2019t have that hand-crafted feeling we felt was fundamental to a Blizzard game. We didn\u2019t want the characters to feel procedural or generic because of these processes. We also embraced realism in terms of materials and character appearance. I think the touchpoint being the amazing pre-rendered look from the Diablo III cinematics. We loved those and it felt like a strong foundation to build upon in regards to the characters and achieving that warm quality that came through in the cinematics but in a real-time game environment. We thought it was ambitious, but possible. This of course is a simplified summary of the thousands of conversations it took to achieve the results we have today, but what's meaningful is that during the journey nobody was arguing for our limitations. Nobody ever said we shouldn't, we couldn't, or we can't...everyone said yes, even when it meant starting over or throwing out work, everyone really pushed and brought their best to this work. I think this is one of the truly unique aspects of Blizzard...we all said 'Yes, and...' instead of 'No, because...' it's a wonderful aspect of working here.\nThat singular focus and commitment to quality led us down a very long, winding, and challenging path to where we are today. The challenges required us to completely rebuild our rendering engine and authoring tools. We needed to assemble a world-class character team comprised of artists, tools engineers, rigging specialists, lighting and surfacing experts. This was a complete overhaul.\nWe made massive improvements to the level of detail, the surfacing of complex materials like skin, cloth simulation, hair, fur, metal, even down to the details of the highlights of the eyes and rivulets of perspiration. We built a robust character customization system that is entirely new to Diablo and it was a daunting amount of technical character work. These solutions had to work not just for a single character, but for hundreds of componentized armor sets, different body types, dozens of unique personas, and completely unique art for five distinct classes (to start). This was an entirely new challenge for our team to tackle.\nI can say now \"(with the hard work behind us and the comforting steady hum of our pipeline)\" that it was all worth it. We hope you agree \"(when you play it)\" that it really enhances the overall experience of the character's journey exploring the world of Sanctuary and makes the story, the gear, and the ways you see the characters of Sanctuary that much more enjoyable.\nMost importantly, we hope you feel the love and care we've put into creating the gear and characters you will see in the game. Beyond just living out my most awesome Barbarian fantasy, we're honored to bring this work to you!\nOne of the benefits of the investments we've made in our character art development pipeline is that now most of our story cutscenes will be rendered in our engine using the game models. In previous Diablo games, the high fidelity cinematic story moments were all pre-rendered. We will still have those amazing cinematic moments from Blizzard Animation, but now we also have cinematic moments that feature your character up close, rendered in our game engine. We have been working closely with the legendary Blizzard Animation team to bring as much of their knowledge into our process as possible. The Rogue Announce trailer was a really fantastic collaboration where we were able to push the limits of our tech and tools.\nWe are getting to geek out about how good things look up close, but all things Diablo are in service to our isometric point of view. The fidelity we put into the characters and the balance of detail all has to work with our game camera. Those looking closely will notice we like to work with bigger shapes on the armor, and we tend to reduce things that affect readability. I think we've found a sweet spot of detail that retains the readability, works well with the environments, but also keeps things looking grounded, which is super important for this vision for Sanctuary and how we present the world to you, our most important critic.\nWhile I\u2019m really happy with where we have arrived. I know we are going to keep pushing the bar at every opportunity and at Blizzard, releasing a game is just the beginning! I hope you enjoy the rest of the deep dive on character art with Arnaud and Nick!\nArnaud Kotelnikoff, Lead Character Artist.\nThanks for joining us! I\u2019d like to dive into character customization and some of the visual improvements we developed for Diablo IV.\nDiablo IV has more in-depth customization for your characters than we\u2019ve had in any previous Diablo games. You will be able to change the face of your character, the hairstyle, the facial hair (beards and eyebrows), and add jewelry (nose piercing or earrings), makeup, and body markings such as tattoos or body paint. You will also be able to change the color values of your character\u2019s skin, eyes, hair/facial hair, and body markings. Some elements will be class specific, to support the classes\u2019 unique backgrounds, but many will be shared between classes allowing more possibilities to mix and match. You can see some examples of these customization options throughout this blog.\nNow I want to talk about some of the challenges we faced.\nDiablo IV is intended to have a look that is grounded in reality, and to achieve that we need to follow some basic rules of color value, such as PBR, which means our materials look and react to light in a realistic way. The challenge for the 3D artists is to transfer the color of a concept drawing to a PBR value. For example, in PBR, silver is a very bright grey, almost white, and the reflection of the material makes it look darker. All the characters in Diablo IV follow the PBR rules, to ensure that our characters look as good in daylight as they do in a dark dungeon.\nTools that empower players to customize the look of their characters help build a stronger connection to those characters and the game. Our dye system allows you to change the color palette of your armor pieces, such as changing silver to gold or replacing a white cloth for a black cloth, etc.\nEach part of the armor can be dyed, including the helmet, chest, gloves, legs, and boots. You can dye each piece with a different color palette if you choose, or apply the same palette to all of them.\nThis system was challenging to implement because materials such as metal do not allow themselves to be dyed with inappropriate colors when they follow PBR rules. To address this, we added data to our armor that identifies specific material types and tells the dye system what color goes on what material, such as leather, fabric, metal, and other specific surfaces. The result is armor that is dyable in a range of colors that still feeling grounded and realistic in the world we\u2019re building for Diablo IV.\nThe game camera is one of our top priorities, as we want to make sure the character looks good and readable from the isometric perspective. It\u2019s the first thing we consider in character development. That said, the player character will be displayed in a lot of different ways throughout the game, whether that\u2019s the character customization screen, the inventory paper doll, social screens, and in our real-time cinematics, which will often zoom in for a closer view of the character than in the rest of the game. To support that, we have added an extra layer of texture called detail mapping\u2014detail mapping is a small, repetitive texture applied on top of the material that bring more sharpness and detail to the main texture.\nEvery armor set in Diablo IV has two body types. Here is an armor set for Barbarians with some subtle differences between the two.\nHere is a video clip in slow motion of the Rogues, which we recorded in our real-time engine. You can really enjoy the details and see how the light reacts with the materials. You will also be able to see some of our customization elements that I talked about earlier. Please note, the environment is a test scene that modelers use to look at their characters and many of these armors are works in progress and subject to change and polish.\nHere is another slow motion video of the Barbarians. Please note that all these armors are a work in progress and are subject to some adjustment.\nThis is just scratching the surface of what\u2019s to come in Diablo IV in terms of character customization. The team is dedicated to delivering the best quality possible, and we hope that players will enjoy all the options we have available for customizing their characters in Diablo IV.\nNick Chilano, Associate Art Directors, Characters.\nHello everyone,\nI'm excited to share with you our vision and our process for making monsters in Diablo IV.\nWith monsters, success requires that many different things come together, but it starts with the player feeling satisfied in killing it. That means the monster needs to visually match its gameplay and have a gory/demonic twist to it. They should look like something you have not seen before as well as taking something visually familiar and brushing it with a Diablo paint brush. That Diablo brush applies a level of detail, an understanding of gameplay needs, a level of artistry, and the demonic Diablo theme to all our monsters.\nFor me, everything starts with a goal. Typically, it's a goal from design on what this monster needs to do and what the player experience should be. Making games is a collaboration. Sometimes a visual concept helps drive an idea, while in others a paper design is enough.\nOur game design goal for the Blood Bishop was to make a caster who would cast direct damage and create AOE bombs for area of denial. As for the visual notes, we wanted a high-level boss based on vampiric blood and magic. We knew we wanted to double down on the notion of a heart shape for the function of the blood magic. That naturally led to the notion of arteries creating these blood clots that explode to cast the AOE effect design needs. An exposed beating heart was the natural visual choice. So, the organic pulsing we see, the flowing arteries, and the blood-based VFX all combined to reach an aligned goal the team could get behind. The success here is when the game design needs were met visually in a true Diablo way.\nThis process was similar, but this time we had a visual concept to work from.\nThis undead Skeleton Lord is made of fused skeleton and body parts, with sinew and blood connecting it together\u2014something we felt fit our game visually. That led to a Design Lead wanting to create a fight based on this character. The Design team was able to create a unique fight based on bone visuals, summoning skeletons, bone walls to restrict pathing, and leveraging the giant staff\u2014one attack has the Skeleton Lord smashing the staff into the ground and creating a shower of exploding bone shards. Even though the art was created first, the Design team leveraged its look to help theme a fun and interesting fight we all enjoy.\nWe also need to look at our assets from two main focal points. Our game camera and a closer full body size camera. This means we need to understand what is important and what is supporting these elements in terms of overall shape language and finer secondary and tertiary details.\nLevel of artistic detail is always a challenge. Details need to be readable for the game, colors need to group well, silhouettes need to stand out, as well as being built for performance and movement. Understanding this is key to allowing our monsters to look great from our isometric camera while also delivering stunning details up close.\nThis Spider feeding upon and birthing \"spider spawn\" from a bloated corpse has a great visual design.\nThe spindly legs and back thorax instantly tell you what it is. That thin look of the legs as it moves down to a thicker body give it a nice balance to settle the shape language from top to bottom. The saturated red of the spider, on top of the cooler and more subdued body, help pop the spider visually so your eye catches it as soon as they show up on screen. When we look closer, you can see the spectacular highlights on the bloated body, the torn and pulled flesh, and the bulging pustules. So, up close gruesome details are visible from the game camera because of the clear shape and color grouping.\nThis succubus is another great example of an interesting and clear visual read from gameplay, with finer details that don't get in the way of the game camera but really raise the visual bar.\nAt the game camera we see a familiar silhouette. A winged demon hovering to seduce its prey and attack with magic from a distance. As you look closer, you see intricate details in the cloths, translucent skin on the wings, as well as materials like gold clasps, stitching, and embroidery on the outfit. We also see the wings are attached at the base of the head. A detail that needs a closer look to see but doesn\u2019t complicate the look from different cameras.\nIn order to achieve this, we needed a process and technology to realize these amazing and, honestly, disturbing creations. To do that we have built a world class team creating monsters and demons at a level of quality that raises the bar for the Diablo series.\nPBR gives us the ability to create surfaces and materials that look realistic and accurately react to lighting in the world. Leather can look like leather, metals like metals, and organic surfaces can feel appropriately squishy and fleshy by comparison.\nThis Knight is covered head to toe in metal and fabric that reacts differently based on lighting. You can see nice details and material breaks on the hard surfaces that your eye expects to see. This detail grounds us in a world we all visually know and understand. The difference from a scale pattern of finer metal to large, hammered iron next to gold trim is readily apparent.\nOrganic surfaces also are represented accurately in our engine. Fur, bone, flesh, and blood are all visible and react to light correctly. This is a Diablo game, after all, and we know these materials will be important.\nSo that is a brief rundown of some of the things we look at and value when it comes to monsters in Diablo IV. We really enjoy creating enemies, monsters, and demonic creatures that bring out an emotional response from our players, from fear or revulsion to the excitement of slaying them in true Diablo fashion.\nIn closing, I'd like to say that there are moments as a developer where you are just making the game, day-in and day-out, and you don't always take time to appreciate the craft on display that you are privileged to see every day. I love that we are doing these blogs to give you all some insight into our progress and process. It's a great opportunity for us to reflect on the journey, share our art, and appreciate the craft of our teammates. We hope you like what you see, and please share your comments on your platform of choice. We love to hear community feedback\u2014it's really been a labor of love and an honor to create for you, and we can't wait for you to play it!\nThank you for joining us and keep an eye out for our upcoming blog update next quarter!\n-The Diablo IV Team\nDiablo IV Quarterly Update\u2014December 2020.\nThis update prioritizes one of the fans' most anticipated system \u2014 itemization. It also details changes to character attributes. Published on the 15th of December, 2020, the update is also the first that David Kim was not a part of the Diablo IV team, and instead, was signed off by Lead Game Designer Joe Shely.\nThe update marks that the next update would not be in blog format, and would instead take place during BlizzConline. It is also teased that a new class would be revealed in \"a new version of the campfire scene\".\nThree Core Ideals.\nThe developers would rely on three core ideals in deciding what changes to make:\nSkill Tree.\nThe developers expressed confidence with the Skill Tree based on community feedback and internal playtests. One change is that related skill nodes would be clustered together so that players would have an easier time finding them in the tree.\nRe-specialization.\nAs with the previous two games, active and passive skills can be re-specialize again. The number of times this can be done is infinite, but there would be a ramping cost.\nRe-specializing would be easier at the beginning of a character's progression, but would require significant investment in end-game.\nPrimary Stats.\nThe previous attributes (Angelic, Demonic, and Ancestral) were scrapped in favor of those found in previous games. This change was made because they didn't \"reinforce\" the fantasy of the classes and also because the developers wanted to return to the roots of classic RPG elements of early Diablo games.\nSome attributes may come from items, but a majority would come from leveling up. Attributes provide benefits to all classes, though some attributes function differently depending on class.\nStrength\nIntelligence\nWillpower\nDexterity\nSkill Upgrades.\nIn addition to affecting stats, attributes can be used to enable additional skill effects. Skill upgrades would require specific attributes with a certain threshold to unlock them.\nItemization.\nWeapon Types.\nWeapon types would differentiated from one another. Not only would each weapon type have a visually distinct look \u2014 each type would also have its own weapon speed and inherent characteristics as implicit affixes. For example, all shields would have a block value, all wands wands would have a \"critical strike chance\" implicit, and all staves would grant additional \"resource regeneration\".\nItem Qualities.\nSimilar to Diablo II and unlike Diablo III, magic and rare items would play a more prominent role.\nSystem Design in Diablo IV (Part II).\nThough lacking specifics, itemization was focused on the blog. Itemization was described as \"very early design\". The developers stressed that its depth and customization is valuable to the game.\nThe dev team \"don\u2019t want to create an exact copy of Diablo II or Diablo III\" and plan to take best parts of previous games and improve upon them while introducing new elements to make Diablo IV unique. An important philosophy for the dev team is \"Easy to learn, difficult to master\". Items would be just one part of a character's overall power, and that power would spread out power across different sources, including skill ranks, character level, talent trees, and the endgame character progression system\nAffixes.\nItem affixes have two takeaways: they should be a meaningful part of character power and should create interesting choices when deciding which items to equip.\nThere is a plan to increase the total number of affixes on items, including Magic (Blue), Rare (Yellow), and Legendary (Orange). This change is intended to raise the importance of non-Legendary affixes and address the issue of Legendary bonus overpowering other affixes.\nThree new stats were introduced:\nAdditionally, these new stats would act as prerequisites to unlock certain affixes.\nAttack/Defense Changes.\nThe developers have made Attack exclusive to weapons, Defense exclusive to armor, and removed Attack and Defense from jewelry. It has also been emphasized that solely picking items based on Attack and Defense will almost never be the optimal way to play, but it does provide a good starting point for newer players.\nAncient Legendary Replacement.\nAncient Legendary items were removed from this version of the game. The developers took cues from feedback to focus on addressing the usefulness of Rare (Yellow) items and increasing the depth and complexity of player gear choices in the endgame.\nThere is also a plan of introducing a new unnamed type of consumable that would have a random Legendary affix that can be applied onto a non-Legendary item. This item type would only drop in late endgame by killing monsters. This would mean:\nSystem Design in Diablo IV (Part I).\nThe update details what the Diablo IV developers' preliminary direction on what future systems would be in Diablo IV. It emphasizes the importance of parsing through the Diablo community feedback and opinions, as well as internal discussion. The article was published on the 19th of November, 2019.\nItemization.\nThe Diablo IV developers plan to design an itemization system with the intention of adding depth and complexity to items. The developers' aim is to give players \"more freedom\" to customize items and explore gameplay possibilities instead of \"looking for the most optimal build online\".\nElective Mode.\nThere was a misconception (due to the way the &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%23BlizzCon%202019\"&gt;Blizzcon 2019 demo&lt;/a&gt;) that skills were locked in the UI. The Diablo IV developers assured that Elective Mode would be implemented in the game and that skill selection and assignment will be open for all players.\nAncient Items.\nDue to a backlash by fans against Ancient items and, according to the developers, that these items serve no clear purpose, the developers would be revisiting this item quality.\nEndgame Progression System.\nThe developers expressed their ambivalence towards whether character leveling and experience system should be finite or infinite. Among the points discussed is the inclusion of a level cap and a secondary experience system, which is reminiscent of Diablo III's &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon system&lt;/a&gt;.\nSources of Power.\nAn issue among Diablo fans is that items would monopolize power. The developers clarified that power would come from a mix of leveling up, skill ranks, talents, and items. They also rectified that, unlike in Diablo III, bonuses from legendary items would not invalidate other affixes.\nKeyed Dungeons.\nA new feature in Diablo IV are Keyed Dungeons. The majority of these dungeons would be found in \"real places\" throughout &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Rifts&lt;/a&gt; in Diablo III, Keyed Dungeons would introduce challenges through \"Dungeon Affixes\". This would make players plan ahead and strategize \"before\" going into one of these dungeons."}

It represents a character's nimbleness and finesse, often bringing defensive benefits and implying skill in using &lt;a href=\"Ranged%20Weapons\"&gt;Ranged Weapons&lt;/a&gt; as well as certain &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapons\"&gt;Melee Weapons&lt;/a&gt; that are not driven by brute &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;. In later games, Dexterity is the &lt;a href=\"primary%20stat\"&gt;primary stat&lt;/a&gt; of s, s, and s.\nDiablo I/Hellfire.\nDexterity is represented in its most basic and limited form in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and . It contributes to a hero's To-Hit %, and Armor Class. In addition, as a hero's Dexterity grows, certain swords and all bows begin to open themselves for use.\n\u2020 Ingame, this blocking bonus is bugged. After the first game, the hero loses his blocking bonus, and can only rely on his Dexterity and clvl to do the work for his blocking chance.\nIn addition, the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Hellfire%29\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; all rely on Dexterity for damage, although they still accept a bonus from &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; as well:\nUnfortunately, due to how high the classes' caps on Dexterity are, only the Rogue stands a chance at hitting targets with only items that give Dexterity. All other classes need affixes that give To-Hit % chance\nDiablo II.\nDexterity affects &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Attack Rating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Rating\"&gt;Defense Rating&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome melee weapon damage, such as &lt;a href=\"javelins\"&gt;javelins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"claws\"&gt;claws&lt;/a&gt;, and all &lt;a href=\"Ranged%20Weapons\"&gt;Ranged Weapons&lt;/a&gt; damage increase with Dexterity. Dexterity is also required to use some weapons, such as &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is not generally required for some weapons, such as maces and axes.\nDexterity also increases chance to block. The chance to block is capped at 75 percent.\nDiablo III.\nAs of Patch 2.1, Dexterity increases Armor (1 Armor for 1 Dexterity), in the same way &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; does for all classes. &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Monks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s (both use dexterity as their primary attribute) also increase all damage output by 1% for each point in Dexterity.\nMonks and Demon Hunters gain 3 Dexterity per level, while other classes gain 1, and may receive 5 points per &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; point invested in it. Dexterity can also be gained by placing &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt; gems into empty armor sockets.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally, each point of dexterity was increasing the player's chance to &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of class. The gains were big at first, but they would also suffer from diminishing returns, not recommended to classes with other primary attributes. In patch 2.1., developers wanted to replace Dodge bonus with Armor, in order to make this bonus more predictable and reliable."}

However, the Prime Evils rarely worked together, though when they did, he served as the harbinger of their wrath. One example of these rare instances of cooperation was the &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Battle%20of%20the%20Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Fifth Battle of the Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt;, and just when it seemed that the Prime Evils would win the Great Conflict, they turned on each other, fighting over spoils that they had yet to win. With this discord in Hell's ranks, Heaven was able to drive the forces of Hell back.\nWrath.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Battlefield\"&gt;one such battlefield&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo battled &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;. They fought each other to a standstill as Diablo commented on Imperius's rage, and wondered aloud if his enemy (Imperius) feared of how the angels saw him for what he truly was.

An enraged Imperius however, declared that demonkind could only be dealt with through blood, and slew the Lord of Terror. In his last words, Diablo mocked the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; for its supposed unity.\nThe Sin War.\nSanctuary.\nThe Eternal Conflict came to a halt with the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt;, the powers of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; came to learn of the existence of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;inhabitants&lt;/a&gt;\u2014creatures that had been born from the coupling of angels and demons.

Sensing the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;dormant power&lt;/a&gt; within humanity and reasoning it could be turned to suit their own ends, the Prime Evils began a campaign to tip humanity over to their side. To this end, they founded the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a seemingly benevolent religion that was actually a front for their true motives. Each of the Primes took on an alter ego for worship and in Diablo's case, he was known as Dialon, the Spirit of Determination, represented by a ram in Triune iconography. \"Dialon\" was said to bring purpose to humanity, and carried the \"Tablets of Order.\"\nThe Triune's efforts to ensnare humanity were hindered by the rogue angel &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; however, who founded the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Nephalem.\nIn the last days of the Sin War, events were complicated with the emerge of the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt;, a group led by the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt; who sought to end the influence of both the Triune and Cathedral of Light. The Triune was his first target. &lt;a href=\"Astrogha\"&gt;Astrogha&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo's minion, reported to his master. Diablo was interested in Uldyssian's might, especially in light of the demise of &lt;a href=\"Gulag\"&gt;Gulag&lt;/a&gt; (a servant of Baal).\nThe Triune was nonetheless wiped out, and Diablo confronted Inarius directly. Diablo was gratified to sense the angel's fear. Less gratifying was Inarius seeing through his charade, that Uldyssian had become a threat to the Prime Evils' plans for Sanctuary. Diablo offered an alliance, a proposal that left Inarius aghast. As Diablo pointed out, however, this would not be the first time that Inarius would have consorted with demons. Inarius agreed, and &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt; (a servant of Diablo through the Triune) entered the angel's service.\nDiablo later came into contact with Uldyssian himself, after the nephalem nearly drowned. He offered Uldyssian his own allegiance, pointing out the dogmatic thinking of Inarius and Heaven, of the \"sin\" they saw as being inherent in Sanctuary. Uldyssian fought the demon off and was able to craft the water into a mirror of &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; as Diablo rose to face him. In an instant, Diablo was subjected to his own innate terror, as the fears he had been thrusting onto Uldyssian were transformed into his own. Howling, Diablo fled.\nIn the end, the conflict ended with both Heaven and Hell agreeing to respect Sanctuary's neutrality in the Great Conflict.\nThe Kingdom of Shadow.\nLong before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, there existed the city of &lt;a href=\"Ureh\"&gt;Ureh&lt;/a&gt;. One of the greatest cities in all of Sanctuary, it attracted traders, artists, and masters in every field to bask in its glory. But, for all its prosperity, it came under the gaze of the Lord of Terror, for the people of Ureh did not fear anything let alone be terrorized.\nDiablo laid siege to the city in his trademark fashion\u2014corrupting it from within. Although the innocent inhabitants of the city were unaware of what transpired, the city's powerful sorcerers, both indigenous and foreign erected unbreachable barriers that prevented Diablo's influence from spreading within. This caused Diablo to change his tactics; he started corrupting the local flora and fauna, using them as pawns to weaken the barriers that withheld his influence from spreading. But these weak machinations were no match for the arcane powers of Ureh's united sorcerers, bent on protecting the city at all costs. But the people started to suffer, the city was surrounded, supplies stopped.\nDiablo then disguised himself as the &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; Mirakodus, and corrupted &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Khan\"&gt;Juris Khan&lt;/a&gt;, the city's ruler, with his visions. Eventually, the Lord Khan actually became an embodiment of Diablo, subverted by his will. Khan told his Sorcerers that Mirakodus had told them that their plight had not been overlooked by Heaven and that their struggle against Diablo would soon be over. The city of Ureh would be granted a place in Heaven itself. However, it was Ureh's job to find the way. Eventually, they found a way through a portal spell. In reality, however, the spell would not bring Ureh into Heaven, but deliver it to Hell. Through the portal, Hell would be granted a means to invade Sanctuary. However, his plans were thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Gregus%20Mazi\"&gt;Gregus Mazi&lt;/a&gt;, who realized Khan's deception. His efforts ensured that Ureh did not enter Hell, instead of stranding it in &lt;a href=\"Limbo\"&gt;Limbo&lt;/a&gt; between the planes.\nDiablo's machinations didn't stop there, and he continued to give Khan guidance. Under his guidance, \"angels\" (in reality, demons) applied \"subtle ministrations\" to Ureh's people, turning them into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; abominations. Diablo himself forced himself upon Khan's daughter &lt;a href=\"Atanna\"&gt;Atanna&lt;/a&gt;. She struggled, screamed, and her resistance gave even the Lord of Terror himself pause. Yet he nonetheless succeeded in corrupting her. Yet Diablo was not yet satisfied. &lt;a href=\"Kentril%20Dumon\"&gt;Kentril Dumon&lt;/a&gt; would theorize thousands of years later that while Diablo's initial plan had been thwarted, he recognized that if Ureh could be returned to the mortal plane, it could serve as a gateway for the forces of Hell. A way to spill into Sanctuary, unencumbered by any kind of barrier. However, for his plan to work, people with untainted blood would have to enter Ureh from the outside.\nThe Dark Exile.\nDiablo and his brothers had kept Sanctuary's existence a secret from the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;, and that had driven a wedge between them. That they continued to be interested in Man's potential after the Sin War did not sit well also and the Lesser Evils rose up in rebellion. Mere days before the rebellion's end, &lt;a href=\"Izilech\"&gt;Izilech&lt;/a&gt; defied Diablo. The Lord of Terror's wrath left Izilech permanently deformed, but Izilech's will endured.\nThe conflict ended with the Lesser Evils' triumph, and Diablo and his brothers were banished into Sanctuary in what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;. In truth, this was a plan on the Primes' part to corrupt the Worldstone and corrupt humanity. While Diablo and his brothers were free to wreak havoc for a few decades, their presence came to be discovered by the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, who formed the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; to find and capture the three brothers.\nThe banishment of the Prime Evils from Hell to the mortal plane also left them incorporeal. In other to acquire a physical form, they required a body for their spirit to possess. Over time their demonic presence twisted the victims human flesh into grotesque simulacrums of their physical form.\nIn time, both Baal and Diablo journeyed west across the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; to the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Diablo later crossed into &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; spreading terror and anarchy in his wake. Over a decade after their hunt began, the Horadrim finally confronted Diablo along with a demonic army. Diablo was imprisoned within a &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, which was hidden in a labyrinthine cave system near the &lt;a href=\"River%20Talsande\"&gt;River Talsande&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrael, appearing before the Horadrim for a final time, commended them for their victory, but declared that Diablo's site would have to be guarded for all time. The remaining Horadrim built a &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;small monastery&lt;/a&gt; and a series of catacombs within the caves.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nThe King and the Prince.\nOver two centuries after his imprisonment, Diablo's chance at freedom came in the form of &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, who appropriated the cathedral and nearby town of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; as his seat of power. Sensing that freedom was within his grasp, Diablo entered the nightmares of &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; (a servant of Leoric) and lured him into the dark, subterranean labyrinth beneath the cathedral. In his terror, Lazarus raced throughout the abandoned hallways until he, at last, came to the chamber of Diablo's soulstone. No longer in command of his body or spirit, he raised the stone above his head and uttered words long forgotten in the realm of mortals. His will destroyed, Lazarus shattered the soulstone upon the ground. Diablo once again came into the world of Man. He told Lazarus of the existence of Heaven and Hell, and the Eternal Conflict that waged between them, and of the Dark Exile, of Mephisto and Baal, and of his intent to free them from their prisons in the far East. Lazarus eventually came to be Diablo's servant.\nAlthough he was released from his imprisonment within the soulstone, the Lord of Terror was still greatly weakened from his long sleep and required an anchor to the world. Once he had found a mortal form to wear, he could begin to reclaim his vastly depleted power. The great demon weighed the souls residing in the town above, and chose to take the strongest of them\u2014 that of King Leoric. For many months, the king secretly fought the evil presence that twisted his thoughts and emotions. Sensing that he had been possessed by some unknown evil, Leoric hid his dark secret from his priests, hoping that somehow his own devout righteousness would be enough to exorcise the corruption growing inside him. He was sorely mistaken. Diablo stripped away the core of Leoric\u2019s being, burning away all honor and virtue from his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;. Lazarus too had fallen under the sway of the demon, keeping close to Leoric at all times. Lazarus worked to conceal the plans of his new Master from the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Light\"&gt;Order of Light&lt;/a&gt;, hoping that Diablo's power would grow, well concealed amongst the servants of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, Leoric's change in demeanor could not be ignored. However, by starting a war with &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, he was able to rid his court of prying eyes, allowing Diablo to assert full control over the king's battered soul.\nAs the Lord of Terror attempted to strengthen his hold upon the maddened King, he found that the lingering spirit of Leoric fought with him still. Although the control over Leoric that Diablo held was formidable, the demon knew that in his weakened state he could never take complete possession of his soul as long as a glimmer of his will remained. The demon lord sought a fresh and innocent host upon which to build his terror. The demon relinquished his control over Leoric, and began to search throughout Khanduras for the perfect vessel to act as his focus, and found such a soul easily within his reach. Enjoined by his dark master, Lazarus kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt; (Leoric's son) and dragged the terrified youth down into the blackness of the labyrinth. Flooding the boy\u2019s defenseless mind with the essence of pure terror, Diablo easily took possession of the prince.\nDiablo gazed upon his surroundings through the eyes of the young prince. A lustful hunger still tortured the demon after his frustrating bout of control over Leoric, but the nightmares of the boy provided ample substance to sate him. Reaching deep into Albrecht\u2019s subconscious, Diablo ripped the greatest fears of the child from their hiding places and gave them breath. The terrors of Albrecht's imagination were given physical form. Such was the terror that grew within Albrecht that Hell itself began to seep into the mortal realm. Diablo, at last, took physical form, as Albrecht's body was altered to match Diablo's own form. When the moment was right, Diablo intended to venture once more into the mortal world and free his captive brothers Mephisto and Baal. The Prime Evils would be reunited, and together they would reclaim their rightful place in Hell.\nLazarus, still loyal to Diablo, led a group of townsfolk into the depths of the cathedral, in a supposed attempt to save Albrecht. He led them into the lair of &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt;, who slaughtered most of them, leaving others to flee. This 'sacrifice' strengthened Diablo further, giving him the power to summon demons to terrorize the surrounding countryside.\nThe Reign of Terror.\nTristram was left without an army, or a king, and the demons that Diablo had spawned brought further grief to the town. Deep beneath the foundations of the ruined monastery, Diablo gorged himself upon the fears of the mortals above him. He slowly sank back into the welcoming shadows and began to harness his depleted power, knowing that the time of his victory was close at hand.\nHowever, Diablo's terror did not go unchallenged. A trio of heroes \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moreina\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 descended into the labyrinth to confront the evil that had gripped Tristram. Reaching what Aidan later described as \"the threshold of Hell itself,\" the trio confronted Diablo. The battle that followed was desperate, as Diablo did not just battle the heroes physically, but mentally as well, as Aidan was forced to battle his own fears. However, spurred on by the disappearance of his brother, Albrecht, Aidan and his companions fought on, wearing the demon down. Ultimately, Aidan himself delivered the killing blow. However, as he watched Diablo's form dissolve, Aidan saw to his horror that Albrecht's body lay before him.\nTo make matters worse, as Diablo's soulstone had been broken by Lazarus, it could not contain the demon indefinitely. Believing he could contain Diablo's essence, Aidan plunged the soulstone into his forehead. Blood filled his vision, the whispers of the damned echoed in his ears and Aidan could feel Diablo himself clawing his way up from the dark recesses of his soul. But he had done it. Diablo had been contained.\nJourney to Hell.\nThe Dark Wanderer.\nThough he wrestled with Diablo's presence, Aidan's will became subverted by the Lord of Terror. Tormented by his experiences, Aidan sought solace with &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, who saw Diablo's essence within him. The two spent many nights behind closed doors, and through this liaison, Adria became pregnant with a &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;. When the time was right, this infant would be Diablo's vessel to become the Prime Evil. Years later, Cain would speculate that this had been Diablo's plan all along, to lure in the strongest of heroes and find a new, perfect host for himself.\nWearing the guise of the Dark Wanderer, Diablo took his host eastward, seeking to free his brothers. Traveling through &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo summoned numerous demons to his side, driving the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; from their home. In the mountains that separated Khanduras from &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, the Wanderer did the same thing to a tavern, sparing only &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;, who had previously survived the fall of Eastgate. The Wanderer beckoned, and Marius followed.\nEventually, the two reached the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tomb of Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering the tomb, the Wanderer appeared to gain strength. Or rather, as Marius observed, appeared to be losing what was left of his humanity, his visage becoming more demonic. Either way, the Wanderer led the way into the tomb, undeterred by the gloom. Eventually, the pair reached the &lt;a href=\"Binding%20Stone\"&gt;Binding Stone&lt;/a&gt; where Tal Rasha, barely containing Baal, stood. The Wanderer moved forward to release the Lord of Destruction but it was here that the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; intervened. The Wanderer and &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; did battle but Marius, manipulated by Baal, released him. Marius promptly fled with Baal's soulstone, but it mattered not. Baal was free. Tyrael was imprisoned in his place. And with that, the Wanderer and Baal set sail to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rebirth of Terror.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, it was found that Mephisto had already succeeded in corrupting the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith. Diablo used his powers of fear to cause the uncorrupted defenders to flee and/or turn on each other. Regardless, Mephisto's soulstone was found, and the Lord of Hatred quickly took possession of &lt;a href=\"Que-Hegan\"&gt;Que-Hegan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;Sankekur&lt;/a&gt;. After centuries, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; were reunited. Within a chamber, the Primes devised a final stratagem to retake the Burning Hells, claim vengeance on those who had turned on them and use their corrupted soulstones to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, thereby enslaving humanity to their will. The &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt; was opened and Diablo took full control over the Wanderer's body, assuming his true form, and entered Hell, ready to rally Hell's legions to the Primes' cause.\nIt did not come to pass, however, as a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; who had pursued the Wanderer since Khanduras, entered Hell itself in their pursuit of the Lord of Terror. Within the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Chaos Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, a final battle played out, and Diablo was bested. Taking Diablo's soulstone, once again containing the demon's essence, they destroyed it upon the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20of%20Annihilation\"&gt;Anvil of Annihilation&lt;/a&gt;, supposedly banishing his soul into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. Through their actions, the heroes had forever loosened Diablo's hold on Sanctuary.\nDiablo Immortal.\nReturn from the Abyss.\nAfter being banished to the Black Abyss, &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; bound Diablo's skull to his throne to use as a power source and to prevent his master from returning. Once he was killed in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo's soul was able to use his skull to return from the Black Abyss. He then tried to kill &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;, but was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Verathiel\"&gt;an angel&lt;/a&gt;, who teleported them away, seemingly at the cost of her life.\nDark Rebirth.\nApproximately &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;two years later&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt; travelled to &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; with a Worldstone shard in their possession. With the shard, they resurrected Albrecht\u2014a former host of Diablo, as a &lt;a href=\"Shardborne\"&gt;new breed of monster&lt;/a&gt;. Using the shard, Albrecht's memories were manifested as a &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Memories\"&gt;seperate plane&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bride%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Bride of Hell&lt;/a&gt; ventured into the plane, looking for the memory with the strongest imprint of Diablo\u2014where Albrecht was possessed. Using the imprint, she opened a portal directly to Diablo. Though the Shard-seeker tried to stop it, Diablo was able to attune the shard to himself and began reconstructing his body.\nSplintered Souls.\nWhile he reconstructed his body, Diablo paid attention to the Shard-seeker, who had travelled to the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Dreadlands\"&gt;Southern Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt; in search of &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;an artifact&lt;/a&gt; that could help foil Diablo's resurrection. At various points of their journey, Diablo dragged the Shard-seeker into nightmares and sent Terror Demons to kill them. When it didn't work, he showed them a vision of &lt;a href=\"Verathiel\"&gt;Verathiel&lt;/a&gt;, still alive and tortured by him. As they despaired Diablo tried to personally kill them, but was thwarted by Tyrael.\nThe Order.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, Leah was beginning to manifest magical abilities and, at times, operated in a trance, as if guided by some unseen hand. Once in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, as her house burnt down, she entered a trance, and caused the temperature of the house to decrease. Once, at &lt;a href=\"Brand%20Manor\"&gt;Brand Manor&lt;/a&gt;, when cultists tried to sacrifice her, her innate magic resurfaced, and walking across the room, as if in a trance, she was able to free &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; as well. And when &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;'s servants attacked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; outside Gea Kul, she was able to use her magic to kill several of the attackers before she was captured.\nFinally, inside the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Tower\"&gt;Dark Tower&lt;/a&gt;, even in a trance, Leah's magic was activated, protecting her body against Rau. She later came face to face with Belial. When he saw Leah, Belial was caught offguard, as he beheld Diablo within her.\nAge of Unmaking.\nc. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231273\"&gt;1273&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo set his sights on Sanctuary, mustering an invasion. With a merciless force of fearsome foot soldiers at his back, Diablo sought to tear away the fabric of the mortal realm. His growing influence warped sections of Sanctuary into a nightmarish hellscape. The legions of Hell ran rampant, paving the way for Diablo's imminent arrival. Diablo assaulted the people of Sanctuary with tormenting visions, such as images of his &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Terror\"&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt;, crushing their spirits before corrupting their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s. However, in so doing, he exposed the power hidden within those who were able to withstand his nightmarish assault.\nShattered Sanctuary.\nAs the year ends, Diablo moves his forces to the &lt;a href=\"World%27s%20Crown\"&gt;World's Crown&lt;/a&gt;; a desolate land at Sanctuary's North Pole. The people there were the first to witness his terror. Since then, they've torn out their eyes and mutilated their bodies until they were no different from monsters. In preparation for his armies to invade he created a &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Verge\"&gt;Terror Verge&lt;/a&gt;, a region where Sanctuary overlapped with the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Realm of Terror&lt;/a&gt;. To deter any defenders of men, Diablo coated large parts of the island with terror-inducing mists that drove any within it it insane.\nThe Shard-seeker arrived at World's Crown with an army of allies. With the help of El'druin, they were able to overcome Diablo's agents and clear the mists.\nBy the time the army amassed to attack Diablo, he had broken Verathiel and corrupted her angelsong. With her, the ingredients for the unmaking (an angel, a demon and the Worldstone) were complete.\nPrime Evil.\nThe Dragon Reborn.\nTwenty years passed since Diablo's defeat in Hell, but it was not his end. Over the two decades, his servant, Adria, remained active in Sanctuary. She gathered the essences of the five Great Evils that had been slain (including Diablo), whose essences lingered in the mortal plane. After those two decades, she had succeeded, leaving only two lords of Hell remaining\u2014&lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;. The essences were prepared for absorption into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, as per Diablo's plan of taking their essences into himself. Adria allied herself with a group of mortal heroes, including &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, and her daughter, Leah. Diablo's host, now ready to be his vessel.\nWith the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Siege of Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Azmodan had followed Belial in defeat, and now, all seven essences were in the soulstone. However, Adria showed her true colors, as she bound &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; in arcane chains, and using the bodies of dead guards, formed a ritual circle around Leah. Plunging the Black Soulstone into Leah's flesh, Diablo was now reborn. But in his own words, more than he once was. The Seven Evils were now upon him. He was the Prime Evil, containing all the powers and malice of all of the Seven. He dismissed Adria and opened a portal to Heaven, intent on ridding the realm of his enemies, and reigning supreme over Creation as the Prime Evil.\nAnd the Heavens Shall Tremble.\nSummoning the entirety of Hell's forces to his side, Diablo approached the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt;. Imperius was there waiting for him, channeling a stream of fire from &lt;a href=\"Solarion\"&gt;Solarion&lt;/a&gt; that revealed Diablo's true form, one unlike any other that had been seen. The two did battle, and before long, Diablo had the upper hand, cleaving Solarion in two, and impaling his enemy. Imperius was able to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; to safety, but could not stop Diablo from shattering the gates. The way to Heaven lay open, and the legions of Hell followed, gaining access to the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in the history of the Eternal Conflict.\nLeading his forces into the city, Diablo specifically targeted &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that without her, the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; would lose hope. To this end, one of Diablo's focal assault points was the &lt;a href=\"Gardens%20of%20Hope\"&gt;Gardens of Hope&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; would comment decades later that Diablo had not been incorrect in his strategy. Auriel was captured, and the Host was scattered. However, she was rescued by The Nephalem, and Diablo's &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Rift\"&gt;Hell Rift&lt;/a&gt;s sealed. Atop the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Spire\"&gt;Silver Spire&lt;/a&gt;, The Nephalem and Prime Evil met. Empowered by the souls of the Evils, Diablo and his foe(s) met in battle, the Lord of Terror even transporting his foe(s) to his own Realm of Terror. Yet even that was not enough, and in the end, the Nephalem prevailed. Diablo's physical form disintegrated, and his essence returned to the Black Soulstone. An unintended consequence of this battle was the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Realms%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Realms of Fate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Reaper of Souls.\nWhile Diablo and the Evils remained contained in the Black Soulstone, the stone itself exerted a corrupting influence on Heaven. Reforming the Horadrim, Tyrael took the stone to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Tomb of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to keep it hidden from the worlds of both Man and angel. However, the stone was taken by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, former Archangel of Wisdom and now the Angel of Death. Malthael intended to use the stone to consume all demonic essence within Sanctuary, which would eradicate humanity in the process. The Nephalem battled him to the point where Malthael destroyed the stone, taking the essences of the Evils into himself. Yet even this was not enough, and Malthael was defeated. However, in the process, Diablo was freed, still bearing the essences of the other six Evils. Eventually however, the other Evils were able to separate themselves from Diablo.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nDiablo, also known as \"The Dark Lord\", is the final &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo II.\nDiablo is the boss of of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo Immortal.\nDiablo appears on the login screen for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", and is revealed as a surprise enemy after the player defeats &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the game. \n&lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Diablo's avatar&lt;/a&gt; features as a stalking boss in &lt;a href=\"Erebban\"&gt;Erebban&lt;/a&gt;, and as a mini-boss at the end of \"&lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shattered Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;\" update.

The speech fragment is slightly inaccurate considering that Diablo has neither wings or hoofs, but it could be a reference to the \"Diablo\" setting as a whole. T\nDiablo also appears as a playable character in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth_Grand_Prix\"&gt;Azeroth Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; optional scenario which is included in the patch v1.22a. He represents the realm of the \"Diablo\" universe on this map.\nAs mentioned in the description, Diablo rides on an Infernal Contraption, a type of demonic siege weapon from the \"Warcraft\" universe. He possesses 600 HP and his honk sounds like a tractor trailer's.\nDuring his transformation in the \"Diablo II\" Act IV cinematic, Diablo lets loose a roar that is heard from the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Frost_Wyrm_%28Warcraft_III%29\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDiablo makes a small appearance in \"World of Warcraft\" as a pet. Mini Diablo is chosen among three small pets as the reward for a special level 1 quest: Welcome!. This quest is only available with the \"World of Warcraft Collector's Edition\". This edition is no longer sold in stores, making this an ultra-rare pet. Of note, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; is also available as a pet.\nStarCraft II.\nA Diablo unit exists in the game and can be placed in player made maps with the game's map editor. Diablo also has a cameo in one of the \"StarCraft II\" campaign &lt;a href=\"http%3A//starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/The_Devil%2527s_Playground%23Easter_Egg\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;, where he appears to control the rising and lowering of a deadly sea of lava.\nA Diablo portrait temporarily replaced that of worker units to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the \"Diablo\" series.\nHearthstone.\nDiablo has, on occasion, been a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Diablo_%28Duels_hero%29\"&gt;playable hero&lt;/a&gt; in \"Hearthstone\".\nHeroes of the Storm.\nDiablo is a playable hero in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe retains his iconic &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Lightning%20Hose\"&gt;Red Lightning Hose&lt;/a&gt; attacks, as well as Fire Stomp and Shadow Charge skills from the third game. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; is his passive trait that allows him to resurrect faster. Diablo's appearance in HotS is closest to that in the second game, though his \"Diablo III\" incarnation is available as a skin.\nCall of Duty: Mobile.\nDiablo aesthetics were available in \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty%3A_Mobile%3Fso%3Dsearch\"&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/a&gt;\" to tie-in with the release of \"Diablo Immortal\". Players could earn a Diablo-themed weapon charm and calling card.\nPersonality and Traits.\nIt is said that of the Three, Diablo is the most creative and farsighted of them, perhaps of all the Great Evils. He is calm, cunning, and patient. He sees himself as an artist of terror. He knows that conquest comes when enemies turn their back on fear rather than face them. However, Diablo does not acquire his satisfaction from conquest itself, as Mephisto might. Diablo feeds on the terror that precedes the conquest. To him, the fear a victim has is a greater reward than the pain they suffer when they are actually tortured.\nLike his brothers, Diablo, by his nature, is confrontational.\nPowers and Abilities.\nDiablo is perhaps the most powerful demon known to Sanctuary. and perhaps the most feared. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; argued that Diablo would always remain the most insidious, and most powerful of all the Evils. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; likewise considered Diablo to be \"the worst of the Three,\" and &lt;a href=\"Valla\"&gt;Valla&lt;/a&gt; considered Diablo to be \"the worst damned demon of them all.\"\nPhysical.\nIn battle as the Lord of Terror, Diablo demonstrated proficiency with &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; attacks, and the ability to run on all fours like a lion. Diablo's horns are strong enough to pierce and gore, though anyone so injured who survives would be wise to pray the wound is swiftly fatal. If not, the tainted gash will fester and rot from the inside out, giving the body over to maggots and hellish parasites long before &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; ends the feverish agony.\nAs the Prime Evil, Diablo demonstrated similar abilities to his form as the Lord of Terror, along with the ability to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;, breathe lightning, and to form cages of bones.\u00a0As the Prime Evil, he was stronger than he had ever been, and one swing of Diablo's spiked\u00a0tail could send an angel flying with enough force to shatter structures.\nPsychological.\nDiablo has the ability to influence the minds of his victims and latch onto their most crippling fears, using a person's own worst fears against them. He has the ability to turn the fears of Men into actual creatures, and even the smallest of fears provide him with power. Not only able to bring nightmares to life, Diablo can also imbue objects with his vile presence. He has demonstrated the ability to psychologically torment all of Sanctuary with nightmarish visions, at least after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeckard Cain wrote that due to his mastery of terror, Diablo is incapable of feeling fear himself. However, his confrontation with Uldyssian stands in contrast to this, realizing that Diablo himself did possess innate fear, and that he could not bear to be subjected to his own powers of terror.\nAppearance.\nDiablo has demonstrated the ability to change his visage at will, even mimicking other individuals. He can even alter his appearance to best mimic his foes' innate terrors. He has two main horns (the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Diablo\"&gt;Horn of Diablo&lt;/a&gt; stems from one of these horns, taken from one of his hosts), and the rest of his body bristles with vicious, bony spikes. Even one of these 'lesser horns' would be enough to induce terror in a victim if so utilized.\nDiablo's gender is malleable. When he possesses an individual, the form reflects that individual's fears. When Albrecht and Aidan were possessed, their forms were that of hulking brutes. When Leah was possessed, the form was more feminine, as per her own fears, combining with Diablo's new form as the Prime Evil than merely the Lord of Terror. In his natural form within Pandemonium, Diablo's appearance was similar to how he appeared while possessing Albrecht and Aidan, but was slightly more lithe."}

{"id": "31353", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=31353", "title": "Diablo (Diablo I)", "text": "Diablo, also known as The Dark Lord, is the final boss of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo I.\nDiablo's lair may be entered by passing through the opening in the pentagram on . A special loading screen will appear and you'll find yourself on the lowest level of Hell, \u00a0(known as Down to Diablo in terms of gameplay). This final level is filled with &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Advocate\"&gt;Advocate&lt;/a&gt;s, the most vicious arch-enemy in the game, so be prepared to cut your way through many monsters. In each corner of the room is an area with a special \"&lt;a href=\"Skull%20Lever\"&gt;Skull Lever&lt;/a&gt;\" which you have to activate. At first only one room is accessible, but as you activate the lever the next room opens up. The third room contains two levers; after activating both the fourth and last room opens... and Diablo, whose title in the game is simply \"The Dark Lord,\" awaits.\nThere is a relatively easy way to defeat Diablo. Although it works best for the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, other classes can try it too. You only need a fairly large manapool, loads of &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Potions\"&gt;Mana Potions&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Shield\"&gt;Mana Shield&lt;/a&gt; and spells (higher levels work better). After Diablo has been released, lure him to a relatively safe area where you can fight him alone without additional monsters. Make sure you have Mana Shield up, allow Diablo to walk towards you and cast Firewall on him. Diablo will frantically cast &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; on you, but due to mana shield you will only lose mana instead of life (Sorcerers are most likely to have a huge mana pool. &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s can try to either soak up the damage with their inherent vitality and/or health potions, or even block the attacks if they wield a shield; in that case they don't need mana shield. A Chance To Hit of 120%, a weapon with an attack speed suffix, and minimum points of 30 damage and maximum of 50 or over will assure that Warriors can give multiple successive blows on Diablo, making him rather helpless). Make sure a Fire Wall is up at all times, refill your manapool with potions in order to prevent losing health. After some time Diablo will start casting Apocalypse even faster in a desperate attempt to save himself, just keep drinking mana bottles. After some more seconds of roasting over the fire, Diablo will finally fall.\nAn alternative, possibly even faster method would be using holy bolt spells. Even though the spell's description does not mention demons as being affected, it is possible to kill Diablo rather quickly with a sustained barrage of s. This strategy is not really recommended for Nightmare or Hell difficulty, however, especially in multiplayer; on Hell difficulty, he could take well over 100 Holy Bolts before succumbing to death. That is well over at least 300 mana, which is definitely not easily done with Warriors, if at all possible.\nWhen a character defeats Diablo, they gain 37,999 experience points. Diablo is resistant to &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and , and immune to &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, (though some spells can still hurt him). He has 1,666 hit points on difficulty.\nDiablo III.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Anniversary%20Dungeon\"&gt;Anniversary Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", players can fight the Dark Lord again. The arena is laid out much like the original, where you have to pull levers to open the next door and release a horde of monsters. Pulling the final one will open Diablo's cage and release the Dark Lord's fury.\nUpon death, he drops &lt;a href=\"Red%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Red Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt; and concludes the dungeon. The classic ending cinematic will be played upon killing him.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Lordling\"&gt;The Dark Lordling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; is based in the Diablo I version of Diablo."}
{"id": "31354", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=31354", "title": "Diablo (Diablo II)", "text": "Diablo is the final boss of of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOverview.\nDiablo appears in his &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Chaos Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; after all five seals have been opened. Note that three of those seals contain a Unique boss with a pack of minions; those have to be defeated as well. In one of the left-hand seals, the Unique boss &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Vizier%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Grand Vizier of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Finger%20Mage\"&gt;Finger Mage&lt;/a&gt;) is hidden, in the upper seal lurks &lt;a href=\"Lord%20De%20Seis\"&gt;Lord De Seis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knight&lt;/a&gt;) and on the right-hand side awaits the &lt;a href=\"Infector%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Infector of Souls&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Megademon\"&gt;Megademon&lt;/a&gt;). When all seals have been opened and all bosses and minions defeated (note that if the last seal you open is a seal containing a miniboss, killing the 'leader of the pack' will also destroy his minions) the Chaos Sanctuary should suddenly start 'brightening up'. After that, a violent tremor quakes through the Sanctuary, killing any monsters left in the Sanctuary, and a demonic voice can be heard saying: \"\"Not even Death can save you from me!\".\" Diablo awaits near the inner seal...\nDiablo has a range of powerful spells and abilities, of which, many are &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;-based, such as &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Circle\"&gt;Flame Circle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Wall%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fire Wall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firestorm%20%28Monster%20Skill%29\"&gt;Firestorm&lt;/a&gt;, so having full &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and some Fire Absorb will help greatly. At the start of the boss fight, diablo will use a fire circle. Diablo also has a nasty &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Touch\"&gt;Cold Touch&lt;/a&gt; ability (as can be seen in the animation above) that slows players down, which can be ignored by having an item with the \"Cannot be Frozen\" ability. His most feared attack in normal difficulty is his &lt;a href=\"Red%20Lightning%20Hose\"&gt;Red Lightning Hose&lt;/a&gt; attack, which deals massive damage. The damage done by this attack is partly based; the other part is Physical Damage. Maximum &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Resistance\"&gt;Lightning Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and Damage Reduction (for players using shields: a high &lt;a href=\"Faster%20Block%20Rate\"&gt;Block rate&lt;/a&gt; helps) might allow you to survive this attack, but it's wise just to run away when you see Diablo preparing to cast it. In later difficulty levels, however, the damage from this attack originates from a distance where melee characters will not take damage from the attack unless they choose to move out of melee range. Diablo also charges at players who are out of his melee range. His melee damage is also considerable \u2013 yet another reason to bring some Damage reduction with you.\nIt is recommended to at least max out Fire Resistance and, if possible, Lightning Resistance as well. That is, achieve 75% resistance in either field (or up to 95% in each, with the appropriate gear). Ranged attackers have fewer problems evading the Fire and Lightning Hose spells, but have to make sure they don't get charged by Diablo. Melee attackers will just have to endure Diablo's melee hits: this is a Healing Potion-intensive fight. Keep hitting the Lord of Terror as much as possible; with full Fire Resistance and possibly Fire Absorption, the player should be able to survive the Firestorm and Fire Nova spells with relative ease. Only run away from the Red Lightning Hose spell; it deals significant damage and will kill quickly if the player does not move away in time. It is also important to fight Diablo at a place where there is enough space to run away.\nWhen dodging the Lightning Hose attack, run around Diablo rather than away from him. Diablo turns slowly while casting the spell, making it quite easy to outrun it. Diablo uses the spell in rapid succession, however (most often three times in a row), so be prepared to run in the opposite direction as soon as the previous Lightning Hose spell ends. This also calls for high stamina or stamina potions, as the player's stamina may run out after doing this a few times, and it is almost impossible to evade the Red Lightning Hose spell while walking. Just before Diablo starts casting his Lightning Hose attack, he raises both his hands into the air, which is different from any of his other skills or attacks: this gives some time, though less than one second, to react before it hits. A combination of his Cold Touch followed up with the Lightning Hose is very deadly and extremely difficult to evade.\nYou most likely have to retreat to the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; a few times to refill the supply of Healing Potions. Opening a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; should be done out of sight where Diablo cannot reach you, as he tends to cast &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison\"&gt;Bone Prison&lt;/a&gt; around Town Portals. Diablo has several seconds to kill the player defenseless in the Prison. Interestingly, Diablo's AI does not allow him to leave the large central area of the Chaos Sanctuary, and thus he will not follow you if you go down any of its four halls. This makes the seal areas and the entrance fully safe for town portals and also for refilling potions to the belt during the fight.\nKeep battering the Lord of Terror until he finally falls. Watch a spectacular death animation, grab the loot and head back to the Pandemonium Fortress before you either continue to &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; or sit back to enjoy the Epilogue.\n\u00dcber Diablo.\nIn the \"Lord of Destruction\" expansion and the classic version, there exists a more powerful version of Diablo called &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Diablo\"&gt;\u00dcber Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. He is most likely added to the game since, despite his name being the title, he isn't the final boss of the expansion or classic. There is no plot explanation for his existence but is speculated to have been created to curb the excessive amount of Stones of Jordan that people managed to duplicate by various exploits on Battle.net's servers. He serves as a super boss enemy, in the sense that fighting him is optional, and he is stronger than Baal.\n\u00dcber Diablo can only be fought on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20difficulty\"&gt;Hell difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, and only on the Battle.Net Realms (not the Open Realms). You get to choose the place to battle him, as when he is able to spawn, he replaces the first super-unique monster you face. For example: When you summon him (although that is a bad way to describe how he spawns), you can go to The Den of Evil to fight Corpsefire, but instead, you will battle \u00dcber Diablo. Upon death he drops a unique small charm called &lt;a href=\"Annihilus\"&gt;Annihilus&lt;/a&gt;, this charm only drops in the expansion. If the \u00dcber Diablo dies in non-expansion he will drop nothing.\nThe Experience you gain killing the \u00dcber Diablo is less than from \"normal\" Diablo, due to the fact his monster level is set at 110, and the non-\u00dcber version is set at 85 for Hell Difficulty.\nAs stated before, \u00dcber Diablo is a much stronger version of Diablo. He possesses all of Diablo's attacks, and can also cast &lt;a href=\"Armageddon\"&gt;Armageddon&lt;/a&gt; as well. Although he's the strongest enemy in the game outside the three bosses of \u00dcber Tristram, he has all of the same attacks, and preparations for fighting him are overall the same as Diablo, requiring a high amount of fire and lightning protection.\nAfter about thirty seconds of combat, he will regenerate his health at an incredible rate, and if the damage is not high enough, he will heal completely. Luckily, an item with \"prevent &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Heal\"&gt;monster heal&lt;/a&gt;\" will prevent this as will the eight seconds from a successful &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt; attack.\nPandemonium Diablo.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Diablo\"&gt;Pandemonium Diablo&lt;/a&gt; is featured as a part of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt;, the ultimate challenge of Diablo II. It is the strongest version of this boss and is accompanied by powered-up versions of his brothers, &lt;a href=\"Uber%20Baal\"&gt;Uber Baal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uber%20Mephisto\"&gt;Uber Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;. The battle itself take place in \"&lt;a href=\"Uber%20Tristram\"&gt;Uber Tristram&lt;/a&gt;\", and in order to get there, players have to collect keys from the weaker, but powerful bosses &lt;a href=\"Uber%20Duriel\"&gt;Uber Duriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uber%20Izual\"&gt;Uber Izual&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, all of which require their own keys to be accessed.\nDevelopment.\nDiablo has three unused laugh sounds in the files titled laugh1.wav, laugh2.wav, laugh3.wav."}

However, &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; pursues him through , reaching the Arch just after Diablo, and defeating him.\nDiablo's essence remains within the Black Soulstone for a time, but as the New &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; attempt to secure it in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Tomb of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; takes the stone's power for himself, ultimately shattering it and absorbing its power for his own fight against The Nephalem. When &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; learns of the shattered stone, he concludes \"Malthael's death will have released Diablo. He is free.\"\nBoss Fight.\nThe final battle with Diablo takes place atop the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; after fighting your way through the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Spire\"&gt;Silver Spire&lt;/a&gt; to reach the &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20of%20Heaven\"&gt;Pinnacle of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; at the end of Act IV. With all seven Evils embodied in him, he is not an easy fight. Followers cannot go with you to the fight against him (except in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;), so prepare yourself accordingly.\nThe battle consists of three major phases, each of which can last as long as needed (as Diablo has no enrage timer). There are two Health Wells on the left and right sides of the central ring, but they are not available in phase 2.\nI Am Legion: Diablo has five major attacks over the course of the battle, along with some supporting abilities. While he looks pretty agile, he is actually moving and attacking very slowly, compensated by his high damage and ability list.\nThe Realm of Terror: After suffering enough damage (about 65%), Diablo stuns you and shunts you off to his &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Realm of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, essentially a dark and shadowy counterpart of the Crystal Arch you've been fighting him in, but without Healing Wells. Here, you will need to fight two major enemies.\nThis Wretched Light Must Be Eradicated: Once you defeat the Shadow of Diablo and escape the Realm of Terror, Diablo heals back to at least 65% and becomes more aggressive with his teleports and attacks. He also gains two more abilities:\nContinue whittling away at his health and avoiding his attacks until his lifebar is down to around 5% of his total HP, at which point the \"Destroy Diablo\" objective appears. At this point, the battle is won: you can hit him with everything you wish (the goal is to bring him to 1%), or just deal a bit more damage and then stand and watch. After some time, Diablo's body will explode, and his corpse collapses to the ground. After a short cutscene, the fight is over, and loot is dropped.\nUber Appearance (Soul of Evil).\nThough Diablo never made it onto the level 60 variant of the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Machine\"&gt;Infernal Machine&lt;/a&gt; event, he does make an appearance for the Reaper of Souls variant of the same event as Soul of Evil, Unstoppable Hatred. Players can fight him in the Realm of Fright, taking on his appearance from the second phase of his canon encounter.\nFor the most part, he possesses the same attack list as that of the canon appearance, but there have been changes to his abilities:\nOnce the Soul of Evil and its servants all die (no matter in which order), the last defeated boss drops at least one &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fright\"&gt;Heart of Fright&lt;/a&gt;. This organ is needed if the hero wishes to craft a &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ring%20%28other%29\"&gt;Hellfire Ring&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Amulet\"&gt;Hellfire Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, and has the same drop rate as other organs: 1 guaranteed at &lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment I&lt;/a&gt; with increasing chances of additional organs at higher difficulty, up to a 100% chance of 4 organs at Torment XVI.\nThe Soul of Evil has a chance upon death to drop &lt;a href=\"Star%20Pauldrons\"&gt;Star Pauldrons&lt;/a&gt;."}

The battle begins immediately after &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Terror\"&gt;his avatar&lt;/a&gt; is defeated.

Many of his abilities from &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;the second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;third games&lt;/a&gt; return here. The fight slightly differs if the player decided to spare &lt;a href=\"Verathiel\"&gt;Verathiel&lt;/a&gt; earlier.\nAt different points, Diablo will protect himself in a barrier, cloak the arena in darkness, and summon an endless horde of demons.

This action has to be done thrice, with the barrier visibly weakening with each dispel.\nDuring this period, Diablo attacks as usual, but cannot use leap or summon minions.\nDiablo retains all his skills from the first phase. If Verathiel was spared earlier, he will bring her under his thrall, forcing the player to kill her. \n2nd Battle.\nAfter being killed. Diablo uses the Worldstone shard to resurrect himself.

Following its popularity, an unofficial expansion pack entitled \"\" was developed by &lt;a href=\"Synergistic%20Software\"&gt;Synergistic Software&lt;/a&gt; and released in November, 1997 by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment\"&gt;Sierra Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. This was followed by a sequel, \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", which was released by Blizzard Entertainment in 2000.\nPlot.\nThe story of \"Diablo\" is based on the premise of a war between &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. The town of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; is under attack by hordes of demons, pouring forth from beneath the ruined &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, and the player must save the town. As the player delves into the network of labyrinths within the Dungeons, and later on the Catacombs beneath, which in turn are followed by the Caves further deep down, he or she discovers more about the &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, who is residing in the &lt;a href=\"Level%2016%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;final level&lt;/a&gt; of Hell, which lies even further beyond, through large &lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; which are found throughout the levels. Eventually, the player reaches the lair of &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself and must kill him.\nDiablo, an incredibly powerful demon, is the Lord of Terror and one of the Three Prime Evils of Hell, who had been imprisoned within a &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; and buried in the caverns deep beneath the town of Tristram centuries ago by an ancient people known as the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;. Although his imprisonment was meant to be eternal, Diablo worked tirelessly to corrupt his Soulstone, eventually overpowering his prison. Diablo received help from the thoroughly corrupt &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, who had been turned into his loyal servant. However, in order for Diablo to actually manifest himself in the mortal realm, he needed a mortal vessel to house his spirit.\nDiablo first tried to possess &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, the local ruler of Tristram, but due to his weakened state and the strong will of the King, Diablo failed to gain full control. Therefore, the demon abandoned the King, which in turn left the King crazed and senseless. Lazarus then kidnaps King Leoric's younger son, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Albrecht\"&gt;Prince Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;. He leads him deep into the Catacombs where he inserts the Demon's Soulstone in the Prince's forehead. This allowed Diablo to possess and warp the prince, thereby attaining material form. Diablo may have a body now, but he is far from his full power, so he bides his time and summons countless hordes of demons, infesting the entire underground complex, gradually turning the region into an outpost of Hell.\nThe maddened King Leoric accuses the townsfolk of Tristram with the kidnapping of Albrecht, and has several people executed. His loyal knights try to calm him, but as the crazed king has completely lost his sanity they are forced to kill him. His dying words are a terrible curse, damning the knights into unholy servitude. Meanwhile, Lazarus emerged from the catacombs and rallied the townsfolk, leading them deep into the catacombs in order to save the prince. This turns out to be a trap - instead Lazarus lures and leads them to the lair of . Many of the townsfolk are slain by the demons. Afterwards Lazarus flees deeper into the underground Dungeon.\nDemons appear in the countryside as the Lord of Terror regains his strength in the very heart of the labyrinth and prepares, biding the time when he would once again emerge to seek out his brothers - &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; - and free them as well. It seemed to be only a matter of time until the three Prime Evils gained dominion over the entire mortal realm.\nThis is where the protagonist comes into play. As he or she fights their way through the sixteen levels of the Dungeon to face &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, they encounter various monsters, quests, tomes, scrolls, weapons, and other miscellaneous items.\nAt the end of the game, the hero removes the Soulstone from \"Diablo's\" head (being that of Prince Albrecht, that is). To the player's surprise, Diablo begins to melt away, revealing Prince Albrecht's body underneath. The hero then pierces his or her head with the Soulstone, attempting to contain the Lord of Terror himself. However, the end of the game hints at a darker outcome. The final scene depicts the hero, swathed in a shadowy, hooded cloak. The closing words are foreboding:\n\"\"The Soulstone burns with Hellfire as an eerie red glow blurs your vision. Fresh blood flows into your eyes, and you begin to hear the tormented whispers of the Damned. You have done what you knew must be done. The essence of Diablo is contained... for now.\"\n\"You pray that you have become strong enough to contain the Demon and keep him at bay. Although you have been fortified by your quest, you can still feel him, clawing his way up from the dark recesses of your soul.\"\n\"Fighting to retain control, your thoughts turn toward the ancient, mystic lands of the Far East. Perhaps there, beyond the desolate wastes of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, you will find an answer.\"\n\"Or perhaps... &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;salvation&lt;/a&gt;!\"\"\nGameplay.\n\"Diablo\" (\"Diablo I\") is one of the most well-known examples of the action-RPG subgenre. Although players level up, choose character classes, and manage a variety of spells and equipment like a typical RPG, all actions are done in real-time, just like in an action game.\nThe majority of commands executed in Diablo are performed by the mouse. Players click on an area of the screen to direct the character, and click on enemies to attack. However, learned spells could be assigned &lt;a href=\"hot%20keys\"&gt;hot keys&lt;/a&gt; using the function keys on mouse-over, as well as several text exclamations (e.g. \"Help me!\") that could be edited in a configuration file.\nIts own expansion ', its popular sequel \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and also the subsequent expansion pack ' extend the gameplay through additions such as new character classes, monsters, items, quests, areas, and plot. The latest installment, and the expansion pack for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", which is \"\" has a huge online gaming community, complete with a primitive game world &lt;a href=\"Economics\"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt; due to the rarity of most of the popular &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter Classes.\nThe three character &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; from \"Diablo\" are the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;. Each character, following typical role-playing conventions, has his or her own particular traits. The Warrior possesses physical &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, the Rogue has got high &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, and the Sorcerer is oriented towards &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarrior.\nThe warrior is a powerful melee fighter, master of &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; of war and capable of enduring more &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; than any of the other classes. Seeking fortune and glory, warriors come to Tristram every day to challenge the dark unknown in the subterranean labyrinth. They are not necessarily of any particular clan or group and range from barbarians from the northern highlands to noble paladins. Warriors are able to repair their equipment at the cost of diminishing maximum durability. The amount of maximum durability lost with use decreases as character level increases. Given this lost durability, most players opt instead to pay for non-destructive repairs in town for equipment they will be using in the long term.\nRogue.\nThe Sisters of the Sightless Eye are the best archers in the world of Sanctuary and the rogue therefore is master of killing enemies from a distance. They can have a higher level of magic than warriors and thus are able to make better use of magic in their battles, although not nearly as well as sorcerers. Willing to test their skills against the evil in the labyrinth, where untold riches are rumored to be stashed, rogues have come from the far east to Tristram. Rogues have the ability to spot doors, chests and sarcophagi that have traps and are able to disarm them. The chance to successfully disarm a trap increases with the character's dexterity attribute.\nSorcerer.\nA powerful master of the Arcane arts, the sorcerer is the hero that is able to achieve the greatest heights of magic, so that he never really has any need for physical weapons - he can kill his enemies solely with magic, whether it be searing arcs of flame or powerful bolts of lightning. Eager to gather knowledge about demons and see them slain, sorcerer acolytes of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; mage clan have come to Tristram - seeking to discover long lost tomes of magic knowledge under the cathedral. The sorcerer is able to recharge magic staves at the cost of the maximum number of charges. The amount of maximum charges lost with use decreases as character level increases. As per the warrior class's skill, this is less-used in late-game and with equipment used in the long-term.\nDifferences Between Classes.\nUnlike \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and other games that strictly differentiate between classes, a character's abilities are not unique; a Warrior can use the same &lt;a href=\"Spellbook\"&gt;Spells&lt;/a&gt; like a Sorcerer, while a sorcerer is able to use an &lt;a href=\"Axes\"&gt;Axe&lt;/a&gt;. All three classes require the same amount of experience to level up, and there are no class-based requirements for equipping items or using spells. However, this does not mean that a warrior could easily turn into a perfect sorcerer as different classes have different starting attributes. For example, a warrior always starts with more strength than a sorcerer. Additionally, the Warrior gains more &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; per level than the Sorcerer, and the sorcerer gains more &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; per level than the warrior, with the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; gaining equal amounts of both, resulting in the rogue being the more balanced character out of all three.\nIn terms of game mechanics, the different characters also each have different maximum possible levels for their &lt;a href=\"Character%20Attributes\"&gt;Attributes&lt;/a&gt;, and gain different amounts of life and mana per level. As a result, some classes may have difficulty attaining the attribute levels required to equip or use high level &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;/spells. For example, only the Warrior is able to natively achieve the necessary &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to wear a full suit of plate armor or wield a heavy sword (the others requiring strength-enhancing equipment), while only the Rogue natively has got the maximum possible &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; required to use a high-level &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter Stats.\nMax values do not include item bonuses. Data source: Jarulf's Guide to Diablo and Hellfire, v. 1.62.\nAlso, the characters have \"hidden\" differences in their in-game performance. The Warrior has an innately higher &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;chance to hit&lt;/a&gt; in melee combat, a chance to cause a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt; (causing twice the original damage; the other two characters lack this), as well as the best &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;chance to block&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. Also there are fewer frames per swing with &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapons\"&gt;Melee Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. The Rogue calculates not only her strength but her dexterity as well when determining the damage she can deal with a bow, she has a higher hit chance in the use of bows and also a faster rate of fire similar to the Warrior with melee weapons. The Sorcerer has the highest chance to hit with magical spells and the fastest &lt;a href=\"Cast%20Rate\"&gt;Cast Rate&lt;/a&gt;, as well as gaining more &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; than any of the other two classes from &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; which increase &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Attribute%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nResult on Gameplay.\nOverall, there are no class-based requirements for equipping items or using spells, but class-based attributes and performance do limit the ability of characters to cross over.\nWarriors are the most effective for melee combat, though their limited level of magic allows them to use spells for support situations, notably &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Curse\"&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/a&gt; against tough enemies and &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt; for \"telekilling\" (to quickly move in close quarters with ranged enemies).\nLike Warriors, Rogues use magic mainly to supplement (their main expertise is archery) rather than as a primary offense/defense, as their maximum mana level is not much higher than that of a Warrior. Nonetheless, they do have more magic (see Maximum &lt;a href=\"Character%20Attributes\"&gt;Attributes&lt;/a&gt; above) so they can rely upon &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Shield\"&gt;Mana Shield&lt;/a&gt; and on a more regular basis than Warriors.\nSorcerers on the other hand essentially rely on spells, given their high levels of magic and low levels of strength, dexterity, and vitality. They have little use for dexterity and vitality, instead focusing on the use of Mana Shield to compensate for low hitpoints. Nonetheless players often max out a Sorcerer's strength in order to wear certain types of armor (these are nicknamed \"Battle Mages\" or \"Tank Mages\").\nEach class also has a special \"skill\" which is unique to specific character classes. Warriors have the ability to repair items, Rogues can disarm traps and Sorcerers can recharge staves that have a certain amount of spell charges on them. However there is a drawback that is associated with repairing or recharging an item. In both cases both the original durability and maximum staff charges are reduced. Therefore in using such an ability, the item loses its potential and worth, which is why it is highly recommended to use these skills only on low-end equipment, e.g., normal items or magic items of low worth.\nCharacter Information.\nAttributes.\nThe four numerical character attributes in \"Diablo\" affect the characters' combat statistics which in turn determine how powerful the character is. With each level up, five points may be distributed among the \"Base\" attributes to permanently increase them at the player's choice. They may also be modified by elixirs and magical shrines encountered in the game. Various magical items acquired in game increase the effective character attributes \"Now\" (while these items are being used).\nThe Dungeon.\nThere are sixteen levels of the Dungeon, divided into four areas. Each area has a different appearance, architecture, light level, monster mix, and musical soundtrack. The first level of each of these areas (levels 5, 9, and 13) have an additional exit leading back up to the town of Tristram, just like the exit of the Church Dungeon.\nIn Single Player, these entrances are blocked until the character opens them from the dungeon side. For example, the entrance from level 13 to town is not visible at first. When the character reaches level 13 from level 12, and then finds the stairs to town, they may go up, and the entrance (a glowing crevice) opens and is available for two-way travel from then on.\nIn Multi Player, the entrances to town all start in their \"open\" position, but with a level requirement to access them from town. A character that does not meet this level requirement will have to either gain more levels, or reach that area by completing the preceding area.\nMonsters.\nThe monsters of \"Diablo I\" are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; monstrosities, vicious nocturnals and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s spawned from Hell. As the player progresses, it passes through four distinct areas: the , the , the and , which has started to seep into the mortal plane due to Diablo's presence. Each of the sixteen levels contains monsters that are tougher and stronger than ones from the level before it. When the player kills a monster, the monster may randomly drop an item or gold. Upon killing more enemies, the player may find out more details about the monsters, such as &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Hit Points&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;Immunities&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the world of Diablo, monsters are divided according to their masters.\nThe followers of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Hatred, are the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s), demonically corrupted animals whose unshapely forms and twisted limbs leave them in eternal agony and rage (&lt;a href=\"Overlord\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt;s), and &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Demon\"&gt;Magma Demon&lt;/a&gt;s spawned by the spilling of Mephisto's blood in Hell.\nThe followers of &lt;a href=\"Baal%20%28Diablo%29\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Destruction, are creatures that seek the undoing of the material universe and the manifestation of chaos. Some of them include the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20One\"&gt;Fallen One&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Goatman\"&gt;Goatmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Spitter\"&gt;Poison Spitter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe minions of Diablo, the Lord of Terror, are the fears of man in a corporeal form, figuratively-speaking. They prefer to attack their victims from the shadows, especially after their prey demonstrates weakness. Some of these demons are The &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scavenger\"&gt;Scavenger&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn Diablo, enemies are also divided in 3 groups:\nItems and Shrines.\n&lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;Items&lt;/a&gt; are sold by the vendors, randomly dropped by slain monsters, and can also be discovered within the labyrinth inside of chests or barrels or sometimes even lying on the floor. There are several types of items:\nConsumables.\nThese are items which are consumed when used.\nThe Belt: Between the red and blue orbs of life and mana, at the bottom of the screen, the player has eight slots representing a belt which can contain potions, elixirs, and scrolls. These slots are numbered, and pressing the corresponding key (one through eight) will drink (or cast, for a scroll) the associated consumables. No other items can be placed in the belt.\nEquipment.\n&lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helms\"&gt;Helms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rings\"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amulets\"&gt;Amulets&lt;/a&gt; are the basic types of equipment. Any character can use any piece of equipment so long as they meet its statistical requirements - Strength, Dexterity, and Magic (there are no items with Vitality requirements). The only other restrictions are that characters may not equip two weapons simultaneously, use a two-handed weapon in conjunction with a shield, or hold two shields simultaneously.\nWeapons and protective gear have durability values that decrease with use. The durability of weapons has a chance of being reduced when striking an enemy; the durability of armor has a chance of being reduced when the character is struck. When the durability of a piece of gear gets low, an icon appears the corner of the screen to warn the player. If the durability reaches zero, the item breaks and is utterly destroyed. An item's durability can be restored by paying &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt; to repair it, or using the Warrior's repair skill on it. Item repair costs at Griswold vary, but overall, the more powerfully enchanted the item is, the more expensive the repairs will be.\nStaves are magical weapons used primarily for the spell charges they contain; each charge allows one casting of the spell contained within the staff; staves also can have magical prefixes. Some of the most popular abilities found on staves are \"Angel's\" and \"Archangel's\", which add to all spell levels, and \"Emerald\" and related prefixes which improve resistances. A Sorcerer can recharge a staff using his Recharge skill, but at the cost of permanently reducing its maximum charge level. Therefore, it is preferable when possible to have Adria recharge staves, though this can be expensive. With respect to effective level of the spell produced by the staff's charge, staves function identically to scrolls: the spell is cast at the level known to the caster, unless it is unknown, in which case it is cast at level one.\nRings and Amulets have no innate damage or armor class bonuses, and only come in Magical and Unique versions, never Normal and they're always Indestructible. The character may wear only one amulet and two rings at any given time.\nEquippable items can have various modifiers, and break down into three major classes as a result:\nGold.\nGold is the currency used to buy goods and services from the vendors. When gold is picked up from the ground or received from selling an item, the amount is added to the smallest pile of gold in the player's inventory. A maximum of five thousand gold pieces can be in one pile (which occupies one square of inventory space). In the Hellfire expansion, an item gained as a quest reward is a unique amulet that allows each inventory space to hold ten thousand gold instead.\nQuest Items.\nQuest Items come in many varieties in the Single Player mode of \"Diablo\" and within the \"Hellfire\" expansion. Some of them activate a quest when picked up or found, while others must be carried along or used to interact with the environment, and yet others are given as special rewards for completing quests. Some of these quest-related items are automatically \"destroyed\" (or otherwise taken from the player) when the related quest is completed.\nShrines.\nShrines add a twist to \"Diablo\". They create effects upon one's character and sometimes others when activated. The normal Shrines found in the Dungeon and Catacombs (first eight levels) are labeled when the mouse cursor is placed over them. However, the Goat Shrines found in the Catacombs and the Cauldrons in Hell cause a random effect, leaving the player only with the result and the same cryptic clue that would be displayed in the center of the screen by a normal Shrine.\nLevels.\n\"Diablo\" is highly replayable thanks to its randomly generated levels, with every map that the player encounters being unique compared to the last. This randomness extends to the monster population as well, though they are generated from a group appropriate for that level. In addition, in Single Player mode there are only three core missions as the rest of them are drawn from several pools, making it impossible to complete every quest in one setting. Either way, only the last two quests are compulsory (although it is necessary to complete the voluntary missions to gain experience and items, and to learn more of the backstory). Given this arrangement, no two playthroughs of the game are ever exactly alike.\nBy contrast, its sequel, \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", is much more linear. Though many of its maps are randomly generated as well, the player will encounter the same levels and quests (many of which are compulsory) upon each playthrough.\n\"Diablo\" helped popularize a system used in other CRPGs (Computer Role Playing Game) such as the Might and Magic Series, to handle the many combinations of random items imbued with random magical properties (i.e. any item \"of the Eagle\" will give hitpoints to the player, any \"Bronze\" item will increase the chances of a hit, etc.); this system is utilized by its sequels. The only items which are relatively constant are \"Unique Items\", which have the same types of bonuses, though sometimes of varying amounts, every time they are found.\nMulti Player.\nThe game supports several types of Multi Player connections. It can be played over a local area network using the IPX network protocol, a telephone line with the use of a modem, or by means of a serial cable in a direct connection. One can also play \"Diablo\" over the Internet via &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnfortunately, the game lacked the stronger anti-cheating methods of Blizzard's later games and as a result, many characters online have been altered in various ways by common third-party programs known as \"trainers\". It is difficult to play a fair online game of \"Diablo\" in public games, as hacks and duplicated items are common. The use of trainers (which modify memory locations while the game is running in order to cheat) is fairly common and character editors are often used to give incredible statistics to even newly made characters. Additionally, buggy game code allows any player to infinitely duplicate items. A typical duped/hacked item seen online is the \"Godly Plate of the Whale\", a combination of enchantments which actually can never appear legitimately on Full Plate Mail due to the way the game generates items. Another is the \"Archangel's Staff of Apocalypse\" with 255 charges (while Archangels' Staves of Apocalypse are possible, they can never have more than twelve charges legitimately).\nVersions and Expansion Pack.\n\"Diablo\" was cited to be officially released by Blizzard in January, 1997, with an official announcement of the release by Blizzard Entertainment on January 3, 1997, although the game had originally been set to be sold in stores on January 6, and its wide release was reported on that date by \"CNET Gamecenter\". However, certain retailers had broken the game's official street date by January 2. Designer David Brevik claimed in 2016 that certain West Coast retailers already had begun selling the game by December 31, 1996. An oft stated release date of November 30, 1996 is incorrect as Diablo only went gold and into full production on December 27, 1996.\nIn 1998, a PlayStation version of Diablo was published by Electronic Arts. The game lacked online play, but featured a two-player cooperative mode. It also featured an option to learn the story through a narrator without having to find the books in the game. This feature can be found on the main menu under the title 'history'. This version was infamous because of its needs of 10 blocks from the memory card.\nThe only official &lt;a href=\"expansion%20pack\"&gt;expansion pack&lt;/a&gt; made for \"Diablo\" was \"\" in 1997. The expansion was produced by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment\"&gt;Sierra Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; rather than an in-house Blizzard North development team. The expansion featured two additional dungeon segments located within a new side storyline, several new unique items and magical item properties, new spells, and a fourth class, the Monk. There were also two possibly unfinished \"test\" classes (the Bard and Barbarian) and two quests which could be accessed only through a configuration file modification.\n\"Hellfire\" was also relatively buggy, and since a version of \"Diablo\" with \"Hellfire\" installed could not be patched using Blizzard's \"Diablo\" patches, and Sierra themselves only released one patch for \"Hellfire\", it retained some bugs that the original \"Diablo\" did not. The expansion also had some small design problems wherein some of the new unique items could never be found in the game.\nHowever, despite these problems \"Hellfire\" generally received quite favorable reviews from the game magazines at the time. Blizzard North also later implemented their own versions of the insect caves and the crypt levels introduced in the expansion in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Diablo\" was included with the release of the Diablo Battle Chest on December 31, 2003, however it was sans the expansion &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt; and the 80 page booklet.\nDevelopment.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe idea of a game called \"Diablo\" existed as far back as &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt; seeing Mt. Diablo. The original concept for the game itself was more of a traditional party-based RPG, turn-based and heavily influenced by ', ', and \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//ultima.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page\"&gt;Ultima&lt;/a&gt;\". Brevik started designing the game when he was 16. His exposure to Roguelikes in college (including \"Rogue\" itself) further influenced his early designs. \nWhen Condor was formed, Brevik put together a 10 page design document for \"Diablo\", describing it as a turn-based, Single Player DOS game that would have expansion packs (he likened the expansions to the booster packs of '). The expansions were expected to be picked up at cash registers at $5 per expansion. Each would have their own theme, such as \"Dark Nightmares\" or \"Holy Avengers.\" The game would have permadeath, which had been a feature of previous roguelikes. The game would also have a claymation art style, taking inspiration from '. The idea of permadeath was removed due to how punishing it was for players, but would return later in &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode. Brevik hoped the game would be an improvement (e.g. graphics) on the games he played in college. \nAt the time, the RPG genre had a focus on narrative. The developers wanted to instead focus on the action, with story layered into the background.\nEarly on, the idea was to set the game in a dark gothic world, bereft of orcs or elves.\nDevelopment Cycle.\nInitially, game was pitched to various publishers without success, given that it would be PC-exclusive, and the sense among publishers that the game's genre was too niche. The game was pitched around 20 times and rejected in each case.\nCondor approached &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; in 1995 with their idea for the game\u2014a turn-based, singleplayer claymation RPG. The use of turn-based combat would involve action points which would determine how many actions would be possible in a given turn. Both the player and monsters would use these points. The turn-based formula came from early Roguelikes. \n\"Diablo\" was simply its working title at the time. At this point, Condor had to decide what the game would actually look like as it appeared on-screen. Brevik took a screenshot from \"\" as a point of reference as part of the pitch. Blizzard accepted the pitch.\nThe game's development process was difficult, and left Condor on the brink of insolvency several times. The game was given an initial budget of $1.2 million. Even for the time, it was a budget that was very small. The game had a development staff of 15 people.\nCondor was purchased by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; and renamed \"Blizzard North\" about halfway through the game's development process. This changed the nature of the project and the developers almost started over, as they were now free from their former budgetary constraints.\nThe game's \"crunch period\" of development began in August, 1996. &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; was implemented into the game's Multi Player six months before release. Towards the end of its development, members of Blizzard South were transferred to work on the game before returning to work on \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\". This included work on the development of &lt;a href=\"battle.net\"&gt;battle.net&lt;/a&gt;, as during most of its development, Diablo didn't have Multi Player modes, or even codes for Multi Player. Brevik was wary of people hacking, but Blizzard reasoned these would be isolated incidents. Brevik was proven in the right, leading to revamped architecture for \"Diablo II\".\nCompared to RPGs of the time, the gameplay of \"Diablo\" was intentionally streamlined. Examples include controlling one character rather than a party, and the absence of character backstories. Brevik has cited his experience in developing console games as part of this design philosophy.\nNo propriety tools were used in the game's design. Background tiles were created by hand, and commercial software was used to process character art. The developers intended to implement a \"jog\" function that would allow players to navigate Tristram more quickly, but they couldn't implement the required animation. This function would not be implemented until the game's .\nA pre-alpha released demo was provided in November, 1996, through \"PC Gamer\". The game went gold on December 26, 1996.\nArt Style.\nThe game's art style was designed to be dark and bloody, to stand in contrast with traditional high fantasy (e.g. elves). &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich Schaefer&lt;/a&gt; was the game's art director, in addition to being its lead designer. The look of the game was taken from his love of Italian zombie movies, and his personal visits to churches, castles, and catacombs. The art style caused some unease from Davidson &amp; Associates (the company that owned Blizzard at the time). The game's artists had filled the dungeon with lurid imagery including blood, gore, and naked dead bodies, leading to some arguments with the strike team, who demanded that the graphic content be toned down.\nCinematics and Story.\nIn the original story, Diablo would be the actual Devil. In opposition to him was a hero where, in a backstory different from the final product, the hero had lost his home and family to raiders. Left with nothing save vengeance, the hero would trace the raiders to a crypt with a labyrinth below it. It was also intended that the game's ending be open-ended to allow for different themes in future sequels. Goblin caves and a \"living fungus world\" were ideas pitched for such themes. These locations were intended to be released in expansions.\nBlizzard's cinematics team was created at around the same time as \"Diablo I\" was being developed.\n&lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; originally reacted negatively to the \"\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\"\" name. Metzen later developed the game's story.\nThe game's final cinematic (where the hero plunges Diablo's &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; into their forehead) was sent to Blizzard North one month before the game's release. This created some contention with Blizzard North, as they hadn't been consulted, and the implication was that the hero died at the end of the game. However, according to &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;, \"we liked it enough, and it was just weird enough, and it was too late to do anything else.\"\nUser Interface.\nA year into development, Blizzard requested that the game be turned from a turn-based game to a real-time one, along with featuring a Multi Player component. Brevik protested the decision, but everyone in Condor agreed to the change. Brevik converted the game from turn-based to real-time over the course of a few hours of coding.\nCondor disliked RPG menus during Diablo's development, due to the time spent on character creation before one could begin the game proper. Inspiration was taken from \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Adoom%3ADoom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;\" in regards to the game's menu, including thematic inspiration. The idea that the UI would meet the \"mom test\" (i.e. \"could my mom play this?\"). The idea was to make something that players could start playing as quickly as possible, with minimal hang-ups.\nThe game's map took inspiration from \"\", and was implemented in the last 3 months of the project.\nClasses.\nAt least two conceptions of the game's class system exist prior to the final version that was implemented in the game.\nIn the original design document, the player would be presented with a choice of class and race. 5-6 human races would be offered (hill people, forest people, etc.), each with advantages and disadvantages. The player would then have a choice of class, namely fighter, thief, or magician. All the characters would be able to use weapons and cast spells, but advantages would exist based on the nature of the class\u2014the fighter would gain more attacks, the thief would move faster and have stealth advantages, and the magician would be able to cast more powerful spells. The magician would be able to choose from one of four schools of magic. After making the choice, the game would provide the character with basic statistics in the form of strength, magicial aptitude, dexterity, and vitality. The player could also choose a pre-set character, skipping the character creation process. The idea of sub-classes was also mentioned.\nA different take on the characters also existed prior to the game's release. It has been stated that it was originally intended that the game would only have a single class (represented by the warrior), where players could distribute attributes to their liking and thus take the character in whatever direction they wanted. The division of the character into the warrior, rogue, and sorcerer archetypes occurred late during development.\nCut Content.\n\"Diablo\" was originally intended to be much more expansive than the final product. A large number of monsters, characters, items, and quests never made it into the retail release. A large portion of this content is still contained on dormant files hidden on the CD of the game.\nBugs.\nMany gameplay bugs were fixed by the patches made available by Blizzard. However, two critical bugs were never addressed by these patches. One of these is a bug allowing item duplication, also called the \"dupe bug\". With practice and timing, a character can duplicate any single item, including stacks of money. However, the existence of trainers and other third-party programs made item duplication far quicker and easier, so few learned to use the duplication bug after the trainers became widely available.\nThe last patch, v&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.09%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;1.09&lt;/a&gt; was released in 2001.\nA bug that is only noticeable on latter-day computers is the colors appearing very psychedelic since the 32-bit color-rendering graphic system on newer computer systems causes the 256-color scheme of the game to falter miserably. This effect can be worked around by killing explorer.exe before or after starting Diablo (tested on Windows 7). Another possible workaround for Windows 7 is to right-click on the desktop and select \"Screen Resolution\" before launching the game. It's also possible to Alt+Tab out of Diablo after starting, right-click on the desktop, select \"Screen Resolution\", and Alt+Tab back into Diablo while the \"Screen Resolution\" window remains open. In Windows 8 it is possible to fix this color wash issue by changing the compatability settings under properties of either setup or autorun. Under settings, allow color reduction and use either 8 or 16-bit color mode. Blizzard have subsequently released a registry fix for this which is available from their site.\nAnother bug that prevents players from connecting through Battle.net is the fact that if you play the version of \"Diablo I\" from the Battle Chest and attempt to connect to Battle.net, you will have to apply v1.09 before you can play. However, once you finish applying the patch, it will tell you the following:\n\"Battle.net was unable to properly identify your application version. Please uninstall and then reinstall the application. If the problem persists then you may have a computer virus. For information on detecting and removing this virus you may contact us by email support@blizzard.com\" \nOn Macs, the online play works just fine.\nReception and Influence.\nThe game sold 2.5 million units.\nCritical Response.\nThe large majority of reviews \"Diablo\" received were very positive. It received an average rating of 94 on Metacritic, with many awarding the game near-perfect or perfect scores on their respective grading systems. Most praised the game's addictive gameplay, immense replayability, dark atmosphere, superior graphics, moody musical score, and its great variety of possible magic items, enemies, levels, and quests. This last aspect was praised by GameSpot editor Trent Ward in his review of \"Diablo\", which he gave a \"9.6\", the highest score for a PC game to date:\n\"Similarly, although a set number of monsters is included, only a few will be seen during each full game. This means that players going back for their second or third shot at the game will very likely fight opponents they haven't seen before. Talk about replay value.\"\nDiablo was awarded GameSpot's Game of the Year Award for 1996.\n\"Adrenaline Vault\" reviewer Brian Clair awarded \"Diablo\" a perfect five out of five stars and had a similar amount of praise for the sound design and musical score for the game, calling the former \"perfect\" and saying of the latter:\n\"For years I have waited for a game to come out with that perfect musical score. I think I've found it in Diablo. The music is just as perfect as the sound fx in both quality of the sound and the score itself. Everything about it is perfect for the fantasy genre and just integrates great with the other nuances of the game.\"\nDiablo's online Multi Player aspect was also cited as one of the strongest points of the game, with it described as greatly extending its replay value.\nThe most common complaint about the game was the length of its Single Player aspect, which many felt was too short. Others criticized what was seen as the simplicity of the story, with RPGFan stating:\n\"It's been said already, but I'll say it again - if you consider plot to be a highly important part of your RPGs, and can't play any RPGs without a solid plot, stay away.\"\nInfluence.\n\"Diablo\" has been credited with creating a sub-genre of \"point-and-click\" Action RPG's. Since 1999 many games have used the concepts introduced in Diablo and some have imitated the game. These games include \"Dungeon Siege\", \"Mu Online\", \"Sacred\", \"Ragnarok Online\", \"Titan Quest\", etc.\nReferences to \"Diablo\" are scattered throughout the various Blizzard products that followed; see the 'Trivia' section for examples.\nThe Secret Cow Level.\nOne of the more well known aspects of \"Diablo\" was something that didn't actually exist. Rumors started of a \"Cow Level\" with varying instructions or ideas on how to enter such a place and what existed in this level. This would later become a running joke around &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;'s offices.\nBlizzard put a cheat code in \"StarCraft\": 'there is no cow level.' Typing this caused instant victory.\nThe Hellfire expansion also mocks this rumor - if \"cowquest\" is added to &lt;a href=\"command.txt\"&gt;command.txt&lt;/a&gt;, the first new dungeon segment is accessed by speaking to one of the townsfolk, who's dressed in a cow suit.\nAs a fan service, Blizzard actually did put a &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;Cow Level&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", although it was merely a very large area full of monsters called &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Bovine\"&gt;Hell Bovine&lt;/a&gt;s which were cows walking upright and carrying halberds. All of their sound files were of humans saying the word 'moo'. Net lore has it that the ridiculously bad voices of the cows were those of various Blizzard employees. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cow%20King\"&gt;The Cow King&lt;/a&gt;\" makes an appearance as a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; Hell Bovine.\nThe cow level is rarely brought up other than as a joke but is still referenced in other products. In the game \"Warcraft III\" the Tauren are introduced, a race of anthropomorphic bulls and cows, whether intentionally spoofing the joke or not. \"World of Warcraft\" features them as a playable race, and their city is sometimes jokingly referred to by players as \"The Cow Level.\" An item even exists named \"The &lt;a href=\"Cow%20King%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Cow King's Hide&lt;/a&gt;.\" On the game's loading screens, one of the tips displayed is \"TIP: There is no cow level.\" although this was added long after the game was released.\nThis is later referenced in Diablo III as well, through a tip on the loading screen, and when the spirit of the Cow King allows the hero passage to Whimsyshire. In the spirit's case, the hero is confused as to why he is seeing a cow, and remarks that something has gone wrong, be it a health potion, or where he/she went wrong. After insulting the hero as 'a stinking bag of flesh with no fur', the Cow King bids them welcome to the 'level of sparkling happiness and rainbows'. They then break the fourth wall, asking 'You mean the cow level?', to which the Cow King defends Blizzard's stance on the cow level, before telling them to 'move' along.\nHowever, there is a secret level that can only be accessed by transmuting a Bovine Bardiche into Kanai's Cube, which then opens a portal to \"Not the Cow Level\" which has the portal with special text telling the reader not to tell anyone as they won't be believed. This could be a reference to how the Secret Cow Level was opened in \"Diablo II\", as it required the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; and had the player use it to transmute &lt;a href=\"Wirt%27s%20Leg\"&gt;Wirt's Leg&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Tome of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;. This level in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" was originally only open to the public through a different method, and only for a limited time, but was changed to allow everyone a chance to play the \"nonexistent\" level.\nRe-release.\nIn March 2019, the game was re-released on the GOG digital distribution platform. It is available in two versions; the first is the original Battle.net version of the game, which is completely unchanged and allows players to connect to one another through Battle.net. The second is the GOG-enhanced version, which offers several quality of life additions, including minor audio fixes, up-scaling support for resolution and refresh rate control, and compatibility fixes. However, this version cannot connect to Battle.net and only supports Multi Player via LAN and P2P connection.\nOn 29/30 January 2024, the game along with the \"\" expansion released on &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; itself and can be installed via the Battle.net desktop app."}

The third room has two skull levers and both must be pulled to open the fourth and final room.\nIn this room, there is a pentagram on the floor, and it is heavily guarded. A row of Blood Knights forms the outer defense with Advocates behind them. In the very center of the room is an enemy denoted as \"The Dark Lord\", which is Diablo himself. Surprisingly, he is not a &lt;a href=\"unique%20monster\"&gt;unique monster&lt;/a&gt;. He uses the mighty &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; spell, and cannot be &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Curse\"&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/a&gt;d. Defeating him completes the quest, and the game ends in victory.\nMultiplayer Mode.\nThis quest is one of the four Diablo quests to appear in Multiplayer mode. Like in Single Player, it is triggered by &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; after Archbishop Lazarus is killed, but this time, level 16 is much larger. The four rooms are still in the same place, however, and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; still has his Blood Knights and Advocates as personal defenders.\nThe Multiplayer game will boot all players on Diablo's level upon his death, treating them to the ending &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent visits to Diablo's level will not result in booting players. This, given with the fact that players drop nothing upon dying on this level, can make lv. 16 a 'poor man's' &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; site.\nDiablo III.\nThis quest returns in &lt;a href=\"The%20Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;The Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt; virtually without any changes, except for that levers and rooms are located one after another, so there is no bypassing them or guessing where the boss might be.\nKilling Diablo (The Dark Lord) will play the cutscene from the original game (&lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;'s for male characters and &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;'s for female) and reward &lt;a href=\"Red%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Red Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;."}

But the mysterious armor is cursed, channeling a malevolent power into Norrec's tortured soul.

Years ago he left the town of &lt;a href=\"Bramwell\"&gt;Bramwell&lt;/a&gt; to walk the wide world as a champion of the realm. But Bramwell is not as he left it.

After the &lt;a href=\"Stress%20Test\"&gt;Stress Test&lt;/a&gt; in spring 2000, it was released for both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS in the summer 2000 by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. Diablo II was developed by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy April 2001, \"Diablo II\" had become one of the most popular online games of all time. Major factors that contributed to Diablo II's success include what fans found to be addictive hack-and-slash gameplay and free access to &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;. Diablo II may be played as a single-player game, multi-player via a LAN, or multi-player via Battle.net, with the last option being the most popular one.\nThe game was conceptualized and designed by &lt;a href=\"Stieg%20Hedlund\"&gt;Stieg Hedlund&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt; founders &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Max%20Schaefer\"&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich Schaefer&lt;/a&gt; acting as project heads for the other disciplines. The main production roles were handled by Matthew Householder and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Roper\"&gt;Bill Roper&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn expansion, \"\", was released in 2001.\nStory.\nThe story of \"Diablo II\" takes place soon after the end of the original \"Diablo\". At the end of \"Diablo\", &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo, Lord of Terror&lt;/a&gt; was defeated by a mortal hero. The hero who slew Diablo (i.e. the player character of the first game) drives the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; of Diablo (a magical stone containing the soul of a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;) into his own head in an attempt to contain Diablo in his own body. After this event, the hero is rapidly corrupted by Diablo and slowly loses control of Diablo's soul. In the opening &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cinematic&lt;/a&gt; of \"Diablo II\", Marius, the narrator of the story, witnesses the fallen hero (known only as the Dark Wanderer) totally lose control, unleashing the demons of Hell upon a tavern. Marius is the only survivor (it is implied that rather than just being blind luck, the demons were ignoring him), and he feels compelled to follow the Wanderer for reasons he himself does not understand. The new player character is a different hero following in the wake of the destruction, chasing the Dark Wanderer, hoping to put an end to the demon lord within him. The new hero ultimately catches up to the Wanderer outside the city of Kurast but is unable to stop him. The rest of the story is revealed through the four acts, as the player faces not just the demon lord Diablo, but two new major villains, his equally malevolent &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil%23The%20Three%20Brothers\"&gt;brothers&lt;/a&gt;, fellow Prime Evils Mephisto, Lord of Hatred and Baal, Lord of Destruction. Diablo is determined to free them from their soulstone incarceration, which was forced upon all three long ago, and from which Diablo managed to break free in the first game. The hero travels through different lands to thwart the forces of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;The Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; from conquering the world known as Sanctuary.\nThe story tells about seven \"Great Evils\" (with 7 totalling the number of the powers of hell); five are killed in \"Diablo II\". Three are directly slain in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", though all seven are effectively slain at once due to Diablo becoming the Prime Evil.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;\"\nA fairly powerful enemy using mainly poison-based attacks. She uses homing poison arrows, poison spray and the weak claws on her back in hand-to-hand battle. She is found in the bottom level of the monastery behind a large set of wooden doors, surrounded by her minions. \nA very fast and very aggressive enemy. His pure physical strength can easily overwhelm an unprepared player. He attacks using his large claws, and may also freeze the player, making it even easier for him to quickly dispense of opposition. He is found in the true Tomb of Tal Rasha by placing the Horadric Staff into a pedestal. \nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s\"\nHe uses several powerful lightning attacks and doesn't have a melee attack. He can be found in his lair in the temple city of Travincal in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; by destroying the Compelling Orb that locked him in his lair. You must use a unique flail called &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Will%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Khalim's Will&lt;/a&gt; to destroy it, created after finding the relics of Khalim and transmuting them with Khalim's flail in a Horadric Cube. Beware of the many allies and minions he has throughout the Durance of Hate-the Council Members in particular. &lt;a href=\"Maffer%20Dragonhand\"&gt;Maffer Dragonhand&lt;/a&gt; is nearly as dangerous as Mephisto himself.\nThe Leader of the Three. He uses the fire element. He is a powerful boss, especially in later &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;difficulties&lt;/a&gt;. Beware of his Red Lightning Hose attack, which resembles a long red stream of lightning spraying from his mouth, as even characters with good vitality can be killed in one full blast, it is the strongest attack in the game. However, this attack is slower than most of his other ones and can be easily avoided. His attacks include Red Lightning Hose, Fire ring, Firestorm (similar to the Druid's but much stronger, the same released by Hellfire torch), Bone Prison (cast on town portals), Cold Touch (freezes you) and a melee attack, in which he will charge quickly toward the player. He appears after activating the five seals and defeating their protectors, the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20De%20Seis\"&gt;Lord De Seis&lt;/a&gt; (Unique &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knight&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Infector%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Infector of Souls&lt;/a&gt; (Unique &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Lord\"&gt;Venom Lord&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Vizier%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Grand Vizier of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; (Unique &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Caster\"&gt;Doom Caster&lt;/a&gt;).\nHe is found in the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20Keep\"&gt;Worldstone Keep&lt;/a&gt;. After destroying the five swarms of his minions, he'll walk into the portal to &lt;a href=\"The%20Worldstone%20Chamber\"&gt;The Worldstone Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, the battleground. He uses fire strikes and a cold attack, the latter of which causes a severe knock back, as well as freezing, a kind of Inferno that drains your mana and also a curse that will damage you if you try to cast any spell (he only uses it if you have more mana than life). He also summons a copy of himself, capable of using all of his attacks, only adding to the troubles of anyone attempting to slay the Lord of Destruction.\nGameplay.\nThe player assumes the role of a hero, fighting monsters while traversing over land and dungeons. The storyline of \"Diablo II\" is played through four acts. Each act follows a predetermined path with preselected quests, although some quests are optional. Each act culminates with the destruction of a boss monster, upon which the player proceeds to the next act. The battle is conducted in real-time, using an isometric oblique top-down viewpoint. Players fight monsters to level their character up and gain better items.\n\"Diablo II\" places heavy emphasis on combat, and randomly generates many monster properties, level layouts and item drops. Most of the maps themselves are randomly generated. In single-player mode, the map is randomly generated but locks the setting thereafter; in multi-player mode, it resets every time the dungeon is restarted.\n\"Diablo II\" allows the player to choose between five different character classes: Necromancer, Amazon, Barbarian, Sorceress and Paladin. Each character has different strengths and weaknesses and sets of skills to choose from.\nIn addition to the four acts, there are also three difficulty levels: \"Normal\", \"Nightmare\", and \"Hell\". A character must complete these difficulty levels in order; only once a character completes \"Normal\" difficulty can that character play at \"Nightmare\" difficulty, and similarly for \"Hell\" difficulty. Each difficulty is a greater challenge than the last, with such features as increased creature difficulty, experience penalties upon death, and other challenges. A character retains all abilities, equipment, etc., between difficulties, and may return to earlier difficulties at any time. Upon completion of the game in Normal difficulty, a player may create a hardcore character. While for normal players the game doesn't end when they die, the game ends when a hardcore character is killed.\n\"Diablo II\" also has a number of other features that enhance gameplay. The player has the option of hiring one of several computer-controlled mercenaries, that follow the player and attack nearby enemies. On occasion, the player might find a rare, valuable item, or one that is part of a set that becomes more powerful when the entire set is collected. Items can be customized using sockets and gems, or transmuted into different items using the Horadric Cube.\nRespawning.\nUnlike Diablo I, where the monsters all stay dead once killed, and their corpses remain where they fell all throughout the game, if you save-and-exit and return to the game, all of the killed creatures have respawned. Even the boss monsters that you killed for the quest will have respawned as well.\nThis will turn out to be rather frustrating for any player who is a &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Acompletist\"&gt;completist&lt;/a&gt;. The up-side, however, is the newly respawned monster still drops loot and can keep earning you loads of riches.\nCharacter classes.\nAmazon.\nThe Amazon is an active skill-oriented fighter. Her skills are oriented around personal protective abilities, the use of a bow and arrow, as well as the spear and javelin.\nThe Amazon is most similar to the \"&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;\" of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\": both are primarily associated with bows, and both make equal use of strength and magic. The Amazon is different in that she can also use javelins and spears adeptly. The class is loosely based on the Amazons of mythology.\nBarbarian.\nThe Barbarian is a powerful melee-oriented character in Diablo 2, and the only character capable of dual-wielding. His skills are divided into various weapon masteries, war cries, and combat skills. The masteries are purely passive and allow the Barbarian to specialize in different types of weapons and to gain natural speed and resistances. His war cries can enhance his and his party's abilities in combat, reduce the enemy's abilities, frighten the enemy into fleeing and even cause considerable damage to them. The Barbarian's combat skills are attacks that maximize brute force, his greatest asset.\nThe Barbarians, in Diablo 2, originated from the Northern Highlands, which is where Act 5 of the takes place, and can also be hired as &lt;a href=\"hireling\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; in that Act.\nA different Barbarian was planned for Hellfire, the unofficial Diablo \"expansion\" released by Sierra Entertainment. Though not included in the final version, the character was available as a hidden class in for Hellfire. The character had the same appearance and speech as the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; but had altered statistics and different abilities.\nThe Barbarian, despite being a strict melee character, can be very effective. In Hell mode, the natural resistance for all characters drop and the Barbarian is the only class that can passively increase his resistance through a skill.\nSorceress.\nThe Sorceress focuses on ranged elemental spells in three areas: ice, lightning and fire. Her ice spells can chill or even completely freeze affected enemies, but do less damage than lightning or fire. Lightning spells can do both very high and very low damage, whereas fire spells deal more consistent damage.\nThe spell \"Teleport\" essentially defines the Sorceress, allowing much faster mobility than any other character. The strong point of the Sorceress is powerful damaging spells and casting speed; her weakness is her relatively low hit points and defence, demanding that the player pay close attention to keep her out of the fray.\nSorceresses are, according to the storyline, rebellious women who have wrested the secrets of magic use from the male-dominated magus clans of the East..\nNecromancer.\nThe Necromancer is a spell-caster who relies on summoning spirits of the dead to aid him in his work. His skills are split into curses, summoning, poison and bone spells. The summoning skills allow him to revive various skeletons, golems and any monster killed (Including Diablo). However, it is to be noted that with the exception of golems, all of the necromancer's summons require existing monster corpses. Poison and bone skills are the necromancer's actual means of straight out damage. Bone skills also hold means for creating obstacles and such, making for great PVP support. Curse skills form an integral part of a necromancer's arsenal ability to produce curses and hexes in both PVP and PVE. These powers greatly alter gameplay for both the caster as well as the target.\nPaladin.\nThe Paladin is a religious warrior fighting for all that is good. To reflect this, the zealous Paladin's combat skills range from fanatical attacks to heavenly thunderbolts. His skills are split into combat skills, defensive auras, and offensive auras, of which, the latter two can enhance personal abilities, lower the amount of damage dealt by enemies, or facilitate health recovery. These auras are helpful in a multi-player game as many of them can be used to upgrade all of the party's stats. Most auras require no mana which makes a Paladin a very economic character as he needs to spend little to nothing on mana recovery. Paladins are highly proficient in the use of a shield, and they may even use their shield as a weapon. He is the best with defensive skills and is also the best choice if the player wishes to weaken enemies without hitting them or casting any spells. Paladin skills are extremely efficient at eliminating the undead.\nMulti-player.\nUnlike the original \"Diablo\", \"Diablo II\" was made specifically with online gaming in mind. Several spells multiply their effectiveness if they are cast within a party, and dungeons, although they still exist, were largely replaced by open spaces.\nMulti-player is achieved through Blizzard's &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; free online service, or via a LAN. Battle.net is divided into \"Open\" and \"Closed\" realms. Players may play their single-player characters on open realms; characters in closed realms are stored on Blizzard's servers, as a measure against cheating, where they must be played every ninety days to avoid expiration. Online play is otherwise nearly identical to single-player play. The most notable difference is that online maps are generated randomly, with a new map for every game a player enters. Offline, single-player maps are retained in computer memory.\nAs the game can be played cooperatively, groups of players with specific sets of complementary skills can finish some of the game's climactic battles in a matter of seconds, providing strong incentives for party-oriented character builds. \nUp to eight players can be in one game; they can either unite as a single party, play as individuals, or form multiple opposing parties. Experience, monsters' hit points, and the \"number\" of items dropped are increased as more players join a game.\nPlayers are allowed to duel each other with all damage being reduced in player versus player. The bounty for a successful kill is a portion of the gold and the ear of the defeated player's character.\nPatch 1.10 included the option of playing with a ladder character. The ladder system can be reset at various intervals to allow for all players to start fresh with new characters on an equal footing. Ladder seasons have lasted from as short as nine months to over a year. When a ladder season ends the ladder population is transferred to the non-ladder population with all items that the player is holding. Certain rare items and rune words are available only within ladder games, although they can be traded for and exchanged on non-ladder after the season has ended.\nUp to twenty-three patches have been released for \"Diablo II\". Through the patch history, several exploits and issues have been addressed, as well as major revamps to the game's balance. Not all patches have affected \"Diablo II\" directly, as several were designed to address issues in the expansion to the game and had minimal effects on \"Diablo II\". The game is currently in version 1.14. The exact number of patches is impossible to determine as Battle.net has the capability of making minor server-side patches to address immediate issues.\nEaster eggs.\nIf a user is to type in 'soundchaosdebug' in the chat window on &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; or in single-player mode, every sound file in the game is played in a chaotic muddle that lasts until the player reenters the code.\nSecret Cow Level.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;Secret Cow Level&lt;/a&gt;\" is the result of a running joke from the original \"Diablo\" that spawned from an Internet rumour about a cow that appears in the game, seemingly without purpose. Supposedly, if the cow was clicked on a certain number of times, a portal to a secret level would open (There were also variations involving Adria's Shack, such as needing to go (counter)clockwise around it a certain number of times before clicking the cow. These were usually used to extend the amount of time that the hoax was believed, as it was usually a high number (ex. 37), and new players could often be convinced several times that they had miscounted in one of the steps, reversed the numbers, or both) The rumour was a hoax, but the legend was born, and player after player asked Blizzard about how to access the level.\nIn \"\", the only expansion to the original \"Diablo\" (This \"expansion\" is actually considered an \"add-on\", since it was not an official release, but instead released by ), it was possible to change a parameter in a specific text file (&lt;a href=\"Command.txt\"&gt;Command.txt&lt;/a&gt;), so that the farmer who gives out the \"rune bomb\" quest was dressed in a cow suit, with appropriate new dialogue (\"Moo.\" \"I said Moo!\"). This added fuel to the fire. To kill the rumour, Blizzard included a cheat (that automatically won the game) in &lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt; that read \"There is no cow level\", this being Blizzard's way of officially confirming that there was, in fact, no Cow Level. Among online game enthusiasts, this phrase has become an Internet joke similar to the phrase &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbone_cabal\"&gt;There Is No Cabal&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 1, 1999, a \"Diablo II Screenshot of the Week\" featured cows fighting. People wondered if the screenshot was an April Fool's joke or if there really was a Secret Cow Level planned for Diablo II. It turned out that there \"was\" a cow level. To access the level, one must kill Diablo (or, in \"Lord of Destruction\", kill Baal), return to &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt; within the same difficulty level, and then transmute &lt;a href=\"Wirt%27s%20Leg\"&gt;Wirt's Leg&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Tome of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;. This will open a portal to the secret level (defeating Baal in the difficulty that the player wishes to enter the cow level in is no longer required, as of . One only needs to be able to access a certain difficulty to enter its cow level). There is an item set named the \"&lt;a href=\"Cow%20King%27s%20Leathers\"&gt;Cow King's Leathers&lt;/a&gt;\" which may only be collected in this secret level. However, when a player kills the &lt;a href=\"Cow%20King\"&gt;Cow King&lt;/a&gt; for their first time on a difficulty level, the character used to open the portal becomes unable to reopen the portal to the level on that difficulty level.\nChat Gem.\nThere exists a purple chat gem that is only visible when inside of a chat channel. There are many theories about the purpose of this gem. There is, however, no purpose for this gem aside from a meaningless message. The gem toggles between an active and inactive state. When activated, a chat message appears stating, \"Gem Activated\" and likewise, a message \"Gem Deactivated\" is shown when it becomes inactive. It can also say \"Perfect Gem Activated\" but the chances, however, are very low. It has also been said that it sometimes can be heard lowing.\nSpecial target code alteration.\nThere is a \"cheat\" for \"Diablo II\" and \"Lord of Destruction\". If one right clicks on the \"Diablo II\" icon on the desktop and goes to properties they'll see three tabs: \"General,\" \"Shortcut,\" and \"Compatibility.\" Click on \"Shortcut,\" and at the end of the file path located to the right of \"Target,\" enter a space and a dash after the quotation mark, then the act to which the character is wanted to go. For example, \" -act 5\" (without the quotation marks) will take you to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt;. Click \"Apply,\" start the game, and create a new character. The character will start in whichever act is chosen. Another interesting thing about this is the character level; depending on which action is chosen, the character's level will be set to a specific amount. However, this will not affect a character's inventory, which will be limited to the standard Act 1 starter items.\nDevelopment.\nWhile developing \"Diablo I\", there was no plan at the time to do a sequel, let alone create a series.\nThe idea of \"Diablo II\" began in the three-month period that followed the launch of its predecessor. Blizzard North bounced around ideas for their next game. At the time, the developers were \"kind of sick of Diablo\" (according to &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt;), and wanted to make a different game. \"Diablo I\" had been the longest game they'd worked on, and at the time, Blizzard South was shifting from \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\" to \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\", and it was expected that Blizzard North's next game would demonstrate a similar departure. However, as Blizzard North continued to patch \"Diablo I\", and the issue of cheating became apparent on &lt;a href=\"battle.net\"&gt;battle.net&lt;/a&gt;, the team began to see how the original game could be improved. Over time, the idea of a sequel crept into their discussions. Fourth months after \"Diablo I\" was released, \"Diablo II\" was settled on. Staff looked at ideas they had sought to implement for the previous game and compiled customer feedback. It was intended that \"Diablo II\" be \"bigger and better\" in every way. Less than 1% of the code and art of the original game were reused for \"Diablo II\". The first priority was to fix the issue of cheating that had plagued \"Diablo I\". The second priority was to update the classes. Other priorities included reducing downtime, such as loading screens and adding the running feature.\nThe development team consisted of between 45 and 60 individuals. New staff were hired to work on the game. A two-year development cycle was estimated for the game. Most of the time was spent on perfecting the game's first act, as it would likely be used in a beta test or demo.\nWork on the game began in 1997. The first six months of development were slow and relaxed, as the company was burnt out from their work on Diablo I. It was publically announced on September 9 of that year, with an estimated release of 1998 provided. By the second half of the year, the game's first act had been created, including its &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;town hub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Moor\"&gt;surrounding landscapes&lt;/a&gt;, and the initial dungeons. By the end of the year, the game's feel and look had been solidified. Planning ahead during development ranged from periods of one week to one month.\nBlizzard South was active in the game's development over the 1997-'99 period. The sometimes adversarial collaboration led to the creation of \"strike teams,\" which moved between projects to give feedback and advice. Strike teams continue to be used by Blizzard South as of 2014.\nThe game's \"crunch period\" of development began in May/June 1999. It lasted about 18 months, with staff working 12-16 hour days, 7 days a week. The crunch was so bad that developers were held back to work on the game rather than moving onto Lord of Destruction. The developers aimed to release the game by the end of 1999. In late September/early October, &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt; contacted Mike Morhaime of Blizzard South to announce that the game couldn't be completed within the year. Blizzard South took the news in stride and gave the developers an extension of the crunch period, but urged that the game had to be completed. By this stage of development, the game was in a playable state, but the developers had yet to reach the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; section of the game (which was implemented in February/March of 2000).\nThe entire backup of the game's source code and assets was lost at the \"eleventh hour\" of the game's development. The team was able to reconstruct a lot of the code and assets from the version of Diablo II that developers took home to play.\nThe game's beta began in March of 2000. The game went gold on June 15, 2000, after a twelve-month \"crunch period\" of development.\nThe game has since been remastered and released on September 23, 2021, titled \"\".\nDesign Document.\nThe game never had an official design document. What became the game's equivalent was effectively a wish list for features created by &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;. Reportedly, the document was only half a page long, and stuffed in a desk drawer and forgotten about soon afterwards.\nThe team sought the following additions:\nDesign Teams.\nThe staff working on Diablo II were divided into the following teams:\nThe design was largely an open process, with members of each team contributing outside their field. Blizzard South also contributed to the game's network code and battle.net support.\nArtwork.\nThe development team began working on the game's art in mid-1997. Almost all of Diablo II's in-game and cinematic art was constructed and rendered in 3D Studio Max, while textures and 2D interface elements were created primarily with Photoshop. The programmers wrote in C and some C++, using Visual Studio and SourceSafe for version control. Early comments on the graphics stated that they were too pixilated. &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich Schaefer&lt;/a&gt; defended the graphic choices but commented that Diablo II would likely be Blizzard North's last 2D game.\nDetailed sketches of settings preceded the actual modelling of the background art. The environments themselves were constructed using algorithms. As soon as a piece of the landscape was painted, it was added piecemeal.\nThe developers considered making the game 3D, given that other PC games at the time were taking advantage of new 3D hardware. However, the decision was made to make the game 2D, as according to Brevik, 3D technology \"wasn't quite there\" (at the time), and it was felt that as a 2D action game, it could look better and have more stuff on screen at the time.\nWhen designing the game's locations, Blizzard North took inspiration from real-world locations.\nClasses.\nEach player character in the game is 75 pixels tall. However, all were modelled and rendered in high resolution for use on the character selection screen and in promotional materials.\nThe idea of five classes was hammered out over several months. During the development of the game, it was originally intended that the classes be archetypes (albeit with slight differences from standard RPG classes) that boiled down to the roles of fighter, rogue, and spell caster, based on a sub-class principle. The rogue would branch out into sisters (of the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; order) and hunters/rangers, the fighter into a templar/paladin or berserker, and the spell caster into the sorceress or necromancer. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt; decided against the idea because multiple genders would mean animating a total of 10 models, that, combined with the game's component system, would make the task too large to undertake. The game's skill trees were effectively away to formalize class pathways/builds, and make it easier for players to specialize their character.\nMore emphasis was put on the visual effects of gear on classes when compared to the original game (which had possessed limited visual representation of gear due to a lack of budget). The characters were designed like dolls, in the sense that every body part would be treated as a separate component (from a design sense).\nDevelopment of the classes was carried out on the fly; balance concerns were addressed at the end of development.\nLocations and Map Design.\nWhile \"Diablo I\" was a \"vertical\" game (i.e. the player descending from Tristram down into Hell), \"Diablo II\" would be \"horizontal,\" as in, the player making their way across Sanctuary, with each act featuring a different location.\nLocation-wise, \"Diablo II\" had a set of locations that were thrown out during development. The locations of the game were made up on the fly, the development team has the idea of going to a \"&lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;desert area&lt;/a&gt;,\" a \"&lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;jungle area&lt;/a&gt;,\" and then eventually deciding to enter &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. Blizzard South originally objected to the game beginning in the \"Irish countryside\" (&lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;), due to the shared location with \"Diablo I\". but the game nonetheless began in the region.\nAn idea that never made it into the game was the idea of the \"Battle.net Town.\" The idea was that players wouldn't start in the b.net lobby, but in an actual town, where the player's character could interact with other players and go to vendors before entering the game's acts. This was partially inspired by \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online\"&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/a&gt;\", in which members of the development team were playing over the course of Diablo II's development. The team aspired to make a game where one could walk seamlessly between areas of the world, but this did not make it into the game, and the act structure was used instead. \"Ultima Online\" became an obsession of &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt; during development of \"Diablo II\", and he insisted that \"Diablo II\" had to do better in areas such as loading times.\n\"Diablo II\" takes place in more open spaces than its predecessor\u2014the development team took time to make sure that they weren't completely empty, and that borders were in place around the edge of the maps. In some cases, walls. This caused some controversy within the team at first due to the artificial nature of the restriction, but the concern disappeared once they started playing it. Much playtesting went into the fields to ensure that there were enough objects to allow position-based tactics to be used, but not so many that the areas felt claustrophobic.\n&lt;a href=\"David%20L.%20Craddock\"&gt;David L. Craddock&lt;/a&gt; has opinionated that \"Diablo II\" represents a shift from \"Diablo I\", given the proliferation of outdoor areas. He attributed this to the arrival of new staff to work on the project, and ergo, new ideas.\nStory.\nBlizzard North barely had a story in mind during the development of the game. The initial idea was that the character would be following the proceeding hero from Diablo I who had stuck the soulstone into their forehead, kill him, and end the game there. The Blizzard Film Department (part of Blizzard South) was tasked with making cinematics for the game, that, in Schaefer's words, \"invented\" the story (it has been stated that the general story arc was crafted by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;). These sequences bracket each of the game's acts. The Film Department also collaborated on the storyline. The decision was made to use the cinematics to tell a separate but parallel story, which generated some internal controversy, and contention from Blizzard North's part, whose approach was to use story only as a means of bridging areas of the game (e.g. creating a means of connecting the Act II desert area to the jungle in Act III).\nOne of the game's first cinematics was someone serving patrons cocktails in a &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;desert bazaar&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of delivery, this cinematic had \"no basis in the game whatsoever.\" This cinematic made no appearance in the final game. However, at times, Blizzard North made changes to the game based on the cinematics produced.\nReception.\n\"Diablo II\" was a runaway success for Blizzard. The game has achieved an overall score of 88 on Metacritic. Gamespy awarded the game an 86 out of 100, IGN awarded the game an 8.3 out of 10, and GameSpot awarded the game an 8.5 out of 10 along with earning the 2000 runner-up Reader's Choice Award for the role-playing game of the year. It was awarded a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records \"2000 edition\" for being the fastest-selling computer game ever sold, with more than 1 million units sold in the first two weeks of availability, by January 2001, it had sold 2.75 million copies worldwide. At the time of its release, it was the fast-selling computer game in history.\nOver the years, \"Diablo II\" has moved in and out of the top twenty games of NPD's sales list and since 2007, sometimes even in the top ten. The game's popularity was boosted even further by the announcement of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" and Blizzard intends to continue to support the game. It has also become one of the top thirty best selling computer games ever. Including Diablo II, the Diablo series has sold 17 million copies.\nSome negative reception towards the game occurred after seeing its desert areas\u2014a departure from the Gothic aesthetic of its predecessor. &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt; has commented that he prefers the darker aesthetic of the original game to its sequel.\nTrivia.\nor are anagrams or other manipulates of such names:"}

Suddenly, a mysterious star falling from the sky strikes the Cathedral, creating a deep crater into which Deckard Cain disappears.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III%23Heroes\"&gt;The player character&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, arrives in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the fallen star. The Nephalem rescues Cain upon Leah's request and discovers that the fallen object is actually a person. The stranger has no memories except that he lost his sword, which was shattered into three pieces. Although the Nephalem retrieves the pieces, &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;the witch Maghda&lt;/a&gt; seizes the shards and attempts to capture Cain to force him to repair the sword for her own ends. However, with an uncontrolled display of power, Leah forces Maghda to flee, and she kidnaps the stranger instead. Cain, dying from Maghda's torture, uses the last of his strength to repair the sword and instructs the Nephalem to return it to the stranger. The Nephalem rescues the stranger and returns his sword, causing him to regain his memories. The stranger then reveals himself as the fallen angel &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. Disgusted with his fellow angels' unwillingness to protect humanity from the forces of Hell, Tyrael cast aside his divinity to become a mortal and warn Sanctuary about the arrival of the demon lords &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"To avenge Cain's death, the Nephalem tracks Maghda to the city of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, which is controlled by her master, Belial. The Nephalem kills Maghda, and rescues Leah's mother, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;. Adria tells Tyrael and the Nephalem that the key to stopping the demons is the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, which can trap the souls of the seven Lords of Hell and destroy them forever. In order to obtain the Black Soulstone, the Nephalem resurrects the mad Horadrim, &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;. Kulle reveals its hiding place and completes the unfinished Soulstone, but is killed by the Nephalem after he attempts to steal it for himself. The Nephalem kills Belial and traps his soul within the Black Soulstone, freeing Caldeum. As Leah studies in Caldeum's library to find more answers about the Black Soulstone and Azmodan, she receives a vision from Azmodan, who tells her that he is sending an army from the ruins of Mount Arreat to take the Black Soulstone for himself.\"\n\"Tyrael, Adria, Leah and the Nephalem journey to &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the only line of defense between Azmodan's forces and the rest of Sanctuary. With the others staying behind to protect the Black Soulstone, the Nephalem pushes out from the keep into &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. The Nephalem kills Azmodan and traps his soul in the Black Soulstone. However, Adria betrays the Nephalem and takes the Black Soulstone with the seven Demon Lords' souls inside. She reveals that she has been &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s agent from the beginning, and that Leah's father is the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, who conceived her while being possessed by Diablo, making her the perfect vessel for the demon's physical form. Using Leah as a sacrifice, Adria resurrects Diablo. Having the souls of all the Lords of Hell within him, Diablo becomes the Prime Evil, the most powerful demon in existence, and begins his assault on the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, the defending angels being no match for him.\"\n\"Tyrael and the Nephalem follow Diablo to the High Heavens, where the city is under attack. The defending Angels warn the Nephalem that Diablo is attempting to reach the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;, which is the source of all of the angels' power. To prevent Diablo from corrupting the Crystal Arch and completing his victory over the High Heavens, The Nephalem confronts and defeats him. With Diablo's physical manifestation destroyed, the Black Soulstone is shown falling from the High Heavens, apparently still intact. After the battle, Tyrael decides to rejoin the High Heavens but remain as a mortal, dedicated to building a permanent alliance between angels and humans.\"\nGameplay.\nDiablo III incorporates the Havok physics engine and enables players to utilize the environment to help in their quest. For example, huge walls can be reduced to rubble to squash monsters by a direct hit. Even monsters use the environment (such as s scaling the walls to reach the player). Many more parts of what appear to be a seamless background environment are destructible. Some dilapidated areas will also collapse (with or without harming the player) automatically when the player gets too near or passes under part of a structure.\nThe UI, including &lt;a href=\"character%20screen\"&gt;character screen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; is functionally similar to its predecessor, besides the graphical upgrades and more details in expanding tabs, and will be very familiar to Diablo II players.\nSome stats (and their UI bars) were removed, including &lt;a href=\"Stamina\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; (and therefore &lt;a href=\"Movement%20Speed\"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt;). The experience bar is now at the bottom of the screen spanning across the UI panel. Some other stats were changed or added, but overall, remain similar to what they used to be.\nStat allocation is changed to &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; system, allowing players to allocate excessive stats after reaching maximum level (60 or 70 with expansion), but before that, core stats are distributed automatically. Paragon levels continue to increase without limit after reaching maximum level, and are shared among all characters of same type on account.\n&lt;a href=\"Potions\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt; have lesser importance because of the introduction &lt;a href=\"Health%20Globe\"&gt;Health Globe&lt;/a&gt;s, dropped by slain monsters. These replenish lost &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; when picked up, and cannot be stored. Only one (endless) potion can be equipped, usable every 30 seconds, but potions may grant special effects in addition to restoring Life.\nIn co-operative play, loot is dropped for individual players (player cannot see what the others get). This was done to encourage trading between players in a group and reducing thievery. Co-operative play remains as the core of multiplayer, with a drop-in, drop-out feature so one can share their items (only available 2 hours after they drop, and only to players who were in the same party when item dropped). Between characters of same type on same account, gear may be transferred at any time.\nPrior to patch 2.0, &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; allowed players to trade their items for &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or real money.\n&lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode appears in Diablo III, with similar functionality to its prior incarnation. As of &lt;a href=\"RoS\"&gt;RoS&lt;/a&gt;, another choice during character creation is &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; participation, which replaces the &lt;a href=\"Ladder\"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers now can only learn 6 active &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s (+3 or 4 passive), but can change those at any time for free. &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;Skill Trees&lt;/a&gt; are gone, replaced with free choice almost without limits (some skills are limited to one per category). To compensate, skills can be upgraded with &lt;a href=\"skill%20rune\"&gt;skill rune&lt;/a&gt;s to change their functionality, and gear offers new stats, which greatly improve functionality of skills (such as reducing &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s and resource costs, increasing their &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, etc) instead of plainly increasing skill levels. &lt;a href=\"Set\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt;s also offer unique bonuses instead of simply increasing stats. &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Points\"&gt;Skill Points&lt;/a&gt; are also gone, players always have access to a number of skills based on their &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;character level&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are four slots for keyboard activated skills, associated with the 1-4 number keys, and two are the mouse skills (LMB and RMB).\nBuffs and debuffs are now displayed on the UI. As of patch 2.4, they are grouped and incorporated into skill icons for better visualization.\nThere is now a mini-map displayed on the top of the right hand side of the screen, replacing the &lt;a href=\"automap\"&gt;automap&lt;/a&gt;. A detailed map can be viewed at any time with M key.\n&lt;a href=\"Action%20Combat\"&gt;Action Combat&lt;/a&gt; feature, originally exclusive to consoles, was implemented on PC in 2.4.\nThe game is designed so that ideally, there is a change of art assets and monsters every fifteen minutes when playing the game.\nActs.\nLike Diablo II, Diablo III has a four act structure.The fifth act is included with Reaper of Souls.\n occurs in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, in and around &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. It hearkens to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;first act&lt;/a&gt; of Diablo II geographically and aesthetically.\n occurs in &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, a location visited in Diablo II in its &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;third act&lt;/a&gt;. However, in Diablo III, the events are centered in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding desert, similar to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; in the previous game's &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;second act&lt;/a&gt;.\n occurs in the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;. This bears resemblance to &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding area in Diablo II's &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;fifth act&lt;/a&gt;, which occurred in the same geographical region (then known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;the Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;).\n occurs in &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, a location never visited in any previous Diablo series game, while in previous game, fourth act occurred in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;.\n takes place in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtisans.\nDiablo III features four &lt;a href=\"artisan\"&gt;artisan&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Shen\"&gt;Covetous Shen&lt;/a&gt;, a jeweler, &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%20Eamon\"&gt;Haedrig Eamon&lt;/a&gt;, a blacksmith, and two more added in Reaper of Souls: a mystic, &lt;a href=\"Myriam%20Jahzia\"&gt;Myriam Jahzia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; operated by &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowers.\n&lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt; are an upgrade to &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt;, who have expanded storyline, dialogue, and their own quests. They cannot permanently die, but fatal damage will put them out of combat for short time.\nDiablo III includes three different &lt;a href=\"followers\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt; the Templar, &lt;a href=\"Lyndon\"&gt;Lyndon&lt;/a&gt; the Scoundrel, and &lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt; the Enchantress. Followers are unlocked as the player progresses through the main storyline. While only one follower can accompany the player at a time, followers gain experience even when not in the player's party. In Multiplayer, followers are not available.\nFollowers can be equipped with a minimal set of items, and gain skill options at four periodic level-ups. Each time a new pair of skills is unlocked, the player must select one for the follower to learn. These skill choices can be reset and made again with no penalty. Followers may wear special items that give them unique properties unavailable to players.\nShort-term followers also exist, as in, characters that follow the hero(es) for short sections of the story. These followers may not be equipped by the player.\nHeroes.\nDiablo III has seven classes, all of which have a choice of gender, and had a unique source of energy for their abilities. Expanded character customization features include choice of gender, &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s (for cosmetic appearance), &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s and (as of expansion pack) &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;, which allow players to build a unique way their character looks.\nAll classes have 3 types of &lt;a href=\"Class-specific%20Items\"&gt;Class-specific Items&lt;/a&gt;. No class-related quests are in game.\nBlizzard also announced the &lt;a href=\"Archivist\"&gt;Archivist&lt;/a&gt; class as an April Fools' joke, it appeared to die in a single hit and use spells based entirely on the usage of books and scrolls. &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;s will not be playable classes due to them not being &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nNPCs.\nDiablo III features more NPCs per act than its predecessors. These NPCs, while found in town hubs, are also found outside, and may spawn randomly. Also in contrast, interaction with NPCs is based on dialogue, where the player character interacts with the NPC, rather than the monologues of previous games. NPC dialogue can also be heard in the background, reflecting recent developments in the story.\nDifficulties.\nBlizzard does not intend to make the gameplay of Diablo III any easier than its predecessors, and wants the game to have the same level of difficulty as \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", though is easy to progress through at the beginning. However, harder difficulty modes can be unlocked. In addition, the game can be played through entirely as a solo experience and no section of the game requires more than one player to complete.\nThe game currently has numerous difficulty settings \u2014 , , , , and , Torment being adjustable from I to XIII if players wish for more challenge.\nItems.\n \"Diablo III\" expands the player character's arsenal by leaps and bounds. Many &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique Items&lt;/a&gt; make a return in the form of &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; items, this new tier replacing the Unique ones. &lt;a href=\"Set\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt;s also return. &lt;a href=\"Normal%20Items\"&gt;Normal Items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic Items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt; also make a comeback.\nItems may be &lt;a href=\"Crafting\"&gt;crafted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Artisans\"&gt;Artisans&lt;/a&gt; in addition to dropping from monsters.\nArmor.\nArmor slots in Diablo III include the following:\nGems.\n&lt;a href=\"Gems\"&gt;Gems&lt;/a&gt; make a reappearance in five colors (&lt;a href=\"Ruby\"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amethyst\"&gt;Amethyst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Topaz\"&gt;Topaz&lt;/a&gt;), with more power levels than in the previous game: gems have 14 quality levels (19 as of patch 2.0, and then 10 as of patch 2.3), but only the first few can be obtained as drops from monsters, the rest (above Imperial) must be crafted by the Jeweler &lt;a href=\"Artisan\"&gt;Artisan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt; also feature, replacing &lt;a href=\"Jewels\"&gt;Jewels&lt;/a&gt;.\nInventory.\nAfter many iterations the latest style of inventory is grid-based, but to a smaller degree than the inventory in Diablo II. Small items take one space, while big items take two spaces. Potions and some other items (scraps and ingredients) are stackable.\nThe player will also have a similar grid-based &lt;a href=\"stash\"&gt;stash&lt;/a&gt; in town for storage purposes, it is expandable with gold.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Scroll of Identify&lt;/a&gt; has been replaced by the player simply right clicking an unidentified item. Magic and Rare items do not need to be identified.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Scroll of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; has also been replaced by a button on the player's toolbar, which transports you directly to town.\nMonsters.\nDiablo III's enemies operate on the same variety principle as Diablo II, divided into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.\nEnemies' health bars appear at the top of the screen when a player attacks them and disappears if combat ceases or after the enemy dies. However, for Super Uniques and Bosses, is a separate health bar on top of the screen, staying there regardless of the location of the mouse until the enemy is destroyed.\nPlayer vs Player (PvP).\nDiablo III features a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Arenas\"&gt;Battle Arena&lt;/a&gt; system, to allow players to show off and face off against other players. They made PVP separate to remove griefing and help keep the focus on player vs monster (PVM) gameplay. This also allows for balancing of PVP without changing the PVM experience. PVP will not be available at release, as Blizzard reiterates some core PVP concepts, PVP game play, and experience. The company stated the PVP experience for Diablo III is not up to their expectation or quality standards.\nQuests.\nDiablo III features a &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; system to Diablo II, though with more quests per act. In addition, random &lt;a href=\"event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;s feature. These are shorter quests not part of the main storyline. dungeons are still randomized but the random map generator has undergone an overhaul. However, there are still hard borders to areas and players must go around some obstacles like crevasses and large fixed objects like trees and inaccessible buildings. Small amounts of experience can also be gained by destroying many destructible objects in a short period of time.\nDungeons are designed via tiles, with a non-standard unit of measurement (\"Diablo metric feet\"). 18-70 tiles go into the creation of a dungeon in a fixed dungeon. Most of the game's exterior environments have a fixed layout, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, in order to keep the story experience consistent. However, monster, treasure, objective, and event placement can be random.\nCheckpoints allow characters that have died to return to the fray quickly, without going through the hassle of returning from town, as was the case in Diablo II. However, in battle with bosses, players may not revive themselves in the boss chamber. While items lose durability after death, a hero retains the items all the same.\nDevelopment.\nEarly Development.\nBlizzard Irvine took over development of Diablo III in 2006, effectively rebooting it, though the game wasn't officially announced until two years later. possessing a development team of around 60-65 individuals. The reason for the delay was that there was a lot of debate within Blizzard as to what kind of game Diablo III was going to be. In fact, several versions were scrapped and rumors link these difficulties to the dissolution of Blizzard North in 2005. After &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt; started work on the game, the developers spent over a month brainstorming the game. During this time the also studied and played other games in the genre, especially the previous Diablo games.\nAccording to a former senior-level staffer at Blizzard who worked on game for most of its 11 year development cycle, the legacy of Diablo II overshadowed every aspect of the game's production. The staffer claimed that the team had differing ideas as to what the franchise actually stood for, and as such, several versions of the game were created, all of which \"dead-ended.\"\nDuring development, Diablo III was codenamed \"Hydra.\" In 2007, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Sams\"&gt;Paul Sams&lt;/a&gt; reaffirmed Blizzard's dedication to the setting.\nA build Blizzard worked on prior to publicly announcing the game was never shown to the public. Jay Wilson has referred to this build as \"Diablo 2.5.\"\nIn 2008, the game was officially announced. In that same year, there were fifty people on the game's development team.\nSubsequent Development.\nUpper management within Blizzard gave the game's development team free reign in regards to the design of the game. A key concern within the team was stagnation, of building a game too similar to its predecessors.\nContent was being generated in regards to the tech and game engine, which was indicated as \"really solid\" by August 2008. At that time, most of the design team was still on Act I, refining and improving the quests and flow and some of the big game systems that hadn't been announced yet. Blizzard was not moving through the acts in a linear fashion, and would often revisit previous ones.\nContext/lore-wise, the game is based around black and white rather than gray morality. The idea is that if one sees something, it can be slain, without asking why; the player is killing monsters, not people.\nThe game's music was expanded upon, using a full orchestra, choir, and several additional musicians. The game's soundtrack was recorded in a concert hall. The composers decided to \"go big\" with the score, reflecting the game's epic nature of good vs. evil. 87 instruments were used in the orchestra. The music partly operates on a 'by location basis, using specific tracks for specific areas, and different choirs were used for Hell and Heaven-themed music.\nThe game entered its \"crunch period\" towards the end of 2011.\nConsole Version.\nDespite compatible gameplay, Blizzard stated in 2008 that it had no intention of releasing the game on a console. However, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version were eventually released. The success of \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowpedia.org/Hearthstone%3A_Heroes_of_Warcraft\"&gt;Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" gave Blizzard an impetus to release a console port after seeing the viability of gaming platforms outside the PC.\nThe console team was initially small, consisting of three individuals. The lead designer of the team was &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Mosqueira\"&gt;Josh Mosqueira&lt;/a&gt;, who previously worked as design director on \"Company of Heroes\" at Relic. The PC and console versions influenced each other (in terms of development) and ideas from one version can be carried into another. Blizzard gave Mosqueira's team liberty to overhaul everything for the console version. They took advantage of this freedom, changing the skills of every class to account for the new control scheme.\nWhen the PC version entered its crunch period, the console team (which had grown to eight people) were transferred to work on the PC version. After the release of the main game, the console team returned to work on their version of the game.\nArtwork.\nOne of the goals of the game's art style was that no one should feel comfortable in any location. This includes even locations such as Heaven and churches, the idea being that the player has to save themselves. That no one is coming to save them. Artist comments indicate that Blizzard wanted to take the art style in a different direction from the previous games.\nAs soon as a direction for the game was chosen, the art style that would be used came under discussion. Initially the game as a whole was set to be dark and gritty, but it was found that monsters blended in too well with the background. The game's original art style got \"good, but not great\" responses internally. A second art style was chosen, and received a much more positive response within Blizzard. This art style was similar to the one the game possessed when it released.\nSome monster designers developed insectoid demons for the game. However, these were scaled back, as senior staff members pointed out that such demons didn't exist in \"Diablo II\". Ergo, the game went with more traditional designs for its demons.\n\"Diablo III\" utilizes a \"painterly\" art style. The game's art style was not universally greeted with enthusiasm from the public after it was showcased, and a petition was created by players to force Blizzard Entertainment to change their art direction for the game. Blizzard underwent three art revisions, finding that a purely dark style was too drab. As the case was, the \"sunny\" art style was said to represent the early parts of the game. This was to establish contrast between the game's early and late stages, things \"feeling worse\" as the game moved on. \nAn artwork divide existed between \"Diablo III\" and its predecessor in that they use 3D and 2D art styles respectively. This required new technology and stylistic methods. To best demonstrate this, the decision was made to start the game in New Tristram, a familiar abode from previous games. That, and because the region is steeped in Medieval fantasy, it would serve as good contrast to the more exotic locations found later in the game.\nBetas.\nThe closed beta launched on September 20, 2011. As it developed, a number of &lt;a href=\"patches\"&gt;patches&lt;/a&gt; were written.\nThe open beta was launched April 20, 2012 at 12:01 p.m. (PDT) and ended Monday, April 23 at 10:00 AM (PDT).\nThe beta was intended to be a short demo of the game, in order to avoid story spoilers.\nExpansions.\nIt was stated in 2008 that Diablo III would have a number of expansion packs. In 2014, the first expansion pack, \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", was released.\nIn early March, 2014, it was stated that there was a \"fairly decent list\" that the Diablo III development team wanted to do with the property. This included dealing with the issue of &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, and \"the ultimate end to the saga of the humans, angels and demons.\" It was stated later in the month however that the future of the franchise is \"up in the air,\" and while Reaper of Souls will continue to be supported, Blizzard is evaluating whether the game will receive further expansions, and has surveyed some players to gauge interest in a possible second expansion. In 2013, &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Day\"&gt;Travis Day&lt;/a&gt; stated offhand that a \"Diablo IV\" will be made at some point in the future, predicting that Blizzard would be working on the game by 2018 (though also joking that its release date would come \"twenty years from now\" (2033). As of May, 2014, Blizzard's development model was to release expansions and free patches rather than DLC. At &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202014\"&gt;BlizzCon 2014&lt;/a&gt;, Josh Mosqueira refused to confirm or deny the existence of a second expansion. A was planned to be announced at BlizzCon 2015, but was scrapped and its content released for free.\nGameplay.\nBlizzard considered abandoning the isometric perspective of previous games and have \"Diablo III\" with a camera setup similar to that in \"World of Warcraft\". However, the isometric perspective was stuck with.\nThe combat design and physics engine of the game are most attributable to &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt;. The game's difficulty was designed to mirror that of \"Diablo II\". The idea was that players would play through the game once on Normal mode, then once on Nightmare mode, then Hell mode. A fourth mode, &lt;a href=\"Inferno%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Inferno&lt;/a&gt;, was designed as well, intended for players who had hit the level cap.\nA number of internal modes were tested internally. These included an arena with four pillars, a MOBA style 3-lane map with towers and creeps, a mode where a player played as a boss against four heroes, and a hostile bounties system where the player is doing bounties, but PvP is enabled outdoors.\n&lt;a href=\"Skill%20Tree%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Skill Trees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fatalities\"&gt;Fatalities&lt;/a&gt; were cut from the original game.\nThe developers wanted to have a central player hub, which they referred to internally as \"Player Town.\" The idea didn't make it into the final product, but was revisited with &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; system was added later to introduce extra leveling for those who had reached the level 60 cap.\nThe game was designed to have a lot of randomness, and that drop rates would be low in order to encourage item searching. The &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; was removed in 2014.\nIn 2014, competitive PvE was being looked into, even beyond &lt;a href=\"Ladder\"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Tiered%20Rift\"&gt;Tiered Rift&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs of February 2015, Blizzard is considering implementing microtransactions into the game. However, this model will not be used for European or North American regions.\nOriginally, conversations with NPCs would use highly detailed models appearing close to the screen, rather than text boxes being employed. The idea was later abandoned.\nDynamic weather was once present in the game, but scrapped.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Talisman\"&gt;Talisman&lt;/a&gt; system once existed as an extra means of character customization, but was removed.\nPVP.\nIn regards to player vs. player (PvP) gameplay in Diablo III, there were two opinions during development as to how it should be approached. The first was allow structured dueling of some form, but not try to make it a serious, balanced, competitive mode. The other opinion was to try and make an e-sport. The team generally fell behind the idea of making something closer to an e-sport. Within the team the mode was pretty popular, but outside of the team the reception was a lot more mixed. Jay Wilson took a dim view on the idea, convinced that PvP would demand game balance that would harm singleplayer and co-op gameplay. The issue was balance, in that PvP would require a curtailing of some abilities, while PvE gameplay allowed for more \"whimsical\" possibilities. As singleplayer and co-op were the game's focus, the idea for PvP was dropped. During development, some ideas for some team-based player vs. monster vs. player type gameplay, but these weren't pursued.\nIn 2012, it was stated that PvP would be added in a later patch. As of August, 2015, this is doubtful\u2014the developers found that trying to balance PvP would adversely effect the PvE of the game, including item design.\nSimilarly to PvP, there was no serious talk about a hostility feature in the game, similar to Diablo II.\nHeroes.\nThe class abilities of the game were designed before their backgrounds. There was a fair amount of debate in Blizzard as to whether each class should have both genders available, or whether to stick with the single-gendered classes from the previous games. Adding more genders meant having to create custom models, more weapon design, more art, etc. Despite the cost however, Blizzard decided to go ahead with the dual gender option, as in the knowledge that gamers come from both genders, they wanted to make a choice available. However, genders do not affect a class's available abilities. Ultimately, both genders were made available for each class.\nIt was decided that the classes of Diablo III would be actual characters with backstories, rather than the classes of the previous games which were seen as archetypes rather than actual individuals. Initially, Blizzard did not intend to bring back any of the classes from the previous games, feeling that the other classes could not be improved on. With entirely new classes, Diablo III could stand on its own. The Barbarian was an exception to this, as it was felt that the class had a lot of room for development. As such, it is the only returning playable class from previous games. Blizzard considered bringing back old classes for future expansions.\nIt was initially intended that the classes have a 7 skill limit. This was reduced to 6 during development. The class design intended that there be 3-5 iconic skills for each class.\nThe game's classes are regularly played by the developers in order to gauge the game's difficulty. This is cross-referenced with player feedback concerning balance, builds, and what monsters are killing them.\nStoryline.\nSince the first two entries in the series focused on combat over storytelling, there was a lot of room to build out the world beyond the cast of demons that made up its core mythology. Some on the team resisted that urge, saying that it ran counter to their vision of the franchise. Some staffers also resisted attempts to inject some levity into the game\u2019s environments, saying that the game should stick to \"grimdark environs.\"\nFor \"Diablo III\", it was deemed that explaining with mood is preferable to explaining with dialogue. The writers have to compromise when writing their story because it has to fit from a gameplay perspective and can't be too expensive, art-wise. It was decided that \"Diablo III\" would employ dialogue rather than monologue for the conveyance of quest information. The backstories of the characters would be reflected through their art design, and the way they viewed the events of the story. &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; worked on the plot. It was decided that the game would end the overall story that began in the first game, but not end the story of the setting itself. Among the game's themes are loss, regret, and being able to pick up the pieces and move on.\nElements of the storyline were altered based on input from the art and design teams. At least one third of the game's story was rewritten at some point to account for these changes.\nEffort was made to make the setting its own unique world rather than being derivative of Earth-history. This involved the lack of iconography with real-world sources (burning crosses, pentagrams, etc.)\n\"Diablo III\" was going to have branching storylines. &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Boyarsky\"&gt;Leonard Boyarsky&lt;/a&gt;, the game's lead world designer and co-creator of the \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki\"&gt;Fallout&lt;/a&gt;\" series, believes that this was one of the reasons why Blizzard brought him on board. However, he came to believe that player choice couldn't be factored into an ARPG, partly due to how quickly its story moves, but mainly because of the multiplayer aspect. Players would have had branching conversation choices and a 'corruption' system would have seen players gain access to different conversation options as their characters fell from grace. An angel/demon system was toyed with that stemmed back to work on \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%202.5\"&gt;Diablo 2.5&lt;/a&gt;\", where narrative choices a player made would influence the player's character and their character development. The developers were inspired by \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic\"&gt;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/a&gt;\", namely the idea of the player walking down a 'light' and 'dark' path. However, the design team couldn't find a way to implement it due to the multiplayer issue. \nOther issues remained with the attempted light/dark mechanic. First, the developers found that not all players were interested in reading all the dialogue required to make the good/evil choices meaningful. Second, players often identified often as \"always good\" or \"always bad\", so the game didn't end up with a lot of nuance. This was deemed fine for a single playthrough, but not good for repeat playthroughs. Third, the developers tried to tie mechanics to the system (e.g. needing a certain number of alignment points to unlock a skill or equip an item). They found that this put the player at odds with the \"player fantasy,\" where their narrative choices conflicted against the build they wanted to use. By extension, according to Cheng, the type of player who plays \"Diablo\" a lot tends to focus on builds, and a focus on dialogue trees would create \"dissonance.\"\nIn the end, Boyarsky and the team decided to strip the game's story down to a linear one, and one easily skippable at that. However, he reflected that the game \"came down too hard\" on players uninterested in the story, that the mechanics of the game's original complexity hadn't been removed from what was now a linear story.\n&lt;a href=\"Skovos\"&gt;Skovos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ureh\"&gt;Ureh&lt;/a&gt; were originally in the game but were cut due to their inability to \"fit in.\"\nThe original idea of Jay Wilson was to evolve the \"Diablo\" setting through Diablo III's story in such a manner that the series would be able to lead into an &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20MMO\"&gt;MMO&lt;/a&gt; game. This idea has since been dropped.\nReception.\nCritical Reception.\n\"Diablo III\" had a positive reception from news sites, gaining normalized rankings of 87.64% and 88% on Metacritic and Gamesrankings.com respectively. Criticisms included the use of the game's DRM and the consequent server issues that stemmed from it, along with the lack of a PvP mode. The Auction House was a controversial addition.\nPlayer Reception.\nNegative player reception to the game was noticeable\u2014news sites made note of a flurry of 0/10 and 1/5 scores on Metacritic and Amazon respectively. \"Forbes\" argued that the scores should not be taken as objective feedback, but were still a valid protest vote against the game's DRM. \"Error 37\" (a notice that stemmed from connectivity issues) became an Internet meme.\n&lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt;, the series's creator, expressed a dim view on the game. He expressed the idea that Blizzard South did not have the same experience with the ARPG genre that Blizzard North did, that they had concentrated on elements that they were more interested in (e.g. story) that were not shared by Blizzard North. He was also critical of the game's loot system, and reflected that \"some of the decision they have made are not the decisions I would make.\"\nThe poor player reception was noticed at Blizzard. Josh Mosqueira described Team 3's office as being \"akin to a funeral home\" due to the poor player feedback, even as the sales figures broke expectations. In a talk at the 2015 Game Developers' Conference, Mosqueira described the following issues as being key to the poor reception:\nIn 2024, in his book \"The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment\", Jason Schreier that \"Diablo III\" was the \"black sheep\" of the \"Diablo\" franchise, at least in the period before the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". It was an IP that had been created by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt; rather than Blizzard South, and one that some in Blizzard South had scoffed at.\nExectutive Reception.\n&lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of Blizzard's executive branch saw \"Diablo III\" as a failure; that it had damaged the IP's brand, and felt that its expansion would not be enough to turn it around.\nIn 2019, a former Blizzard member who'd worked on the game stated that \"Diablo II\"'s legacy had overshadowed development of \"Diablo III\". They further stated, in regards to the game's development cycle, that \"I think if we\u2019d listened to every \u2018that\u2019s not Diablo\u2019 that was said, there\u2019d be a very small, very bland game left over, If Diablo 2 is a perfect game, with no faults, then it was a mistake to make a sequel.\"\nIn \"The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment\", Schreier stated that \"it seemed absurd for Blizzard to view the game as a misstep.\" He noted that other companies had griped about the game, as every time \"Diablo III\" released a new patch, their own games' user counts went down. When interviewed, &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that \"Diablo III\" had earnt Blizzard more revenue than most of the company's other IPs at the time, with the exception of \"World of Warcraft\". In the work, Schreier argued that \"Diablo III\" had ultimately been a success for Blizzard, in that while other companies might have immediately moved on from such a launch, Blizzard had stuck with the game.\nSales.\n\"Diablo III\" sold 6.6 million copies within 2 days of launch\u2014figures that Blizzard's sales team had initially expected within a year. At the time of its release, it was the fastest selling PC game of all time.\nAs of May 2013, \"Diablo III\" had been played by 14.5 million unique players, according to Blizzard's released statistics. As of June 2014, \"Diablo III\" and \"Reaper of Souls\" had combined sales worldwide of more than 20 million copies. The game and its expansion were among Blizzard's strongest revenue makers as of the time of their release. \nAs of May 2022, \"Diablo III\" has over 65 million registered players. As of September 2024, \"Diablo III\" has around 3 million monthly players."}
{"id": "37365", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=37365", "title": "Diablo III (Blizzard North)", "text": "Diablo III was a game created by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt;. It was a different project from &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20South\"&gt;Blizzard South&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nAn outline for \"Diablo III\" existed as early as 2000. At this point in time, the Diablo Writer's Bible (a guide for authors who worked on tie-in novels) held a two paragraph section titled \"The Future,\" which gave a brief plot summary on \"what appeared to be Diablo III\" (in the words of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20B.%20Marks\"&gt;Robert B. Marks&lt;/a&gt;). It stated that this material should not appear in any novel bar through means of vision or prophecy. The paragraphs outlined the Second Great Conflict between order and chaos, mentioning that powerful heroes would emerge, but not specifying who would win.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Hartgraves\"&gt;Chris Hartgraves&lt;/a&gt; (a former Blizzard North employee), the game was to take place primarily in &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;. Comments from an art director on the project corraberate this statement. Hartgraves further claimed that the storyline/gameplay would involve &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; trying to take over Heaven.\nGameplay.\nThe game was to be an MMO, with a strong focus on &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; and factions. Multiple players would be present in a zone at any given point in time.\nThe game would have used a 3D engine, but stay close to the visual tone of the previous entries. Screenshots released in 2011 showed the presence of an \"Angelic Lands\" zone within Heaven, and another zone simply referred to as \"Keep.\" The player(s) would encounter &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s in Heaven, including &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; (these &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s had a very different visual style from their Diablo II versions, with said style being carried on to the current Diablo III game), and fight creatures similar to the &lt;a href=\"Bat%20Demon\"&gt;Bat Demon&lt;/a&gt;s. At least one &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; was available, an individual equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; in a vein similar to the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; tab was similar to those of the previous games in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potions\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Potions\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; numerically assigned and located on the bottom of the screen.\nComparisons were made to \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" in terms of the game's size and playability. References to guild halls were also made. Every single &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; in the game was to have a \"light\" and \"dark\" version, but apart from a visual change, their stats remained the same. Similarly, an angel/demon \"influence system\" was experimented with, where players could pick a narrative alignment.\nDevelopment.\nBlizzard North, the developers of the series's previous games, intended to work on a second &lt;a href=\"Expansion%20pack\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; to \"Diablo II\". The second expansion would have focused more on expanding Diablo II's multiplayer features. However, after a few brainstorming sessions, the team decided not to follow through on the expansion, and instead turn their attention to \"Diablo III\". The game was inspired by \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//ultima.fandom.com/wiki/Ultima_Online\"&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/a&gt;\". \nWork began in 2001, and by 2003, Blizzard North had created some &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; models, such as the &lt;a href=\"Flayed%20Hound\"&gt;Flayed Hound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Immolated%20Warrior\"&gt;Immolated Warrior&lt;/a&gt;. The game's graphics presented an issue. Few games in the early 2000s were still using 2D technology, but within Blizzard North, the company was working on two separate 3D engines, yet neither were established enough for the game's development.\nIn 2003, &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Max%20Schaefer\"&gt;Schaefer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Brothers&lt;/a&gt; left Blizzard North. With their resignation, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard South&lt;/a&gt; took over (some) control of Blizzard North and gave them a guideline for Diablo III\u2014\"make it like Diablo 2.\" The reason for this was not wanting competition with \"World of Warcraft\", as both games were being developed as MMOs. Thus, their version of \"Diablo III\" was scrapped, leaving it to be dubbed internally as \"\"Diablo 2.5\".\" The project would undergo strict supervision from Blizzard South, and North staff members felt this was their last chance to make the project viable. For the next few months, Blizzard North worked on a vertical slice\u2014a small chunk of the game meant to demonstrate how it would feel to play. They built some monsters, some items, and a few dungeon levels to explore. South was satisfied with what they saw as progress, and at the time, most of South's resources were tied up with \"World of Warcraft\". Since Blizzard had no idea how \"World of Warcraft\" would turn out, \"Diablo III\" was a 'backup game' of sorts. &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; returned his attention to \"World of Warcraft\".\nHowever, as time went on, development ran into more problems. Outside North, Blizzard executives like &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; would come in and offer directions, sending North's staff scrambling. Internally, the team was divided between those who wanted to follow the \"Diablo II\" formula, and those who wanted to explore new ideas. The game wasn't making progress in key areas, and when interviewed, &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Love\"&gt;Julian Love&lt;/a&gt; stated that \"Diablo III\" never improved, despite the content being added to it.\nThis new direction had to change again because of changes in circumstances. However, this version of the game was canceled in 2005, and Blizzard North shut down due to various personal and financial reasons. Reportedly, the game was 33% finished at this time.\n&lt;a href=\"Matt%20Uelmen\"&gt;Matt Uelmen&lt;/a&gt; worked on the score of Blizzard North's version of \"Diablo III\". Reportedly, his music for the game was \"big and powerful,\" shifting away from his previous style. His take on the game's music influenced the game's direction under Blizzard North.\nReboot.\nBlizzard Irvine took over development of \"Diablo III\" in 2006, effectively rebooting it."}

Some dungeons have random generation methods and the path through them may not be the same every play through. Instructions will be given where it is possible.\nSome monsters cannot be specified due to the generation nature of Diablo III. You may encounter unique, rare and champion monsters, yellow and blue named respectively, that would have been unable to be determined beforehand. These mobs are typically tougher than bosses to fight but offer much better rewards.\nThis walkthrough is intended to give a quest overview and help with each one where it can. This walkthrough will not provide information in regards to what vendors sell specifically, as this cannot be known at any given time.\nThe definition of 'boss' on this walkthrough is defined by a named mob that is the primary target of a questline that is not found more than once. They will also be more difficult to kill.\nCharacter Creation.\nAs you start up your game and log-in, for the first time, you will be greeted with the character creation process automatically. You can pick from one of the five classes from Diablo III as well as their gender.\n&lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nStoic warriors who uses tremendous physical strength to crush foes. Uses melee weapons such as swords and clubs to destroy the forces of hell. The barbarian can also use shields to block the blows that would otherwise kill any mortal man. The barbarian relies on his/her fury to inflict damage and combat foes.\nPrimary stat is &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanged weaponry and shadow manipulation make this vengeful hero an elusive stalker of demons.

Specializes to hand-to-hand based weapons but can wield one-handed weapons, as well as two-handed polearms, staves, and daibo. The monk relies on his/her spirit to drive their fighting will.\nPrimary stat is &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe commander of the dead, leading a fearsome army to battle and willing to make the ultimate sacrifice of life when necessary. Command armies of bone, blood, and corpses. Become the Necromancer, the only hero willing to wield &lt;a href=\"Magic%23Necromancy\"&gt;death magic&lt;/a&gt; to save the world of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Able to manipulate &lt;a href=\"Corpse%23Necromancer%20Corpses\"&gt;corpses&lt;/a&gt;, summon fearsome creatures and &lt;a href=\"Curse%23General%20Information\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; his enemies, the Necromancer is a force to be reckoned with. Calm and calculating, the Necromancer balances direct intervention with making others do the dirty work in his place. The Necromancer balances &lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; to power his unnatural abilities.\nPrimary stat is &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;.\nManipulator of the forces of life and death, this caster wields the power of nature in unsettling ways. Can wield swords, staves, axes and other one-handed weaponry however the Witch Doctor typically favors a ceremonial knife and an off hand \"mojo\" or shield. The witch doctor relies on his/her mana to repel the demonic taint of hell.\nPrimary stat is &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaster of the temporal and elemental energies powering creation itself. Wields wands typically with an off hand (either a source or shield) but can also use daggers, swords, axes and 2H swords, 2H axes and staves. The wizard relies on his/her arcane power to decimate the forces of hell.\nPrimary stat is &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.\nTactical survivability: ranged classes (Wizard, Witch Doctor and Demon Hunter) are generally very poor in melee, and take 42% more damage than melee fighters (to compensate those for being generally closer to the enemy). Ranged classes' best chance of survival is avoiding direct contact with the enemy, though certain 'melee builds' exist and are playable.\nAct I.\nThe Fallen Star &amp; The Legacy of Cain.\nAfter arriving on the outskirts of New Tristram you will move down the path to the main gate. There you will meet &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rumford\"&gt;Captain Rumford&lt;/a&gt; who needs help defending the gate from newly Risen Dead. Afterwards he will ask you to talk some sense into Leah and earn the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Legacy%20of%20Cain\"&gt;The Legacy of Cain&lt;/a&gt;. Talk with her, and she'll tell you to head back to the Old Ruins to find the keys to the gate. Use the waypoint to head back, and follow the path north to Adria's Hut. Head inside the cellar. Here you'll encounter &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Daltyn\"&gt;Captain Daltyn&lt;/a&gt;, the former Captain of the Guard. He uses an ice attack which freezes your character. When he uses this attack, be sure to move out of the range of the ice bombs. Keep your distance and use hit-and-run tactics and you should be fine. After killing him, talk with Leah.\nHead back outside where a group of Risen will attack you, finish them and then follow the path outside the hut to the east. Follow that path north-west until you reach the Cathedral. Head inside and enter level one of the Cathedral. Explore the first level until you find the stairs to &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Passage\"&gt;Leoric's Passage&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you enter Leoric's Passage, you will enter a cutscene where you will see &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; running through a doorway and the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt; attacking him by raising some skeletons to fight Cain. You will need to go down and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Henchmen\"&gt;Royal Henchmen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Executioner\"&gt;Royal Executioner&lt;/a&gt; before being able to continue the quest. Once you talk to him, Cain will walk toward the bookshelf and open a secret passageway, enter it and follow Cain through the waypoint back into New Tristram. Once back, talk with Leah.\nA Shattered Crown.\nAfter you speak to Leah, you will need to speak to Cain. He will tell you to find the town's blacksmith, who might know more about the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt;'s Crown. Head out through the west and talk with the blacksmith &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%20Eamon\"&gt;Haedrig Eamon&lt;/a&gt;. He'll ask you to follow him into the cellar. Do so, and kill the &lt;a href=\"Ravenous%20Dead\"&gt;Ravenous Dead&lt;/a&gt; inside. After killing Haedrig's wife, &lt;a href=\"Mira%20Eamon\"&gt;Mira Eamon&lt;/a&gt; who turned undead, talk with him and he'll tell you where to find the crown and makes mention of his apprentice that never came back. Head back outside and to the gate to the north, upon trying to cross you will be attacked, dispatch of them. Follow the path until you hit the cemetery. Once at the cemetery you will need to explore each of the three open crypts to find which one holds the crown. If the tomb has a second level, you're in the right one. If you find a pillar that teleports you back to the Cemetery or find an event quest in one, it is an incorrect place. As soon as you reach a large door, an enemy will bang on it. &lt;a href=\"Manglemaw\"&gt;Manglemaw&lt;/a&gt;, probably the first real &lt;a href=\"Unburied\"&gt;Unburied&lt;/a&gt; you'll face, will come out. He is a relatively easy boss. Finish him, and enter the &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Chancellor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the path, and as soon as you reach the crown activate it. You will now fight the &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Eamon\"&gt;Chancellor Eamon&lt;/a&gt;. He can use magic from long range, slowing your movement speed toward him. He also has the ability to pick you up and toss you back. Once he is finished, use your newly found Town Portal ability, default T, to go back to town and talk to Haedrig. He will be surprised that you found it and make note that it needs to be repaired, after a moment he will give it back to you almost as new. From henceforth you may use the blacksmithing equipment to craft new weapons and armor.\nReign of the Black King.\nOnce you speak to Deckard Cain about you having the crown and where to find the Skeleton King, you will be told to head back to the Cathedral and head into Leoric's Passage. Simply take the waypoint back to the Cathedral and enter Leoric's Passage where you came out from before. Go to the second level of the Cathedral by using the large door nearby the bookshelf entrance. Once you descend to the second level you need to find the stairs down to the third. Upon reaching the third floor you will run into a circle of cultists holding a warrior prisoner, free him and he will be your assistant once you retrieve his armor. He is &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Templar\"&gt;Templar Order&lt;/a&gt;, one of the three major &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt; you will encounter in the game. Find the waypoint in the area near where you find his equipment, down one of the hallways near the larger room where you ran to get his equipment. After that follow the pathway to the end of the level, where you will fight &lt;a href=\"Jondar\"&gt;Jondar&lt;/a&gt;, a former Templar who has joined the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Coven\"&gt;Dark Coven&lt;/a&gt;. He's a relatively simple boss to defeat. Once you've taken him down and gained Kormac officially as a follower, head down the stairs to the end and enter Cathedral Level 4.\nOnce you make your way down the stairs, you will be told to find The Royal Crypt. Explore this area to find the stairs leading down into it. Once in, you will need to follow the path toward Leoric's Sword and use it to find some history about the story. Continue onward to find four pillars and skeletons and the Skeleton King will make an announcement. Destroy the pillars quickly as they summon skeletons for as long as they are active. Once the pillars are destroyed and all the skeletons are dead, move onwards through the door. Once through the door you will have to go through some more skeletons and doors, once done you will cross a bridge like straightaway and to the left (north) you will find the door to the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you entered you will hit a cutscene with the Skeleton King breaking the central bridge to his chamber and saying that you will never defeat him. Head toward the broken bridge and take a right (east) where you will run into a locked gate. Some skeletons will spawn and you will need to kill them to unlock the gate. Once done, run through the gate up to the throne of the Skeleton King and place the crown upon his head, after a moment or two he will be alive and fighting you. His melee attacks hurt quite a bit so be careful of those and will summon some skeletons to help him in defeating you.\nOnce the Skeleton King is dead, enter the Desolate Chamber that opens up where the throne chair is and follow the path downward to find the source of the Fallen Star. Talk to the stranger as instructed and you two will end up back in New Tristram by a nearby waypoint. A cutscene will ensue.\nSword of the Stranger.\nAfter speaking to Deckard Cain about the stranger and something strange with the stranger as he fell, you will be instructed to go to the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Misery\"&gt;Fields of Misery&lt;/a&gt; located north of the Cemetery, you may use the waypoint to head back there. Once the gate unlocks, and you get there you will be told to find the &lt;a href=\"Khazra%20Den\"&gt;Khazra Den&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou may follow the path through this place but chances are you will not find it just nearby. There is also a waypoint in this area that can be found and activated. Once you found Khazra Den you are told to enter it and to find the glowing sword shard. So enter it and follow the pathway to some cultists and &lt;a href=\"Urik%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Urik the Seer&lt;/a&gt; doing some ritual on a blue spot, that is the Glowing Sword Shard that you must collect and can do so after killing the cultists. &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt; will show up to give you a speech about taking it and bring more cultists to stop you. Once you pick it up, teleport back to town and talk to Cain.\nThe Broken Blade.\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; to start this quest. You will be asked to go to the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Temple\"&gt;Drowned Temple&lt;/a&gt; to recover another piece of the sword. You do this by going through the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Misery\"&gt;Fields of Misery&lt;/a&gt; so head back there now. Follow the path to get to a Scoundrel that needs help saving his wife to be. You must help him in order to get through, you will face quite a few &lt;a href=\"Brigands\"&gt;Brigands&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Cutthroat\"&gt;Nigel Cutthroat&lt;/a&gt;. Dispatch of them and the Scoundrel &lt;a href=\"Lyndon\"&gt;Lyndon&lt;/a&gt; may follow you from here on out as one of your &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scoundrel will lead you to the temple where you need to talk to &lt;a href=\"Alaric\"&gt;Alaric&lt;/a&gt; who mentions that the only way in is to get two keys from a nearby forest called &lt;a href=\"Festering%20Woods\"&gt;Festering Woods&lt;/a&gt;. Follow Alaric to raise the bridge and enter the forest where you will be tasked in getting those keys. Head onwards through the path and explore to find the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Warrior's Rest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Crypt of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Both dungeons have a very simple and small layout and shouldn't need assistance, just do not rush through as both are packed with minions of hell.\nOnce you have both of the keys you can return to where Alaric is by the waypoint there to the Drowned Temple or run back. Place a key on each of the stone pillars and the path will open to get inside the temple. Once inside, explore the straight forward path where you will encounter &lt;a href=\"Ezek%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Ezek the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. Defeat him and he will rise &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Moek\"&gt;Brother Moek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Larel\"&gt;Brother Larel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Karel\"&gt;Brother Karel&lt;/a&gt;. Defeat these three as well.\nOnce those people are defeated, Alaric will show up and tell you your strength rivals their champions and permit you to enter their most sacred place. Enter and you will be verbally assaulted by Magdha. Once she is done talking cultists will appear. Defeat them and the sword piece is yours. Pick it up and head back to New Tristram.\nThe Doom in Wortham.\nOnce back speak to the Stranger to continue the plot line and you will be heading toward the docks of New Tristram now to catch the ferry into &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;. Head to the dock and speak to the Ferryman to go.\nWortham is in shambles, burning to the ground due to the cultists. Defeat your way toward the center of town and you will need to help the church and the town fight against some cultists in the town center. Doing so will have Magdha show up and talk about the piece. She will bring &lt;a href=\"Urzel%20Mordreg\"&gt;Urzel Mordreg&lt;/a&gt; to come and stop you along with some more cultists, focusing Urzel will remove the cultists once he dies. After his death, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Berserkers\"&gt;Dark Berserkers&lt;/a&gt; will appear for you to kill. Dispose of them and Leah will leave your party at this time, head over to the &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; and talk to him, he will lead you into the churches cellar to get the sword piece.\nUpon getting to the altar where it was kept; Magdha will show up and tell you that she has the piece and your friends (Leah, Cain and the Stranger) captive, you will need to head back to New Tristram into Deckard Cain\u2019s house where the cutscene will ensure about the situation.\nAfter the cutscene, the stranger is captured by Magdha, Cain is dead, and Leah is in town still upset about her uncle's death.\nTrailing the Coven.\nSpeak to Leah about the situation and she will bring up the next quest, &lt;a href=\"Trailing%20the%20Coven\"&gt;Trailing the Coven&lt;/a&gt;. You are told to enter the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Araneae\"&gt;Caverns of Araneae&lt;/a&gt; above Wortham. Head back to Wortham by ferry, waypoint, or town portal and head outside the church and go north to get outside the town. Once outside, simply follow the arrow on your minimap to get to the Caverns.\nOnce inside you will need to look for the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Queen%20Araneae\"&gt;Chamber of Queen Araneae&lt;/a&gt;, where, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Araneae\"&gt;Queen Araneae&lt;/a&gt;, the main boss of this part of the quest line, is located. As you progress through this dungeon you may encounter large amounts of spiders and demons coming at you, making surviving a difficult task, recommendation of Area of Effect skills is ideal as this will help kill them quickly without wasting much time. Also the webs the spiders shoot will slow you down and can prove difficult to navigate around to fight them.\nHug one of the edges when you get in and follow it around until you find the exit, as running around blindly can take some time. Some other means to find it is looking for a long curved bend that heads north, east, or south as this will lead into an area that should take you to the boss in one of the directions out from the opening area. Also, looking for the stone pillars and flooring that's in ruin can also lead to a quicker discovery but is not guaranteed, simply a trend that has been noticed.\nOnce you find the Chamber, you will need to run to the other side of it and meet a woman, &lt;a href=\"Karyna\"&gt;Karyna&lt;/a&gt;, stuck in a spider web. She will have some dialogue for you and mention that the Spider Queen is coming already as she can hear her. You will need to kill Araneae to continue.\nAraneae will on occasionally leave this area to hide and have her minions come out to fight you, typically this will happen 2 to 3 times before you are able to finally slay her. As soon as you're finished you will need to get some acid from the pool nearby Karyna and release her before she goes mad. She will want to get out of this place as soon as possible and the way into the &lt;a href=\"Highlands%20Crossing\"&gt;Highlands Crossing&lt;/a&gt; will become open.\nOnce you're outside you will need to talk to her and find out that she stole a staff from the &lt;a href=\"Khazra\"&gt;Khazra&lt;/a&gt; and they will most likely not let you pass on your way to &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt;. You will need to retrieve the staff and take it to them to see if they will let you peacefully pass.\nAs you start to cross the bridge into the main area of the Highlands, you will find a Shaman at the bridge who will run away from you, following them or killing them from a distance without them running does not matter. If you end up following him you will also have to deal with some warriors that pop out of the ground south of the bridge once you finished crossing.\nStart exploring the Highlands Crossing for the cart that she left the staff on, you may typically find this to the very north of the area or almost directly east after crossing the bridge. You can look at your main map to see the notification of where the cart is once you are close enough to it, however the arrow on the minimap will not show and only the location will ping itself once it is also on the minimap view.\nOnce you find the staff and pick it up, some Khazra will spawn along with a named Khazra called &lt;a href=\"Nalghban%20The%20Foul\"&gt;Nalghban The Foul&lt;/a&gt;. You can run away from these &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Clan\"&gt;Dark Moon Clan&lt;/a&gt; enemies or kill them, as you will be told to approach the Khazra barricade at this time. Follow the arrow on your minimap to get to it, or head back to the road and follow it to the barricade as well.\nUpon going to the barricade, the Khazra will break it down and rush out at you to kill you, saying the staff is theirs even though you meant to return it to begin with. Kill them off and you will need to fight your way through their camp in order to get to the other side where you can get to &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Be careful of the traps, &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Clan%20Shaman\"&gt;Moon Clan Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Walker\"&gt;Highland Walker&lt;/a&gt;s you may encounter, as they can be a handful as they fight in larger groups.\nOn the other side of the Khazra camp is the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Highlands\"&gt;Northern Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Simply follow the road to get to a building in ruins that may have been a stopping point for the manor. Continue up the road and fighting off cultists and khazra to finally get to &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Leoric's Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe path to finally get to &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt; is simple, follow the road just like before fighting off anything you may need to. You will finally arrive at a bridge with a gate on the other side, break it open with an attack and continue forward killing off any cultists that get too close. Once inside you are told to explore the manor. Simply head north following the tattered and ruined red carpet to a staircase.\nAs soon as you get near you will be attacked by many cultists and some hounds. Dispatch of them and continue up the left set of stairs as the right set is broken to progress through the manor. You will come to a set of doors labeled Manor Doors, open them and you will enter a room full of cultists with &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit and after some speech the cultists will attack you all at once. Kill them off.\nOnce that is done, talk to the &lt;a href=\"Wounded%20Man\"&gt;Wounded Man&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the next quest. You find out they took the &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Man\"&gt;Strange Man&lt;/a&gt; through this passage into the place below.\nThe Imprisoned Angel.\nEnter the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt; Level 1 as instructed by the objective, which is just down the staircase outside the doors by the wounded man. Fight your way through this semi-straightforward floor to the second floor, Level 2 of the Halls of Agony. You can tell if it is the right way by the large blades smacking the floor and hitting you if you're in the way. Avoid these as you progress toward the stairs.\nOnce on the second level you will need to head to the &lt;a href=\"Highlands%20Passage\"&gt;Highlands Passage&lt;/a&gt;. There is no easy way to tell if you're going the right way on this level, however you will be given an arrow once you're close enough to the stairs outside.\nOnce outside, head across the bridge to the north where you may visit a merchant to sell, repair, buy and then follow the stairs down to the east, fighting off demons and cultists as you go. You will find the way into &lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Hold\"&gt;The Cursed Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering you will need to talk to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Asylla\"&gt;Queen Asylla&lt;/a&gt; who tells you of her servants' souls being kept here and tortured, forever lingering here. You will need to free her six servants by heading to the main area and going north and south of the central intersection bridge. You'll know you've found one when you see a restless spirit pacing a green area. You may find one or two along the way into this area.\nOnce all six servants are free, Asylla will direct you to find and kill &lt;a href=\"The%20Warden\"&gt;The Warden&lt;/a&gt;, King Leoric's head jailer, who can be found at the central intersection bridge. He is a semi-difficult foe with his undead minions backing him up and his Jailer abilities, but shouldn't be too much of a threat. After you defeat him head west through the now open gateway and follow that path down into the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt; Level 3 to search for the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Suffering\"&gt;Chamber of Suffering&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce on Level 3 you will need to look for the exit into the Chamber of Suffering and you may be able to find this easier by noticing the many chains coming off the ceiling. However at this point you should also have the marker on your minimap pointing out the exit.\nIn the Chamber of Suffering, you will encounter the final boss of this act, &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt;. The battle takes place in a large pit on a large segmented grate. During the battle, sections of the grate will glow with fire, and if you're standing in that section, you will take damage. The Butcher has several main special attacks. The first attack consists of sending his meat-hook out toward you much like the Barbarian's Ancient Spear. If it hits, you will get pulled toward him and stunned, and he will get a free attack on you. The second major attack has him firing some kind of fire/sonic blast your way, and if it hits you, you'll get knocked back. He also has a habit of charging you, which does heavy damage, but which stuns him if he misses and hits a wall, allowing you to get some damage in. If you're hurting during the fight, there are two healing wells on either side near the top of the chamber that can be used to heal. Avoid his attacks and the fire as best you can and keep hitting him until he dies.\nOnce he is dead you may leave through the North-East gate into the &lt;a href=\"Cells%20of%20the%20Condemned\"&gt;Cells of the Condemned&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the long staircase down into a cutscene where you will see the Stranger being tortured by cultists. Kill the cultists and then talk to the Stranger. The Stranger will take up the restored sword and undergo a transformation as his mind and body are restored and you will learn his true identity: the archangel &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to him to finish off the quest.\nReturn to New Tristram.\nHead back to &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Once back, finish off the dialogue with Tyrael and you may now talk to the Caravan Leader to head into the next Act! Congratulations!\nEvent Quests.\nMatriarch's Bones.\nThis is an instance possibility in the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20the%20Forsaken\"&gt;Cemetery of the Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in one of the three crypts. You are required to return the bones of a person long dead. By searching each of the three Funerary Urns you will summon Lord Dunhyld, and after the third time you will be able to finish the quest.\nJar of Souls.\nThis is an instance possibility in the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20the%20Forsaken\"&gt;Cemetery of the Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in one of the three crypts. You are required to survive for a given amount of time against a massive horde of skeletons and undead and then destroy the jar itself. The time duration to survive is a minute and a half.\nLast Stand of the Ancients.\nLocated in the &lt;a href=\"Festering%20Woods\"&gt;Festering Woods&lt;/a&gt;. You need to defend a mountain top from an onslaught of &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20Spirit\"&gt;Enraged Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEvent Locations.\nTinker's Hovel.\nLocated in the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Misery\"&gt;Fields of Misery&lt;/a&gt; it contains a merchant that sells various goods.\nScavanger's Den.\nThis dungeon contains various monsters and often chest filled with riches at the end.\nCave of the Moon Clan.\nLocated in the &lt;a href=\"Highlands%20Crossing\"&gt;Highlands Crossing&lt;/a&gt; it contains many Khazra and Cultists who will try to impede your way through this dungeon.\nAct II.\nUpon your first entering of this Act, you will hit a cutscene with what you know, some new information about the upcoming act and details in regards to what you must first do. When you first enter you will need to follow the pathway into the actual town and talk to Leah who is on the wooden lookout over the city below. She is marked on your minimap on where you need to go to speak to her.\nShadows in the Desert &amp; The Road to Alcarnus.\nAfter speaking with her, you will obtain the &lt;a href=\"Shadows%20in%20the%20Desert\"&gt;Shadows in the Desert&lt;/a&gt; quest. You will need to head into the city by means of the east passageway from the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Camp\"&gt;Hidden Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you've arrived in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; you have an updated objective to talk to &lt;a href=\"Asheara\"&gt;Asheara&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to her to learn about the ongoing issues in this region with the cultists and demons. You also learn that the people in this area are mainly refugees from the attacks and you need to head through the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Canyon\"&gt;Sundered Canyon&lt;/a&gt; to find where &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt; is located.\nHead through the town through the eastern gate, the only gate out of this town, and follow the pathway down where you will find the &lt;a href=\"Enchantress\"&gt;Enchantress&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to her and she will end up following you through the canyon toward a blocked passageway. You will discover that this is actually an illusion created by the cultists and she will dispel it after fighting off an ambush.\nAfter she dispels the barrier, heading outside the new pathway will have you run into refugees guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; being attacked by demons summoned by the cultists. You are tasked with saving them, being the hero you are. After killing them you need to speak to &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf%20Jarulf\"&gt;Iron Wolf Jarulf&lt;/a&gt;. He tells you that the cultists are casting their spells from two main places and leaves it up to you to find them and stop them.\nHug the wall to the north and follow it to the north east to eventually find the first set of footprints the Enchantress reveals. Following these will be your best bet and guide to getting to the locations quickly and with minimal effort. After you dispatch of the cultists in &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Conclave\"&gt;Hidden Conclave&lt;/a&gt; heading outside and going a bit south of that will show the footprints leading to the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Altar\"&gt;Secret Altar&lt;/a&gt; location. Follow those footprints to stop them there as well.\nOnce both locations have been cleared you will need to head toward the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Canyon%20Bridge\"&gt;Black Canyon Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the arrow on your minimap to get there or the road. After arriving at the bridge, you will notice some magical flickering of the bridge showing that it's broken by an illusion only. But before you can cross you need to speak to the &lt;a href=\"Enchantress\"&gt;Enchantress&lt;/a&gt; to find out more of her story. After that she will dispel the illusion and allow you to cross over the bridge. So cross the bridge and you will need to find the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt; since the road toward your goal is blocked by rubble.\nHead north north-east through the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Canyon%20Mines\"&gt;Black Canyon Mines&lt;/a&gt; to come to location where it squeezes you through a broken gateway into the &lt;a href=\"Stinging%20Winds\"&gt;Stinging Winds&lt;/a&gt;. Go through the passageway and head north east to eventually come to another squeeze that will take you to some stairs up toward a waypoint. Keep going north east until you finally find the entryway into Khasim Outpost.\nOnce inside the outpost, you will need to speak to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Vachem\"&gt;Lieutenant Vachem&lt;/a&gt; who can be found further inside the outpost outside. Speak to him and he will tell you to head into the &lt;a href=\"Command%20Post\"&gt;Command Post&lt;/a&gt; in order to get permission to continue your way through the gate. So enter the Command Post and you will find out &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt; set up a trap here for you to die. Slay the &lt;a href=\"Copperfang%20Lurker\"&gt;Copperfang Lurker&lt;/a&gt;s here and then open the locked cages for &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Davyd\"&gt;Captain Davyd&lt;/a&gt;. Follow him back outside to find out the guards outside were also posted there by Magdha. Slay them and Davyd will allow you through the east (note: it is the south gate by directions but game speaks of it as east) gate out of the outpost.\nCity of Blood.\nSo head south until you either find the spot where you need to go south west into or follow that edge until you find it. It will look like a broken archway. You may run into many large openings in the ground along the path, these are not the edges of this area that is spoken of, go by them on either side and continue heading south. Hug the eastern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Road%20to%20Alcarnus\"&gt;Road to Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt; to come upon a bridge that is marked on your minimap, you will come upon a boss named &lt;a href=\"Shatterbone\"&gt;Shatterbone&lt;/a&gt;. He hits pretty hard so avoid his swings if you can, and dispatch of him and the cultists that come with him.\nCross the bridge into the town and you will be told as a bonus to save 8 prisoners who are caged in this lower section of Alcarnus. You are also tasked with finding the Lair of the Witch in Alcarnus. Kill your way to the south side of town where you will find stairs leading toward the east into the upper section of the city. Follow the brick pathway toward the north to eventually come to the gates to where this witch resides. A marker on your minimap will be given to you for guiding you to its location.\nOnce inside you will need to go to the center area of this to hit a cutscene where &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt; shows herself and you will need to kill her. Avoid her bug swarm attack while draining her health and you should be fine. There will be three cases where she shields herself and has demons spawn to fight you, you will be unable to attack Magdha while she has her shield up but will have it down after the demons are killed. Repeat as necessary to kill her and be done with her for good. Return to the Hidden Camp, town portal being fastest, where a cutscene will happen. Once back in camp, speak to Tyrael to continue the questline.\nA Royal Audience.\nYou will need to head down into &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; and speak to &lt;a href=\"Asheara\"&gt;Asheara&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Gates of Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; to get an audience with the emperor of the city, upon doing so you will be attacked by more &lt;a href=\"Copperfang%20Lurker\"&gt;Copperfang Lurker&lt;/a&gt;s, killing them will let you escape the area where you will fight some more of the snakes to get to the sewers.\nAct III.\nThe Siege of Bastion's Keep.\nWhen you arrive to the watchtower talk to &lt;a href=\"Tyreal\"&gt;Tyreal&lt;/a&gt; to start your first quest. Go through the armory and to the Baston's Keep Stronghold. Go to the Skycrown Battlements to signal 5 beacons. After completing, you will talk to a captain and a new quest will be given, you will help to raise 3 catapults.\nTowns.\nNew Tristram.\n&lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; contains the focal point of the young hero to be. With only one weapons and armor merchant available and the bartender inside the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Calf%20Inn\"&gt;Slaughtered Calf Inn&lt;/a&gt; selling potions, you are very limited on what you may do to start with but as the game progresses you will gradually gain access to the following:\nOld Tristram.\nOld &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; is nothing but a bunch of rubble of its former &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt; days. You can find some notable shops such as &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt;'s shop, &lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Fine%20Weapons\"&gt;Griswold's Fine Weapons&lt;/a&gt; where a weapon stand may be looted. This is also a location where a random chance dungeon &lt;a href=\"Musty%20Cellar\"&gt;Musty Cellar&lt;/a&gt; may happen.\nOther Information.\nBosses &amp; Minions.\nAct I.\nMinions: &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walking%20Corpse\"&gt;Walking Corpse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Mother\"&gt;Wretched Mother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crawling%20Torso\"&gt;Crawling Torso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spiders\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spiderlings\"&gt;Spiderlings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carion%20Bat\"&gt;Carion Bat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ravenous%20Dead\"&gt;Ravenous Dead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grotesque%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Grotesque&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Worm\"&gt;Corpse Worm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imp%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Henchmen\"&gt;Royal Henchmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scavenger\"&gt;Scavenger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungry%20Torso\"&gt;Hungry Torso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wretching%20Cadaver\"&gt;Wretching Cadaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghastly%20Gravedigger\"&gt;Ghastly Gravedigger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghostly%20Murderer\"&gt;Ghostly Murderer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unburied\"&gt;Unburied&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Servant%20of%20Jondar\"&gt;Servant of Jondar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fiend\"&gt;Fiend&lt;/a&gt;\nBosses: &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Queen\"&gt;Wretched Queen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Executioner\"&gt;Royal Executioner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manglemaw\"&gt;Manglemaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jondar\"&gt;Jondar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20warden\"&gt;The Warden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt;\nAct II.\nMinions: &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Wasp\"&gt;Sand Wasp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lacuni%20Huntress\"&gt;Lacuni Huntress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Summoner\"&gt;Dark Summoner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lacuni%20Warrior\"&gt;Lacuni Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;,\nBoss: &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;\nAct III.\nMinions: &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubus&lt;/a&gt;, Hulking Phasebeasts\nBoss: &lt;a href=\"Ghom\"&gt;Ghom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siegebreaker%20Assault%20Beast\"&gt;Siegebreaker Assault Beast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cydaea\"&gt;Cydaea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;\nAct IV.\nMinions: Terror Demon, Mounted Armageddon\nBoss: &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iskatu\"&gt;Iskatu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rakanoth\"&gt;Rakanoth&lt;/a&gt;\nAct V\nBoss: &lt;a href=\"Urzael\"&gt;Urzael&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;\nTips &amp; Tricks.\nExperience.\nYou can gain bonus experience by breaking multiple objects at once. You can break an object with your left mouse button attack by holding shift down.\nYou can also gain bonus experience by killing multiple enemies with a single attack, or by killing multiple enemies as a whole without wasting too much time between deaths.\nA more unique way to kill enemies and gain bonus experience is to use the environment to kill them such as the chandeliers or crumbling walls.\nReplaying quest lines is a great way to get experience and gold from them; it will be even quicker than killing monsters. Be warned; multiplayer play allows a certain level range for each quest, so if you want to run through a quest again, you may have to do it by yourself.\nGold.\nYou can find tons of gold by killing and selling off magic and rare items. The base normal items do not sell for much and typically will not be worth your effort unless it is to sell to make gold as much as possible. The selling of normal items is a bit easier once you acquire your ability to teleport.\nIt is recommended to explore an entire dungeon for all monsters and breakable objects to ensure maximum gaining potential, just don't waste a lot of time or it may not be worth it!\nReplaying quest lines is a great way to get experience and gold from them, it will be even quicker than killing monsters but be warned, public multiplayer play allows a certain level range for each quest, so if you want to run through a quest again in a public game you may have to do it by yourself. However, there are no level restrictions for private multiplayer games, except a character cannot play on a difficulty it has not unlocked.\nAs of the latest patch, the repeatable quest rewards, such as XP and Gold reward, have been severely reduced, upon an already finished quest, first timer. E.g., Act IV Quest I, difficulty Hell: Gained 60000xp, and after patch quest only yields 22500xp upon repeat.\nSkills.\nIf you are looking for defense or any other but you can't choose because you think some of them or good well read the following on how to solve this problem: press esc on your keyboard, options, gameplay then elective mode, check your skills, press defense. You will notice some arrows and when you press it you will notice that you are already on other categories but on the same skill slot, using elective mode you can select two to four skills that has the same category.\nAnother way to explain this:\nAs you gain levels you will unlock all 6 action slots (Primary, Secondary, and 1 through 4). Each ability category will unlock 4 or more abilities as you level. By default the game assigns each category to an action slot.\nIt may seem you can only have one ability from each category available for use. \u201cElective Mode\u201d changes that. Under Options \u2013&gt; Gameplay \u2013&gt; Interface column, the last checkbox is \u201cElective Mode\u201d. With this option enabled you can assign any ability to any action slot. You can have several abilities from the same category available at the same time.\nExample:\nYou may not use any of the abilities currently available in your Secondary ability category. Why waste the Secondary action slot with something you don\u2019t use? Assign that action slot with an unassigned ability from your Primary or Defensive category.\nNOTE: When you gain a level and access the Skills screen it will flash \u201cNew\u201d for the categories that have a new option. It is possible that one of the categories doesn\u2019t have any abilities currently assigned an action slot. The unassigned category will not be on the screen so it will not have the \u201cNew\u201d tag flashing next to it. You\u2019ll need to click a slot to go into the screen that allows you to make changes. From there you can switch categories at the top to the one that was not show on the previous screen. The \u201cNew\u201d tag will show up here. If the new ability isn't something you\u2019ll use just click the \u201cCancel\u201d button. Nothing will have changed."}
