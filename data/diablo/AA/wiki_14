Located atop the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Spire\"&gt;Silver Spire&lt;/a&gt;, it is the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s. It is guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Luminarei\"&gt;Luminarei&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Mystic%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Mystics&lt;/a&gt; have described the Arch as being composed of uncountable diamond facets that shimmer with a brilliance indescribable in mortal words.\nThe Arch is said to be the spine of the creator god &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;, and to hum with a remnant of its essence that permeates all of Heaven. Many in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, from the mystics of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; to the priests of &lt;a href=\"Skovos\"&gt;Skovos&lt;/a&gt;, agree that an echo of Heaven can be found at the height of meditation. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; speculated that this echo might be the harmony that comes from the arch itself.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, he specifically sought to corrupt the Arch. With the fall of the Arch, all of Heaven would fall with it. And reach it he did, and the adverse effects began, as a wave of energy shot out, incapacitating nearby angels and causing their wings to fade. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; (now mortal) and his mortal allies were immune to the effects however, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; successfully defeated the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;. With his fall, the Arch shone once more, cleansing Heaven of Diablo's corruption.\nLightsong.\nNew angels can be created through a process called the \"Lightsong,\" otherwise referred to as the \"Song of the Arch\" or \"angelic resonance.\" Here, angels tune their essences into the Crystal Arch in synch. Luminous bands flare off the Arch in perfect synchronization with its music, occasionally manifesting as new angels. These births are said to only occur during moments of perfect harmony in Heaven.\nThe amount of angels the Lightsong can give birth to is finite\u2014it is a case of them embodying a set amount of Anu's power. If an angel is killed, a replacement angel will be created by the Arch, but such an angel is still a different individual from the one (s)he is replacing. The replacement does not come instantaneously. Of note, the Arch specifically called on Tyrael to take the mantle of wisdom after &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, taking the place of the absent &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe angelic resonance of the arch can be sensed by some &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. However, no human has been able to mimic it.\nWeaponry and &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Tower\"&gt;other equipment&lt;/a&gt; may be blessed by the Song of the Arch. Examples include the &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azurewrath\"&gt;Azurewrath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amberwing\"&gt;Amberwing&lt;/a&gt;. Weapons forged in harmony with the Lightsong represent the greatest potential of angelic weaponry.\nIn-game.\nThe Arch appears in &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". The map name appears as \"The Crystal Arch\", and it is where the final battle against Diablo takes place in the game. As befitting its supposed origin, the parts of the Arch that can be seen look like spurs from a giant vertebra made of glowing stone. As the battle rages, the Arch becomes more corrupted, its light blocked by growths of dark matter."}

As they didn't know the shard's exact location, they attacked and destroyed &lt;a href=\"the%20Shanties\"&gt;the Shanties&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf the survivors, some they took for sacrifice, others they interrogated for information concerning the shard's location. Captives that gave displeasing information were killed and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruspex%7Chad\"&gt;their entrails read&lt;/a&gt; They conducted human sacrifices in order to summon &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfterwards, they besieged &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint%20Keep\"&gt;Stormpoint Keep&lt;/a&gt;, in a bid to retrieve the Worldstone shard that resided within.. Corpses of the sacrificed were gathered at &lt;a href=\"Windswept%20Shoals\"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"the%20Shanties\"&gt;parts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barbican%20Transverse\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; Stormpoint in grotesque piles that they referred to as \"sculptor's piles\". This binds the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the victims to the piles. These souls were used by the Cultists to \"sharpen their blades\".\nThe Cult succeeded in obtaining the shard and retreated from Stormpoint.\nAncients' Cradle.\nThey were unable to send the shard to Diablo because of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s taint within it. In order to purify the shard, they set sail on the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Sea\"&gt;Forgotten Sea&lt;/a&gt; in search of the &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the Cradle, the cult tried to harness the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20of%20Life\"&gt;power flowing through the land&lt;/a&gt;, but were rejected violently. The backlash killed some cultists, and reanimated them to fight the intruders.\nThey then rampaged through &lt;a href=\"the%20Granges\"&gt;the nearby farmlands&lt;/a&gt;, killing people and interrogating anyone who looked to be of importance. When it bore no fruit, they headed deeper into the island to &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Unholy%20Nativity\"&gt;the nearest place of importance&lt;/a&gt; to interrogate the officials there.\nDark Rebirth.\nWith the purified shard in hand, the cult arrived at &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, the place where Diablo once rose. Their plan was to use powerful imprints of Diablo to perform a ritual that would open a path to their master. The strongest imprints were &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;, (Diablo's former host), and &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; (Diablo's former lair). Unfortunately, when they tried to implant the shard in his &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt; he instead turned into a raging monster. With the proof of concept, they tried infecting other corpses (and some hapless civilians) with the shard, creating more &lt;a href=\"Shardborne\"&gt;Shardborne&lt;/a&gt; in the process. During this time, the Bride of Hell led a regiment of cultists to &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt; in search of any object in which an imprint of Diablo still lingered.\nAlbrecht was still their link to Diablo, only if they could bring him to heel. After &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; defeated Albrecht, the &lt;a href=\"Bride%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Bride of Hell&lt;/a&gt; connected the Shard to his dying psyche, creating a &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Memories\"&gt;temporary realm out of his memories&lt;/a&gt;. Within Albrecht's mind, the Bride of Hell goes to the point with the strongest imprint of Diablo \u2014 when Albrecht became possessed. Using the imprint, she created a portal directly to Diablo in &lt;a href=\"Skarn%27s%20Throne\"&gt;Skarn's Throne&lt;/a&gt; room.\nThere, the shard is delivered to Diablo, who attunes himself to it in order to speed up his &lt;a href=\"resurrection\"&gt;resurrection&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nThe Cult of Terror is introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", in the \"&lt;a href=\"Terror%27s%20Tide\"&gt;Terror's Tide&lt;/a&gt;\" questline. Its bestiary is a mix of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; enemies, though all of its members are classified as demons within the game."}

It is &lt;a href=\"Ladder\"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt; only.\nCure is an easily made helmet and can be equipped at early-mid levels. It provides a solid array defensive of bonuses, mostly geared at making its wearer less susceptible to poison. The inherent 50% reduction of poison length stacks with the level 1 Cleansing aura's reduction of 39%, for a total of 89% reduction time; this, together with the high poison resistance, renders all but the most potent poisons relatively harmless. The Cleansing aura also grants its wearer and their nearby allies a greatly reduced curse duration. Cure is a great budget rune word for mercenaries, for whom being poisoned hampers their auto-regenerating health and often gets them killed otherwise; additionally, the benefits of the cleansing aura can benefit the player, in turn, without having to sacrifice a head gear slot.\nCure is the poison variant of the patch 2.6 rune words, and is analogous to the &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;-oriented &lt;a href=\"Temper%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Temper Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;-oriented &lt;a href=\"Hearth%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Hearth Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;-oriented &lt;a href=\"Ground%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Ground Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt;-oriented &lt;a href=\"Bulwark%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Bulwark Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;. Cure stands out from the crowd thanks to its &lt;a href=\"Cleansing\"&gt;Cleansing&lt;/a&gt; aura allowing its wearer to heal nearby party members and mercenaries, as well as cutting down on their poison length. As poison interferes with a mercenary's ability to self-heal, Cure is a decent, and cheap, helmet option for increasing their survivability. Cure is particularly powerful with &lt;a href=\"Act%20II\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;desert mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Prayer\"&gt;Prayer&lt;/a&gt; aura, as it provides synergy to the cleansing aura, granting rapid healing to the party as well as poison reduction length. This can be further increased with a polearm with the &lt;a href=\"Insight\"&gt;Insight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; for a rather potent life regen.\nResult:\nRune effects:\nRune Word Bonuses:"}

{"id": "26729", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26729", "title": "Cursed Chest", "text": "A Cursed Chest is a special type of and appearing in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" where the chest is locked until the event is completed. All Cursed Chests look like large, dark metal chests with a red glimmer, and sometimes have a bubble around them while the event is being completed. When clicked, these chests start the corresponding event instead of opening.\nCursed Chest events require killing a number of &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s or a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; as fast as possible, after which the Cursed Chest turns into one or two &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Chest\"&gt;Radiant Chest&lt;/a&gt;s that can be looted. Two categories of Cursed Chest are found throughout the game world: minor ones with easier challenges that cause the chest to disappear if failed, and major ones with harder challenges which award a bonus chest if successful, and can be assigned as &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt;. A few special Cursed Chest types are limited to zones \"only\" accessible through bounties, but are otherwise similar to major chests. A very few may appear as part of other specific events.\nCursed Chests are never found in &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s of either kind, nor other zones \"outside the main world\" such as &lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;Follower&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; zones (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Lair of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;) or special event zones like &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Visions of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of Cursed Chest.\nThe first two Cursed Chests types are most common: every game is very likely to contain quite a few Cursed Chests distributed throughout each &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;, including some in &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt;. However, any specific Cursed Chest may or may not appear in any given game, and its exact location is somewhat randomized, like with other s. The remaining types of Cursed Chest are much less common, and some may only be found in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinor Cursed Chests.\nThese Cursed Chest events are found in many game zones and require killing a relatively small number of monsters as fast as possible. A highly geared character may be able to do this in a few seconds even at maximum difficulty. This simply cleanses and unlocks the &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Chest\"&gt;Radiant Chest&lt;/a&gt;, while failure causes the chest to disappear. There are three variations:\nIn all cases, the monsters appear as soon as the chest is clicked, in the area surrounding it and the player.\nThese chests are not marked on the minimap until the player clicks on the chest, and are never selected as bounties. They follow the name format of \"Cursed Chest of the [monster description]\", such as the \"Cursed Chest of the Khazra\" or the more poetic \"Cursed Chest of the Hidden\".\nMajor Cursed Chests.\nThis category of Cursed Chest event also appears in many game zones, and requires killing a large number of normal monsters, spawning repeatedly en masse within a medium time window. A higher amount of damage output is required to accomplish the objective compared to minor chests, and positioning and spawning patterns can make it difficult to kill all monsters quickly. Success within the time limit grants a bonus &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Chest\"&gt;Radiant Chest&lt;/a&gt;; failure still allows the single cleansed Radiant Chest to be opened once the remaining monsters are cleared. There are two subtypes:\nMajor Cursed Chests are the most common ones that can be assigned as &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt;. They share their bounty category with other s, so none may appear on some bounty maps, while there may be multiple on others. The bounty for a chest is completed once the event is done, regardless of whether the bonus chest was earned or not.\nThese types of chests are marked on the map from reasonably far away, even if not available as a bounty. They have the name format \"The Cursed [location]\", like \"The Cursed Shallows\" or \"The Cursed Mill\". These names show up on the &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; when offered as a bounty.\nBounty Zone Cursed Chests.\nThese Cursed Chests are similar to the previous category in requiring more work than minor chests, having a guaranteed &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Chest\"&gt;Radiant Chest&lt;/a&gt; reward, and allowing a bonus chest. However, the chests only appear in \"bounty zones\", which are only accessible for one of four specific &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt;. Any of the bounties are possible in any &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;, but not guaranteed. Any game is reasonably likely to contain one of this kind of chest somewhere in the world.\nBounty Zone chests do not follow standardized spawning patterns - each event has its own objectives, enemies, and objects. The chests themselves have no \"Cursed\" names; the event and the bounty instead share one of four possible names:\nAll of these events award a bonus chest for completing the full objective in time.\nAppearance in other events.\nRarely, another , such as &lt;a href=\"Leap%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Leap of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, may feature a chest with the same look as regular Cursed Chests, which is similarly locked until the event is completed. These events do not follow the same standardized time limit or monster spawning structure as other Cursed Chests and aren't named the same way, so they aren't categorized as Cursed Chest events on this wiki.\nCursed Shrines removed from the game.\nMost if not all Cursed Chest events with the \"five wave\" format were formerly &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%20III%29%23Cursed%20Shrines\"&gt;Cursed Shrines&lt;/a&gt;, as were a number of the minor chests. This type of shrine was removed and replaced with chest versions, possibly around &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 10. The Shrines awarded the bonus chests the same way as Cursed Chests did, but the base reward was a cleansed shrine rather than a chest.\nThe shrines were formerly covered by the achievements below, but upon being replaced, the achievements were updated as well to refer to the corresponding chest.\nAchievements and Conquests.\nCursed Chests are the subject of one \"Cursebreaker\" &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; per &lt;a href=\"act\"&gt;act&lt;/a&gt;. These require the player to complete all major Cursed Chest events in the act, but does not require any minor ones. They are named:\nIn some &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"Conquest\"&gt;Conquest&lt;/a&gt; may be available to complete, requiring the player to kill at least 350 monsters in a single Cursed Chest event on &lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment X&lt;/a&gt; difficulty or higher. This can only be completed with a major chest found in the world. &lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Peat\"&gt;The Cursed Peat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Bellows\"&gt;The Cursed Bellows&lt;/a&gt; are known as the easiest Cursed Chests with which to achieve these high kill counts. The Conquest names are:\nThese Conquests were available during Seasons 6, 8, 12, 13, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, and 30."}

There were only two cutscenes included in the final game.\nThe first was a cutscene showing the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;'s altar, obviously possessed by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. This led to the player's confrontation with Lazarus and his succubus guards.\nIn the second and final cutscene, it shows Diablo's death as his body crumbles to ash and the young &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Albrecht\"&gt;Prince Albrecht&lt;/a&gt; is released from his torment. Also in the scene, the character is shown stabbing himself in the forehead with the &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; in order to contain Diablo's evil. This scene is notable because originally, all three character &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; had their own version of this scene, but the final version of the game only contained the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;'s scene, further reinforcing the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; is in fact, the Warrior from Diablo I.\nA ending scene shows the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; as his fate is explained by a narrator.\nDiablo: Hellfire.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion for \"Diablo\" came with a new cinematic, related to &lt;a href=\"Na-Krul\"&gt;Na-Krul&lt;/a&gt;. It depicted Na-Krul being summoned into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo II.\n&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt; took cutscenes to a new level, with improved graphics and showing more interest in revealing the storyline. At the beginning of each &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;, the narrator, a crazed old man named &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;, tells &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; (believing him to be &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;), why he was unable to complete the task of bringing the Soulstone of Baal to the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt; to be destroyed.\nDiablo II: Lord of Destruction.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Lord of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; expansion brought two more cutscenes to the sequel, both of which were praised highly for their quality and content in many game reviews.\nThe first epic scene showed Baal, now in his true form with the powers of his Soulstone, and the &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Legion\"&gt;Demonic Legion&lt;/a&gt; invading &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. Their ascent is hurdled at the gates of the Capital, &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;, by an old, but brave Barbarian guard. The guard tries to convince Baal to turn back, lest the Barbarian Hordes within the city obliterate the Legion. Baal thinks about the proposal and proceeds to literally explode the guard as his reply with his &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Rift\"&gt;Mana Rift&lt;/a&gt; spell. Then, the Legion pours into the gates hacking away at all who stand in their way.\nThe final cutscene featured the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, dressed in a new garb and spectacular \"wing\" effects, trying to save &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption by destroying it. This cutscene may play a huge part in deciding the storyline of Diablo III. The music and direction of this scene has been lauded by fans and critics alike. The expansion ends in a cliff-hanger, like all the previous releases.\nDiablo III.\nThere are five cinematics in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;:\nTwo more were added in &lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;:\nMajority of interludes between quests are given in form of engine-based cinematics. Class intros and some cinematics between quests are given in form of animated sketches and narrated by the player character's voice.\nFor a complete list list of Diablo III videos and trailers, see &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III%20videos\"&gt;Diablo III videos&lt;/a&gt;."}

Per the orders of &lt;a href=\"Daedessa\"&gt;Daedessa&lt;/a&gt;, the Immortals were formed to guard &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic threats, while the Shadows were formed to constantly test the Immortals. It was agreed that if the Shadows ever defeated the Immortals, they would become Immortals themselves. This came to pass, with &lt;a href=\"Akeba\"&gt;Akeba&lt;/a&gt; becoming the next Immortal. However, not willing to rest on her laurels, she founded the Cycle of Strife, which has continued ever since, with the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Exile\"&gt;Rite of Exile&lt;/a&gt; reguarly being conducted, and beyond that, the &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20of%20the%20Immortal\"&gt;Challenge of the Immortal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cycle of Strife had been on for over a thousand years by the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, though was escalating by this point.\nGameplay.\nThe Cycle of Strife is a game mechanic of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". It is based on clans competing with one another. Each clan has the ability to become a \"dark clan\", whose members are &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. If a Dark Clan defeats the Immortals in the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Exile\"&gt;Rite of Exile&lt;/a&gt;, the current Cycle ends, and a new Cycle begins. At that time, everything connected to the current Cycle resets. This includes all ranks, Eternal Crown levels, &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Path of Blood&lt;/a&gt; progress, and so on. Additionally, when a Cycle ends, participating heroes earn &lt;a href=\"Deeds%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Deeds of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, special titles connected to their performance that Cycle. The former Immortal and their lieutenants will be engraved on the &lt;a href=\"Wall%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Wall of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, as a permanent place of remembrance to reflect on that group\u2019s reign.\nIf the Immortals successfully defeat the Shadows, the Cycle continues as normal.\nSchedule.\nStarting with the first week of the Immortal reign, the events of the Cycle follow a set schedule:\nRewards.\nThe reward for a blessed reign is a Blessed Reign Chest that contains 2 random &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Items&lt;/a&gt;, 3 random &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; and 3 &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Crest\"&gt;Legendary Crest&lt;/a&gt;s. Furthermore, special cosmetics can be unlocked by accumulating 4 and 6 Blessed Reigns on a character.\nCycle's End.\nWhen the Immortal reign ends, the Cycle's End or Cycle's Turn is started. For the next week, a login reward can be claimed:\nFurthermore the &lt;a href=\"Cycle%27s%20Turn%20Chest\"&gt;Cycle's Turn Chest&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased from the &lt;a href=\"Hilts\"&gt;Hilts&lt;/a&gt; Trader.\nServer Merge.\nDuring a &lt;a href=\"server%20merge\"&gt;server merge&lt;/a&gt;, the alliance with the highest dominance is chosen to be the new Immortals. All other clans who were Immortals are reverted to &lt;a href=\"Adventurers\"&gt;Adventurers&lt;/a&gt;. The Cycle of Strife counter is set to the length of the reign of the Immortal alliance that was chosen to be the Immortals on the merged server.\nIf there was a reign change on the last Sunday before the merge, the Cycle's Turn daily rewards and the &lt;a href=\"Cycle%27s%20Turn%20Chest\"&gt;Cycle's Turn Chest&lt;/a&gt; option from the &lt;a href=\"Hilts\"&gt;Hilts&lt;/a&gt; vendor are cancelled before their regular end date.\n&lt;a href=\"Deeds%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Deeds of Valor&lt;/a&gt; scores are set to the maximum for all players as part of the merge.\nDevelopment.\nThe Cycle of Strife initially functioned differently. There would only ever be one group of Immortals on a server, with up to 500 members. There was no limit as to how many Shadows could be active, and they would all be vying to displace the current group of Immortals. The Cycle was expected to reset each month.\nPlayers could originally form &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Houses\"&gt;Dark Houses&lt;/a&gt;. This was replaced by the \"dark clan\" system.\nThe 7-week cycle with a fixed schedule was introduced in the September 21 2023 update.\nWhen the fixed cycle was introduced, Blessed Reign was earned by winning the Challenge of the Immortal on week 7, and the number of matches needed to win the Rite of Exile on week 6 was 3 for the Shadows (the outcome of the Rite on week 7 didn't affect the result of the event). In the update, Blessed Reign was changed to be earned by winning the Rite of Exile on week 7, and the number of matches the Shadows need to win was changed to 4 on weeks 6 and 7."}

It could be described as the elemental, windy version of ; it stays on your Druid until it absorbs a certain amount of &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage\"&gt;elemental damage&lt;/a&gt;, or you leave the game. Unlike its &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; damage cousin, however, the synergies it receives are \"not\" flat additions, but rather percentage additions.

She also held dominion over a flock of &lt;a href=\"Succubi\"&gt;Succubi&lt;/a&gt;, calling them her &lt;a href=\"Daughters%20of%20Pain\"&gt;\"daughters\"&lt;/a&gt;. When Azmodan launched his &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Cydaea remained behind. However, when &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; thwarted the demonic incursion, Azmodan called upon his consort to defend the vile &lt;a href=\"Sin%20Heart\"&gt;Sin Heart&lt;/a&gt;s that powered his &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Sin\"&gt;legions&lt;/a&gt; from within &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt;. However, like many other minions of Sin, Cydaea proved unable to stop The Nephalem. She was slain in the depths of Arreat Crater.\nIn-game.\nCydaea appears as a minor boss in the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20the%20Cursed\"&gt;Tower of the Cursed&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", appearing when the Nephalem destroys the &lt;a href=\"Siegebreaker%20Assault%20Beast\"&gt;Siegebreaker Assault Beast&lt;/a&gt; and proceeds to make progress towards the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Heart of Sin&lt;/a&gt;. Cydaea will taunt the heroes seductively during their journey through the crater, dangling from a string of silk. Players will also encounter mind-controlled guards of &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt; who will say that Cydaea lured them with false promises and was preparing them to be sacrificed.\nThe player fights her twice, both times when a Sin Heart is within the heroes' reach. Both battles take place at a C-shaped arena, starting as soon as player approaches the Heart. The first battle is more like a gear-check, as she retreats immediately after receiving 50% damage, leaving the matter to her daughters and ghoul thralls.\nThe second and final battle at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Cursed\"&gt;Heart of the Cursed&lt;/a&gt; is more complicated. Cydaea is the fastest boss in game, and often runs away from the player, forcing them to fight her &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;spiderlings&lt;/a&gt; instead. She uses the following abilities:\nOn &lt;a href=\"Torment%20difficulty\"&gt;Torment difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, she has a semi-hard 4 minute enrage timer. Once it expires, she loses a cooldown of her Spiderling Pit and Net Toss abilities, overwhelming the players with the endless swarm of minions if not killed quickly.\u00a0As her own damage does not grow, however, she can still be defeated even on adequate difficulty.\nNote: Due to mechanics of her fight, it is actually the easiest boss in game for builds that rely on gaining power from killing blows (&lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Injustice\"&gt;Grave Injustice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dominance\"&gt;Dominance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rampage\"&gt;Rampage&lt;/a&gt; etc.).\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Binder\"&gt;The Binder&lt;/a&gt; is the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; variant of Cydaea."}

It features &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Nova\"&gt;Poison Nova&lt;/a&gt; along with other poison skills, curses and a few choice points out of the Summoning tab as well. Although it features Poison Nova as its main attack, it will use Poison Dagger and feature physical damage as another element of attack.\nStat Point Distribution.\nThis is a rather unique build for the Necromancer, but stock stat point placement should be sufficient\nEquipment.\nEvery item that gives skill bonus, attack rating, poison damage, bonus to resistance, attribute bonuses are welcomed for this build. Since this Necromancer build focuses on the Necromancer as a fighter, the player must be aware that the Daggermancer will be able to wear heavy armors and large shields to survive hard battles.\nVariant Build using Trang-Oul's Set.\n&lt;a href=\"Trang-Oul%27s%20Avatar\"&gt;Trang-Oul's Avatar&lt;/a&gt; set can be used to build an effective Daggermancer. Instead of relying on &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; to deal physical damage to poison-immune enemies this build uses &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Golem\"&gt;Fire Golem&lt;/a&gt;, combined with the , , and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ball\"&gt;Fire Ball&lt;/a&gt; spells granted by the set to deal fire damage.\nThe advantage of this build is that Lower Resist will improve the effectiveness of both fire and poison damage. Fire Golem consumes only mana, allowing you to conserve/sell/trade higher-end items.\nThe major disadvantage is that regardless of how much FCR the player stacks, the Necromancer will always have a slow casting rate. While in Hell mode fire immunity and poison immunity are both fairly common, but they are rarely found together, and in the rare case they are, a fully synergized poison necromancer can also rely on not only curses, but the physical damage aspect of the build.\nEquipment.\nBecause this build relies on &lt;a href=\"Trang-Oul%27s%20Avatar\"&gt;Trang-Oul's Avatar&lt;/a&gt; there is little diversity in the gear selections: once the complete set is equipped the player only has the weapon, rings, amulet, and boot slots left open.\nThese slots can be filled with the same equipment as the normal build listed above. The only real alternative is the additional optional choice to use &lt;a href=\"The%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;The Rising Sun&lt;/a&gt; Amulet, which provides a bonus to fire skills, including &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Golem\"&gt;Fire Golem&lt;/a&gt; and the spells granted by &lt;a href=\"Trang-Oul%27s%20Avatar\"&gt;Trang-Oul's Avatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkills.\nThe skill distribution is very similar to the standard Daggermancer, with a few small changes:\nGameplay and tactics.\nGeneral tactics.\nUnless monsters happen to be large in number and/or poison immune use the Golem (and hireling if a melee type was chosen) to occupy the monster's attention, cast Lower Resist and then Poison Nova, use Poison Dagger to get in attacks until the Poison Nova has worn off. Move to a safe distance, then re-cast Poison Nova.\nOnce a foe in the group has fallen, Corpse Explosion can be used to inflict area damage. Because there is both fire and physical damage, certain monsters will remain immune to fire even if their resistances are lowered. In this case, the player can choose to use Amplify Damage to magnify the physical damage aspect prior to activating Corpse Explosion.\nBecause the Daggermancer is a physical fighter, the player can choose to use Life Tap, Decrepify or Amplify Damage should it be more effective to do so.\nWhen the groups are large enough to overwhelm or kill the golem and/or hireling then the player can either use Terror or Bone Wall/Prison to break up the group, use Life Tap to out-leech the damage or Decrepify to slow down the mob and apply the same tactics as mentioned above, using Corpse Explosion and Poison Nova where opportunity exists.\nTactics Using Trang-Oul's.\nTactics are fairly straightforward, and largely similar to the standard Daggermancer tactics.\nAgainst Crowds: Use Fire Golem and/or hireling as a lure to draw enemies into a crowd and use &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt;. Use &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Wall%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fire Wall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Nova\"&gt;Poison Nova&lt;/a&gt; to deal damage to them en-masse. Should the crowd appear to be overwhelming, Bone Wall/Bone Prison or Terror can be used to break them up. Once they start to drop use Corpse Explosion cause area damage. The player can also get in melee attacks to help facilitate this\nAgainst Bosses/Uniques: Again, use Fire Golem and/or hireling as a lure. Use &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Nova\"&gt;Poison Nova&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt; to begin to wear them down. Quickly run in and stab with Poison Dagger before falling back and continuing to use Poison Nova, Meteor or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Wall%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fire Wall&lt;/a&gt; to deal fire damage while Poison Dagger does its damage. Repeat as necessary.\nCurse usage.\nThe necromancer has a lot of flexibility in regards to the Curse tab, and although Amplify Damage and Lower Resist will be the most popular curses to use, others such as Life Tap, Decrepify, Dim Vision and Terror can also come into play, especially on multiplayer.\nIn large crowds and with groups of ranged attackers, Terror and Dim Vision have use, although given how many points a player will have invested in the Poison Dagger and its synergies as well as his golem, it may be difficult to if at all worth having Dim Vision skill high enough to be effective.\nThe bottom line with curse usage is effectiveness.\nHireling.\nAlthough many players solo with their characters, &lt;a href=\"Hireling\"&gt;Hireling&lt;/a&gt;s can certainly increase the survivability of any character if maintained properly. Typically, most choose the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Act 2 Defensive Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; in Nightmare Difficulty (the \"Holy Freeze Merc\") or the Offensive version (the \"Might Merc\"), but the others have plenty of potential if geared properly. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Act 3 Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; with cold attacks used to be popular, but are rare now due to many monsters being immune to their attacks. Although &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarian Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are quite rugged, they can be overcome by large mobs. On the other hand, properly equipped, he can definitely play a major factor in increasing the character's survivability. And the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt; should not be counted out either, although without particular gear her ability to assist in later stages of the game diminishes by quite a bit.\nEquipment.\nAlthough the weapons vary, the armor and helmet choices are mostly stock, with some variance in regards to armor."}

Damage can be realised by:\nSpell damage is always successful. The success of melee and range damage depends from the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Attack Rating&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn all case of damage the hitpoints of the defender is decreased. If the defender has no resistances, the hitpoints of the defender is decreased with the same amount as the damage from the attacker is. If the resistance is greater than 0, the amount of taken damage is decreased. If it is less than 0, the amount of taken damage is increased. If the damage is higher than the defender's hitpoints left, the defender &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;dies&lt;/a&gt;. Some damage can also be negated with items that provide a &lt;a href=\"Damage%20reduction\"&gt;Damage reduction&lt;/a&gt; bonus such as \"Damage Reduced By 7\" in which case physical damage will be reduced by 7.\nThere is a difference between &lt;a href=\"Attack\"&gt;Attack&lt;/a&gt;ing and damaging. If you attack a monster, it is an \"attempt\" to do damage to it. It is not guaranteed that the attack is successful. In case of damage the attack was successful.\nDiablo II.\nFor damage in the Diablo II engine, the maximum amount available to be dealt in a single hit is 8388608 (223). This number, however, is reduced severely when used in Player Vs Player scenarios.\nAll damages save poison.\nPhysical damage is reduced by the PVP penalty of 100% to 17% and reduces the aforementioned 8.38 million damage to 1426063.6 which is often rounded to 1426064 for ease of calculation.\nThe second method of damage reduction is the Sorceress' skill \"&lt;a href=\"Energy%20Shield\"&gt;Energy Shield&lt;/a&gt;\" (henceforth ES). At maximum capacity, it can reduce the damage done to life to % which is 71303.2 damage, calculated from the rounded value. Note that the similarities of Phyisical and Elemental/Magical damages end here.\nPhysical damage.\nAfter the ES effect, &lt;a href=\"Damage%20reduction%23Damage%20Reduced%20By%20%28integer%29\"&gt;Damage Reduction by Integer&lt;/a&gt; takes effect, (henceforth DR#) and can reduce, by the limits of the game engine, up to 198 instances of 63 damage reduction. This reduces the 71303.2 to 58,892.2\nFrom there, &lt;a href=\"Damage%20reduction%23Damage%20Reduced%20By%20%28percent%29\"&gt;Damage Reduce by Percentage&lt;/a&gt; takes effect, (henceforth DR%) and can further reduce the damage by up to 50%. this takes the damage to a new low of 29414.6 physical damage that hits life as a game engine best case scenario.\nNon-poison Elemental damage.\nOnscreen resists (the resists shown by the Character Screen) can go up to 95% and reduce the damage as such. The 71303.2 damage from the previous instance is reduced to 5% yet again, taking the damage to 3565.16 per hit.\n&lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;Absorption&lt;/a&gt; reduces the damage further, and will be explained by their two different types. Absorbs by percentage, similar to DR% for physical damage, further reduce the damage taken by the non-poison elemental types. The way it works, is that Absorbs up to 40% are effective in reducing the damage by said amount. However, they also heal the same amount, which in turn doubles it's effective value. This reduces, in a perfect scenario, the 3565.16 damage to 20%, which is 713.032 damage per strike as a maximum.\nAbsorbs by integer can reach a maximum easily above 100,000 if using the character limits, rendering the elemental damage able to HEAL instead of hurt, however, for simplicity's sake, a small integer of 200 will be used. This would reduce the damage further from 713.032 to 513.032, and would heal for 200 as well, which would negate 200 of the damage, reducing the actual damage taken to 313.032.\nHOWEVER! Absorbs % and integer absorbs reduce the damage before healing it, but the end result is the same.\n3565.16 reduced to 2139.096, a difference of 1426.064 (the number looks familiar, yes?) then is further reduced by the 200 integer absorbs to 1939.096. The heal would then reduce the damage by (1426.064+200) or 1626.064, which comes to 313.032, as seen before.\nPoison Damage.\nPoison damage is unique in the way that it can deal up to 8388608*25 damage per second, the 8.3 million damage per frame. That's a lot of hurt, and a very sickly poison. Maybe &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; herself concocted this with some help from &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alkor\"&gt;Alkor&lt;/a&gt;?\nNonetheless, it's also reduced by the PVP penalty to 1426064 (rounded) per frame, which is still ridiculous. However, it's also reduced similarly by up to 95% onscreen resists, which takes that again down to 71303.2 per frame. There are no poison absorbs, so the damage cannot be absorbed like the other elements.\nIt can, however, be reduced by time, by various different sources. It reduces the overall damage similar to absorbs, as poison damage is calculated as (XXX damage over XXX seconds) and then it is transcribed as, when the damage value is selected, to (XXX damage per frame for XXX seconds) which would then greatly reduce the damage done.\nMagical damage.\nAs the elemental damages from above, it only skips the resistances part and is absorbed by the possible absorbs available. Note that Magic resists are there, but they are, however, unable to be accessed by the game's base drop rates and affixes, which does not allow magical resistance.\nDiablo III.\n\"Diablo III\" calculates damage quite differently than previous games. Most attacks targeted at an enemy will automatically hit, and the only random chance (for player attacks) is whether each will be a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;. The attack's baseline damage is almost always based on &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; damage for players, and is multiplied by a series of offensive bonuses and defensive decreases to calculate the final \"unsaved damage\", which may then be &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;ed or &lt;a href=\"absorb\"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt;ed before being applied to &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a chance to some types of attacks; a dodged attack is nullified completely.\nDamage numbers may be shown above enemies when damage is inflicted: white color for normal hits, yellow for Critical Hits, and red for damage done to the player. As of &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.0%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, very large damage numbers may be abbreviated (rounding down), M for millions, B for billions and T for trillions. These options can be adjusted in the game settings, including an option to display the color of damage more orange and red if its damage is substantially higher than previous hits.\nDamage statistic.\nThe game calculates the damage per second that a continuous series of basic attacks would deliver, for the purpose of giving players a baseline to compare to when they change their items and skills, and shows this as \"Damage\" (also called DPS) on the &lt;a href=\"character%20screen\"&gt;character screen&lt;/a&gt; just above the other \"effectiveness statistics\", &lt;a href=\"Toughness\"&gt;Toughness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Recovery\"&gt;Recovery&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt; chance / damage, overall damage increased by &lt;a href=\"Passive%20skill%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;passive skills&lt;/a&gt; and several item powers, and a few other stats are all taken in account. Also included are temporary increases to overall damage caused by triggered item powers or active skills with a duration. On the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Area%20Damage\"&gt;Area Damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cooldown%20Reduction\"&gt;Cooldown Reduction&lt;/a&gt;, bonuses to specific skills, and conditional overall damage bonuses granted by most class &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;sets&lt;/a&gt; are not included.\nFor example, if a skill deals 200% damage of the basic weapon damage, and one has 100,000 DPS, the attack will deal (on average) 200,000 damage per second not including more specific bonuses. If it deals, for example, &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, and the character has a 10% bonus to either Fire skills or that specific skill, the total effective DPS will increase to 220,000. In other words, for almost every skill in game, the Damage stat reflects the effective damage done pretty accurately. Some effects and &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s, however, especially those relying on and other specific stats, scale very differently, so this number becomes somewhat meaningless for them.\nCalculating damage.\nBefore multipliers are applied, the \"base damage\" is determined:\nOffensive damage bonuses include:\nThese bonuses are almost universally in the form of a percentage added to the total damage. This can be treated as a multiplier by that percentage plus 100%; for example a 40% bonus is the same as a 140% or 1.4x multiplier. Note that multiplication gives the same result regardless of the order the increases are applied.\nDefensive reductions to damage \"to players\" include:\nMost general defensive multipliers are known as &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt;. Each reduction is applied sequentially, affecting only the amount of damage remaining after the previous one is applied. This can be treated as multipliers on the total damage equal to 100% minus the reduction, for example 30% reduction is a damage multiplier of 70% or 0.7. In either form, the result is the same regardless of the order the decreases are applied. Since the separate effects are not summed, and no single type of effect ever grants 100% damage reduction, it is impossible to reduce damage to 0 even with many of these effects.\nSome sources can grant damage increases \"or\" damage reductions, or both:\nThe remaining amount is known as 'unsaved damage', and is applied to the character's / monster's &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, though it can be reduced further by special &lt;a href=\"absorption\"&gt;absorption&lt;/a&gt; shields granted by certain skills. A shield's &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; value also applies to this amount if the blocking check proves successful. Note that even if all unsaved damage is entirely absorbed, the hero still counts as having suffered a damaging hit.\nAfter all absorptions, the remaining damage is drained from the Life pool, and &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; the target if it brings the Life to zero.\nElemental Damage.\nAll attacks count as &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; in \"Diablo III\". The relevant element for attacks by players is usually the one from the its selected &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Rune\"&gt;Skill Rune&lt;/a&gt;, as most elemental bonuses are based on skills of a specific type. However, damage from players often has \"two\" types, or even three if &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;Dual Wielding&lt;/a&gt;: one from the skill, and one from added elemental damage from each weapon's Magic Properties. A few effects do care about dealing any \"damage\" of a certain type rather than specifically with a \"skill\" of that type, for example , &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Cause\"&gt;Holy Cause&lt;/a&gt;, the , and a couple &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt; with an elemental &lt;a href=\"immunity\"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeriodic Damage.\nPeriodic damage (such as &lt;a href=\"Bleed\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;, or Plagued pools) counts as many separate strikes with rapid succession. Some abilities can roll Critical Hits, while others simply increase damage by average of the Critical Hit chance / damage ratio. &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; also boosts the periodic damage: it either increases the plain damage done, or allows delivering it in a shorter duration."}

Examples of such skills are the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grasp%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Grasp of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Haunt\"&gt;Haunt&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, a DoT skill is described as X damage over Y seconds. Some skills deal both instant damage and DoT.\nDamage done by DoT effects is not applied at once, but drained gradually. Technically, target will suffer a hit 10 to 30 times per second (combined numbers popping up every 0.5 seconds). Some DoT effects can even roll a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;, or deal damage in a shorter duration (faster ticks) proportionally to &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt;, but most are simply increasing their plain tick damage proportionally to the Attack Speed, Critical Hit Chance and Critical Hit Damage. They will still be affected by the target's &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt;s, if any.\nMany DoT skills hit everything within the area of effect, effectively delivering a hit to every enemy standing in a 'pool', stopping the damage as soon as target leaves the dangerous area. Note that this damage counts as being inflicted in melee.\nMost DoT skills have very low &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;Proc Coefficient&lt;/a&gt;s, but some (like &lt;a href=\"Haunt\"&gt;Haunt&lt;/a&gt;) may have higher values.\nChanneled skills (like &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Firebats\"&gt;Firebats&lt;/a&gt;) also deal damage like DoT, as long as a foe is foolish enough to remain in the area of effect of the beam or the torrent. These skills always roll normally for the Critical Hit and fully benefit from the Attack Speed, but drain &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; from the target over time just like a normal DoT.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, where heroes could not die from being &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;ed, in Diablo III, both monsters and characters can die from any DoT effect. Note that most DoT effects can kill the target even after the player or monster who had placed that effect is already dead. Notable exceptions are Damage Over Time effects with very long duration \u2014 such as &lt;a href=\"Firebird%27s%20Finery\"&gt;Firebird's Finery&lt;/a&gt; ignition or &lt;a href=\"Haunt\"&gt;Haunt&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Locust%20Swarm\"&gt;Locust Swarm&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Creeping%20Death\"&gt;Creeping Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes.\nBleed is a special form of DoT, mostly using the &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage type, and is sometimes treated differently than other Damage Over Time effects.\nBurn.\nBurn is a special form of DoT, mostly using the &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage type, and is sometimes treated differently than other Damage Over Time effects.

It comes in two forms:\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Damage Reduction comes from &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"suffix\"&gt;suffix&lt;/a&gt;es or special modifiers on &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;. In \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", it can be granted by &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s and powers and is only based on percentages.\nDiablo II.\nThe second game includes several possible item &lt;a href=\"Suffix%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;suffixes&lt;/a&gt; which reduce damage by an absolute quantity per hit. It also includes rarer effects that reduce physical damage by a percentage, found only on &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Word\"&gt;Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt; Items.\nDamage Reduced By (integer).\nThis item trait reduces the damage of each hit of a certain type, either all &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; Damage or all &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Damage\"&gt;Magic Damage&lt;/a&gt;. When it prevents Magic damage, this is displayed as Magic Damage Reduced by (integer); the physical version has no additional specifier. The type and amount prevented depends on the specific suffix, and the level of the &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor each hit of the correct type, the damage reduction amount is simply subtracted from the total. In a scenario that a &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20One%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt; would normally hit a character for 5 damage, ignoring all other penalties, \"Damage Reduced By 3\" will reduce the damage taken from 5 to 2. It can reduce damage dealt to 0, but not below 0; damage reduction never causes healing from attacks.\nMagic Damage Reduction applies to all Magic damage. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt;, which only apply to elemental damage (&lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;), this applies to \"general\" &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Damage\"&gt;Magic Damage&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nThese item suffixes are quite common and can appear on &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Uniques&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Sets&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt;. However, the amount reduced by them is generally too low to be considered useful beyond very early game. Apparently &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; had intended this attribute to be standard on some &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt;s, but this idea was dropped.\nDamage Reduced By (percent).\nThis modifier removes a percentage of the physical damage done to a character; it could be thought of as Resist Physical, analogous to other &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \u00dcber &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt; possess a similar resist damage attribute.\nIt is generally considered to be a more important statistic than the integer Damage Reduction attribute in spite of the fact it is capped at 50%, normally due to there being little place to stack the former attribute or to utilize &lt;a href=\"Sol%20Rune\"&gt;Sol Rune&lt;/a&gt;s as elemental damage is also a concern, especially in later stages of the game. In any case, this attribute is most certainly a helpful one when being attacked by missiles or melee weapons.\nUnfortunately, this attribute is also significantly more difficult to find, as it cannot spawn on Magic or Rare Items. Can be found on:\nDamage Taken Goes To Mana.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Shield\"&gt;Energy Shield&lt;/a&gt;, where damage is taken away from &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; and reduces the amount of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; taken, Damage Taken Goes To Mana just adds a portion of the damage you take to your Mana and does not reduce any damage taken to Life. Can be found on:\nDiablo III.\nThe third game has a wide variety of percentage-based effects that increase or reduce damage taken and dealt by the player characters or their enemies. Most, but not all, apply to \"any\" damage rather than limited to certain types. &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt;-specific damage reduction is now also present in the form of physical &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;, although it is treated like any other resistance rating.\nA few effects distribute a portion of damage that would be taken to allies, &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s, or even enemies (damage reflection). While damage redirected to friendly targets depends on the survival of the damage sharer, it can be reliable enough to be counted as Damage Reduction. Unlike other Damage Reduction, the order of the effects does matter to determine the amount taken by the target: The redirection happens \"after\" other percentage decreases, so \"all\" recipients take same amount of damage based on the defenses of the character that was actually hit.\n&lt;a href=\"Blocking\"&gt;Blocking&lt;/a&gt;, Resistances and &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; each contribute another percentage of damage prevented. Several effects \"increase\" damage taken, which can be thought of as negative or inverted Damage Reduction. Others decrease damage dealt \"by\" enemies, which reduces damage to \"all\" allies, and has conditions such as hitting an enemy or applying &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; to the enemy. These are not considered Damage Reduction in the same way as constant, \"flat percentage\" decreases, but once the various percentages are calculated, all are combined multiplicatively to determine the final damage.\nCalculation.\nSeparate sources of Damage Reduction that would apply to a given attack can be thought of as \"allowing\" a percentage of the damage through, and stopping the rest. These allowed percentages can be multiplied together to find the final damage. It can be thought of as each DR effect applying one by one (the result is the same regardless of order), with each percentage decrease applying only to the damage \"remaining\" after previous decreases.\nPercentage reduction has a degree of diminishing returns, since each effect eliminates a percentage of a \"fraction\" of the original attack, rather than a percentage of \"all\" of the original attack. But, the relative change to incoming damage a player will see when they acquire a new DR effect will exactly match the percentage stated by that effect, unlike the effects based on accumulating \"ratings\" like Resistances and Armor.\nFrom classes and skills.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" \"&lt;a href=\"Melee%20Attack\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt;\", which usually engage in close-quarters combat, each get constant 30% damage reduction to all attacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Passive%20skill%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Passive Skills&lt;/a&gt; which provide Damage Reduction are most prevalent for Barbarians, with &lt;a href=\"Superstition\"&gt;Superstition&lt;/a&gt; (20% non-physical) and &lt;a href=\"Sword%20and%20Board\"&gt;Sword and Board&lt;/a&gt; (30% when using a shield), as well as &lt;a href=\"Nerves%20of%20Steel\"&gt;Nerves of Steel&lt;/a&gt; (95% for a few seconds after being saved from death). Most other classes get one such skill: &lt;a href=\"Vigilant\"&gt;Vigilant&lt;/a&gt; (Crusader, 20% non-physical), &lt;a href=\"Sixth%20Sense\"&gt;Sixth Sense&lt;/a&gt; (Monk, 25% non-physical), &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20Fortitude\"&gt;Jungle Fortitude&lt;/a&gt; (Witch Doctor, 15%) and &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt; (Wizard, 17%). Demon Hunters and Necromancers do not have direct damage reduction passives.\nAll classes also have Active &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt;s that reduce damage (sometimes depending on a specific &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Runes\"&gt;Rune&lt;/a&gt;), usually for a short period:\nFrom items.\n\"Reduced damage from melee attacks\" or \"Reduced damage from missile attacks\" may appear as secondary &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; properties.\nThe bulk of Damage Reduction from items is usually in the form of unique powers. A high proportion of six-/seven-piece class sets grant Damage Reduction as one of their set bonuses.\nThe damage splitting ring can be used to achieve 50% Damage Reduction by equipping it on both the player character and their &lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;Follower&lt;/a&gt;, and giving the Follower one of the \"Your follower cannot die\" items (&lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20Favor\"&gt;Enchanting Favor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Smoking%20Thurible\"&gt;Smoking Thurible&lt;/a&gt;)."}

They are very weak, but usually attack in large numbers, and often are supported by demons.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Vessel\"&gt;Dark Vessel&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee the respective article: Cultists can be recognized from Dark Vessels\u00a0by their lack of a staff. Vessels have a long staff which curls at the end, on which they lean while summoning up the demons by which they are possessed. A few seconds after combat starts, they turn into &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Thrall\"&gt;Dark Thrall&lt;/a&gt;s unless killed quickly.\nDark Conjurer.\nConjurers are human mages, usually not attacking the hero (unless he comes really close), but holding the dark portal opened, therefore summoning &lt;a href=\"Hellions\"&gt;Dark Hellions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Berserkers\"&gt;Dark Berserkers&lt;/a&gt; every few seconds. Once all Conjurers are dead, the portal is closed. If approached, they can shoot fireballs for average Fire damage. It's wise to bypass the hulking Berserkers to kill the Cultists as quickly as possible. Some Conjurers are initially not channeling a portal, in that case, they attack at once.\nDark Summoner.\nSummoners are the more powerful variant of Conjurers. They do not need a portal to summon reinforcements, instead being able to summon one Hellion at a time and enhance its damage by controlling it with a beam of dark energy.\nDark Zealot.\nZealots are the more powerful variant of regular Cultists, moving and attacking much faster.\nTemporal Priests.\nTemporal Priests only spawn during &lt;a href=\"The%20Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;The Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt; event, and drop the &lt;a href=\"Cultist%20Page\"&gt;Cultist Page&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOne Priest spawns (along with a few Temporal Initiates) in each of the &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; zones.\nTemporal Priests are grey colored versions\u00a0of the regular Cultists.\nThere can only be one Temporal Priest spawn per location, and he can drop duplicate pages; but on the upside, they are a guaranteed drop.\nHematic Supplicants.\nSupplicants are a special type of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Cultist\"&gt;Blood Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s, presumably the lowest-ranking initiates of &lt;a href=\"Vidian\"&gt;Vidian&lt;/a&gt;'s blood-worshippers. They are encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Moors\"&gt;Shrouded Moors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, as well as arenas between those.\nIt appears that &lt;a href=\"Theodosius%20Jordan\"&gt;Theodosius Jordan&lt;/a&gt; leads them.\nAll of the Supplicants are of Zealot type, bearing bright red robes and daggers.\nTheir most notable appearances are during the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Statue\"&gt;Blood Statue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Hematic%20Key\"&gt;The Hematic Key&lt;/a&gt; s, where their &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; can be used to destroy the monument and to open the doors to the inner sanctum of the Temple.\nDevelopment.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Triune%20Cultist\"&gt;Triune Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s were supposed to appear in game. &lt;a href=\"Triune%20Vessel\"&gt;Triune Vessel&lt;/a&gt;s also used to resemble Dark Cultists and Summoners at certain point, a mage style monster, member of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "2518", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2518", "title": "Dark Exile", "text": "The Dark Exile refers to the banishment of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;. This article also covers the Hunt for the Three Prime Evils on Sanctuary, though most sources treat this as a separate event.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe Dark Exile had its origins in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, and consequent cessation of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, as per the pact made between &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;. The Prime Evils nonetheless turned their attention to the perversion of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s, for they realized that mankind was key to their eventual victory over &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;. This deviation from the norm caused many of the Lesser Evils to question the authority of the Three, and so brought about a great rift between the Prime Evils and their servitors. That the Primes had not revealed the existence of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; to the Lesser Evils when they first discovered it prior to the Sin War had already soured relations between them and their lesser brothers, and &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would speculate hundreds of years later that this deception added to the Lessers' decision to rebel.\nIn their ignorance, the Lesser Evils began to believe that the Three were afraid to continue the war with Heaven. They considered themselves innately superior to humankind, and that the Eternal Conflict was theirs alone to fight. Frustrated by the cessation of the war, &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; saw the situation as their chance to overthrow the Prime Evils and take control of Hell for themselves. Belial manipulated Azmodan into revolt and the demon lords made pacts with their brethren, assuring them that humanity would not deter them from seizing victory in the Eternal Conflict. &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; had their doubts at first, afraid that they would fall in the coming conflict. Belial however, kept them in the fold. Azmodan and Belial devised a plan to end the stalemate, achieve victory in the Sin War and ultimately ride the bloody crest of the Great Conflict straight into the very arms of Armageddon. Thus, a great revolution was set into motion as all of Hell went to war against the Three Brothers.\nThe Uprising and Aftermath.\nHell became embroiled in civil war as the Prime Evils were turned upon. To their credit, the Prime Evils fought with devastating power, annihilating a third of Hell's treacherous legions. A few days before the conflict's end, &lt;a href=\"Izilech\"&gt;Izilech&lt;/a&gt; defied Diablo. Diablo's wrath left Izilech's form permanently deformed, but Izilech endured. In the end, the Primes were overcome by the &lt;a href=\"Horned%20Death\"&gt;Horned Death&lt;/a&gt; led by the traitors Azmodan and Belial. The Prime Evils, weakened and bodiless, were banished to the mortal realm where Azmodan hoped that they would remain trapped forever. \nThe banishment of the Prime Evils from Hell to the mortal plane also left them incorporeal. In order to acquire a physical form, they required a body for their spirit to possess. Over time their demonic presence twisted the victims human flesh into grotesque simulacrums of their physical form. \nMeanwhile, Azmodan believed that with the Three set loose upon humanity, Heaven would be forced to turn their focus upon the mortal plane, thus leaving the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Heaven\"&gt;Gates of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; abandoned and defenseless. According to folklore, a single demon devastated half of Hell in anger after the Prime Evils' defeat. Those few demons who still pledged allegiance to the Three Brothers fled the wrath of Azmodan and Belial, escaping to Sanctuary to seek out their lost masters.\nAs the fires of war died down, Azmodan and Belial began to argue over which of them held the higher authority. The pact that they had made quickly fell to ashes as the two demon lords took up arms against each other. The legions of Hell that remained were polarized behind either warlord, launching themselves into a second civil war. One account states that there was no falling out however, and that the two Lesser Evils began a scheme to subjugate all life to their will. In truth however, the two lords did indeed do battle, and both claimed massive realms as their own. By the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Azmodan had held the upper hand for quite some time. Of note, &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; was also able to claim swathes of Hell as his own. Eventually, both Lesser Evils would turn their attention to Sanctuary.\nIn truth, the Primes' banishment to the mortal realm had been masterminded by the Primes' themselves. &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; had told them of the soulstones, and helped them devise the scheme. It was intended that through the use of the soulstones, they would corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, and through it, humanity, and its &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; potential.\nThe Hunt for the Three.\nThe coming of the Three marked a time of evil in the history of Sanctuary unlike any other. The cataclysm that followed their arrival brought immense change to the world when the Three unleashed their hellish followers upon the world. These followers wrought great destruction upon the lands of Sanctuary. That which was not consumed by the arrival of this malevolence was often twisted and altered by the effects of the resulting chaotic forces. Many of the native creatures inhabiting the world became vile and depraved shadows of their natural forms. A world that once allowed the unfettered development and expansion of mankind became a place where only the strongest could survive.\nThe Prime Evils' banishment had left them incorporeal, and forced them to take human hosts. They roamed the east of Sanctuary, feeding upon the lusts of men, leaving chaos in their wake. Entire nations were led into brutal and petty wars. Their exile from Hell had left the Three with an insatiable hunger to bring suffering and pain to all who would not kneel before them, and so the Three Brothers ravaged the lands of the Far East. The Three could inhabit the bodies of humans, and used this ability to control political and religious figures, allowing them to deceive the people of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually the presence of the Primes was discovered by &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; of Justice. Knowing that the Angiris Council had spared mankind by a single vote at the end of the Sin War, the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; dared not inform his brethren that Hell threatened to corrupt humanity once again. Somehow, he had to intervene without alerting Heaven to the situation. To this end, he gathered various individuals from various &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;. They were all strangers to one another, but were selected because these men were the most likely to succeed in Tyrael's mind. Naming this group the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrael gave them three &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s, each a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these soulstones would be used to contain the essence of a single Prime Evil. The soulstones allowed the Horadrim to track the Primes, even when their true forms were hidden within mortal shells.\nThe Cube.\nA device simply called &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;\"the Cube\"&lt;/a&gt; was designed by &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;; one of the mages Tyrael had chosen. The Horadrim agreed that it would be a necessary device if their hunt was to succeed. However, its creation was marred by dark methods and disastrous results, resulting in the order quickly determining that it was too dangerous for anyone to continue using. Creating the weaker &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; in its stead, they entrusted the first Cube to a secret organization of s on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, who kept it safe from everyone, including the rest of their tribe.\nThe Binding of Hatred.\nThe power of the soulstones proved to be much more difficult to employ when used against the great Prime Evils. Voraciously disposed to possessing hapless mortals, the Three Brothers found that they were immune to the effects of the stones while occupying human souls. Thus, the Horadrim were forced to kill the innocent victims of the Three so that their demonic essences could be subjected to the soulstones.\nDuring the hunt for &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Hatred frequently made use of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; minions, and common soldiers were hard pressed to combat the seemlessly endless tides of undead that he summoned. During the assault on the demon's &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20of%20Bone\"&gt;Fortress of Bone&lt;/a&gt;, the army the Horadrim led was nearly overwhelmed by these beings, but were able to nullify the demon's ability to resurrect soldiers through a &lt;a href=\"Resurrect%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;type of magic&lt;/a&gt; and won the day. After five years,the Horadrim located Mephisto in or around one of the urban centers of Kehjistan. They succeeded in capturing and imprisoning the demon, but the fight cost many innocent lives. The Horadrim thus vowed to avoid confronting another Prime Evil in a populated area.\nThe Horadrim also had to decide what to do with Mephisto's soulstone. &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; decided to entrust it to the monks of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, whom he had an affinity for, and believed could be trusted to guard it. As the Horadrim continued their hunt for the remaining Primes, the Zakarum began building the temple city of &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, under which Mephisto's soulstone would be guarded. While the act of construction drew many followers to Zakarum, Mephisto's presence would have disastrous consequences for the religion in later centuries.\nThe Binding of Destruction.\nIn time, Diablo and Baal journeyed across the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; to the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, the Horadrim in close pursuit, emboldened by their success against Mephisto. 58 days after the hunt had begun, Baal took refuge in the city of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. Tal Rasha had believed that Baal had been headed north for &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;, but regardless, for three days, the Horadrim waited patiently. The demon then fled into the scorched wasteland, but the harsh desert offered no solace from his persuers. Turning to fight, Baal unleashed his powers against the Horadrim. Reportedly, as very ground itself gave way, and the combatants fell into a network of subterranean caverns. In truth, however, the battle took place on the surface, as the Horadrim fought against Baal's demons. Tal Rasha engaged Baal in single combat, until Kulle, leading the rest of the Horadrim, arrived to join the fray.\nIt is here, that accounts vary. One states that in a desperate attempt to survive, Baal hurled a devastating spell against Tal Rasha, shattering the Amber Soulstone. However, it was not enough, and the raging demon lord was subdued. Tal Rasha, gathering the largest of the stone's shards, trapped Baal's destructive essence within it. A different account from &lt;a href=\"Nor%20Tiraj\"&gt;Nor Tiraj&lt;/a&gt; however, states that it was Kulle's inability to properly handle the stone in battle that led to its destruction. In truth, the former account holds more weight. Whatever the truth, the outcome was the same\u2014Baal was contained in the shard, but it would not hold him indefinitely.\nOnce again, accounts differ, as to whether it was the suggestion of Kulle or Tal Rasha that a human act as a surrogate soulstone, using the shard as a conduit to their body. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would theorize centuries later that Kulle's role was downplayed in writings due to the falling out he had with the Horadrim. But again, whatever the truth of the matter, Tal Rasha volunteered for the role, fated to wrestle with the demon for eternity. It was here that Tyrael appeared once more, telling Tal Rasha that his sacrifice would be remembered. He then led the men through the tunnels into the burial chambers of long-dead kings. In one of the largest tombs, the Horadrim built a binding stone, etched with runes of containment, held fast to the chamber's walls by unbreakable chains. Tal Rasha ordered his brethren chain him to the stone, after which Tyrael jammed the soulstone into his chest, leaving him to wrestle with Baal's spirit for eternity. Sorrowfully, the Horadrim sealed the chamber and departed.\nThe Binding of Terror.\nIn the wake of Tal Rasha's sacrifice, &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt; became the leader of the Horadrim. They began searching for Diablo, in a hunt that would take them the better part of a decade. Finally, in the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231019\"&gt;1019&lt;/a&gt;, fifteen years after their quest had begun, they found the Lord of Terror in the lands of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. In a battle that nearly cost the Horadrim their lives, Diablo was defeated, and his spirit imprisoned. \nThe soulstone was hidden in a labyrinthine cave system near the &lt;a href=\"River%20Talsande\"&gt;River Talsande&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrael then appeared before the Horadrim a final time, commending them for their victory. He ordered that the site must be guarded for all time, lest the Lord of Terror someday walk among mankind once more. The Horadrim thus built a &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;small monastery&lt;/a&gt; and a system of catacombs within the caves. \nThe hunt was over.\nLegacy.\nAs the generations passed in Khanduras, the Horadrim diminished in number. With no quests to undertake, and too few sons to replenish their number, the Horadric order faded into obscurity, Their greatest fear was that the three Prime Evils would one day reunite. However, they took squabbling among themselves over petty differences, leading to the dissolution of their brotherhood.\nThe Horadrim's fear was well founded, as each of the Primes returned to wreak havoc on the mortal world. Mephisto was able to corrupt the Zakarum faith from within, subverting their guardianship over his soulstone. In the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo returned to the world of Men, eventually taking &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt; as his host and departing east to reunite with his brothers. This included Baal, still wearing the guise of Tal Rasha his powers increased thanks to his host. It was only thanks to a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; that their plans to corrupt the Worldstone and retake their place in Hell were thwarted, though not without cost, as the Worldstone itself was destroyed.\nEven now, the legacy of the Dark Exile endures. Today, the areas most tainted by the Prime Evils' arrival in the mortal realm are the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the desert regions of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, and the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. Unnatural and evil forces influence most, if not all, of Sanctuary's native creatures to at least some degree. Lairs of demonic nobility remain in the land, and the sight of these creatures assisting Hell's minions grows more common as one nears these lairs.\nThe events of the Dark Exile have been written on extensively, including works such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile%20Scrolls\"&gt;Dark Exile Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Librarius%20Ex%20Horadrim\"&gt;Librarius Ex Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;\", and the \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Cain%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Book of Cain&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Geherit noted that it was, by Ymuthrus's standards, generous.\nLater, Zatham returned to the Cradle in the company of &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;. Zatham attacked Ymuthrus, but was blasted away. Geherit advocated mercy, and asked Ymuthrus to entrust Zatham and the newcomer to her, so she could evaluate their claims. Ymuthrus agreed, but told her that whatever harm they brought would be inflicted on her tenfold. Geherit agreed to his terms, and asked Zatham and the Shard-seeker to follow her. She asked Zatham why he couldn't have held his grieviances inside, to which Zatham bitterly responded that this was how rot spread; unwillingness to speak its name.\nOutside &lt;a href=\"Exiles%27%20Repose\"&gt;Exiles' Repose&lt;/a&gt;, Geherit and Zatham discussed the situation. She pointed out that only Ymuthrus had taken Zatham's sight, not his fellow elders. Zatham responded that Ymuthrus was the worst of them, and emblematic of the rot that had taken the Inari. Geherit told him to save his anger for the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, and led them into &lt;a href=\"the%20Veiled%20Spring\"&gt;the Veiled Spring&lt;/a&gt;. Zatham told her that they had the Pathstone, which meant they could use it to reinforce the &lt;a href=\"Husk%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Husk of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. With that, Ymuthrus would see their worth. However, the time the Pathstone had spent away from the Cradle had unblanaced it. To use it, they had to restore its equilibrium. The Pathstone was given to the Shard-seeker, and she ordered them to take it to &lt;a href=\"Shieldholm\"&gt;Shieldholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shard-seeker returned after charging the Pathstone with the Father's Legacy. Geherit was overjoyed, and commented that with the Mother's Legacy, the Ancients' Cradle could be reforged. Zatham joined them after a short while. After they caught up on each other's progress, Geherit offered to peer into the spring for a vision of the cult's activities. The spring revealed a vision of the &lt;a href=\"Bride%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Bride of Hell&lt;/a&gt; with the shard at the &lt;a href=\"Husk%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Husk of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. After she told her companions of her vision, the Shard-seeker left for Lilith's shrine with renewed haste, while Zatham promised to do his best to delay the cult.\nZatham returned to the Veiled Spring with cultists. Together, they defeated Geherit and destroyed the spring. However, Zatham spared her, and left her trapped beneath rubble. The Shard-seeker later returned with &lt;a href=\"Tarzoine\"&gt;Tarzoine&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nGeherit is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

These precious stones embody innate magical abilities. When set into a &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed item, these gems can add powerful magic effects. Higher grades of gems have stronger effects.\nDiablo II.\nGem effects are stackable, e.g. If you place 3 gems of the same type in a sword, you will receive the bonus of all three. The first gem that is placed will determine the color of the weapon.\nThey can only be obtained by killing monsters, opening &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; or using a Gem Shrine with no other gem in your inventory. Vendors do not normally sell gems, though if another player in a multiplayer game sells a gem to a vendor, you may be able to buy it. Vendors also will not typically pay you full price for socketed items.\nOnce inserted, gems cannot be removed from a socket, although they can be destroyed via a &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; recipe. The skulls of some demonic creatures, inscribed with eldritch symbols, are said to work much like gems. They were introduced to showcase the socketing system, which was expanded in the Lord of Destruction with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jewels\"&gt;Jewels&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are six types of gems, plus skulls, which are considered by the game to be gems for all purposes:\nThey come in five levels of increasing quality, which also determines their sell price to vendors:\nYou can upgrade gems by using a &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Gem Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, with a gem in your inventory, or by using the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;. You can use the Horadric Cube to convert gems into higher quality gems. Place 3 gems of one type into the Horadric Cube and click the Transmute button.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", there are five standard types of gems, and ten levels of gem quality with increasing power. Gems only grant their benefits when they are &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed into equipped items, which can be done in the &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt; Screen at any time. Each type of gem grants specific bonuses when &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed into a Helm / Weapon / other gear (\"Armor\"), as follows:\nOf the seven gem types from the previous game, only &lt;a href=\"Sapphire\"&gt;Sapphire&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Skull\"&gt;Skull&lt;/a&gt;s did not return, although Diamonds were only added for the expansion. \"Diablo III\" did not introduce any new standard gem types/colors, although the expansion added &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt;s as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Shen\"&gt;Covetous Shen&lt;/a&gt; the Jeweler can remove gems from sockets for free. If the socketed item is no longer needed, &lt;a href=\"salvage\"&gt;salvaging&lt;/a&gt; it also removes all gems and returns them to the inventory. Gems can be upgraded at the Jeweler by combining two or three lower quality gems to form the next higher quality, for a fee.\nAside from being socketed into items, non-Legendary gems have two other uses:\n doubles the effectiveness of the non-Legendary gem socketed in it - or in the player's current &lt;a href=\"Helm\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, if the power is selected in &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining gems.\nGems can be found randomly from most monsters and containers, but especially from &lt;a href=\"Gem%20Hoarder\"&gt;Gem Hoarder&lt;/a&gt; Treasure Goblins who drop gems instead of gold, in &lt;a href=\"Diabolic%20Hoard\"&gt;Diabolic Hoard&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whimsydale\"&gt;Whimsydale&lt;/a&gt; special zones. Picking up a gem also picks up all other gems of any type within 20 yards.\nThe quality of gems dropped as loot is based on &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;character level&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;game difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. At level 61+ in &lt;a href=\"Master%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; difficulty and above, Imperial gems have a chance to drop and the rest are Marquise quality. Levels above Imperial do not drop and must be achieved through upgrading at the Jeweler. Crafting Imperial gems requires Shen to be level 11+, thus Marquise gems are the highest quality available without \"\", since the higher level requirements of both the character and the Jeweler are beyond the limits of the base game.\nAll gems of Marquise quality and above are account-bound, regardless of if they were dropped or crafted. \"All\" gems are account-bound for &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;al characters. \nThese mechanisms can also help attain desired gems:\nUpgrading.\nCovetous Shen charges a &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; fee to craft any gem, in addition to two (up to Square) or three (above Square) gems of the next lower quality tier. Shen must also be leveled up sufficiently for each tier. The final two tiers (Royal gems) also require one , and require a recipe to be found for each gem to train Shen how to craft it - two qualities of each of the five gem types, ten recipes total.\nThe following table shows the required materials to upgrade to each gem quality level. It also shows the cumulative cost to upgrade up to each level, assuming starting with Regular (Reg), Marquise (Mrq) or Imperial (Imp) gems - the lowest or highest qualities that can drop as loot, respectively.\nLegendary Gems.\nLegendary Gems are pre-designed socketable &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt;, each of which has two unique Legendary powers and does not fit any of the standard gem types. Compared to the previous game, they have the multi-faceted and complex nature of &lt;a href=\"Jewels\"&gt;Jewels&lt;/a&gt;, and the non-randomness and variety of &lt;a href=\"Rune\"&gt;Rune&lt;/a&gt;s. They are only socketable in &lt;a href=\"amulets\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rings\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, with a couple niche-use exceptions, and like other Legendaries are unique-equipped (two of the same cannot be used together). They drop at the end of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s (with a couple exceptions), where they can also be upgraded to improve the first power and unlock the second. They are powerful enough that any end-game &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; will always want to use the maximum of three Legendary Gems in jewelry sockets.\nDiablo Immortal.\nGems in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" are divided into Normal and Legendary gems. Normal Gems are categorized quite differently from those of the other Diablo games, being divided into three colors with two gem types each:\nAs gems in the other games are meant to be \"distinct\" from each other by color, the latter gem in each pair appears only in \"Immortal\". &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Amethyst\"&gt;Amethyst&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Skull\"&gt;Skull&lt;/a&gt;s do not return from previous games, although some Vessels of the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Horadrim\"&gt;Legacy of the Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; system are reminiscent of them.\nAlso unique to \"Immortal\" is that each &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt; has one of the three colors, and gems can only go into matching sockets.\nDiablo IV.\nGems return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". As of \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Season of Blood&lt;/a&gt;\", they no longer take up inventory space.\nNormal Gems are available at Level 51, Flawless at 71, and Royal at 91. "}

Every time, she refused.\nMoon of the Spider.\nWith the passing of King Cornelius, &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt; was next in line. Many regarded Justinian as a weak heir, and wondered why Torion didn't seek the throne for himself. However, Torion had no desire to become king, and was loyal to Justinian, despite his misgivings.\nTorion visited Salene, requesting her political support for Justinian. The &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;Zayl&lt;/a&gt; was present, and quickly learnt two things\u2014that Torion hated his kind (per his insults), and, not spoken out loud, that he was in love with Salene. Salene assured Torion that she would support Justinian's ascension. Torion departed, but not before threatening Zayl.\nTorion was releived that Salene would vounch for Justinian, but was still concerned; it would be at least two days until Justinian could claim the throne, and the longer the issue dragged on, the harder it would be to maintain support. That, and he had little faith in Justinian himself. He headed to the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Palace\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Edmun%20Fairweather\"&gt;Edmun Fairweather&lt;/a&gt; directed him to the throne room. Finding Justinian waiting for him, he was taken aback by the youth's new regality. Justinian was aware of Torion's misgivings concerning his ability to rule, but nonetheless thanked him for his support. He quickly moved onto the issue of support among the nobility, and whether Westmarch's armies could be counted on if it came to it.\nTorion's confidence was shaken, however, when Justinian ordered that the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20City%20Guard\"&gt;City Guard&lt;/a&gt; be drawn back from the walls to maintain order within the city itself. He would have preferred that the walls remain manned. Nonetheless, he left the meeting with more confidence in his future king than he had previously possessed.\nIn-game.\nHe appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Act%20V%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".

He had blue eyes, one of which was damaged by a scar. He had a low opinion of the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Sardak%20Nesado\"&gt;Sardak Nesado&lt;/a&gt;, he had a penchant for dramatic entrances. He considered himself to be a man of action. He was interested in military history, but not of any other kind. While a capable military commander, he had no desire for rule from the throne, considering it an \"oppressive weight.\""}

In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, he was travelling east with &lt;a href=\"Warriv\"&gt;Warriv&lt;/a&gt; He was present in the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; lost their &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s roamed the forests as well as the monastery, he remained in the camp, providing services to a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to eventually reach &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt;, few, if any of the encampment's members had any love for him. Charsi trusted him to the extent that she was willing to let him hang onto her &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, unaware that Gheed was intentionally telling her of adventure so that she wouldn't notice how much money he was making by selling his wares to the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s. Many of the Rogues detested him, but Charsi's affection for him prevented &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt; from chucking him out.\nAt some point, Gheed lost his fortune. His daughter, &lt;a href=\"Kadala\"&gt;Kadala&lt;/a&gt;, considered him to be a \"great man.\"\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nGheed appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" as a character located in the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt;. He sells &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; and provides &lt;a href=\"gamble\"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt;. He's greedy, opportunistic, and cowardly. Most of the Rogues have no love for him (in the words of &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt;: \"Gheed is a pig. I was tempted to throw him out of the camp many times.\"), with &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt; being the only exception who takes comfort in Gheed. Gheed says he keeps &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi's&lt;/a&gt; prices low by filling her head with stories of adventurers and he is secretly raking in all the cash. Gheed bears a special hatred towards &lt;a href=\"Warriv\"&gt;Warriv&lt;/a&gt;, and will often make snide remarks about him. In \"\", a unique grand charm titled &lt;a href=\"Gheed%27s%20Fortune\"&gt;Gheed's Fortune&lt;/a&gt; derives its name from the NPC. It adds to the player's percent chance of finding magical items, increased gold drops, and reduced vendor prices.\nGheed also seems very wary of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; who shows up at the camp. It can be inferred that Gheed has encountered necromancers before, though it is unclear if his fear is derived from anything a necromancer did or simply a fear of his craft.\nAt one point, he also says he is going with &lt;a href=\"Warriv\"&gt;Warriv&lt;/a&gt;'s caravan to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, but does not appear there in Act II. He stays at the Rogue Camp, and if the player returns from a later Act, he would complain that he is unable to sell anything since the rogues started moving back into the monastery.\nDialogue.\nGossip about Gheed.\nSome of the other locals give their thoughts concerning Gheed.\nDiablo III.\nGheed does not appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", though his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Kadala\"&gt;Kadala&lt;/a&gt;, appears in the game's &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; in Reaper of Souls. She does not specify who her mother was, but states that her father 'was a great man... before he lost &lt;a href=\"Gheed%27s%20Fortune\"&gt;his fortune&lt;/a&gt;'. She also asks &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; if they had ever heard of Gheed, implying that he could have been quite famous across the land."}

Like all demons, he fought the forces of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. Ghom once devoured six angels in a single swallow - spears included.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Ghom was faced with a new enemy\u2014humanity, specifically those serving at &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. He was among Azmodan's forces that laid siege to the fortress. When Azmodan's infernal siege engines breached the Keep's walls, Ghom was sent forth to spearhead the assault from within the Keep. However, &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of Tyrael, defeated his minions on the way to the larder, and successfully dispatched the Lord of Gluttony, preventing Azmodan from achieving victory from below the keep. Before he died, however, Ghom had spoiled all of the fortress's stored food. Sister &lt;a href=\"Frances\"&gt;Frances&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20the%20Dying%20Sun\"&gt;Alliance of the Dying Sun&lt;/a&gt; wondered how the garrison would make it through the next season.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nGhom features as the first &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". He must be killed to stop the siege of &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe combat takes place in &lt;a href=\"The%20Larder\"&gt;The Larder&lt;/a&gt;, in a relatively large room with four indestructible pillars. There are no objects in it, save for the Half-Eaten Guard which drops a lore book called &lt;a href=\"Ghom%27s%20Log\"&gt;Ghom's Log&lt;/a&gt;. After passing the iron gate, the combat starts after a short cutscene.\nFor his size, the Lord of Gluttony moves surprisingly quickly, but his attacks (except for Gas Cloud) are very slow. Ghom has a total of four attacks:\nHaving a &lt;a href=\"Mara%27s%20Kaleidoscope%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Mara's Kaleidoscope&lt;/a&gt; equipped will trivialize the encounters with Ghom; the clouds are weak and, as mentioned above, do not stack if more clouds occupy the same location. It will add insult to injury when the poison \"heals\" &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; as the result of having equipped the above mentioned amulet.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, Ghom has a hard enrage timer of 4 minutes. Once the time is up, he no longer has a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; on his Gas cloud, and existing clouds no longer despawn. However, for an adequately geared player, most of the room (if not the entire room) will be filled with gas long before that timer expires, so positioning and slow retreating from Ghom is advised if defenses are not up to par. However, since his damage does not increase, it is still possible to kill him after the enrage.\n&lt;a href=\"Voracity\"&gt;Voracity&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; variant of Ghom.\nThe Foul Desecrator, Gaping Maw of Hell is a Uber variant of Ghom, only encountered during the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Machine\"&gt;Infernal Machine&lt;/a&gt; event.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Stomach\"&gt;The Stomach&lt;/a&gt; is a non-combat pet (modeled after Ghom) available to players.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", Ghom appears as a stylized print on the back of &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric%23Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt;'s suit in his \"Toxic Janitor\" skin.\nPersonality and Traits.\n\"Lord of Gluttony\" is a title Ghom lives up to. Ghom's hunger is his signature weapon. He has four mouths: one (largest) on his torso, two that act as a pair of spaulders and, apparently, one more under his helmet on his head. Whenever he speaks, flatulences and licking of lips are heard. He attacks with a rather foul smelling gas, a putrid vomit attack and a bone crushing snap bite, but according to Deckard Cain, he also uses his bile and 'other substances' in combat. Ghom is also very sadistic, even for a demon, as he prefers eating his victims alive, tearing the flesh from their bones very slowly, and likes humans to be served to him purposefully overfed ('stuffed', as Ghom himself calls it) with the fresh meat of their dead comrades."}

While not unique in their size (other spiders in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; have reached similar proportions), they \"are\" unique in their levels of intelligence (though are still basically animalistic). They have earned the moniker of \"Evil Spiders\" due to their cunning and cruelty These spiders owe their origins to giant spiders in &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, which were changed by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, causing them to seek meals of the human variety. They slash with their &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swordlike&lt;/a&gt; mandibles (which secrete a virulant poison), delighting in sucking the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of their prey, and using the carcass as an incubator for their young. They hunt by crawling on the ceiling of man-made structures, spinning and dropping sticky webs on anyone unfortunate enough to be below. They are immune to poison themselves.\nOne of the most deadly of these spiders, the Poison Spinner, is found not far from the city of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. Even in their largest forms, the giant arachnids had never been much of a problem for the inhabitants of the tropical forests. These creatures are highly poisonous and generally have fatal bites.\nIn-game.\nGiant Spiders are encountered in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". They have four varieties: &lt;a href=\"Arach\"&gt;Arach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Spinner\"&gt;Poison Spinner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Spider\"&gt;Flame Spider&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Magus\"&gt;Spider Magus&lt;/a&gt;. \nSpiders &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Web\"&gt;Spin Web&lt;/a&gt;s when retreating and have 50% faster health regeneration than normal monsters. They are also unique in that they will rarely attack unless provoked. It will only take minor damage, however, to make them hostile.\nA &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super-Unique&lt;/a&gt; Flame Spider is &lt;a href=\"Sszark%20the%20Burning\"&gt;Sszark the Burning&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nThere is an unused animated graphic named \"spider_goo_neutral\". There is no projectile connected with it which suggests that Giant Spiders were planned to leave pools of caustic acid upon death like the &lt;a href=\"Spitting%20Terror\"&gt;Spitting Terrors&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;. There is an unused monster missile property named Acid which would destroy the armor class and durability of items, it's plausible that this goo would work like that."}

It is &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Account\"&gt;account bound&lt;/a&gt; as soon as it drops.\nAcquisition.\nThe Gemstone drops from &lt;a href=\"Chiltara\"&gt;Chiltara&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lacuni%20Huntress\"&gt;Lacuni Huntress&lt;/a&gt; who sometimes spawns in Level 2 of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Caverns of Frost&lt;/a&gt;. The Caverns are located under the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Slaughter\"&gt;Fields of Slaughter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt;, most easily accessed via the &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge%20of%20Korsikk\"&gt;The Bridge of Korsikk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; just to the south. They are a guaranteed mutually exclusive shared spawn with the &lt;a href=\"Icefall%20Caves\"&gt;Icefall Caves&lt;/a&gt; - one or the other will always appear in a given game session, but not both.\nThe dungeon, the monster, and the item each have a chance not to appear, so repeated attempts to find the Gemstone are almost always needed. Gemstone drop rate from Chiltara has been estimated at around 5%. Chiltara herself was initially a fairly rare spawn, but &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0.5%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.0.5&lt;/a&gt; increased the rate to around 50%. The Caverns of Frost unfortunately seem to be somewhat less common than the Icefall Caves alternative.\nThe caves can spawn in any of several possible locations on the map. They share the same set of possible locations with the ballistae for the quest, even if the quest is completed, in which case the ballistae locations will just be empty. In Adventure Mode, the ballistae will always be present.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; is recommended to hunt for the gem - the waypoints are the same, there is no distraction from quests or NPCs, and the Act III &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; often provide a clue as to which cave dungeon is available before actually visiting the zone. Specifically, if one is offered to kill Chiltara or clear the Caverns of Frost, then the zone is obviously present and worth clearing. Even better, map navigation arrows lead directly to the Caverns entrance in this case. On the other hand, if the task is to clear the Icefall Caves or complete &lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Glacier\"&gt;The Cursed Glacier&lt;/a&gt; which occurs there, then the correct Caverns are not present, and the game can be restarted immediately. \nPlayers who do choose to search for the stone in &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt; can select the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Machines%20of%20War\"&gt;Machines of War&lt;/a&gt;\" or later in Act III."}

She was one of the few to survive the nightmares of the town, but at heavy cost.\nBiography.\nEarly Life.\nGillian grew up in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Canace\"&gt;Canace&lt;/a&gt;. In her youth, she played with &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain%20%28The%20Order%29\"&gt;Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt;. She grew up hearing various stories, such as that of the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20of%20Fury\"&gt;Anvil of Fury&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt;'s father and boys discussing the tale of the &lt;a href=\"Arkaine%27s%20Valor%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arkaine\"&gt;Arkaine&lt;/a&gt;. Her mother died prior to the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; spoke at her funeral.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nDuring the Darkening of Tristram, Gillian was in her late teens. A shadow fell over &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt; and he began behaving erratically, terrorizing his people and launching an ill advised war against &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. In the midst of this, his son, Prince &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt; disapeared, which sent him into a rage, and spurring his remaining &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Khanduras\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; to turn against him. Gillian was unaware of the &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt; of the one who slew the king, but heard of his death regardless. She was saddened by the event, and tried to remember Leoric for the man he once was.\nLazarus led the townsfolk into the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to find Albrecht. Few returned, as they were set upon by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Canace passed away after her son &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt;'s injuries, inflicted in the depths of the cathedral. Gillian believed that Canace died from a broken heart due to the adverse effects the experience had on Wirt's personality. &lt;a href=\"Farnham\"&gt;Farnham&lt;/a&gt; mentioned something about a &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Butcher&lt;/a&gt; killing people, but she discounted it. Nonetheless, conditions worsened. and Gillian suffered from horrific nightmares, due to the &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt; that had taken root beneath the cathedral.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Garda\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; gave her a job and residence (along with her grandmother) at the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;Tavern of the Rising Sun&lt;/a&gt;, paying her a few &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; pieces. Gillian took on a fair share of the work, which ran through the daylight hours. She was very grateful for their generosity, however, and hoped that one day she could leave and help them start a grand hotel in the East. However, her grandmother was too ill to travel, so she was committed to remaining in Tristram. Ogden begged her to leave, telling her that she would look after Gillian's grandmother, but she refused to do so.\nGillian's grandmother had a dream that a &lt;a href=\"classes%23Diablo\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; would appear before her during the Darkening of Tristram. This came to pass as Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; heroes would be the trinity that defeated Diablo, who had been responsible for the horrors that had afflicted Tristram.\nInto the East.\nAfter Diablo's defeat, Ogden and Garda offered to let Gillian and her grandmother stay with them. She considered the proposal, and was inclined to take the offer. However, she was still afflicted by nightmares. She hoped they would fade, but they seemed to be getting stronger. She ended up refusing Ogden's offer and traveled with the &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. It saddened her to leave Ogden and Garda, but Adria assured her that she would find a cure for her nightmares.\nGillian's departure with Adria saved her life, as not long after their departure, Tristram was sacked by demons, its inhabitants butchered. In Caldeum, Adria gave birth to a girl, which she named &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;. The infant was left in Gillian's care, and after casting a protective spell around Gillian's new home, Adria departed on a mysterious errand.\nWhispers of Madness.\nGillian raised Leah as her daughter, Leah believing that Gillian was her biological mother. Gillian refused to talk about her father. Like Gillian, Leah experienced numerous dreams, and Gillian warned her not to confuse them with reality. The two were originally close, and Gillian would take Leah with her into the market, and buy her the occasional treat. Over the years however, Gillian's mind began to slip due to the horrors she had experienced in Tristram. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;Eight years&lt;/a&gt; after Tristram's destruction however, Gillian, in Leah's view, had slipped even further into madness. Coming home one day, Leah watched as her 'mother' seemed to talk as if other individuals were present, whispering of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;restless dead&lt;/a&gt; and demons.\nThe same night, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; arrived at &lt;a href=\"Gillian%27s%20Residence\"&gt;Gillian's Residence&lt;/a&gt;. Cain voiced his fears of a coming invasion from &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;, but Gillian couldn't take it, letting her frustrations boil over. She confessed that she feared Leah, even more than she'd feared Adria back in Tristram.\nIn-game.\nDiablo.\nGillian is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\". She is not directly related to any quests, nor does she provide services.\nShe has many kind things to say about a couple of the inhabitants of Tristram, especially &lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt;. She is wary of &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt; has a crush on her in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;, as he reveals to the Hero that he would like to take Gillian away with him when he leaves the town, as well as 'showering gold and riches' upon her. He also mentions a secret project that requires 'a great deal of gold' to the Hero; whether this means setting Gillian up for life or financing some other scheme is not revealed. Sadly, Wirt is killed in Diablo II and is not able to reach this lofty goal. Gillian, on the other hand, while sympathizing with Wirt's previous traumatic experiences, only sees Wirt as \"a mean spirited youngster,\" but harbors memories of Wirt's deceased mother, &lt;a href=\"Canace\"&gt;Canace&lt;/a&gt;, as they grew up together.\nGillian also states that she would love to repay &lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt; and his wife for their kindness for taking her and her ailing grandmother in and letting her work at the inn by helping them to set up a grand hotel in the East, should the opportunity ever arise.\nDiablo III.\nGillian's &lt;a href=\"Gillian%27s%20Diary\"&gt;diary&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Act%20I%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;first act&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nGillian gossiped a lot about her fellow townspeople. She was highly regarded by her fellow townspeople for her kind spirit and beauty. After the Darkening of Tristram however, her mood darkened, and she was prone to bouts of madness as a result to her exposure to the horrors Diablo had unleashed. It took a physical toll on her as well\u2014she appeared to age faster than she should have normally, and her hair turned gray and brittle, her eyes haunted and bruised. In Cain's mind, she carried an 'air of neglect' around her, as if barely able to take care of herself."}

It should be remembered that the cold damage Gleamscythe does give is very small; the only use it has is to temporarily slow enemies.

Therefore, this, plus the fair boost to mana, are just two ways that a spellcaster could effectively utilize Gleamscythe better than a physical fighter. But no matter what use its put to, Gleamscythe is still relatively low level, and is overshadowed by other, more powerful unique &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt;.\nStats.\nOne-Hand Damage: (14-18) To (27-34)\nRequired Level: 13\nRequired Strength: 33\nDurability: 32\nSword Class - "}

{"id": "3182", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3182", "title": "Gold", "text": "Gold is the currency in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;\"Diablo\"&lt;/a&gt; series. Prices of items and repairs are expressed in gold generally. However, gold is virtually worthless when trading with other players, where items are valued much higher.\nLore.\nGold has long served as the monetary means of trade in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. This precious metal is melted into small gold slugs that are flattened and stamped with the heraldry of the kingdom that created it. Regardless of shape and size, the amount of gold per coin is consistent throughout the realms. Before gold coins were accepted as the universal currency, the wealthy fashioned\ngemstones and precious metals into jewelry in order to display their riches to others.\nDuring the long reign of peace that existed in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, most &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s and cities agreed upon a standard gold coin to use in trade. The Church of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; has tried to have its own currency accepted as the new standard, but so far it has gained little acceptance. Although it would seem that &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s have no use for gold coins, many demons hoard all the wealth they can find.\n&lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s have spent their lives trying to transmutate base metals into gold.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nGold is represented at its most limiting form in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\". Used for buying potions, scrolls, gear, and other items, just like it would be in its sequel and its expansion, gold is something sought out for until a certain amount is achieved. Unlike later installments in the series, however, gold itself takes up inventory at the rate of 5000 gold per 1 box, leading to a frustrating decision for the player to make; should they hoard gold at the expense of having to go to town earlier just to pawn items, or should they only go with the essential amount for repairs. At the end, the second option is more favorable; the player eventually reaches a point where &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt; will not be able to offer up gear that is an upgrade to their own. As such, endgame players only need enough gold to cover the costs of potions and item status.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;\" did very little about gold's effects on a hero's inventory. Only one way exists to lessen the burden of gold, and even then, a player must sacrifice a good amulet to utilize that one way. When you use the Rune Bomb on the entrance to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nest\"&gt;the Nest&lt;/a&gt;, return to &lt;a href=\"Lester%20the%20Farmer\"&gt;Lester the Farmer&lt;/a&gt;, and he will drop the &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Amulet\"&gt;Auric Amulet&lt;/a&gt;. This allows you to double gold capacity per 1 box of inventory, at the cost of the Amulet slot.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", characters can carry 10,000 gold per level. For example, a 10th-level character can carry up to 100,000 gold; a level 99 character can carry 990,000 gold. The maximum amount of gold a character can carry with stash is 3,490,000, at level 99. Gold does not share space with items or weapons in the backpack as it did in \"Diablo I\".\nIf killed, characters lose a percentage of the total gold both carried and stored in the Stash. This percentage is equal to your character's level but will not exceed 20%. After this 'death penalty' is deducted, the remaining gold your character was carrying falls to the ground in a pile. If the penalty exceeds the amount of gold you were carrying, the remainder of the penalty is deducted from your Stash.\nIn singleplayer, dying will not deplete your entire gold supply. No gold is lost from your stash, and 500 gold per character level is exempt from the death penalty. For example, if a 10th level Single-Player character with 5,000 gold dies, he will lose no gold.\nIn terms of player-to-player interaction, the value of gold is much lower than items and socketable items. This is because other players are also able to generate gold easily by killing monsters and selling items.\nDiablo Immortal.\nGold returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo III.\nGold returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", with exactly the same functions it had in the earlier installments of the series. Prior to March 18th of 2014, players were able to spend gold in the game's Gold &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; for weaponry, materials, and other items. However, there are certain items that Bind to Account on Acquire. These items are not allowed trading priviledges, Auction House or otherwise.\nGold (much like &lt;a href=\"stash\"&gt;stash&lt;/a&gt;) is shared among all characters of the same type on account (&lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;al characters having their own reserves, separate from normal characters). There is no limit on the maximum amount of gold an account can have.\nAs far as the values of items go at in-game vendors, the item's resale value is 1/25th of its buying price; an item that costs 500 in gold to buy from a vendor, if the player were to try to sell it, would refund 20 in gold for the exchange.\nAs a first for the series, gold can be picked up simply by walking over to the drop. A player can pick up gold from further distances by finding equipment that gives him/her an increase in pickup radius. And much like in Diablo II/Lord of Destruction, players can increase gold quantity by finding items that give a % increase in Gold Find.\nMuch like in \"Diablo II\", gold is not very valuable in player/player interactions. The costs of repairing one's equipment also seem to have gone down with the 2 decades of time between Lord of Destruction and Diablo III: for one death alone, even at the level cap, it would be considered expensive if the costs broke 6000 gold just from the death, with many ways to reduce that amount or even &lt;a href=\"Spaulders%20of%20Zakara\"&gt;remove it completely&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the player's gold will go to &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; services, &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gem\"&gt;Gem&lt;/a&gt; upgrades and (least of all) on crafting new items.\nAs of patch 2.0.5., Gold Find multiplicatively stacks with Gold Find bonus from &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Patch 2.1, a special gold counter has been added: it shows the total amount of Gold obtained in a streak, and resets 5 seconds after picking up no gold.\nPlayers in need of vast amounts of gold might want to visit the &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Realm\"&gt;Treasure Realm&lt;/a&gt;, which offers the highest yield of money in game.\nVisually, the gold pile appearance changes depending on the amount it contains, larger piles including gold bars and jewelry in addition to coins.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shards\"&gt;Blood Shards&lt;/a&gt; are an alternate currency, displayed next to the gold counter.\nAs of patch 2.4, cosmetic and non-combat &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; pick up the gold for the player. This patch also added an alternate use for gold: it can be spent prior to starting a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt; to grant a fourth attempt to upgrade &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt; upon successful completion.\nAs of patch 2.6.10, the Gold Pickup radius can be increased by up to 5 yards with &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; points.\nDiablo IV.\nGold returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOther items used as money/currency.\nPlayers tend to use Perfect Gems as very valuable currency. These items are useful in many ways - most notably for &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; combinations and &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed weapons and armor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Jordan%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Stone of Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, considered by many players as the best available ring in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", was often duplicated and hacked. It lost its former value and was used like money, as players often had many of these \"rare\" rings in their inventories. Eventually, they became incredibly numerous - and worthless. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; included in a few uses for this ring with the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"World%20Event\"&gt;World Event&lt;/a&gt;\" to encourage players to use their Stones of Jordan to get rid of large amounts of these items from player inventories.\nIn \"Diablo III\" before the expansion, it was a common practice to pay with &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s, as those had fixed value in game."}

While he was an adequate ruler of the town in times of peace, his bravery proved to be quite lacking when the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt; hit the old &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; began to rise to attack the town.\nThe Mayor, fearing for his life, tried to flee the town and take his broken cart with him, regardless of the blockage it caused. He claimed that the town was doomed and that anyone with a grain of sense would flee. His cowardice disgusted both the townsfolk and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, who refused to help him. Eventually, the townsfolk dragged his cart aside, leaving him to wallow in his despair before fleeing.\nMaking his living as a merchant once again, Holus made his way to Bastion's Keep, only to find the fortress under siege by &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Here, he encountered The Nephalem again. Certain that if he stayed he would be slaughtered, he offered to pay the Nephalem anything if it would gain him an escort to safety. The Nephalem refused, and continued to do so as the siege progressed. Eventually, Holus rationalized that it was perhaps safer to stay and, if it came to it, fight. The Nephalem was taken by surprise by his change in attitude, surprised again when it was discovered that Holus had indeed stayed. As Holus stated, while he wasn't brave, he wasn't a liar.\nThe siege was thrown back and the demons defeated. However, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; turned on the keep's defenders, killing many of them. Holus stood his ground and fought, a defiance which cost him his life.\nIn-game.\nHolus is encountered as an &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; throughout \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn , Holus is designated as \"Mayor Holus,\" and can be found blocking the way into the rest of the town with his personal belongings in a cart. After the player visits the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, his cart will be removed from the road, permitting the player to explore the rest of the town.\nUpon arriving in &lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt;, he can be found inside of &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt; once again cowering for his life. His name also slightly changes, gaining the title of \"Former Mayor.\" Through the act, he will often give foresight into the oncoming quest, and the hero will encourage him to be a braver man.\nImmediately after beginning &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt;, if the player returns to Bastion's Keep, they can find his corpse in his previous location. A nearby guard will explain how he stood his ground till the very end."}

This removes the need for players to pursue a resistance stat that very few monsters use, but which some do, such as &lt;a href=\"Raiziel\"&gt;Raiziel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as attacks from other players in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll Holy skills also &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;destroy corpses&lt;/a&gt; of slain enemies, which for any other damage type only happens if killed by a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;. Holy skills cause the target to vanish in the flash of bright light, leaving nothing behind as if they were vaporized completely. However, this is is suppressed if there are reanimator monsters nearby.\nHoly damage does not have any special effect against the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s, or any other \"dark magic\".

This is an improvement over the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Bolt%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;original spell&lt;/a&gt;, which could only do damage.\nUnfortunately, its power is effective only against enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; subtype. While there is no shortage of Undead or Demon enemies on which this skill can be unleashed, it does not possess the raw damage potential of other skills (although this is compensated by completely ignoring enemies'\u00a0&lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;). However, it is effective if you can get enemies lined up or you utilize chokepoints.

During this time, &lt;a href=\"Cathan\"&gt;Cathan&lt;/a&gt;, a devout priest who was also a fierce warrior, found that by invoking the powers of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and then infusing them with the essence of Fire, a bolt of great speed and intensity could be created and used by those otherwise untrained in the use of magic.

Particularly devout Paladins can channel their faith into their shields, bolstering its defensive value with holy energy. The purer his faith, the greater his defense.\"\nGeneral Information.\nOne of the Paladin's most important and often-used skills, Holy Shield greatly increases a user's chance to &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; damage, and total &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Defense&lt;/a&gt; from all sources, including &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.

It costs a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; and, at lower levels, the duration isn't very long; however, more points allocated in this skill will increase its duration and power, effectively making it a passive enhancement.\nThe defense increase listed for this skill multiplies the total Defense the user has, not just that of the shield.\nThe skill effect still remains active even if weapons are swapped. Therefore, if the user's secondary set has better bonuses to Combat Skills and/or Holy Shield, he/she can activate Holy Shield with that set and then swap back to their main set with a better enhancement to their shield than one would have earned by casting the skill using your primary equipment.\nHoly Shield effectively lowers the effectiveness of the &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; Aura, which only activates when foes successfully hit users.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 35"}

Divine bolts spring from the earth to smite the Paladin's enemies.\"\nGeneral Information.\nAlthough the minimum damage of Holy Shock is low, it has the highest maximum and average damage out of the three pulse damage auras. Players investing heavily in this skill and its synergies can often simply walk by crowds of enemies and watch them all die without lifting a finger in &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.

Aura deals double damage at melee range and linearly scales to normal damage at maximum range. The displayed maximum Area Damage value incorporates the maximum proximity damage bonus.\nThere are also a few &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; that give this Aura, including the &lt;a href=\"runeword\"&gt;runeword&lt;/a&gt; ."}

It is given to players after completing all five bounties of an act. It contains random loot that is scaled to the level of the player at the time it was acquired.\u00a0It can contain\u00a0&lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Breath\"&gt;Death's Breath&lt;/a&gt; (added in patch 2.6.5\n), crafting ingredients, &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;ing plans (guaranteed to have at least two suitable for level),\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;. When clicked on, the Cache will disappear, dropping its contents on the ground near the character.\nThe item level of its contents are determined when it is acquired, but the item stats are not determined until the cache is opened. For example, if a level 70 &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; acquires a cache, and a level 60 &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; opens it, the loot will roll at level 70, but &lt;a href=\"Smart%20Loot\"&gt;Smart Loot&lt;/a&gt; will roll stats of the Witch Doctor.\nThe items within depend on character level and &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; at the moment the cache is obtained. The chances to drop and amounts of dropped legendary items, crafting materials and Blood Shards increase with each difficulty. At &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; VI, there is a guaranteed drop of a Legendary item, although it can only be one of the Cache-specific items (see below). At T9 and T10, there is a 20% and 50% chance to get two Legendary items. The chance further increases to 65%, 80% and 100% at T11, T12 and T13 respectively. As of 2.5.0, the chance was further increased (roughly by half) to compensate the merging of smaller Caches.\n&lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt;-only legendary items (including the legendary &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;) can only drop from the cache if that cache was obtained on Torment I or above.\nAct-Specific Drops.\nThere are many items that can only be obtained from Horadric Caches in a specific act, although\u00a0\u00a0caches can drop items from any other act (and do not have their own exclusive items).\nItems from Act I are themed after &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, Act II items are from vaults of the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt;, Act III items are the seven sins in form of items from the stash of &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;, and Act V items are the artifacts of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;. All these items have special, sometimes irreplaceable affixes, and can drop as early as at level 12.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s have the class-specific Legendary items among the ones listed below.\nEach Horadric Cache obtained at level 70 is also guaranteed to have the corresponding &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Material\"&gt;Crafting Material&lt;/a&gt; (last entry in each section). Drop rates depend on &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; at which the Cache was acquired:\n\"Note: before the 2.5.0 buff, each cache contained half the materials listed\"\nAct IV.\nAct IV Horadric Caches do not have any exclusive loot except the Legendary crafting material, but they do drop the act-specific Legendary items that can be found in any other act, selected randomly.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally, Horadric Caches were given to players after completing individual bounties.\nPrior to patch 2.5.0, if Bonus Act bounties were completed, two Caches dropped, although the second Cache had reduced chances to contain Legendary items (but still guaranteed materials, gold, and recipes). In 2.5.0, bonus acts in Bounties were removed: bonus Caches previously granted by the old system have instead been combined with the base Horadric Cache to form Large Horadric Chests. These are granted after completing a full set of five Bounties in any one Act and hold the total amount of materials and loot that previously would have been contained in the two separate caches. This was done so that players can complete whichever Acts they prefer in any order without feeling forced to complete all twenty-five Bounties at once in specific order."}

However, it is known that the Cube stemmed from a &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;more powerful version&lt;/a&gt;. However, the original Cube was marred by dark methods and disastrous results, resulting in the order quickly determining that it was too dangerous for anyone to continue using. The Horadric Cube was then created in its stead.\nThe Horadric Cube operates via the principles of transmutation and alchemy. The Horadrim preserved important artifacts and equipment by separating them into the component parts for future use. By later utilizing these elements within the cube, they could reassemble the original item.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;Long after&lt;/a&gt; the time of the Horadrim, the cube was obtained by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; that pursued the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;.

The Horadric Cube functions by intimately binding the Prime Energies of the items stored within it. This is a highly specialized process that requires the use of certain items which \"resonate\" with each other.\nIt can also contain 12 slots worth of items, while only taking up 4 slots itself. Note that &lt;a href=\"charm\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt;s do not work while they are inside the cube.\nRecipes.\nYou can use the Horadric Cube's magical powers to Transmute items into a new item. Simply place the items into the Cube and click the Transmute button.\nThis includes and the recipes in the following list:\nNOTE: &lt;a href=\"ilvl\"&gt;ilvl&lt;/a&gt; = item level | clvl = &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;character level&lt;/a&gt;\nDevelopment.\nOriginally, the Cube was to be a quest-only item. The idea of using recipes to craft and store gear came up later."}

Place the Horadric Staff within the &lt;a href=\"orifice\"&gt;orifice&lt;/a&gt; and behold as the entrance to Tal Rasha's burial chamber is revealed, completing this convoluted quest. The Horadric Staff cannot be retrieved, so if you've been using it as a weapon, make sure that you have a new one. Regardless, be prepared for a fight against the &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;Act Boss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "138", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=138", "title": "Horadrim", "text": "The Brotherhood of the Horadrim, at times referred to as \"the Order,\" \"the Crusaders of Light,\" and the \"Horadric Order\" were an ancient brotherhood of &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s that were formed by the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; to combat the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; when they were &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;banished&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs decreed by Tyrael, the Order's most basic tenet is to stand for justice and light. An oath existed for the original Horadrim. Its symbol is a figure eight with an amber gemstone in the middle. However, it has been said that while the Horadrim were a powerful order, they were maybe too prideful.\nLore.\nOf the original group, every aspect of their dress was carefully chosen to augment their magic abilities. Many Horadric members wore crowns made of unearthly metals to reflect their status, and often these crowns were enchanted for superior protection. The greatest Horadric alchemists were able to brew &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s that permanently affected the drinker. The time of the Horadrim is considered to be the greatest age in &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and were the greatest group of mortal spellcasters the world has ever known. They were skilled enough to create torches that burn with an eternal flame and the use of &lt;a href=\"telekinesis\"&gt;telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; was but a small exercise for them. They also created &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt;s between their fortresses so that they could react quickly to any demonic incursion.\nHigh-ranking Horadric mages were mummified, and their tombs protected by spells. Horadric &lt;a href=\"mummy\"&gt;mummies&lt;/a&gt; were also created to protect the tombs. Certain Horadric funereal priests altered the bodies of their dead mages with magical and surgical techniques, often replacing body parts with those of animals. This was thought to augment their powers, and raise their status in the afterlife.\nThe original Horadrim order were known for hiding their meeting places in plain sight, in an area that people would least expect to find them. Such meeting places would be protected by a spell of concealment.\nThe Horadrim made efforts to record local legends, cautionary tales, and \"stories of the most twisted horror,\" in the hope that some innocents might be saved by their knowledge.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, the Horadrim made use of foot-soldiers, equipped with spears. By the time of the Horadrim's hunt for &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, they possessed a &lt;a href=\"Reanimated%20Vanguard\"&gt;vanguard&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to their scholars/mages.\nThe original Horadrim had a rank system. Known ranks (in ascending order) include the following:\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe Horadrim was formed by the archangel Tyrael in the wake of the Dark Exile, their members taken from the various mage clans of the East. Their membership was not selected due to any particular wisdom or reverence, but because they were the most likely to succeed in carrying out Tyrael's mission. The mage &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as their leader and Tyrael entrusted a trio of &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s to the order, each with the power to contain the essence of a Prime Evil. The mage &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; was entrusted with carrying the stones and using them to capture the demons.\nThe Hunt for the Three.\nThe Cube.\nAt the beginning of their hunt, the Horadrim realized they would need an artifact of immense power. Such an artifact came in the form of a device simply called \"the Cube.\" Designed by &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, the Horadrim agreed that it would be necessary if their hunt was to be successful. Believing they understood the dangers, the Horadrim forged the Cube over a period of weeks, as smiths hammered and &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s chanted, feeling their sanity slipping all the while. The Cube was completed, but was marred by the dark methods used to complete it, and disastrous results.\nFor an extended period of time, the Horadrim used the Cube as they hunted the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. In time, the Cube became the center of Horadric works. Every initiative or action required it, and those who survived its creation became increasingly haunted by its presence. Aware of the dangers of corruption, and of the Cube's marred design the Order determined that it was too dangerous for anyone to continue using it. That it had to be hidden from anyone, including them. Of all the Horadrim, only Kulle objected to the abandonment of the device. As such, they created the weaker &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; in its stead, and entrusted the first Cube to a secret organization of s on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, who kept it safe from everyone, including the rest of their tribe. Throughout the years, these Barbarians served as guardians over the Cube, keeping it safe from prying eyes and those who would use its powers for evil.\nSecuring a Legacy.\nAt some point during the Hunt for the Three, prior to their confrontation with Baal, the Horadrim's founding members imbued their &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"vessels\"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;. They imbued their memory, power, and accomplishments. While the Horadrim had conquered Sanctuary's greatest evils, they could not conquer &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. It was intended that the crystal pass on the original members' traits to future Horadrim. The Horadrim believed that their order would continue unbroken, its knowledge passing from one generation to the next.\nHatred and Destruction.\nThe first of the Prime Evils to be captured was Mephisto. Prior to this, the Horadrim had made a costly assault on the demon's &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20of%20Bone\"&gt;Fortress of Bone&lt;/a&gt;, succeeding only due to being imparted with the knowledge of magical &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt;ion. But regardless, they did battle with Mephisto, in or around one of the great urban centers of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. Mephisto was defeated and his essence was contained, but the fight cost many innocent lives, prompting the Horadrim to vow to avoid confronting a Prime Evil in a populated area.\nThe Horadrim built the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Tower\"&gt;Guardian Tower&lt;/a&gt; and entrusted Mephisto's soulstone to the emergent order of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;. An act that would have dire consequences centuries later...\nThe task of hunting the Primes was a daunting one, and the mages often lost the demons' trail before picking it up again. In time though, Diablo and Baal ventured across the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; to the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Emboldened by their success against Mephisto, the Horadrim engaged in hot pursuit. Aware of the Horadrim's pursuit, Baal took refuge inside the city of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; for three days, Tal Rasha ordering the Horadrim to wait so that no innocents would be caught in the crossfire. He then headed north into the desert for a few miles before the Horadrim, undeterred by the harsh environment, attacked him again. \nAccounts differ on what happened next. The main account states that during the fight, one of Baal's attacks shattered the sacred soulstone that was supposed to imprison him. Tal Rasha however, subdued the raging demon lord and, gathering the largest of the soulstone's shards, trapped Baal's destructive essence within it. Another states that it was Kulle's inability to properly handle the stone in battle that led to its breaking. In truth, the first account appears to have more weight, as Kulle and Tal Rasha jointly wielded the soulstone against Baal, but it was shattered. Baal fled, with Tal Rasha in pursuit, who engaged him in battle until Kulle and the rest of the Horadrim arrived. In a second, equally vicious battle, Baal was subdued, and sealed inside the fragment. Whatever the case, Baal was imprisoned, but the fragmented soulstone could not contain his essence forever, and there wasn't enough time to reformulate it.\nWhile accounts again differ as to whether it was Tal Rasha or Kulle who made the suggestion, the idea was put forward that a human body might be able to contain the demon's essence by fusing a shard to their body. Unfortunately, the host would be left to wrestle with the demon for all eternity. But an instant later, Tal Rasha stepped forward to volunteer. It was at this point that Tyrael appeared, leading the Horadrim to an old &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;burial chamber&lt;/a&gt;. A binding stone with &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s of containment was built, and Tal Rasha ordered his brethren to chain him to it. As the mages looked on in sorrow, Tyrael jammed the soulstone shard into Tal Rasha's heart, sealing his fate. Sorrowfully, the Horadrim sealed the chamber and departed.\nTerror's End.\nWith Tal Rasha's sacrifice, Jered Cain became leader of the Horadrim. He and his surviving brethren began their search for Diablo, following the trail of terror the demon lord left for nearly a decade. Their hunt took them into the western lands of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; where Diablo, along with a demonic army, was finally confronted and imprisoned within his soulstone. The stone was hidden in a labyrinthine cave system near the &lt;a href=\"River%20Talsande\"&gt;River Talsande&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrael, appearing before the Horadrim for a final time, commended them for their victory, but declared that Diablo's site would have to be guarded for all time. The remaining Horadrim built a &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;small monastery&lt;/a&gt; and a series of catacombs within the caves. It was within these catacombs that members of the Horadrim would also be interred.\nAfter the Hunt.\nTheir task complete, the Horadrim debated as to what the order should do now that their quest had been completed. Jered declared that records be kept. Rules of conduct were devised, and the rudimentary formalization of the order began in earnest. Some members returned to their homes while others continued to seek out evil in all its incarnations. For all intents and purposes however, the Horadrim as they once were, were no more. Once an order of warrior mages, they steadily made the transition to a society of stoic academics.\nMisc. Events.\nAt some point some Horadrim trekked up &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. They were never heard from again, though &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would later reflect that it was unlikely that they met their end at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the Horadrim fought a war against the &lt;a href=\"Viz-Jaq%27taar\"&gt;Viz-Jaq'taar&lt;/a&gt;. Kulle, who had since left the Horadrim, grudgingly aided them in the conflict.\nThe Hunt for Zoltun Kulle.\nAn exception to the Horadrim's shifting nature was the matter of Zoltun Kulle. Following Diablo's capture, he took leave of the order and returned to Kehjistan to pursue his studies of magic. Little of him was heard for years until reports reached the Horadrim that he had built an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; beneath the desert sands and had begun a number of strange experiments. Experiments that centered around an object called the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. The Horadrim believed that Kulle sought to duplicate the power of the soulstones and wield it for his own ends, an act that would draw the attention of Heaven and Hell and doom them all. They thus agreed to hunt the renegade down. Horadric &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s entered the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, but were struck down by Kulle, and resurrected as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; slaves.\nLater, the Horadrim entered Kulle's &lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;. They found traps waiting for them, but they still pressed on. However, they could not kill Kulle himself, as his experiments had granted him immortality, and his soul refused to leave the mortal plane. As such, the Horadrim separated his body, storing his blood at &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Assassin\"&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt; and sealing his body (head removed) in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. The Horadrim never recovered from the losses Kulle had forced them to bear, and they made an effort to expunge all of Kulle's knowledge from the world. However, the Horadrim had no means of destroying Kulle's archives, or even finding them all.\nFragmentation.\nAs the generations passed in Khanduras, the Horadrim diminished in number. With no quests to undertake, and too few sons to replenish their numbers, the Horadric order faded into obscurity; a fate not foreseen by any of its founders. Their greatest fear was that the three Prime Evils would one day reunite. However, they took squabbling among themselves over petty differences, leading to the dissolution of their brotherhood.\nIt was foretold that the Horadrim would rise again when Sanctuary needed it. By the thirteenth century however, only two Horadrim remained. &lt;a href=\"Aderes%20Cain\"&gt;Aderes Cain&lt;/a&gt; and her son, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard&lt;/a&gt;. One a storyteller, the other unbelieving of his heritage. Over time, he began to see the truth in the tales his mother had told him, but by then, it was too late. The Prime Evils arose, and while a new group of heroes (with Cain's help) were able to defeat them, it was not without great cost to the world. \nLegacy of the Horadrim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Iben%20Fahd\"&gt;Memory of Iben Fahd&lt;/a&gt; contacted and guided &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; to his &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Iben%20Fahd\"&gt;sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. It was there, Fahd explained, that the Horadrim had imparted their essence into the crystal in preparation for new Horadrim to follow them. The hero(es) engaged in a series of trials, as other Horadric memories were restored to the sanctum. In doing so, the aspirant's knowledge and power grew. The &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Memory of Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt; counted the Shard-seeker as being Horadrim themselves.\nLast of the Horadrim.\nThe principles of the order survived with the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and his adopted daughter &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; however, twenty years later, the Order appeared to cease to exist.\nReappearance.\nAfter the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrael refounded the Horadrim order. After perusing Deckard Cain's journals, Tyrael discovered the existence of a group of scholars calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. These reclusive scholars, based in Gea Kul, had dedicated their lives to the study of ancient and hidden Horadric texts. Tyrael recruited the First Ones, along with mages and warriors from other orders, to reform the Horadrim. They aided him in hiding the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, but were attacked shortly afterwards by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, former Archangel of Wisdom. Despite their efforts, many fell to the fallen &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;'s blades, and the soulstone was taken. &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;One of their number&lt;/a&gt; was sent to find Tyrael's &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; ally and aid in stopping the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy this time the group had also sent an expedition to the &lt;a href=\"Skovos%20Isles\"&gt;Skovos Isles&lt;/a&gt; which had failed to return. It also maintained a chapter in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, which advised its citizens to stay indoors in light of sightings of &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Bovine\"&gt;demonic bovines&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the defeat of Malthael, the Horadrim received word of a new evil that had stirred in the &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Moors\"&gt;Shrouded Moors&lt;/a&gt;, drawing in followers with unsettling desires. The Nephalem traveled to the Moors and entered the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, where they uncovered and defeated &lt;a href=\"Vidian\"&gt;Vidian&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Second Decline.\nThe new order of Horadrim quickly declined, and its numbers dwindled.\nDecades after their reformation, the Horadrim remained active, but only to a point. By the time of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;'s return to Sanctuary, the Horadrim had been reduced to \"mad old men talking to themselves, talking to graves, clutching their bottles as hard as they want to clutch their swords.\"\nKnown Artifacts.\nThe Horadrim gathered relics from the far reaches of the world. So many, in fact, that many were never identified. Within their monasteries, the Horadrim amassed treasures great and small. But as the Order was forgotten, so were its secrets.\nTomes and Literature.\nThe Horadrim compiled a vast deal of lore, but while the libraries of the East keep guard over many magical tomes, it is believed that much Horadric knowledge has been lost, though much was compiled by Deckard Cain. Known Horadric tomes include:\nKnown Members.\nThe First Order.\nThe first group of Horadrim were small in number, accounts differing as to whether that number was seven or twelve (both may be correct if one includes escorts and apprentices among the tally). The \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile%20Scrolls\"&gt;Dark Exile Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\" mentions ten Horadrim in the original group, and mentions blacksmiths being part of the group. The tally does not count the Horadrim's foot-soldiers.\nOriginal Group.\nAll these Horadrim formed the core of the original group, and took part in the Hunt for the Three. It does not include &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; (a founder of the Horadrim, but not a member himself) nor the soldiers that supported them):\nSubsequent Members.\nThese members do not appear to have been part of the original group, but were members of the first Horadric order before its dissolution:\nInterim.\nWhile not members of the original group of Horadrim, these individuals could trace their lineage back to it and/or can be counted as Horadrim themselves:\nThe Second Order.\nThe following members of the Horadrim were active at the time of its re-founding in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231286\"&gt;1286&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe Third Order.\nThe third order of Horadrim was effectively a reformed/refounded version of the second order. It steadily fell apart as its members went their own ways."}

{"id": "2826", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2826", "title": "Horazon", "text": "Horazon was a &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;-user of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt; and a participant in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, he retired to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Will of Demons.\nHorazon rose to prominence in the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt; alongside his brother &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;. Horazon achieved a place on the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Council\"&gt;Vizjerei Council&lt;/a&gt; via the patronage of &lt;a href=\"Oskul\"&gt;Oskul&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Horazon and Bartuc were equally powerful and ambitious, and both were fascinated by the power one could obtain through the practice of &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Magic\"&gt;Demonic Magic&lt;/a&gt;. Horazon viewed demons as a great source of power and felt that in order to use that power best, a magic-user must harness a demon and bend it to their will. Horazon's ideology was in contrast to Bartuc, who advocated allying with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; to best learn the demons' secrets.\nHorazon and Bartuc lived in a time after the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;; when the Vizjerei were engaged in such reckless summoning of demonic forces that caught the attention of the other &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;. When the other clans tried to assassinate some Vizjerei summoners and the Vizjerei responded in kind, the result was the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mage Clan Wars.\nThe Mage Clan Wars were short but devastating. Pushed to the brink, the Vizjerei unleashed demons on their foes. The plan worked, and the tides of the war turned, as the Vizjerei pushed the other clans back to the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;. Horazon however, had grown concerned. Bartuc had since gained the epithet \"Warlord of Blood\" and lived up to that name, slaughtering his foes and summoning demons \"en masse\". He realized that even if the Vizjerei won the war, there would soon be nothing of civilization left, bar enslavement to Hell. However, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Ruling%20Council\"&gt;Vizjerei Ruling Council&lt;/a&gt; dismissed Bartuc for his acts of depravity. By this point, the views of Horazon and Bartuc on demons had turned into opposing philosophies, and thus a great schism split the ranks of the clan. Thus, the Vizjerei engaged in the civil war and after many hard-fought battles, Bartuc and his faction gained the upper hand. Thus, he turned his attention to conquering Viz-jun. Only then did Horazon resolve to confront his brother.\nAt the end of all things, the brothers realized that Hell had played them for fools, yet still they battled. By the end of the battle, Horazon stood victorious and Bartuc lay dead, yet at the cost of Viz-jun and the casualties, its destruction resulted in.\nThe Armor of Bartuc.\nHorazon and his fellow mages were unable to destroy Bartuc's corpse, as his armour protected him even after death. That he had failed to cover his throat properly was the reason he had been able to be decapitated. Wary of his brother's vast power even in death, Horazon ordered that Bartuc's body be forever hidden from the sight of Man. In this he and the Vizjerei were aided by the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arcane Sanctuary.\nThough a powerful Summoner, Horazon feared that the Lords of Hell would punish him for enslaving their brethren. His mind shattered by the horrific experiences he had gone through, he travelled to &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, where he tried to engage in a life of studious pursuit. He built the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and kept demons as slaves within the structure. He retired to the Sanctuary disappearing from the public eye, which he believed would keep him free of Hell's reach, but would also allow him to continue his studies free of the ravages of time and disease. Horazon crafted many wondrous scrying devices through which he observed the events of the world outside. This included the imprisonment of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote down his observations in his &lt;a href=\"Horazon%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; and provided clues for adventurers seeking the True Tomb amongst the &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Tombs%20%28quest%29\"&gt;six False Tombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the song \"&lt;a href=\"Bartuc%20and%20Horazon\"&gt;Bartuc and Horazon&lt;/a&gt;\" was composed, telling the tale of the two brothers.\nEarth and Stone.\nHorazon continued to reside in his Sanctuary, remaking it over and over, even as his body began to give out on him. Then came the day where Horazon gave what was left of himself to the Sanctuary. In essence, Horazon \"became\" the Arcane Sanctuary itself.\nAt some point, a curious &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; found his way into the Sanctuary by accident, losing his senses in the process. Feeling guilty, Horazon did what he could for him, though the Sorcerer effectively became a vessel of Horazon himself. This appeared to fragment Horazon's consciousness, dividing it between the shell and the Sanctuary.\nLegacy of Blood.\nBlood Brothers.\nEven in death, the bond between Horazon and Bartuc remained. &lt;a href=\"Norrec%20Vizharan\"&gt;Norrec Vizharan&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to wear the armour of Bartuc, found his way to Lut Gholein, where the Arcane Sanctuary was buried under, such as the bond between the brothers. Horazon sensed the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kara%20Nightshadow\"&gt;Kara Nightshadow&lt;/a&gt; in the city above and sent his shell to find her.\nAs part of her efforts to find Norrec, Kara found her way into the Sanctuary. A number of mosaics came to life and attacked her, but she was saved by Horazon himself (or rather, the shell of the Sorcerer he had commandeered). He appeared to barely have left of his senses, but upon the mention of Bartuc, he led Kara deep into the Sanctuary, seeking refuge from his brother. Horazon brought her to a bedroom and told her to sleep, locking her in. He retired to drink wine and eat food. Seeing Kara (having made her way through the Sanctuary), he bid her sit with him (the fact that he was seated upside down due to the Sanctuary's insane geometry aside) and eat, a feat which she accomplished. As they sat, Horazon spoke of his past when Kara tried to get information out of him. However, his words were like babble, and incoherent. At one point he spoke of having discovered the Sanctuary by accident. At another, he told her of how he had come to Aranoch to study the ley lines around what would become Lut Gholein. But after that, he said that he had fled to Aranoch in a bid to escape his brother's dark legacy. As the conversation progressed, Kara got the sense that she was talking to two different people. One who actually \"was\" Horazon, and one who \"thought\" he was Horazon (a side effect of Horazon's fragmented mind). She supposed that his experiences in the Mage Clan Wars, coupled with centuries of isolation, had torn apart his mind. In truth, Horazon was actually learning about her, just as he had done when she had slept.\nWith the meal finished, Horazon led Kara through the Sanctuary but began to quiver in fear as he sensed the presence of Norrec (and through him, Bartuc's armour). He told Kara that she had to go, while he had to hide. However, the Sanctuary appeared to take on a mind of its own, hands literally jutting out to grab him, and force him to confront his foe. He did battle with Norrec, but Kara realized that the armour was controlling Norrec. Kara begged Horazon to stop, but he kept fighting. Norrec asks whether \"Horazon [is] just like his brother?\" From every wall, every ceiling, mouths took form and answered for their maker...\n\"No.\"\nBlood Calls to Blood.\nThe Arcane Sanctuary took it upon itself to expel Kara and Norrec, but Horazon made no appearance. At least not until after the siege of Lut Gholein by &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20Malevolyn\"&gt;Augustus Malevolyn&lt;/a&gt;, where Horazon appeared before Norrec. Kara, at last, realized Horazon's true nature, and he explained it as such to her. Through Norrec, Horazon conversed with his brother, whose dark legacy still persisted through the armour he wore. Through magic, Bartuc's armour was ripped off Norrec, and was worn by Horazon himself, but unlike Norrec, he did not lose himself. He told Kara to never again seek the Arcane Sanctuary and told Norrec to create his own legacy. With all said and done, his body began to crumble, joining the sands of Aranoch, taking Bartuc's armour with him. Ending the legacy of the two brothers.\nThe False Summoner.\nDuring the time of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s resurgence, it was doubted Horazon still lived. In their pursuit of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; fought their way through hordes of demons running rampant in the Arcane Sanctuary. There they discovered a dark impersonator: one of the Vizjerei sorcerers that attempted to save &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; who had been corrupted and styled himself &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;The Summoner&lt;/a&gt;. He was slain by the adventurers. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the impersonator was pulled down to Hell by the forces of Evil after his death. Others suggest that it was Horazon's spirit that possessed the sorcerer.\nPersonality and Traits.\nHorazon was ambitious, and delighted in breaking the will of demons, though turned away from this path at the end of the Mage Clan Wars. Deckard Cain was of the opinion that Horazon was perhaps one of the greatest mages who has ever lived, but noted that for all his power over demons, that might not have been enough to save Horazon from death and/or the reach of Hell. However, at the least, Horazon managed to live well over 1000 years, as he was able to be present for both the Mage Clan Wars and the final days of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe legend of Horazon is well known to the people of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, and over time, many feats and strange events were attributed to him. Such legends were not entirely positive, however, and in some, Horazon was portrayed as being the lesser of two evils when compared to Bartuc, for, after all, he had engaged in the summoning of demons himself. The legends claimed that Horazon's actions in the war were down to self-preservation. The Vizjerei still revere Horazon as a symbol of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's ability to triumph over otherworldly forces. The &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, however, cite him as an example of mankind's folly.\nAt the end of his life, Horazon's grip on sanity was loose, and his body was failing him. Thanks to the body he had taken, he looked like a beggar, with long white hair, including a beard, along with blue eyes. His mind was ravaged by his experiences in the Wars, his fear of Bartuc, and centuries of isolation within the Arcane Sanctuary. Nonetheless, Norrec noted that while Horazon looked like a beggar, he radiated a sense of presence that made those around him seem insignificant. Also, in these last moments, Horazon appeared in full control of himself. It was now clear to those present that Horazon had no further desire to be part of the world."}

It is similar to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us\"&gt;Among Us&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on the parlour game \"Werewolf\".\nGameplay.\nHowler Hunt becomes available from &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Level&lt;/a&gt; 30. The player is tasked with obtaining Sacred Energy from Sacred Wards and submitting it to the Altar of Purging, located at the center of the map. During the match, one of the player's companions will become The Howler. The Howler is tasked with sabotaging their former companions' progress, using additional threats to their advantage to disrupt any progress made. Howlers can summon Undead Incursions and blighted Sacred Wards to cause chaos and sow the seeds of dissent from the shadows.\nEmbodying the night terror of The Howler presents unbridled advantages, but those that can master their lunar urges will reign supreme. Howlers can instantly slay their nearest ally, but this will reveal their true Howler form for several seconds. Subsequent kills create longer cooldown times, so feast on your companions wisely.\nOnce a slain adventurer's corpse is located, a vote will be called to execute the adventurer suspected of the foul deed.\nAdventurers and the treacherous Howler win through different means. If all Howlers are executed successfully through a vote, the Adventurers succeed in their grim task. Similarly, if the Howlers manage to execute all Adventurers, the night is theirs. If the Sacred Energy bar reaches 100% completion, the Adventurers win. If all Sacred Wards are destroyed, the Howlers win.\nRewards are determined by how much you assist\u2014or deter\u2014the player side\u2019s victory. Collecting and turning in Sacred Energy, participating in voting your fellow Adventurers out, slaying Adventurers as the Howler and dealing with threats will contribute to rewards.\nHistory.\nHowler Hunt was first available between January 31, 3 a.m.\u2013February 21, 3 a.m., 2024. It returned for the 2024 &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Hallow's Wake&lt;/a&gt; event."}

{"id": "22773", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22773", "title": "Human", "text": "Humans, otherwise referred to as humanity, (hu)mankind, Man, or exile-born are a mortal race native to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The descendants of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, humanity has long been the focal point of the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysiology.\nHumans are mortal and upon death, their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s enter &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;a location&lt;/a&gt; beyond the reach of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s (though various &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;s claim otherwise). Half angel and half demon, the two components of a human's soul are integral to their existence. Humans possess the ability to choose between good and evil, an ability that causes many angels to fear mankind.\nHumans can be used as sacrifices to summon demons into Sanctuary\u2014some humans are better suited to act as sacrifices than others. Humans and demons are capable of interbreeding, usually to the horror of the former. Few children of such couplings survive childbirth, and fewer still survive into adulthood, as they are generally killed by those who know them for what they are. Demons can possess humans, and to best knowledge, the possession cannot be ended without killing the host. Humans are also capable of breeding with nephalem. As with angels and demons, human blood carries &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman eyesight is inferior to that of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s in most respects, though the human eye is quite adept in picking up light. \nFor humans, life in Sanctuary is brutal, and comforts are rare. Humans have a short life expectancy, at least in part due to the horrors that blight their world. Few humans make it to the age of 70, and only a few are able to stand against the darkness that blights their world.\nThe ability to practice magic is not universal among humanity. Only the strongest of humans can harness anything more than the most basic of magical effects. The lies spouted by particularly black-hearted humans rarely manifest in turning their tongues a milky white.\nHumans are more intelligent than &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s, and have secured their place in Sanctuary through their intelligence and mastery of tools. Humans are wont to war among themselves. Not all of their woes can be placed at the feet of Heaven or Hell. \nEven humans with the utmost mental fortitude can find themselves lost to the unrelenting darkness spread by the Burning Hells. Broken. Shattered. Trapped in the deepest recesses of their mind.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThe world of Sanctuary was created by rogue angels and demons led by the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and the demoness &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, seeking refuge from the Great Conflict. The two races interbred, leading to the birth of the nephalem. Their powers exceeded those of their parents, raising concern that the nephalem might not only become a threat, but could draw the attention of Heaven or Hell to their world. The issue led to bloodshed, as Lilith slaughtered angel and demon alike, fearing for her children's safety. Inarius succeeded in banishing Lilith to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, but he was the only one of his kind left on Sanctuary. Alone, he altered the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; to diminish the powers of the nephalem. Each subsequent generation's powers were diminished, to the extent that they became mortal. Eventually, humanity as a whole rose up, unaware of its history bar myths and legends inspired by its nephalem forefathers. Specifically, humanity first emerged in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, which was constructed in honor of the first nephalem to be born.\nThus, humanity spread across Sanctuary. Building cities, collecting knowledge, and developing distinct cultures and ethnicities. From the outset, humans waged war among themselves, but relatively speaking, humanity's early history was one of relative peace. However, it was not to last, as the lords of Hell eventually discovered the mortal realm. This discovery led to the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, a covert battle between Hell and Inarius to turn humanity to their own ends. It ended with an agreement between Heaven and Hell that humanity would be allowed to choose its own path between Light and Dark. After the pact was sealed, humanity's memories of the terrible events were wiped clean and was given a second chance to start over.\nSuch has been the state of Man since this time. The &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; have made plays to turn humanity to Chaos, while the archangel &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and mortal heroes have often foiled them. \nRecent History.\nBy the destruction of the Worldstone, human civilization was fragmented, with only a few functioning cities left on Sanctuary. The Worldstone's destruction altered the very essence of humanity, and with the Worldstone destroyed, nephalem have emerged amongst humanity, an event coinciding with the end of the Great Conflict. Thus, Tyrael declared that humans and angels would stand together as one. It was a hollow declaration as humanity found itself nearly eradicated by rogue angels called &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; was able to save humankind, angelkind was mostly indifferent to humanity's suffering. By the time of Malthael's defeat, cities had been ravaged, and entire populations had been decimated, with 50% (or even 90%) of the human race having been killed. The survivors fared little better, and Humanity remained in peril, as death and ruin were reaped upon Sanctuary, the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; unable to protect those in need. Because of Malthael's actions, humanity suffered religious schisms, war, and famine. Numerous structures fell into ruin. \nDecades since Malthael's attempted genocide, humanity remained beset by chaos, caused by demons, corrupted wildlife, and mankind's own evil. Townsfolk huddled in dark corners, trying to survive one more day. The pious prayed for salvation, but doubts had them feeling that their devotion was misplaced. With the power vacuum that resulted, some rose up to attempt to fill the void, including the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; church and a resurgent &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Triune\"&gt;Temple of the Triune&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, no single mortal force in Sanctuary had the strength of arms to stand against Hell, should demons ever come in force.\nWith the return of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; to Sanctuary, a new wave of cultists and worshippers were spawned, but regardless of one's faith, all prayers remained unanswered. Lilith's very presence on Sanctuary caused much of humanity to lose all sense of morality.\nCultures.\nHumans are a diverse people, with a variety of unique cultures. Numerous different human groups exist across Sanctuary, their traits differing in accordance with their location and culture. Human cultures can broadly fall into one of two viewpoints. The first of these is mysticism\u2014the study of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and the root desire for humanity to become the master of its own destiny. The other viewpoint is faith\u2014the view that humanity must put its trust in powers beyond mortal understanding to determine its fate and establish ethical and moral guidelines to live by. Various faiths have arisen over time, and often subsume existing practices into their structure. Humans often build altars or shrines on sites of power, knowingly or otherwise.\nThe prominence of both viewpoints has waxed and waned over time. Spirituality is unique to humanity, and humans cannot help but worship. Many times, human societies have dedicated themselves to malignant beings. Similarly, there are no shortage of martyrs who follow the orders of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s, even though the machinations of Heaven are inscrutable to mortals.\nHumans have fought numerous wars across their history. Some humans choose banditry as a way of life.\nThe peoples of Sanctuary use &lt;a href=\"herbs\"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; as medicine, occult reagents, or simple decor through their daily lives.\nA number of human cultures have been lost to history, and entire kingdoms have fallen. Slavery is practiced by at least some human cultures, and wedding rings are used in at least one human culture. Humans have an endless thirst for knowledge, but even &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, many humans did not believe in the existence of angels or demons, or worlds beyond their own. Many humans fear the inexplicable.\nMany humans don't know how to swim. Seafaring folk are known to spin a tall tale.\nMost human structures put function before form. Isolated human societies often grow and advance at incredible rates. If destabilized enough, human society will inevitably turn in on itself in bloodshed; a pattern that has been repeated numerous times over Sanctuary's history. For humanity, life is generally a struggle, even for the wealthiest of mortals. Some humans choose to become &lt;a href=\"adventurers\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt;, but only those with a razor-sharp sense of survival live long enough to decide their fate.\nHumans hold dear the names of old heroes and champions, and often shout their names in battle. Across humanity, many legends speak of a hero's fall, but few speak of a monster's redemption. The vengeful seek to right past wrongs and make their enemies pay for the harm they've caused. This righteousness is blinding, and they often find themselves incurring a debt they could never repay.\nBy the 11th century, the human population in Sanctuary was at least in the millions.\nEthnicities.\nExamples of human cultures and ethnicities include the following:\nAskari.\nThe Askari (often referred to as \"Amazons\") are native to the &lt;a href=\"Skovos%20Isles\"&gt;Skovos Isles&lt;/a&gt;, located south of the Western Kingdoms. Their society is matriarchal and caste-based, while their mythology is polytheistic, mostly centered around the nephalem &lt;a href=\"Philios\"&gt;Philios&lt;/a&gt;, but also features worship of many other gods.\nChildren of Bul-Kathos.\nThe Children of Bul-Kathos exist in two distinct branches\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt; (now the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Druids\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;. Central to both cultures was the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, and both built their societies around their protection of it. With the Worldstone's destruction, the Barbarians lost their homeland and scattered to various parts of the world in exile.\nPeople of Aranoch.\nA number of nomadic human tribes inhabit &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; is a permanent settlement. The land itself acts as a barrier between the East and West of Sanctuary. Many ruins dot the landscape\u2014relics of times long gone.\nPeople of the East.\n&lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; is the dominant power of the East, and perhaps no other region has been as influential in shaping human civilization in Sanctuary. It is in this region that some of the most influential discoveries in religion, philosophy, magic, and science, have been made. The land has a tumultuous history, what with the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the coming of Zakarum, the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently, the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom was left paralyzed by his manipulations of &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt;, but his yoke was removed, much to the joy of the populace.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vecin\"&gt;Vecin&lt;/a&gt; are present in this region.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ascenian\"&gt;Ascenian&lt;/a&gt;s inhabit a highlands area of the region.\nPeople of Greyhollow Island.\nA human civilization developed on &lt;a href=\"Greyhollow%20Island\"&gt;Greyhollow Island&lt;/a&gt; that developed into a grand empire. For reasons unknown, the society collapsed, leaving chaos in its wake.\nPeople of Ivgorod.\nThe people of &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; are seclusive. Once a mighty civilization, Ivgorod is now confined to its single capital. Ruled by a religious oligarchy, the religion of Ivgorod is &lt;a href=\"Sahptev\"&gt;Sahptev&lt;/a&gt;, which preaches the exist of 1001 gods and goddesses. This system dominates every aspect of the lives of Ivgorod's people.\nPeople of the Torajan Jungles.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Torajan%20Jungles\"&gt;Torajan Jungles&lt;/a&gt; are located southwest of Kehjistan, and have seen numerous civilizations rise and fall over time. The &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; are the only exception to this. The Umbaru clans frequently war with one another in ritualistic warfare, to honor the spirits of the rainforest. Their overriding faith is in the &lt;a href=\"Mbwiru%20Eikura\"&gt;Mbwiru Eikura&lt;/a&gt;, a \"true reality\" beyond the mortal realm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Opaya\"&gt;Opaya&lt;/a&gt; inhabit(ed) the southern region of the jungles.\nPeople of the Western Kingdoms.\nThe West of Sanctuary encompasses the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdoms have their origins in the crusade led by &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; in the name of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, and consequently, Zakarum is the West's dominant religion. That being said, variation exists\u2014Entsteig still practices ancient pagan rituals, melding their folklore with worship of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Westmarch is a healthy, vibrant kingdom, and is currently a forward-looking civilization as Zakarum influence declines. Khanduras is best known for its suffering at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, though merchants have since returned to the region.\nPeople of the Swamplands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Swamplands\"&gt;Swamplands&lt;/a&gt; are located in the far east of Sanctuary, beyond &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. The people of this region are of fairer hair and skin than the &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt;.\nXian.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Xian\"&gt;Xian&lt;/a&gt;\"\n&lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt; is Sanctuary's northernmost nation, and due to its insular nature, Xian culture developed free from major foreign influence. Xian society is dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Families\"&gt;Great Families&lt;/a&gt;, which each controls a portion of their kingdom's economy. Xian religion is polytheistic, featuring numerous gods, albeit without any distinct hierarchy.\nOther.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Custerians\"&gt;Custerians&lt;/a&gt; are a now-extinct race of humans.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Samurenian\"&gt;Samurenian&lt;/a&gt;s were the people of the &lt;a href=\"Samuren%20Empire\"&gt;Samuren Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Boosenian\"&gt;Boosenian&lt;/a&gt;s were a people who possessed exceptionally talented smiths.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Inari\"&gt;Inari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilin\"&gt;Lilin&lt;/a&gt; are native civilizations of &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nHumans have appeared in every \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" game; mostly as allies, sometimes as foes. With the exception of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", all player characters are humans. Most humans encountered in the games are friendly or neutral towards the player characters, offering various services as &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s. Most, but not all, types of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; in the games are risen from human &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;II&lt;/a&gt;\", humans are rarely encountered as enemies: to some extent, &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; s in are human enemies, and &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s in the first game are presumed to be ones (even though both types are greatly corrupted). There are no special effects that work against humans.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", some human enemies are encountered, such as &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Robber\"&gt;Grave Robber&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Scorpion\"&gt;Sand Scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"Diablo III\" marks the first (and so far, only) time the player characters are not humans, but rather, &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. In \"Diablo III\", &lt;a href=\"Brigand\"&gt;Brigand&lt;/a&gt;s, Templar &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Soldier\"&gt;Westmarch Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Mage\"&gt;Hired Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cultist\"&gt;Dark Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s / &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Vessel\"&gt;Dark Vessel&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; are human enemies. &lt;a href=\"Pig%20Sticker\"&gt;Pig Sticker&lt;/a&gt; is the only item in game with a bonus against humans. Some unique monsters, such as &lt;a href=\"Jondar\"&gt;Jondar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rad%27Noj\"&gt;Rad'Noj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Necromancers\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, are also humans.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", humans return as enemies. They can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Cannibal\"&gt;Cannibal&lt;/a&gt; and Cultist monster classes."}

In the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23c.%20-736\"&gt;-736&lt;/a&gt;, he traveled with &lt;a href=\"Gregus%20Mazi\"&gt;Gregus Mazi&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ureh\"&gt;Ureh&lt;/a&gt;. On the seventh day, Mazi again approached the edge of the city's ruins. Humbart told him that the quest was helpless and they should just leave, but Mazi remained steadfast. Humbart was skeptical of Mazi's claims of reaching Ureh and entering &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, but sure enough, a shimmer occurred, and the ruins appeared 'alive.' Lights even glowed from them. Mazi disappeared before their eyes as he entered the shadow of the city. Neither Humbart or his men would follow the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;. The mercenaries camped outside the ruins. They heard voices coming from them, as if calling to them, but none of them would enter. He told his mercenary company that when Mazi came out the following day, they'd go in and get their fill. But tomorrow came, and there were no ruins, no lights, no voices, and no Gregus Mazi.\nPer a prior agreement with Lord &lt;a href=\"Hyram\"&gt;Hyram&lt;/a&gt;, Humbart recorded his experiences and sent it to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;.\nResurrection.\nLong after Humbart's death, Zayl the Necromancer resurrected him to find what information he could on Ureh. Somehow, he never got round to sending Humbart's spirit back to the &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Plane of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. Humbart, apparently content with (un)life as a talking skull, was in no hurry to be sent back. Zayl ensorcelled\u00a0the warrior's skull and made it his personal companion and magical off-hand tool, keeping Humbart inside his belt pouch.\nReaper of Souls.\nHumbart was with Zayl as he entered the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Marsh\"&gt;Blood Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, in a bid to fix the imbalance in the area. The pair encountered &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Zayl telling Humbart to be quiet, he told the Nephalem that if Zayl had been in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Tomb of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; had come to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, he wouldn't have succeeded. The Nephalem told them of their intention to kill &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;.

Her brother was bitten by a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, and as he was turning into a &lt;a href=\"thrall\"&gt;thrall&lt;/a&gt;/vampire himself, Erys was unable to help him. When he reached out for her, he ran. Erys repeatedly dreamt of her brother over the following years. \nErys spent much of her life hunting vampires and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; for years, despite the emotional toll. As a vampire hunter, she mentored many in her craft. However, many of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9s succumbed to vampirism, betraying her. Consequently, she was forced to put them down.\nSeason of Blood.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, a vampire plague swept across the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;; one that the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; ignored, despite the mounting fear and &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s. Erys worked with a group of fellow vampire hunters to stop it. Months were spent identifying and tracking the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Seekers\"&gt;Blood Seekers&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne night, Erys came across a burning village, finding its people slain by &lt;a href=\"thrall\"&gt;thrall&lt;/a&gt;s. She concluded that the living needed something different; one with all of the strengths of a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, and none of their weaknesses. However, she had little time to dwell on this realization before she was surrounded by thralls. However, they were slain in turn by an unseen figure. \nErys made her way to &lt;a href=\"Ked%20Bardu\"&gt;Ked Bardu&lt;/a&gt;, where she entered the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%27s%20Office\"&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; of Magistrate &lt;a href=\"Oren\"&gt;Oren&lt;/a&gt;. She was aware of a vampire cult that Oren was part of. However, Oren was absent, and in his place was a group of vampires, lying in ambush. Moments later, she was joined by , who aided her in slaying their ambushers. She explained the situation to the Wanderer, and had them search Oren's office for clues. They found a note written by Oren, revealing that he'd been summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Hallows\"&gt;Tomb of Hallows&lt;/a&gt;. Erys knew where that was, but it was at this point that she realized that the Wanderer had been bitten by a vampire. However, given the depth of the wound, the Wanderer should have already turned.\nPerturbed, Erys nevertheless didn't have time to investigate further. She headed to the tomb, and ordered the Wanderer to follow her. When asked as to why, Erys explained that their goals aligned, the Wanderer could be of help, and being together would allow Erys to keep an eye on them. However, Erys was certain that the Wanderer would eventually change into a vampire, as in her experience, nothing could stop a vampiric transformation. While the Wanderer had developed vampiric abilities, and was the type of hero Erys had been searching for, their vampiric traits still made her wary of them. In Erys's mind, the Wanderer's abilities made them a useful tool, albeit a disposable one, and as such, she kept a close eye on the Wanderer, as she knew none were truly immune to vampiric corruption.\nThe pair entered the tomb and arrived in time to see Oren executed by some vampires. Erys deduced that their presence had complicated things for the cult, and told the Wanderer to search the tomb for logs and documents, as with Oren dead, they'd lost their only link to the cult. Erys meanwhile returned to Ked Bardu to follow up with some contacts.\nErys appropriated Oren's office as an impromptu headquarters. After sending some vampire hunters to their camp with supplies, she was met once again by the Wanderer, who explained that they'd found the leader of the cult\u2014an &lt;a href=\"Firstborn\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; vampire named &lt;a href=\"Zir\"&gt;Zir&lt;/a&gt;. Erys was taken aback, not only because of the vampire being an Ancient, but that the Wanderer had been able to walk away. She told the Wanderer that she knew of an Ancient burial site in &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;. If they were able to find the remains of a vampire from the time of the Ancients, there were rituals she could attempt. \nThe pair retrieved a vampire skull from the &lt;a href=\"Fetid%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Fetid Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;. Erys returned to Ked Bardu while the Wanderer was charged with obtaining enough &lt;a href=\"potent%20blood\"&gt;potent blood&lt;/a&gt; for the ritual to be conducted. When the Wanderer returned, Erys could tell that their power was growing, but the Wanderer was still without any apparent side effects from their vampire bite. The ritual was conducted, and the vampire's skull bathed in blood. This awakened it in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Skull\"&gt;talking skull&lt;/a&gt;, one that, while 'alive,' was not necessarily lucid. However, it was clear that the skull was no friend of Zir's, and opened a portal to the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;City of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, where they could find Zir.\nErys and the Wanderer used the portal, but found their way blocked by a sealed door. After fighting off a vampire ambush, they returned through the portal back to the skull. Erys explained that she'd need to prepare a ritual to unseal the door, and the skull advised the Wanderer to seek out Zir's Blood Seekers. Erys was uneasy, but gave the Wanderer the information she had on Zir's Blood Seekers. At the least, eliminating them would do Sanctuary a favor. \nErys was ill at ease. The Wanderer reeked of vampirism, and despite apparently still being in control, was becoming more like a vampire with every passing moment. She feared that by pushing them to fight monsters, the Wanderer would become a monster themselves. She poured over an old text on vampirism, paying particular attention to the time it took for the curse to take hold. She made a list of potential allies, and headed for the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;. In truth, she knew the Cathedral couldn't help.\nWhatever hopes Erys had were dashed at the doors of the Cathedral. She found them locked, and despite her pounding, her pleas remained unanswered. The same remained true for the people of Kyovashad, who had gathered at the base of the Cathedral, but found their cries for help unanswered save for the &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Penitent\"&gt;Knights Penitent&lt;/a&gt;. It was in this crowd that Erys was approached by the Wanderer. Leaving the crowd to speak, Erys stated her fear of the Wanderer. That they'd taken so much of Zir's power, that if they lost control, she did not believe she could stop them. The Wanderer assured her that they were still in control, but Erys could not believe that, despite her desire to do so. She ordered the Wanderer to seek out Zir's army and slay as many of his minions as they could. If they succeeded, she reasoned, they were damned anyway. She explained that the Blood Harvest had reached a scale of carnage she had never seen. She reasoned that Zir's army had begun its \"big push.\" That Zir's ascension was nigh.\nErys watched the Wanderer tear through Zir's Bloodseekers before she returned to Ked Bardu. She discovered that the skull had gone missing, but thought little of it. The Wanderer eventually rejoined her, stating that they'd routed Zir's forces. Erys, awed by the Wanderer's deeds, stated they were ready to face Zir. She revealed that she'd found a way to open the gate in the City of the Ancients that had barred their way earlier, and ordered the Wanderer to meet her there. She explained that while the Wanderer had blunted the Blood Harvest, Zir's legions would rally and be sent out to gather the remaining blood he needed. They had to defeat Zir before that happened.\nThe pair met at the city. She slew vampires to provide the \"offering of flesh\" the seal demanded, and then breached the seals themselves. The way opened, the Wanderer descended into the city. Erys warned them that Zir likely knew they'd arrived. Erys returned to Ked Bardu, where later, the Wanderer returned, having defeated Zir. Erys, greatful for their help, confessed to her earlier misgivings, and told the Wanderer that whatever was in their blood would likely cure them of their vampirism in time. However, while Zir had been defeated, Erys knew the fight wasn't over, as his &lt;a href=\"thrall\"&gt;thrall&lt;/a&gt;s would try to claim his throne, and the killings would continue. She intended to finish packing, have a drink at the tavern, then set out to hunt them down. She joked that she'd leave a few for the Wanderer.\nAs for the missing Ancient skull, Erys wasn't worried, reasoning that it couldn't have got far.\nIn-game.\nErys is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", exclusive to \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Season of Blood&lt;/a&gt;\". She plays a significant role in the 's storyline, acting as a \"beacon of hope\" for players.\nPersonality and Traits.\nA seasoned &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and emotionally complex, Erys is jaded, having experienced plenty of horror in her life. Because of these horrors, Erys is emotionally guarded, and her disposition is frosty and bitter. She is stubborn and fixed in her worldview. However, she still displays compassion to others. \nThe &lt;a href=\"crossbows\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; is her weapon of choice."}

It is available to &lt;a href=\"Ladder\"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt; only.\nWhen made in weapons, Hustle combines the effects of &lt;a href=\"Fanaticism\"&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burst%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Burst of Speed&lt;/a&gt; and a large increased attack speed modifier to bump attack speed up tremendously for the user (and, to a lesser extent, their allies). The low level of both skills may seem unassuming, but they add up to a hefty +35% IAS; this stacks with the native +30% IAS of the runeword for a total of +65% IAS, one of the largest increases for a single item in the game. The low level and proc rate of the Burst of Speed means that it will activate more consistently on classes that attack quickly, such as &lt;a href=\"Strafe%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;strafe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bowazon\"&gt;Bowazon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Zealot%20%28Build%29\"&gt;Zealot&lt;/a&gt;s. Overall the damage output is very decent for a runeword that is accessible as early as level 39 and with such cheap requirements, but it is not powerful enough to compete with more expensive, late game options.\nThe theme of speed carries over to the armor version, with a massive +65% faster run/walk being the largest increase applied to a body armor in the game, and the 40% IAS making it a rival to &lt;a href=\"Treachery%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Treachery Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; in this regard. The +6 to &lt;a href=\"Evade\"&gt;Evade&lt;/a&gt; is unique to this armor, and greatly improves survivability while on the move. The increase to resistances is a pittance compared to other body armors of a comparable availability, but it is still better than nothing. The armor can be seen as an relatively cheap upgrade over the &lt;a href=\"Stealth%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Stealth Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;, having a similar theme of speed, but arguably being superior for physical fighters. \n3 socket Weapons\n3 socket Armor\nPatch History.\nUpon its introduction in patch 2.4, Hustle originally gave a level 9 Burst of Speed, but had no Fanaticism aura. This resulted in players using it to give themselves a buff before switching to another weapon, akin to the &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20Arms%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Call to Arms Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent patches toned down the Burst of Speed to be less powerful and with a much shorter duration, and added Fanaticism, both of which were introduced to encourage use of the rune word as a main weapon.

This can be a very useful build for leveling and PvM. The abilities are up to you, and if chosen wisely, it can be a great use.\nPassivazon/Javazon.\nSkill Points.\nFirst pick your hybrid combination.

In NM, and Hell, the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; will be a great tank. Having 2400~ HP, and the ability to be fully healed when re-summoned. &lt;a href=\"Decoy\"&gt;Decoy&lt;/a&gt; is not much of a help since it only has 200% of your life. cHP x 2 = &lt;a href=\"Decoy\"&gt;Decoy&lt;/a&gt; HP (cHP = 300 = 300(2) = 600 HP = &lt;a href=\"Decoy\"&gt;Decoy&lt;/a&gt;'s HP) 600 HP is not a lot in NM and Hell, for normal is an easy play through IMO.\nHotkeys are important in your build. I use F1, F2, and F3 only since I have only 3 spells I need use for.\nF1 - &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Strike\"&gt;Lightning Strike&lt;/a&gt; - Your main ability, you use it to kill groups :)\nF2 - &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sight\"&gt;Inner Sight&lt;/a&gt; - it's your initiation, use it before you fight a big group to lower their armor\nF3 - &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; - your &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; stays with you, no need to cast it all day. It's your last move\n&lt;a href=\"Power%20Strike\"&gt;Power Strike&lt;/a&gt; is just a synergy to boost your &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Strike\"&gt;Lightning Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage. If you don't know most of these spells, go to the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%23Amazon_Skills\"&gt;Amazon Skills&lt;/a&gt; page and learn about them.\nFighting Groups.\nYou want to just walk around them to lure them all, then pull them back to your &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;. Once she's got the aggro of them all, just run up and spam &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Strike\"&gt;Lightning Strike&lt;/a&gt;. The crazy 12 chains will just keep going around and hitting everything within a 700 unit range. If there is a hero within the group, definitely let your &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; tank it, dying is not an option!!\nItems.\nI'm not a handyman at items. But with your chain lightning always hitting, you will need a mana regen item. Mana regenerating nonchalantly or mana regenerating based on a percentage of your damage. (3%-7% mana regenerated for each PHYSICAL strike) Magic will not count as physical. It's magic, you cast it, not fight with it."}

Many of the items can be interchanged with others to increase power of either/or section one wishes to choose in this build.\nIt is often referred to as the \"Lazymancer\" build, as you can simply cast &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; on the monsters and your minions will slaughter them within seconds, allowing you to basically walk through the entire game without clicking an unnecessary amount of times.\nStats.\nPlacing your stats is not very difficult to do, you should only increase your &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; as much as needed to use your equipment, as for the &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;, they should not be touched within this build, as excessive &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; is not needed. The rest of your points should go solely into &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Armor\"&gt;Bone Armor&lt;/a&gt; having a decent amount of absorbing ability, your only weakness are purely magical spells, which is why the increased vitality is necessary. The build's true strength lies in the &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Skeleton\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, but with the finished build, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spirit\"&gt;Bone Spirit&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spear\"&gt;Spear&lt;/a&gt; will be dealing decent damage as well, so destroying run-away minions will not be so difficult in the end. But only in the high levels does this benefit really shine.\nSkills.\nSummoning Skills.\nOptional\nPoison &amp; Bone Spells.\nOptional\nCurses.\nOptional\nThe optional skills are for those who would rather choose Poison Nova over Bone spells, however, maxing out Bone Wall/Prison enables good defense on Bone Armor as well as good damage from Bone Spirit. You can place more points into Bone Spirit for additional damage, if you exclude Iron Maiden, Life Tap, Lower Resist and Fire Golem from the skill list. These are merely luxury skills used for various occasions.\nItems.\nThe items for the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; have to be specific, as his &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; will be strained and limited in expendable points. This is done to maximize &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter Items.\nAt a glance, the items are typical, and used quite often. The reason for this is you want the maximum + to skills as possible. It is best to get &lt;a href=\"Boneflame\"&gt;Boneflame&lt;/a&gt; ethereal, or a non-ethereal for high resistances. &lt;a href=\"Homunculus%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Homunculus&lt;/a&gt; is best ethereal and upped, for better defense.\nMercenary Items.\nIt is preferred if you get an &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; mercenary as they work extremely well with Summonmancers. Infinity mercenaries work best with the &lt;a href=\"Might\"&gt;Might&lt;/a&gt; aura, however, if you choose to go and forgo the , using &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Aim\"&gt;Blessed Aim&lt;/a&gt; is a good choice, as your Skeletons will have high attack rating, but not enough to hit as often. Infinity lowers monsters resists by -85%, which helps them strike much more often, &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Aim\"&gt;Blessed Aim&lt;/a&gt; also works but it is pointless with Infinity, as the need for attack rating is eliminated with the lower defense. Bramble is used mainly for the Skeletons luxury, the &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; aura deals impressive damage to the attackers, as the damage is doubled with &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt;, making it much more useful than &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;.\nIron Golem.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; is very important when made out of Beast, it is highly recommended that a Beast is made out of a with 5 sockets, the damage is low enough to slide past the damaging effects of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt; that are cast by &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knight&lt;/a&gt;s (note-In patch 1.13, Iron Maiden has been removed from the Oblivion Knight's Curses). The golem is not meant for damage as much as buffing your main force: the skeletons.\nThe golem may vanish if you run away too far, so it is best to teleport every so often to keep his appearance in check. Fortunately, maxing &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Mastery\"&gt;Golem Mastery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; is not necessary, the golem can tank without either of those maxed out with no problems.\nStrategy.\nWhen using this build, it is wise to walk a few paces and teleport only when necessary, your &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Armor\"&gt;Bone Armor&lt;/a&gt; can take a beating, but unfortunately it cannot withstand massive amounts of damage should you teleport into the wrong crowd.\nOne of the best strategies for &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Chaos Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, is to take it slowly. Teleporting too much, too quickly can get your army obliterated in a matter of seconds from &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;, including your mercenary. (note-In patch 1.13, Iron Maiden has been removed from the Oblivion Knight's Curses)\nDealing with Bosses is an entirely different matter, it is best to teleport on top and run away quickly, then cast &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt; and let your skeletons take them down.\nThis build can also do battle with the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;s, but this requires the &lt;a href=\"Blunderbore\"&gt;Blunderbore&lt;/a&gt; or one of their variations, as they have the stun ability which helps keep the Ubers in check. Although with a Beast Golem in your summoned arsenal, it is not recommended, unless you have no problem risking losing him."}

It calls forth a three-headed monster made of fire that shoots s at its enemies. It cannot be attacked, and up to 6 Hydras can be summoned at once; having all the Hydras on your side can be deceivingly powerful.\nAlthough its synergies are minimal, it can benefit greatly from &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Mastery\"&gt;Fire Mastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe listed damage is for each individual fire bolt fired by the Hydras. Each Hydra shoots 8 volleys (it takes 1 second to both \"start up\" and \"cool down\"), with 3 shots per volley.\nThe optimal spread between Mastery and synergies is: a total (including soft points as well as hard points) Mastery 15\u201316 points higher than hard points in synergies, until Mastery is capped. This number changes with gear or auras reducing enemy fire resistance, however.\nHydras attack autonomously once cast. Therefore, a sorceress can place them in strategic positions, such as from much farther away than other more direct skills, or around corners, and have them do the casting while the sorceress is in a relatively safe position.\nThis can be advantageous in the fight with &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, as one can utilize the safespots behind the jutting corners of the walls to remain entirely protected, while the hydras deal damage.\nSkill Progression.\nDuration: 10 seconds"}

Each head rapidly spits high-speed &lt;a href=\"firebolt\"&gt;firebolt&lt;/a&gt;s, causing 165% damage as &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; to the first enemy they hit (missiles have a limited range). All Hydra heads try, but do not have to fire at a single target. Costs 15 &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power\"&gt;Arcane Power&lt;/a&gt;, and has no &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;. Normally only one Hydra per Wizard can be summoned.\nHydra cannot be directly controlled, is unable to move, does not block path, and may not be targeted with any attacks and spells, only disappearing in three cases:\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; of Hydra depends on that of its master, and each head spits independently.\nHydra has a zero &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;Proc Coefficient&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, Wizard will not gain any healing for Hydra's attacks, and these attacks will not trigger any 'on hit' special effects. In return, Hydra's attacks will not cause Wizard to take damage from the Reflects Damage monster affix.\nHydra will not attack &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s beyond 10 yards of itself if those are not yet in combat.\nHydra is a popular kiting build spell, as it can attack independently from the Wizard, and regardless of its master's movement.\nThe Arcane Hydra version does benefit from the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Flux\"&gt;Temporal Flux&lt;/a&gt; passive skill to everything within the area of effect of each bolt, turning it into a very effective AoE DPS and &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; turret.\nHydra is not applying shields from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weapon\"&gt;Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(Deflection) on attacking, only doing it on cast.\n&lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;s can summon Hydras as well. With Serpent's Sparker wand and Duplicates rune, a Wizard could have as many as 10 Hydras active at a time (even though 8 of them would be fake and do little damage). Since then this combo was fixed and now Mirror Images can have only one summoned Hydra at the same time, whatever the Images' numbers.\nHydra's attack speed interval is reset if it is resummoned. In other words, spamming Hydra again and again with careful timing can increase its attack speed (at cost of greatly raised Arcane Power expenditure).\nAs Hydra exists for a limited time and attacks independently, it benefits greatly from Attack Speed.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally Hydra was assumed to have a variety of rune choices involving the fully-functional summonable &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; with the Striking rune.\nBefore patch 2.0., a Venom Hydra variant existed in game in addition to other types. It was removed along with all other variations of Venom and Blood magic from the Wizard's arsenal."}

At night, after the fight had concluded and the pit vacated, Fahd found his eye drawn to commingled &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; and sweat in the pit. He watched a puddle sink through a concavity in the ground. When it dripped below, he saw white teeth gleam in a glistening red snout. The blood vanished with a puff of sand and a guzzling noise.\nAt some point, the Ammuit stripped Fahd of his titles. He did not complain, but simply defected (it is unclear if this defection was to the &lt;a href=\"Ennead\"&gt;Ennead&lt;/a&gt; or Horadrim).\nThe Horadrim.\nFahd was one of the founding members of the Horadrim. He was one to first realize the dangers &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; posed, and spoke to the nine Horadrim against its further use, convincing most of them to hide the Cube.\nTal Rasha was among the Horadrim that bound their &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"vessels\"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;. As the Horadrim could not conquer &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, these vessels would store their memories for future Horadrim.\nSometime after the Hunt for the Three, Fahd came to lead the Horadrim.

A &lt;a href=\"portal%20device\"&gt;portal device&lt;/a&gt; (or something similar) was built under the land where &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; would be constructed hundreds of years later, which led to the sanctum.

They must be opened using &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%27s%20Key\"&gt;Aspirant's Key&lt;/a&gt;s. There are 5 chests per room and 4 rooms total, with some mobs spawning in between. The first chest can be opened for free, and each successive chest requires more keys to open. After opening all 20 chests, a secret chest shows up in the middle.\nIn the below table, the free chest's stones are not counted towards the cumulative rewards since the chest doesn't require any keys to open, whereas the final chest can be opened for free, but only after opening all 20 chests, so its reward is added to the 20th chest's reward.\nSince the ratio between stones and keys goes down and down, there is no point in saving keys for a single big run.\nHistory.\nThe update on added the ability to reset the vessel upgrades and unlock up to 10 levels with a single click."}

This means that the item's &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt;es and properties are unknown, and will be hidden and have no effect until the item is Identified.\nThe item's properties are determined at the moment it is dropped, \"not\" when Identified. They will just be hidden and inactive until unlocked via Identify.\nThere are multiple means, depending on the game, to Identify an item, but the result is same: the item gains a new name (other than its basic type with appropriate color), can be used, and the affixes are unlocked and disclosed.\nThe system of unidentified items serves multiple purposes, mostly giving players incentive to pick items up and see their properties, giving excitement of discovering what the real use of an item is.\nLore.\n\"Any object imbued with &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; exhibits an aura that is easily noticed. To determine the exact nature of this enchantment, however, requires intense study and an extensive knowledge of arcane materials and symbols. While none have mastered the ability to memorize a spell of this magnitude, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; have developed a means for the untrained to discover the secrets of an ensorcelled object by using a rare crystal that is extremely sensitive to magical auras. This sensitivity makes it very fragile, however and the crystal will shatter if it is brought too close to an enchanted item. The very act of Identifying such an object also destroys the crystal. Scrolls and staves have been crafted that can be used to Identify magical auras. By using special inks and dyes that contain tiny grains of these crystals, the stability of the crystal is maintained until it is used to examine the enchanted object. \"\nDiablo I.\nIdentify is both a spell and a skill in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\". As a spell, it can be used by any class, but cannot be learned from &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s. As a skill, it is only utilized by &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt;s, and is arguably the most useful of all class skills in game.\nGeneral Information.\nIdentify, when invoked, instantly reveals the properties of an unidentified item so that it can be used. It is not available as a learnable spell, but can be found on &lt;a href=\"scroll\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Scroll of Identify&lt;/a&gt; was carried over to \"Diablo II\".\nAlternatively, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; provides the service of identification when in &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; for a fee of 100 &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; per item (which is exactly as much as the scroll's cost).\nThe unfinished &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; from the \"\" expansion, accessible by editing a text file, possesses the power of identification, having the ability to use it for free.\nIdentify can be cast on any item in the player's &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. Once the scroll is invoked, it cannot be canceled, and if cast on an item already identified, or not suitable for identification, it is wasted.\nAt earlier levels, it may be a good idea to save the game before identifying items, for with some bad luck, the selling price of loot may be below 100 gold (such as for items with detrimental affixes, lowering the price to 1 gold), leaving the player with no profit for selling the identified item.\nLore.\n\"With the knowledge of the ages stored in their minds from hearing the endless tales of other &lt;a href=\"Seekers%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Seekers&lt;/a&gt;, young bards learn to immediately identify any item that they find, no matter how obscure or foreign.\"\n\"Diablo II\".\nDue to the complete overhaul of the Skill system in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Identify is stripped of its Spell status and transformed into a mere scroll that may drop from monsters or be bought from magical vendors.\nIn \"Diablo II\", the act of Identifying is limited to using a &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Scroll of Identify&lt;/a&gt; on an unidentified item; &lt;a href=\"Tomes%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Tomes of Identify&lt;/a&gt; are used in a similar manner, being a way of condensing up to 20 scrolls into only two inventory slots. This is performed by right-clicking the Scroll and clicking of an item to identify it. Unlike the first game's scrolls, scrolls in the second game are not wasted if misclicked or canceled.\nThe result is that the hidden attributes will be shown. Also, unlike \"Diablo\", the second game nearly always makes this a positive change, as there are no negative attributes in \"Diablo II\", except in some &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique Items&lt;/a&gt;. Also, unidentified items merely sell for the price of the standard equipment version, in addition to being useless as they cannot be equipped.\nDeckard Cain can still identify items while in town. This time, he performs it for free if rescued during the . If not rescued by player character (done by simply clicking his cage), he will be rescued by the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and will charge 100 gold for each item. In either case, he has an option to identify all items at once.\nHe will show up in multiplayer games and have the same function for players who have not done the quest, for 100 gold per item. Since scrolls only cost 80 gold, it is slightly more expensive if you haven't done the quest, but it can save on time.\nDiablo III.\nThe power of identification returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", though somewhat changed. Scrolls are no longer necessary for &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, as they have an identification power of their own, though this is outmatched by Deckard Cain, as well as his &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Cain%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally, the scrolls of identification were implemented, but over the course of development and releasing of patches, the identification process was becoming less strict. At first, the scrolls were removed and replaced with right-clicking and channeling the spell for 3 seconds. Magic quality items no longer need to be identified. Prior to the pre-expansion patch, Rare items required identification, but since then, no longer require such. As result, only &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Set%20items\"&gt;Set items&lt;/a&gt; require identification.\nTo identify many items at once, players can use the Book of Cain or (in the first half of , they can also ask Cain for help).\nThis action, once begun, requires concentration. The hero cannot do \"anything\", even performing an instantaneous action, and will immediately lose progress if attacked, no matter how damaging the successful blow. As such, it is unwise to identify items in the middle of battle.\nIdentifying a Legendary/Set item, or using Deckard Cain's services, book or not, requires 4 seconds of concentration."}

For the Umbaru, there is no greater honor than to take part in the Igani.\nLore.\nThe Igani Bawe is traditionally held in the interval between seasons. It always commences at sunrise, and ends at sundown. The purpose of the Igani is not to slay their fellow Umbaru on the battle itself (this is considered taboo), but rather incapacitate them and capture them to be sacrificed afterwards. When an Umbaru is captured, they embark on the \"Te Wok Nu'cha\", the Final March. When they are sacrificed, their bodies are smeared in ritual oils before their &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; and organs (the latter of which is placed in jars) are offered to the spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Unformed Land&lt;/a&gt;. The Umbaru believe that by doing this, they not only nourish the realm for those who will enter it later, but also strengthen their own world (e.g. allowing healthy crops to grow and the seasons to pass). Most Umbaru are prohibited from entering the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Trance\"&gt;Ghost Trance&lt;/a&gt; during the Igani, as the high priests state it disorientes the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the recently sacrificed tributes.\nIn truth however, the Igani Bawe is unnecessary. Mbwiru Eikura exists regardless of whatever sacrifices the Umbaru make, but it is not utopia either. Two Witch Doctors discovered the truth, &lt;a href=\"Nazeebo\"&gt;Nazeebo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benu\"&gt;Benu&lt;/a&gt;. While the former ended up following the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Benu, who became a spirit, sought to guide the Umbaru away from the needless warfare that they undertook."}

Level 12 is the minimum to break most lightning immunities, but there are perks to having more points in this skill.\nHireling.\nLightning resistance penalty found on items will only work for the user, so don't put a Griffon's Eye on your &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; with the intent to take advantage of reducing enemy lightning resistance.\nAlthough many players solo with their characters, Hirelings can certainly increase the survivability of any character if maintained properly. Typically, most choose the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Act 2 Defensive Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; in Nightmare Difficulty (the \"Holy Freeze Merc\") or the Offensive version (the \"Might Merc\"), but the others have plenty of potential if geared properly. The Helmet and Armor are standard choices, the only thing that would vary are the weapons. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Act 3 Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; with cold attacks used to be popular, but are rare now due to many monsters being immune to their attacks. Although &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarian Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are quite rugged, they can be overcome by large mobs. On the other hand, properly equipped, he can definitely play a major factor in increasing the character's survivability. And the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt;s should not be counted out either, although without particular gear her ability to assist in later stages of the game diminishes by quite a bit. Although the weapons vary, the armor and helmet choices are mostly stock, with some variance in regards to armor.\nWeapon.\nBarbarians (Act 5).\nThere are numerous swords that a Barbarian can use that listing them all would be impractical.

Each have their own reasons for fighting, and a story line that will progress in, but not detract from, the main story arc.\nIf followers' dialogue are enabled, they will periodically have a chat with the player (a follower's text being mostly the same for all classes, but player's replies will vary). They will also warn the player of approaching danger (&lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;elite packs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;), comment on key plot events, and shout out loud when they use their skills. In town, idle followers can be sometimes overheard having conversations between themselves.\nOnly one follower can accompany a player at a time, but even while not at the player's side, the other followers will stay with the player's current level so they can join the player at any time without needing to be leveled up first. With &lt;a href=\"Asheara%27s%20Vestments\"&gt;Asheara's Vestments&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"set\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;, one may have all three followers at their side, almost non-stop.\nThe followers can be customized enough to suit the player's style, depending on which four of their eight skills one decides to develop. Each follower can be equipped with &lt;a href=\"Helm\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shoulders\"&gt;Shoulders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chest%20Armor\"&gt;Chest Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gloves\"&gt;Gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bracers\"&gt;Bracers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belt\"&gt;Belt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rings\"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neck\"&gt;Neck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pants\"&gt;Pants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boots\"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt;, main-hand and off-hand &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, and also a unique class-specific item.\nThe player needs to be in town to pick up their follower or switch between them, but one can dismiss them at any time. If another player joins a game, the follower automatically leaves in 20 seconds, returning to town, and a window pops up to ask if you want them back as soon as the group is disbanded.\nIf a follower's health drops to zero, they do not die, and do not need to be resurrected: instead they are knocked unconscious and automatically revive in 30 seconds with full health. While in this state, however, they cannot provide active buffs and aura-like passive buffs.\u00a0\nShould the player venture too far from a follower (for example, being separated by impassable terrain), the follower will teleport to them in 5 seconds.\nFollowers may accompany the player at any area, except the &lt;a href=\"campaign\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;-only fight with the &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; (they are trapped immediately after the combat starts, forcing the player to fight alone). In &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; can be battled with the follower as normal.\nKormac the Templar.\n&lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt; is primarily a melee warrior who can be built into a tank to support weaker classes. However, he can also be turned into a healer if you do not require a tank.\nThe Templar is not a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;; he is a new type of righteous warrior in the Diablo universe with differing ethics and ideals.\nBackground.\nThe Templars are holy warriors, fighting for justice and eschewing the dangers that lead to cultism and demonic possession by espousing self-denial. They do not merely pay lip service to protecting the realm; they are battle-trained and experienced to a man, and the brooding, dedicated Kormac is a paragon among them.\nKormac came to the order as a young man, and was quickly molded into the ideal Templar, adapting naturally to an ascetic way of life. His devotion is particularly unshakable, even for one of his order, and, despite his respect for battle prowess, his disdain for those who don't share his high moral standards is readily apparent.\nThough Kormac's ways will not always be your own, your aims and goals align, and so he will fight alongside you to purge the world of the insidious darkness that would hide from the light of &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;.\nKormac gradually falls in love with Eirena the Enchantress and is in constant conflict with Lyndon the Scoundrel.\nLyndon the Scoundrel.\n&lt;a href=\"Lyndon\"&gt;Lyndon&lt;/a&gt; is primarily a scoundrel, arguably comparable to the original &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; class in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;. He has some other tricks as well, like blinding powder to disable foes.\nThe Scoundrel is meant to be a humorous and sarcastic\u00a0character, as would suit his title.\nBackground.\nWhere strife festers, opportunists are rarely far behind. A land caught between the High Heavens and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; overflows with rogues and rakes, and both of those words certainly describe Lyndon.\nThe recent years of his whirlwind existence have been spent running from place to place, conning locals, seducing ladies, and relieving the unwitting of their drink and money. The threat of imprisonment or an armed guard has never dissuaded Lyndon from living a life of larceny.\nDedicating himself to a conflict against an endless stream of cruel demons and rampaging beasts seems out of character for a man so outwardly charming and unhesitatingly selfish. There must be more to Lyndon than his lust for wine, women and wealth. Mustn't there?\nEirena the Enchantress.\n&lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt; is primarily a magic caster, but she will also be able to cast spells on the player to enhance them temporarily.\nShe is neither a &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; nor a &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, but comes from a society called the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Hand of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nEirena\u2019s mastery of enchantments and steely bravery in battle belie her youth \u2013 but the truth of her origin reconciles these qualities.\nEirena hails from the distant era of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, where she was part of a clandestine sisterhood of magic-users known as the Hand of the Prophet. When the leader of the sisterhood, the eponymous &lt;a href=\"Prophet\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, foresaw a great disaster that would occur fifteen hundred years in the future, Eirena and her sisters pledged their lives to preventing the tragedy. The sisters\u2019 pledges were far from mere words, and the Prophet placed the entire sisterhood in a magical slumber to preserve them until the appointed time.\nRecently, Eirena awoke to find herself in a world of portents and turmoil, a land vastly changed from the one she remembers. Her sisters are dead, and the Prophet is nowhere to be found.\nDespite the shock of her situation, Eirena\u2019s purpose is clear: she has given herself over to a new age in the hopes that she will discover its salvation. Could her uncommon magic prove to be the key that will help you expel demon-kind from Sanctuary?\nTemporary Followers.\nIn-game, a variety of characters join the player as temporary followers at scripted points in the story, in addition to whatever normal follower is assigned. Temporary followers follow the player, attack enemies and can be affected by buffs, but are invulnerable, and will leave and re-enter the party as the story dictates. &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%20Eamon\"&gt;Haedrig Eamon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Shen\"&gt;Covetous Shen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Myriam%20Jahzia\"&gt;Myriam Jahzia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; serve as temporary followers at various points in the story, as do the three actual followers in the quests immediately preceding their formally joining the party. &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; is an unusual temporary follower who shows up only when he has something to say, and does not attack enemies.\nEmanate.\nPatch 2.7.0 introduced a new revamp for the Follower system. \nPlayers can now equip Followers with a total of 14 different item slots which include the Follower Relic Items, &lt;a href=\"Helm\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shoulders\"&gt;Shoulders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chest%20Armor\"&gt;Chest Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gloves\"&gt;Gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bracers\"&gt;Bracers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belt\"&gt;Belt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rings\"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neck\"&gt;Neck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pants\"&gt;Pants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boots\"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt;, main-hand and off-hand weapons. \nEmanate allows the player to gain the intended effect of certain \"non-combat\" Legendary Powers and Set Bonuses when equipped on the hired Follower. The current list of items with Emanate capabilities are the following:\nNote that none of these properties will work while the follower is incapacitated, so ensuring with an item that makes them invunerable (&lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20Favor\"&gt;Enchanting Favor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Smoking%20Thurible\"&gt;Smoking Thurible&lt;/a&gt;) is important.\nAlso note that the only way for a Follower to benefit from &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Royal%20Grandeur\"&gt;Ring of Royal Grandeur&lt;/a&gt; is to directly equip it on them, the Follower doesn't gain the ring's effect if it is equipped on the player or in the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nIn an early concept of \"Diablo III\", followers were more akin to hirelings, in that they could be hired, and could be permanently killed."}

It was once inhabited by &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt;. For her cruel deeds, she was buried alive, and her castle fell into ruin. By the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, all that remained of the castle was a single solitary tower, looming over the wilderness like a monument to evil. An epic poem was written about the tower, about how much sorrow one could stand there. The tower was not only dangerous due to its state of disrepair; once inside, many succumbed to a vile miasma. Reportedly, several &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; perished once a staircase collapsed on them. Through means unknown, the Countess emerged, but was slain by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; inside her tower, and its riches were plundered. \nThe Bloodsworn.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;Six years later&lt;/a&gt;, the Countess returned once again, and resided within the tower. Dwelling within a pool of blood, fed to her by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, parts of the tower became overgrown with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Creeper\"&gt;Dark Creeper&lt;/a&gt; vines.\nThe tower became the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;. The strongest of their number were stationed in the tower, acting as bodyguards to the Countess. The &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; launched an assault against the tower, but the attack faltered, such was the ferocity of the Bloodsworn's defense. &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Another group&lt;/a&gt; of heroes came to the tower, slaying any Bloodsworn hat got in their way, though the Bloodsworn engaged in a &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood ritual&lt;/a&gt; that the hero(es) failed to stop, which resulted in the resurrection of the Countess.

They are commonly seen under the command of a &lt;a href=\"Castigator%20%28Demon%29\"&gt;Castigator&lt;/a&gt;. They attack at range by throwing balls of hot metal from their bags. These balls &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time%23burn\"&gt;burn&lt;/a&gt; the player if they hit. Wherever they land, they form puddles of molten metal that cause &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage."}

The Peaks are home to craggy steppes and snow-laden pathways, creating an unforgiving landscape rife with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to slay and secrets to discover. Rocky, mountainous surroundings have kept most visitors away from this frozen landscape, which are dotted with crumbling ruins and ancient cathedrals, and a blistering cold saturates the entire region.\nHowever, some call the Peaks home, but they live in a state of constant anxiety; the sense that something is waiting to prey on them when any moment of weakness strikes. When the sun goes down inside the Peaks, the people hunker down in their &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s. Any who are caught outside at night are as good as dead, for if they don't fall prey to &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s, the cold will kill them. In the Fractured Peaks, people cling to flickers of light and faith alike.\nGood ale can be a rare commodity in the Fractured Peaks, as arable land for grain is at a premium, and the growing season is short. The best ale found in the peaks is usually imported from the lowlands near &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Peaks are also the home to a group of religious zealots; devout monks seeking refuge in the isolation of the Peaks to find enlightenment. Their fervant belief in their higher powers keeps them feeling warm and safe during the night, but has left them completely ignorant of the dangers that are slowly, slowly encroaching upon them.\nSnowmelt from the Peaks feeds the swamps of Hawezar. Numerous waterfalls can be seen in the Peaks' south.\nHistory.\nThe history of the Fractured Peaks goes back centuries, if not millennia. At some point, the Peaks was home to a culture (or cultures) that had a faith that &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; speculated may have been a northern variant of &lt;a href=\"Skatsim\"&gt;Skatsim&lt;/a&gt;. Places of worship were erected to this religion, which in turn, Lorath speculated, were built on even older ruins of a people long since vanished.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, the Peaks came under control of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, which operated out of &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;. It strove to assert its dominance over the people, to make them more subservient and accountable to the Church. The Peaks' &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s paid tithes to the Cathedral, and the Cathedral tore down the old ruins that dotted the Peaks, to erect new structures for their own worship such as the &lt;a href=\"Altars%20of%20Illumination\"&gt;Altars of Illumination&lt;/a&gt;. Shrines dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; were also erected all over the Peaks.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; plague was sweeping through the Peaks. It started small; nameless people that no-one would miss, their throats torn open. The Cathedral ignored the killings, even as fear mounted like the bodies. The desperate and the brave fought back against the vampires, but they were too late, either slain, or turned into &lt;a href=\"thrall\"&gt;thrall&lt;/a&gt;s. \nAs winter descended on the Peaks, the &lt;a href=\"Midwinter%20Blight\"&gt;Midwinter Blight&lt;/a&gt; occurred in the Peaks, disrupting any cheer the Peaks' denizens had managed to scrounge for themselves.\nIn-game.\nThe Fractured Peaks are one of the six main geographic areas that can be explored in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". It is the starting zone for the game. The region features 25 main quests, along with 25 side quests to complete.\nNotable Locations.\n\"Main article: \nRegions.\nThe Fractured Peaks is divided into the following major regions:"}

It will next run in &lt;a href=\"Season%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 32, from October 18 to 25, 2024.\nLore.\nThe Fractured Plane is a \"shattered reflection of the mind.\" While the Plane appears to be a very real place, it is implied that it appears differently to all those who enter it. Some minds are crushed by such an act.\nAt least two individuals are known to have entered the Plane. The first was &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, who entered it through the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sumina%20Glass\"&gt;Sumina Glass&lt;/a&gt;. Centuries later, this process was repeated by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;, with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt;. Cain advised them that while entering the Plane carried risk, it could aid them in their fight against &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, they were able to unshackle their mind from the realm.\nGameplay.\nFractured Plane consists of a 12-floor gauntlet that players enter without their usual gear, gems, and skills. Instead, they are provided with a set of pre-selected skills. As players progress, they earn &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Coin\"&gt;Chaos Coin&lt;/a&gt;s. Unstable &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; drop, and the items received complement the skills the player is given. When the session ends, all the collected gear will vanish.\nEach floor of the Fractured Plane consists of various rooms linked by bridges. Players must beat the current room and then step on one of the circles at the end of a bridge to activate the room on the other side. It is possible to complete all rooms on a floor this way, but the player is free to move on to the next floor after completing the final room that contains a portal.\nThe rooms can be of the following types:\nOne of the rooms is designated as the final room that spawns a portal to the next floor on completion. Warping to the next floor converts all unequipped items into Chaos Coins.\nChaotic Chests containing random gear can be obtained by completing floors 4, 8 and 12.\nIf players make it to the last floor without dying more than five times, they receive a reward. Out of all the Legendary items encountered during the run, players can select six, and out of those six, players will receive one of them at random.\nHistory.\nFractured Plane was introduced in 13. \nBefore the September 21 2023 update, the number of floors was 15 instead of 12, Challenge Rooms had a lower chance of appearing, and Chaotic Chests could only be obtained once.\nCrimson Plane.\nWith the release of the class, a version of Fractured Plane called the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Plane\"&gt;Crimson Plane&lt;/a&gt; was active, between July 13\u2013August 2, 2023. During this version of the event, the player's build was that of a Blood Knight instead of one for their current class.\nDarkling Plane.\nOn the launch of the &lt;a href=\"Splintered%20Souls\"&gt;Splintered Souls&lt;/a&gt; update, a version of Fractured Plane called The &lt;a href=\"Darkling%20Plane\"&gt;Darkling Plane&lt;/a&gt; was active, between Dec 14-28 2023. During this version of the event, a random was selected for use every time the player started the Fractured Plane.\nThe Deluged Plane.\nOn the launch of the &lt;a href=\"Unending%20Storm\"&gt;Unending Storm&lt;/a&gt; update, a version of Fractured Plane called The Deluged Plane was active, between May 23 and June 13, 2024. During this version of the event, the player's build was that of a &lt;a href=\"Tempest\"&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt; instead of one for their current class.\nDevelopment.\nThe Fractured Plane was originally a limited-time event. It was introduced in 2022, and ran again from January 16, 3:00 a.m.\u2013February 6, 2:59 a.m. server time.\nThe event was created to invite players to try new skills and Legendary items that they might not typically use. The developers wanted to provide players with an opportunity to start from scratch to see how well they can play their class no matter the circumstances."}

It would not be the first time, as since both were \"men of travel and adventure,\" they crossed paths frequently. Burroughs was included in al-Hazir's account of his travels in &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Xiansai%20Chronicles\"&gt;Xiansai Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEncounter with Burrowing Death.\nBurroughs was frequently called upon to hunt &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Thresher\"&gt;Dune Thresher&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;, when one of their number came too close to civilization. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Burroughs was hunting one such creature when al-Hazir, having left &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; on a journey of his own, asked if he might join him on the hunt. He acted reluctant at first, but in reality he was happy to have al-Hazir along. They met up at dusk upon rocks that bordered the &lt;a href=\"Tardein\"&gt;Tardein&lt;/a&gt; wastes. Burroughs pointed him to a corpse of an unfortunate &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; who had run afoul of the creature, and dispelled al-Hazir's notion that staying on the rocks would keep them safe. To lure the beast out, Burroughs opened a cage of &lt;a href=\"Scavenger%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Scavengers&lt;/a&gt;, releasing them onto the sands with ropes attached to their necks. Almost instantly, the Thresher erupted upwards, closing its mouth around them. Akin to how one might reel in a fish, Burroughs kept his grip on the ropes, but he wasn't pulling, just holding on. After several seconds, the rope stopped jerking. Then, he began to reel it in.\nAs he did so, al-Hazir could see that the Scavengers had been swallowed whole by the Thresher, but they in turn had clawed their way out of it from the creature's inside. One of the creatures was even still alive. Burroughs, laughing at al-Hazir's unease, cut off the Scavenger's head and began lecturing him on the Dune Thresher. al-Hazir could only nod his head and listen as long as politeness dictated."}

It is a more potent (or, in a manner of speaking, extreme) variant of &lt;a href=\"Chill\"&gt;Chill&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe idea is that the target is frozen solid, unable to move and trapped inside the icy tomb, able to do nothing but watch their enemy approaching with the doubtless intention to shatter the frozen victim into pieces. This does not necessarily mean that the victim is going to die: &lt;a href=\"Anya\"&gt;Anya&lt;/a&gt; survived several days of being chained by the freezing curse &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; has put on her, and recovered instantly when the curse was removed. In both games, a target that was frozen, but not dead, continues to fight normally when they thaw (even though their blood vessels should be torn apart by the blood turned ice).\nFreeze can only happen as a result of unsaved &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Damage\"&gt;Cold Damage&lt;/a&gt; that is specifically stated to be able to Freeze target (while to Chill the victim, any Cold attack will suffice), or a special effect directly stating that it can Freeze an enemy.\nDiablo II.\nThe Frozen target is blue in color and paralyzed completely, and if they die from the freezing attack, or die before the Freeze wears off, they shatter into pieces and &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;leave no corpse&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially useful when fighting monsters that can be resurrected, such as &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;. Freezing enemies is not recommended for &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and for most builds connected to corpses.\nThe Frozen victim may not attack, move or cast spells. &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;Act Boss&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; monsters, &lt;a href=\"Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; monsters, and other players cannot be frozen; they will, instead, be Chilled. Some items in game have the &lt;a href=\"Half%20Freeze%20Duration\"&gt;Half Freeze Duration&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"Cannot%20Be%20Frozen\"&gt;Cannot Be Frozen&lt;/a&gt; traits, and cold &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; reduces duration of any Freeze effect. Some monsters, including &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Horror\"&gt;Frozen Horror&lt;/a&gt;s, are entirely immune to Freeze.\nSkills with the Freezing effect are &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Spike\"&gt;Glacial Spike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Blast\"&gt;Ice Blast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Armor\"&gt;Frozen Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Arrow\"&gt;Ice Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Arrow\"&gt;Freezing Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Strike\"&gt;Phoenix Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Blades of Ice&lt;/a&gt;. Freeze usually has a shorter length than Chill, but is considered a different effect than &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormulas.\nChance of freeze / chill is ( 50 + (AttackerLevel + (B*4) - DefenderLevel) * 5 )%\nB = item bonus (usually is 1). If you use freezing in ranged attack, then AL is decreasing by 6 and chance divides by 3. Duration = (chance - roll) * 2 + 25 frames,\u00a0Duration ranges from 25 frames (1 second) to maximum of 250 frames (10 seconds).\nDiablo Immortal.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", Freeze is normally caused by taking continuous &lt;a href=\"cold\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; damage from specific monsters. A player under this effect is encased in a block of ice and immobilized for seconds. It occurs when a player is under the effect of &lt;a href=\"chill\"&gt;chill&lt;/a&gt;, stacked times.\nSome attacks can instantly freeze the player (eg stalactites in the &lt;a href=\"Cavern%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Cavern of Echoes&lt;/a&gt;).\nDiablo III.\nIn Diablo III, Freeze is still associated with Cold damage, and can only happen as result of certain Cold skills (mostly ones used by &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s). The guaranteed shatter on death is gone and replaced with &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt; mechanics: a victim killed by a Cold Critical Hit is shattered into pieces of frozen flesh (or whatever substance they are made of).\nPlayers can be frozen just like monsters, but the duration of all types of duration is reduced by the Crowd Control resistance or by the\u00a0\"reduces duration of control impairing effects\" stat. &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Climbers\"&gt;Ice Climbers&lt;/a&gt; can even make target completely immune to Freeze and &lt;a href=\"Immobilize\"&gt;Immobilize&lt;/a&gt; effects. Being immune to Cold damage (that is, wearing the &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20of%20Aranoch\"&gt;Talisman of Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;) does not prevent the character from being frozen. In addition, most skills with guaranteed Freeze have a limit on how often they can Freeze the same target (usually once every 5 seconds).\n&lt;a href=\"Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; monsters may have a &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20III%29%23Frozen\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt; trait. &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; also freezes players in combat several times.\n&lt;a href=\"Frostburn%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Frostburn&lt;/a&gt; gloves have a chance to Freeze target with \"any\" Cold damage for 1 second. Another item with an interesting synergy for Freeze is &lt;a href=\"Rimeheart\"&gt;Rimeheart&lt;/a&gt;, which may inflict massive Cold damage on a Frozen enemy.\nDiablo IV.\nIn Diablo IV, Freeze has an additional functionality of applying automatically if enough &lt;a href=\"Chill\"&gt;Chill&lt;/a&gt; effects are stacked on the same target: whenever Chill reaches 100%, the enemy is Frozen.\nAn enemy killed while Frozen is automatically &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;shattered&lt;/a&gt;, leaving no corpse, regardless of what has killed him in the end."}

This powerful attack has an area of effect damage and freezing ability, making it useful for dealing with multiple enemies.\nFreezing Arrow is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Spike\"&gt;Glacial Spike&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in that it hits and freezes a small area of effect upon impact.\u00a0Other players, bosses, and super uniques will be\u00a0&lt;a href=\"chill\"&gt;chill&lt;/a&gt;ed, not frozen.\u00a0Freezing Arrow can be a bit more powerful however because in addition to the base arrow damage, it also works with &lt;a href=\"Pierce\"&gt;Pierce&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt;, and any equipment modifiers such as &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreezing Arrow is less useful in &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, where\u00a0Cold Length Durations are reduced. On Hell the freeze lasts only 0.5 seconds. For a fast bow, however, this is enough to keep most monsters from moving very far. Unlike its fire-based equivalent, &lt;a href=\"Immolation%20Arrow\"&gt;Immolation Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, Freezing Arrow has no &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;.\nCold damage items have a \"hidden\" chill duration. This chill duration gets added to the freezing time of Freezing Arrow.\u00a0 This additional time is added \"after\" the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Arrow\"&gt;Ice Arrow&lt;/a&gt; synergy bonus. Stockpiling on small &lt;a href=\"Charms\"&gt;Charms&lt;/a&gt; of cold damage, regardless of the amount of actual damage on the small charm, adds 1 second, which in Hell difficulty is reduced to 0.25 seconds. Ice Arrow, on the other hand, only adds 0.10 seconds per level. Generally, a single small charm of cold damage is worth 10 hard points in Ice Arrow. The cold damage from such items are also added to the \"explosion\" itself, although obtaining external cold damage is much harder than fire.\nSkill Progression.\nFreeze Duration: 2 seconds\nFreeze Radius: 3.3 yards"}

The maximum amount of Frenzy one can accumulate is also limited by the relatively low duration of just six seconds (which can be increased by the &lt;a href=\"Increased%20Stamina\"&gt;Increased Stamina&lt;/a&gt; synergy): short duration of the buff makes it very hard to preserve when out of direct combat.\nAs Frenzy has &lt;a href=\"Berserk%20%28Skill%29\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; as a synergy, dual-wielding Barbarians can have access to some &lt;a href=\"Magic%20damage\"&gt;Magic damage&lt;/a&gt; after enough points have been allocated, allowing them to destroy &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Immune\"&gt;Immune&lt;/a&gt; monsters within a reasonable amount of time while not suffering the drawback of destroying their\u00a0&lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt;s to the point of suffering from almost every hit.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 3\nDuration: 6 seconds"}

Although less damaging than its electrical kin, the immobilizing effects of the cold can convey other advantages. \"\nGeneral Information.\nA Cold version of the spell, Frost Nova does less damage, but chills and slows surrounding enemies. Although Frost Nova is an excellent way of slowing down crowds and giving breathing room for the caster, damage dealt is very low, and it won't consistently kill past the early stages of &lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt; unless considerable amounts of skill points are put into it. The cold length is considerably long, even in mode; when surrounded by large groups of swift enemies, Frost Nova can be cast to slow them down, after which a more powerful spell can then be used to finish off the immobilized foes.\nPoints spent in Blizzard and Frozen Orb &lt;a href=\"Synergies\"&gt;synergize&lt;/a&gt;, or add damage to, Frost Nova; Frost Nova only synergizes with &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Bolt\"&gt;Ice Bolt&lt;/a&gt;. Frost Nova does almost twice as damage as Ice Bolt with no points spent in synergies. Due to average synergy percentage and low number of synergies compared with Ice Bolt's high synergy % and 5 synergies, this relationship is reversed if both are fully synergized, Ice Bolt doing roughly 1.5 times as much damage as Frost Nova. Due to its high base damage, the Blizzard spell does 5 times more damage than Frost Nova when both are fully synergized.\n&lt;a href=\"Cold%20Enchanted\"&gt;Cold Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; monsters release Cold Nova upon death."}

With other characters this might be difficult to achieve, even with a , but with Druids, this should be no problem. One great thing about this build up is that you can spend most of your skill points on &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, without fearing that the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Attack Rating&lt;/a&gt; will be low even when your &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; is minimal.\nStats.\nStr: To wear desired items\nDex: To wear desired items.

Even with all the attack rating boosts from other skills, it can be difficult hitting monsters. On the other hand, a hit point boost is always helpful. That decision belongs to the player.\nSecondary Skills and Prerequisites.\n&lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; (20): The attack speed increase drops off after level 5, but there is the attack rating boost which remains linear.

Additionally, the bonus to walk/run speed can help provide some extra mobility. At max level it has a high cap of 88% life steal.

Typically, most choose the Act 2 Defensive &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; (the \"Holy Freeze Merc\") or the Offensive version (the \"Might Merc\"), but the others have plenty of potential if geared properly. The Helmet and Armor are standard choices, the only thing that would vary are the weapons. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Act 3 Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; with cold attacks used to be popular, but are rare now due to many monsters being immune to their attacks. Although &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarian Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are quite rugged, they can be overcome by large mobs.

She was proficient in &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, able to cast it, and sense the magic of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiography.\nAranoch.\nGaleona served Malevolyn while his army resided at the northern tip of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Having obtained the helmet of &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;, Malevolyn sought the armor. Every morning, Malevolyn went to Galeona, seeking portents of the future. In turn, every evening, Galeona visited his tent for \"personal matters.\" What he didn't know was that she was also working with &lt;a href=\"Xazax\"&gt;Xazax&lt;/a&gt;, a servant of &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, who was also seeking the armor. She intended to manipulate both of them to her own ends.\nOne day, Malevolyn told her of a dream he had received, how he had seen the armor of Bartuc being worn by a man. Casting her &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, Galeona claimed that \"&lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; calls to blood,\" seeing a &lt;a href=\"Norrec%20Vizharan\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; in the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt;. She could not identify who this man was, or where he was exactly, but believed he was heading in their direction\u2014perhaps the helm and armor of Bartuc were calling out to each other. He left her tent, leaving Galeona to ponder her future. She'd seen that Malevolyn had become more unstable of late, and that he was wearing the helm more. Once, she'd caught him speaking as if he were truly Bartuc himself. She knew that the helm and likely the armor possessed some kind of magical force, but so far, she'd been unable to identify or control it. If she \"could\" control it, however, she wouldn't need Malevolyn.\nAwhile later, Galeona was woken by by Xazax, who was slinking around her tent. He claimed he was only studying the helmet. Galeona tried to get more information out of him, but none was forthcoming.\nEventually, Malevolyn confronted her. They were still in Aranoch, his men were growing restless, and there was no sign of the one carrying Bartuc's armor. He subtly threatened to have her killed if he didn't make good on her earlier promises. Placating him, she asked for one who had disappointed him of late. Malevolyn nominated Captain &lt;a href=\"Tolos\"&gt;Tolos&lt;/a&gt;. He entered her tent, where, at her bidding, Xazax killed him. She performed a ritual through Tolos's corpse where she and Xazax summoned a &lt;a href=\"Dreamer\"&gt;Dreamer&lt;/a&gt;. Through the being, they were able to find their quarry, who was sailing on the \"&lt;a href=\"Hawksfire\"&gt;Hawksfire&lt;/a&gt;\". Appearing as a translucent being, she managed to get his name (Norrec). However, Xazax proved too eager, and accidentally revealed himself to Norrec, breaking the connection. They could not summon the Dreamer back, and while perhaps Malevolyn could give her a second lackey for human sacrifice, she instead focused her thoughts on Norrec's words. He had mentioned he sailed to a place named \"Lut.\" It didn't take her long to realize that he was referring to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. She headed off to tell Malevolyn. After all, she reflected, he'd long since sought to conquer that city.\nMalevolyn gave the order for the camp to be struck, and to head towards the city. Returning to her tent, she found that Xazax wasn't to be found. At least not intially. He returned, but refused to answer her questions as to where he'd been. He almost slew her in his rage, but drew back. Galeona was perturbed that Xaxaz had been willing to break their pact, but also noticed that the demon seemed frightened of something.\nLut Gholein.\nMalevolyn led his army into Aranoch. Galeona traveled at his size, using her magic to provide illumination as they traveled through the night. Despite her queries, he remained convinced that the helmet and armor would work for him. He made mention of &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;his brother&lt;/a&gt;, of how this time, &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt; would fall. In essence, recounting the final battle of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. She used the magic of one of her &lt;a href=\"rings\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt; to probe the armor, escapling Malevolyn's notice. Her hand was burnt as a result of the helmet's enchantments, leaving a permenant scar, and reducing the ring to slag. Malevolyn didn't notice, but she noted that the helmet had never reacted so violently before. She'd assumed up until now that the armor's power was due to Bartuc's enchantments, but now she wondered if Bartuc himself sought to return from the dead.\nAs they neared Lut Gholein days later, Galeona noticed that Malevolyn's mood had brightened, as if he had already succeeded in his goals. This gave her cause for concern. She suspected that this was due to Xazax somehow, whom she had barely seen recently. She guessed that Xazax was trying to manipulate Malevolyn directly. Still, Xaxaz had to remain far away from the caravan during the day, lest he be discovered, which gave her time to look for Norrec directly. She headed out into the desert, and used her magic to locate him.\nA day out from Lut Gholein, Malevolyn made a pact with Xazax, making his army a demonic one. Galeona had slipped out beforehand, but sensed the hellish emminations regardless. She used her magic to follow Norrec, who she knew had ridden out into the desert from Lut Gholein. She intended to manipulate Norrec in the same way that she'd tried to manipulate Malevolyn, feeding him the idea that he could control the armor, while she remained the puppet master. Eventually, she found him, and played the role of a helpless woman looking for aid. Norrec wasn't the fool she'd anticipated him to be, but he did buy her story, and let slip that he could use the aid of a Sorceress in regards to the armor he was wearing. He revealed that he was looking for the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, the tomb of his \"brother.\" Of Horazon, speaking as if he himself was Bartuc.\nGaleona helped Norrec navigate the Sanctuary. But, when the Sanctuary started falling apart, she foolishly tried to save herself by leaving Norrec to die. Norrec, possessed by the armor, became enraged at his betrayal, and the armor retaliated against her, casting a powerful spell at her. She tried to defend herself with her own spell, but she failed. The armor's spell killed her."}

{"id": "3052", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3052", "title": "Gamble", "text": "Gambling is a special form of purchasing &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; in which only the general item type is known, but the exact item received is unknown until the purchase is completed. The item quality received is often unremarkable, but has a chance to be excellent. Gambling can only be done with specific NPCs.\nDiablo.\nA player can pay 50 &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; pieces to &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt; to see what item he's selling. Note that this fee only includes the opportunity to \"know \"what he is selling; they still must purchase it for an additional price. Paying again does not reset the product.\nMany players choose to save before paying, loading the game if they do not like the result.\nDiablo II.\nA player can interact with an NPC and select the \"Gamble\" menu. They will see a window with &lt;a href=\"Unidentified%20Items\"&gt;Unidentified Items&lt;/a&gt;. After spending some money on a specific item (by right-clicking on it) the item gets &lt;a href=\"identify\"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; and you will know what its stats are. Many players regard this to be a waste of money due to the existence of \"runs\". On the other hand, if you have more &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; than fits in your stash, it may be a good move, since you may lose any extra money dying, and may potentially gain a powerful item gambling.\nMechanics.\nTo figure out at what Character levels a base item type will be available for Gambling, subtract 4 from the item's quality level, for having a chance to upgrade to &lt;a href=\"Exceptional%20Items\"&gt;Exceptional Items&lt;/a&gt; subtract 5, and for &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Items\"&gt;Elite Items&lt;/a&gt; subtract 7. Note: Item types that are not listed are not available for Gambling.\nThe chances for every item quality are:\n&lt;a href=\"Item%20Level\"&gt;Item Level&lt;/a&gt; is determined by &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; and can vary from clvl -5 to clvl + 4. Thus, for best available item &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt;es, the character must have at least level 95, for guaranteed ilvl 90. Items with the best affixes are &lt;a href=\"amulet\"&gt;amulet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"circlet\"&gt;circlet&lt;/a&gt;s with +2 to specific class skills.\nGambling is useful when starting a new melee characters, as once the character has reached certain level (12 for the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt;, 18 for &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, 24 for the &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Docks\"&gt;Kurast Docks&lt;/a&gt;) weapons and armor types that cannot be found otherwise until the next Act begin to appear for gambling, which can be useful if there are no good drops until that point.\nContrary to popular belief, stacking the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Find\"&gt;Magic Find&lt;/a&gt; stats does not increase the chance of finding better quality items through gambling.\nSome character builds are centered around gambling, such as the &lt;a href=\"Horker\"&gt;Horker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20builds\"&gt;Barbarian build&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn LAN &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer\"&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, the items do not reset if more than one player is near the NPC.\nOpening the gambling screen will actually generate all the items shown in the window, even if you never buy them. This means that it may spawn a unique item which prevents it from spawning again in the same game. One may want to leave and re-enter a new game after a prolonged gambling session.\nDiablo III.\nGambling returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", but it requires access to \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s can be provided to &lt;a href=\"Kadala\"&gt;Kadala&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for a choice of an unidentified weapon/item.\nPrices in her store depend on item type, most of the armor costing 25 shards, rings 50, weapons 75, and amulets 100. There is a 10% chance to roll a &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Set\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt; item in her store, and an even smaller set chance for a Legendary Item to be Ancient or Primal, regardless of difficulty or &lt;a href=\"magic%20find\"&gt;magic find&lt;/a&gt;. (Primal Ancient items must still be unlocked as with other Primal drops.) Kadala does not sell items that are only found in &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cache\"&gt;Horadric Cache&lt;/a&gt;s, but will sell\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt;-exclusive items.\nUpon every poor purchase, Kadala will laugh at the player, saying that 'maybe they can find a use for the item they just bought one day... as a paperweight'. She will, however, congratulate them on a good roll.\nIn a manner of speaking, using &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; to upgrade Rare items is a way of Gambling, for players only choose the type of item they want to receive, but the resulting gear is subject to random factor."}

{"id": "50948", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=50948", "title": "Game Mode", "text": "Game modes are a variety of different game types, character settings, and in-game activities that create different forms of play and progression in \"Diablo\" games. Some game modes play very similarly to each other with a few key differences, while others are designed to provide an experience very different from normal gameplay.\nGeneral.\nThe game mode is partly based on what type of character is playing. These decisions are made upon character creation and cannot be changed at will:\nA character is defined by these types in combination, for instance a Hardcore non-Seasonal character. \nAny form of progression involving multiple characters is usually restricted to those of the same type. In this vein, any game session is specifically for one type of character, which prevents trading or combat assistance between different modes. When resources could be shared among multiple characters on an account (in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" and beyond), only those from the same mode are accessible. This prevents \"normal\" characters from helping either Hardcore or Ladder/Seasonal characters in any way, preserving the integrity of those modes.\nThere are other choices of game mode that may or may not be tied to a character type. Common ones include:\nDiablo II.\nThe modes of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" primarily revolve around character choices:\nAny one character is created with a combination of all of these decisions, for instance a Hardcore Realms expansion character, or a normal Ladder non-expansion character.\nCharacters can only start or join a game matching their own mode, except for local characters: they can freely switch between playing on their own computers without connecting to the internet (locally), \"or\" joining &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; games via network methods including \"open Battle.net\". This still preserves the principle that item trading and multiplayer gameplay is possible only among the same mode of characters.\nGameplay is largely the same between all modes. The biggest differences are:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt; may itself be considered a special game mode, since the challenge it provides - facing three powerful bosses at once - cannot be found anywhere else in the game.\n&lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; is possible in any multiplayer game and is called Dueling.\nDiablo III.\nThe modes of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" come in a wider variety of forms than in the previous game.\nThere is a sharp divide between the base game and \"\". Most of the other game modes are only available to players who have purchased the expansion, and there is no option to create a non-expansion character once \"Reaper of Souls\" has been activated on an account.\nCharacter modes.\nThere are six different character modes available during &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;s:\nHardcore status works like in other games. Seasons are the equivalent of Ladders from \"Diablo II\". &lt;a href=\"Solo%20Self%20Found\"&gt;Solo Self Found&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;single-player&lt;/a&gt;-only variation of Seasonal characters, which ceases to apply after the Season ends. All six mode choices are permanent for the season, and have the usual isolation from other character types.\nIn this and subsequent games, all characters are stored on Battle.net and it is not possible to play locally.\n\"Diablo III\" shares a number of progression components between characters of the same mode on an account:\nThis is sometimes called \"account-level\" progression even though it is actually progression within one of the six modes.\nSeasonal characters of all varieties become corresponding non-Seasonal characters at the end of each Season. All Seasonal stash items are sent to the non-Seasonal side of the account at this time; all resources, recipes, Cube powers, Greater Rift unlocks, and transmogs from the season are merged into the non-Seasonal account; all Paragon experience is added to the non-Seasonal total. All of the above is still separated by Hardcore status. The four Seasonal game modes start over from scratch when the next season begins.\nThe overall gameplay feel is similar whether in a Season or not. However, the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Visions%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Visions of Enmity&lt;/a&gt; provide additional power and progression during Seasons, and each Season rotates through additional \"themed\" mechanics which add variety. The &lt;a href=\"Solo%20Self%20Found\"&gt;Solo Self Found&lt;/a&gt; option naturally emphasizes the experience of play without &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; help.\n&lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode again has the same mechanics as normal while encouraging more cautious gameplay. \"Diablo III\" tends to be more forgiving than its predecessor, by including several items and skills to specifically reduce the risk of sudden death.\nGame session modes.\nAny character with the expansion can start a new game session in either &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;. Adventure Mode removes the storyline elements of gameplay and the linear unlocking of areas, and adds numerous other gameplay options, zones, and opportunities.\nPlayers may also start a &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Rift\"&gt;Challenge Rift&lt;/a&gt; game. In this mode, players do not play their own characters at all, and there is no character progression. Instead they control another player's character, selected once per week by Blizzard from among all characters that recently completed a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to beat the rift faster than the original run was completed, rewarding a cache sent to the actual characters on the account via in-game mail. Challenge Rifts can be completed solo or with a group.\nIn-game modes.\nAfter a game session has been started, the character is free to explore and fight through the normal game world mostly as it appears in &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt;. However, several special areas and challenges are available which provide game experiences quite different from normal:\nAll other \"in-game modes\" are only available in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; games:"}

In a very remote way, Gamuel reminded Inarius of his former self. Gamuel also hinted at a darker background and revealed he had at a time been a mercenary.
