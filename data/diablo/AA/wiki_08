It does not pick up items dropped from a character's &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, nor those intended for &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;.

The Cube recipe book does not list this option - the Ring is simply placed in the Cube and transmuted. The Vault is a short level filled with treasure and a few enemies including several &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, ending with a fight against &lt;a href=\"Greed%20%28Demon%29\"&gt;Greed&lt;/a&gt;. \"Vault runs\" from lower-level rings do not yield as many riches, regardless of character level.

This is no longer possible on the current PC version.\nPrior to the \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" era, the legendary power granted a chance to spawn a normal, enemy &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt; when the character was hit by monsters. The chance was very low - it could take several minutes of being hit repeatedly by a crowd of enemies before the goblin would appear. The power worked on &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt; and the goblin scaled its loot to the current &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, in December that year, Wilson announced the team was shelving the Arena feature, citing a lack of depth and compelling reasons to play a team deathmatch mode for more than a few hours, and noting that the PvE nature of \"Diablo\" which has always taken precedence made class balance difficult. He reassured fans of dueling from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" that a dueling option would be available in the upcoming . Patch 1.0.7 did indeed introduce Brawling in the Scorched Chapel.

Note that this pit is impassable for the player, but counts as clear terrain for the spider queen, so circling kiting will not work for this fight.\nDuring the fight, she will leave this area to hide (when she loses 25% and 50% of health), summoning her minions (five Brood Daughters) to fight you, returning when they are killed. The queen attacks by either biting the player or pouring poison (latter is a channeled attack), and can summon Plagued pools at will.

Before his fall to madness, Leoric loved her deeply. Asylla was known for her beauty. She had a thousand gowns of a lovely pink, gifted to her by Leoric all at once.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Leoric was seized by madness. Convinced by &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; that Asylla was conspiring against him, Leoric decided to imprison of his wife, confining her in his dungeons. She knew her death was imminent, yet feared for &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;her&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;sons&lt;/a&gt; more.\u00a0\nThe king eventually had her executed by guillotine. In her last moments, Asylla calmly maintained her innocence in the face of her husband's groundless accusations, but she was nonetheless beheaded, with &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; claiming that she had lied to the very end. Following her beheading, her remains did not decay, apparent proof that she was a pure &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; wrongly executed. The queen's bitter confusion about the circumstances of her death remain forever etched on her features, and those who see her vacant stare often found themselves transfixed by it. Her body was interred in &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, though the location of her tomb was kept secret, so that no-one would disturb her rest. Only her &lt;a href=\"Handmaiden%27s%20Spirit\"&gt;handmaiden&lt;/a&gt; knew its location. Her spirit however, was bound to the site of her execution, unable to move on.\nUndeath.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the rogue &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lethes\"&gt;Lethes&lt;/a&gt; tried to summon Asylla's spirit. She believed that in doing so, she would be led to Leoric, and thus be able to claim the Mad King's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; as her own. She found Asylla's handmaiden, tortured the location out of her, and then killed her. She found Asylla's tomb and apparently moved her body to the grounds of Ashwold Manor, where she began summoning her spirit, and in doing so, established a tether to Leoric's &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt;. The summoning was slowed by &lt;a href=\"Xul\"&gt;Xul&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Asylla was found haunting the prisons beneath her former &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt;, holding her own head in a stretched arm. &lt;a href=\"Li-Ming\"&gt;Li-Ming&lt;/a&gt; noted that by all rights, she should be terrified, but that the ghost of the queen carried such sadness with her. Asylla informed &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; of her servants' souls being kept tortured and imprisoned. Once they were freed, the ghost of the queen directed the heroes to &lt;a href=\"The%20Warden\"&gt;The Warden&lt;/a&gt;, and asked they end his evil forever.\nThe Nephalem would later witness the ghostly re-enactment of Asylla's last moments.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nAsylla appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" in cinematics of &lt;a href=\"Mad%20King%27s%20Breach\"&gt;Mad King's Breach&lt;/a&gt;.

Though there is only a finite number of unique quests, each new game generates a random selection of quests. Therefore if players create a new game they might encounter different quests.\nDiablo II quests.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", the quests are a series of missions of which most are integral to proceeding in the single-player game. For example, without the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt;, the Heart, Eye and Brain, and the Flail, the single-player character cannot get beyond the Third Act City. However, in multi-player, an advanced character can open a town portal from a &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; beyond the blocked part, enabling a less-experienced player to bypass the quest entirely. Each &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt; has 6 quests, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"The%20Harrowing\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt;, which has only three. Certain quests can be bypassed as they require finding a specific non-essential item, such as the &lt;a href=\"Tools%20of%20the%20Trade%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Tools of the Trade&lt;/a&gt; Quest, but skipping or failing to complete these quests often result in losing out on permanent bonuses.\nDiablo III quests.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" promised to bring more interactive quests that will be much more rewarding. They tie in closely to the idea of randomness - when replaying the game, the player will most likely get to find quests that were not available to them before."}

Upon his &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, per Horadric rites, he was mummified and buried in &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;Centuries later&lt;/a&gt;, Radament awakened, left his tomb, and made his lair to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. At first the creature raided the town at night, and among his victims were &lt;a href=\"Atma\"&gt;Atma&lt;/a&gt;'s husband and son. Eventually, Radament was barricaded within the sewers. However, he still took victims, hacking off their limbs. Some of the victims washed up in the city's sewers, often missing limbs or a head, and their bodies had always been skinned. Every now and then, a would-be hero headed into the sewers to confront him, but failed to slay the creature. The town's &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenaries\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; planned to send an organized group into the sewers to kill the creature, but with the trouble plaguing the desert, they couldn't afford the chance of losing any men.\nAt Atma's request, a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; ventured into the sewers and slew Radament, giving Atma some measure of peace. &lt;a href=\"Drognan\"&gt;Drognan&lt;/a&gt; speculated that Radament was bent on reviving his own &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt; with the flesh of the living; most unusual behavior.

In the sewers below our city, there lurks a horrid creature that hungers for human flesh. The creature has killed many, including my son and my husband. If you destroy it, I will reward you. Please be careful though, that beast has taken enough from us already. The sewer entrance is through the trap door just up the street.\"\nRadament's Lair is located on the third level of the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Act%20II%29\"&gt;Sewers&lt;/a&gt;. Players will know they're getting close to &lt;a href=\"Radament\"&gt;Radament&lt;/a&gt; when the quest notification pops up, telling them to kill Radament. Another tell-tale sign of proximity to Radament is when the player starts encountering the black-colored &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Horror&lt;/a&gt; minions. All other skeletons encountered in the sewers are colored red.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Radament\"&gt;Radament&lt;/a&gt; dies, bolts of holy energy start shooting down from his body, which will also finish off any remaining undead in the immediate area. Radament drops a unique tome named the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Skill\"&gt;Book of Skill&lt;/a&gt;, which grants the player an extra skill point. Repeatedly killing Radament after the quest has been completed does \"not\" yield more Books of Skill. Also, the glowing chest found nearby holds the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Scroll\"&gt;Horadric Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to activate the next quest, &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Staff%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Horadric Staff&lt;/a&gt;.

It will prove invaluable should players accidentally die and wish to get back into the fight quickly. \ufeff\n&lt;a href=\"Radament\"&gt;Radament&lt;/a&gt; is surrounded by a horde of skeletal and mummified servants. Disposing of his minions first may prove useful, but in order to prevent Radament from reviving them, it's best to use &lt;a href=\"cold\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; attacks. This will cause the skeletons to freeze and shatter upon death, leaving no corpse to revive. Another strategy is to lure the skeletons away from Radament and kill them out of his sight, but as Radament is &lt;a href=\"Extra%20Fast\"&gt;Extra Fast&lt;/a&gt;, and he does tend to follow players, so be warned. Without his minions to help him, Radament should go down fast. It's most likely that players will get poisoned by his poison breath, so bringing &lt;a href=\"Antidote%20Potion\"&gt;Antidote Potion&lt;/a&gt;s or stacking &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Resistance\"&gt;Poison Resistance&lt;/a&gt; might be a good idea.\nOnce Radament falls, what appears to be a strikes his corpse, sending out waves of holy bolts that should neatly put an end to whatever minions of his are still in the vicinity.\nCharacter Quest Dialogue.\nQuest Completion.\n&lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Atma has been avenged.\""}

During this conflict, Raekor liberated a fellow Barbarian named &lt;a href=\"Joritz%20the%20Mighty\"&gt;Joritz&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Samaurenian\"&gt;Samaurenian&lt;/a&gt; labor camp, and the two fought side by side as the camp was liberated. The two were later married\u2014on the day of the wedding, Joritz gifted her with a &lt;a href=\"Raekor%27s%20Heart\"&gt;magnificent brigadine&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Joritz suffered an untimely death; Raekor took his &lt;a href=\"Raekor%27s%20Breeches\"&gt;breeches&lt;/a&gt; as her own, and wore them for the rest of her life.\nRaekor continued to fight against the Samuren Empire. &lt;a href=\"Loren\"&gt;Loren&lt;/a&gt;, panep of the Samaurenian people, stated that he would crush the Barbarians beneath his &lt;a href=\"Raekor%27s%20Striders\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;. Raekor took great delight in ripping them from his cold, dead feet, and forever after, they were a symbol of Raekor's greatest triumph. \nRaekor fought in the sacking of the Samuren Empire's capital. During the battle, her commander fell. Raekor stripped his &lt;a href=\"Raekor%27s%20Burden\"&gt;spaulders&lt;/a&gt; from his body and donned them herself as she led her tribe's &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s to victory. Upon her being granted the status of warmaster, a set of &lt;a href=\"Raekor%27s%20Wraps\"&gt;ox-leather gloves&lt;/a&gt; were crafted for Raekor to commemorate her ascension to the position.\nRaekor's deeds sparked a change in Barbarian culture. Though Barbarian women were held in high regard as warriors, they were still seen as inferior to their male brethren on the field of battle. With Raekor achieving the status of warmaster, this attitude changed.\nIn-game.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Raekor is referenced in flavor lore of &lt;a href=\"The%20Legacy%20of%20Raekor\"&gt;The Legacy of Raekor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item%20set\"&gt;item set&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the player can acquire a &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV%20Side%20Quests\"&gt;side quest&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Worth\"&gt;Crucible of Worth&lt;/a&gt;,\" where they're tasked to find the Broken Great Axe of Raekor."}

While a Barbarian loses nothing permanently from using this, the fact that he suffers penalties during his rest phase is what makes players gauge the skill's usefulness.\nLore.\n\"Training in brute strength and physical force was the norm for Barbarians, with great endurance and vitality being praised.

He enters the cave to find a bitter &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Azgar\"&gt;Azgar&lt;/a&gt; sitting by the fire. The boy tells the Druid that &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Minions%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Minions of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; are readying for an attack on his village; the village that was once the Druid's home. Azgar tells the boy that he can never go back, because he hurt the one who looked up to him the most. He tells him that as a boy, during his training with his father, his brother, &lt;a href=\"Grey\"&gt;Grey&lt;/a&gt;, was his biggest admirer. Azgar's training included keeping the village safe and studies of the spiritual, during which, he noticed \"\"certain fabled abilities\", he had the gift of the \"spiritbeast\"\". He continued his meditation until, one day, he transformed into a &lt;a href=\"Werebear\"&gt;Werebear&lt;/a&gt;. The young Azgar never before knew such rage and, scared, ran for the place he felt safe, home. Unfortunately, Grey was at home, and Azgar, being fully possessed by the beast, swiped him with his paw. When Azgar realized what happened he came back to normal. Fearing the worst, he fled into the forest and hid. A search party was formed, but they couldn't find the young Druid. Not even when he found out that his brother was alive, only blinded by the hit, did Azgar consider going back for fear of hurting people.\nHe became the defender of the forest that was now his home. The boy says that the Druid's story differs from what he has heard and that as the clan's &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are on an offensive, the village's defenses are thin. Hearing this, Azgar decides that his self-imposed exile must end. The Druid intervenes just in time to save the villagers. Just as he is about to dispatch the last monster, Azgar is impaled on a Minion's spike. Mortally wounded, he collapses. As he lies dying, Grey approaches and says that he never held his brother responsible for what happened that day, that he knew it was all an accident and that the men who searched for him the day he fled just wanted to take him back home. To Grey, Azgar will always remain his brother and his hero. Azgar dies, but his name will always be honored for saving the village."}

It is exclusive to &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt; players, and is their counterpart event to &lt;a href=\"Defend%20the%20Vault\"&gt;Defend the Vault&lt;/a&gt;. \nGameplay.\nIn the event, players raid the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Immortals\"&gt;Vault of the Immortals&lt;/a&gt;. A team of four Shadows attempt to steal from the vault. It starts out as PVE against NPC &lt;a href=\"Vault%20Guardian\"&gt;enemy guardians&lt;/a&gt; in the vault, but if the Immortals find out someone is attempting to breach their defenses, they can send players in to defend it and the activity transitions to PVP. If the Shadows are defeated, they leave with nothing from the current floor but keep any loot from the previous floors. If they defeat the Immortals, they have a grace period to continue raiding the vault.. On the first 3 floors, the Immortals are only alerted if the Shadows fail to kill one of the Wardens that randomly appear. After entering the 4th floor, the Immortals are always alerted with a minimum delay of 10 seconds.\nNote that the Immortals will be temporarily invulnerable when they enter the Vault.\nShadows can only raid the Vault during two time windows in a day, from 12pm \u2013 1pm, and from 7pm \u2013 8pm, Monday to Saturday. This way Immortals can be prepared to defend the Vault. There can only be 1200 Raid the Vault events per day server-wide. Players access the event by talking to &lt;a href=\"Fyggus\"&gt;Fyggus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;Court of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;. Each player is limited to 10 Vault raids per day and they must wait for 3 minutes after finishing a Vault raid before signing up for the next one.\n&lt;a href=\"Monster\"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;s killed inside the Vault have a chance to reward items of a random rarity, experience, and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe condition for opening the portal to the next floor (or the exit portal on the 4th floor) is to kill every guard. It is not dependent on opening any chests or defeating the Immortals.\nTo move on to the next floor, party members must simultaneously stand on the four buttons at the end of the floor. However if a player quits early, their button is removed, allowing the rest of the party to continue.\nThere is a time limit of 2 hours. One minute before the end, a countdown labelled \"The Vault is closing\" appears on the top of the screen. Getting booted out this way counts as a defeat on the current floor, even if the floor was actually completed beforehand.\nRewards.\nThe main goal is to open chests, which contain large amounts of gold, up to 40 &lt;a href=\"Hilts\"&gt;Hilts&lt;/a&gt; and a small chance for a &lt;a href=\"legendary%20item\"&gt;legendary item&lt;/a&gt;. The four floors contain 1, 2, 3 and 4 chests respectively. There is a limit of 40 chests per week, after which the chests will stop dropping items. All chest drops are kept even if the Immortals defeat the Shadows.\nThere is an additional bonus of Hilts depending on the amount of Essential collected by the particular player. This bonus caps out at 350 Hilts per week.\nNote that on the Vault registration window, there are indicators for Hilts and chests, but the Hilts indicator counts up while the chest indicator counts down. The Hilts indicator only shows the Essentia bonus, which runs on a separate counter from the Hilts from chests.\nHistory.\nInitially, to initiate the event, a hero or party needed to have a &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Living%20Night\"&gt;Shard of Living Night&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally the event was also available on Sundays. It was changed to Monday-Saturday in the September 21 2023 update.\nOriginally the Immortals could be alerted as soon as setting foot on the 4th floor. This was changed to have a minimum delay of 10 seconds in the February 21 2024 update.\nOriginally the daily limit on Vault raids per player was 5 and the minimum wait between raids was 10 minutes. These were changed to 10 per day and 3 minutes of wait in the February 21 2024 update.\nOriginally the bonus Hilts were awarded based on the number of floors beaten. Furthermore the reward UI was confusing as it didn't split the two types of Hilts rewards. These were changed in the February 21 2024 update such that the reward is now based on Essentia collected and the UIs were improved to more obviously show the two types of rewards. However this did remove the UI inside the Vault that showed the total Essentia collected by the whole team that could be used as an indicator for when the whole floor was clear. Initially the Hilts increased by 10 for each milestone. This was updated to 40 hilts per milestone one week later in an unannounced update."}

All six are required to complete the set, neither of them are Witch Doctor-restricted.\nSet Bonus:\nThe latter bonus does not consume the entire duration, but instead only converts up to 10000 seconds into instant damage (to prevent abuse of the &lt;a href=\"Creeping%20Death\"&gt;Creeping Death&lt;/a&gt; skill). However, even with this limit, this is one of the most damaging set bonuses in game, its potency being \"doubled\" when combined with &lt;a href=\"Quetzalcoatl\"&gt;Quetzalcoatl&lt;/a&gt; and further doubled when &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Emptiness\"&gt;Ring of Emptiness&lt;/a&gt; is equipped.\nThe first bonus works very similarly, except for it deals 3500 seconds of Haunt damage regardless of how many remain, and then refreshes it to full duration. This only applies to the Witch Doctor's own Haunt, and only to the skill itself. The second Haunt is consumed in process, though, so when that enemy dies, it will only release one Haunt to find a new target. Moreover, only Haunt spirits released by the cast (one, two or three, if &lt;a href=\"Haunting%20Girdle\"&gt;Haunting Girdle&lt;/a&gt; and / or Resentful Spirits rune is used) can detonate existing Haunts. Haunts released by dying foes will not trigger the first bonus, attempting to find new targets instead.\nThe third bonus consumes duration of \"any\" Damage over Time effects (not just the Witch Doctor's skills) applied by the Witch Doctor, including the &lt;a href=\"Gem%20of%20Efficacious%20Toxin\"&gt;Gem of Efficacious Toxin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;ing. However, as this gem is unaffected by Creeping Death and Quetzalcoatl, the resulting instant damage is less potent than that of Locust Swarm and Haunt. The damage done by consumed effects has a &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;Proc Coefficient&lt;/a&gt; of zero, may not trigger any other effects, but can score &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s, using the same damage type as that of the original spell(s).\nNote that consuming the effects of Haunt or Locust Swarm when casting Soul Harvest on enemies counts as casts of those spells with regard to the 4-piece bonus. Affecting enough enemies when casting Soul Harvest in this fashion will let Soul Harvest recharge itself.\nDamage reduction, added in 2.6.1, is multiplicative to all other similar effects. It is applied only if Soul Harvest hits at least 1 enemy, i.e. gains at least 1 stack."}

The &lt;a href=\"priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; feel that this is the proof of the dominance of their &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;particular branch&lt;/a&gt; of the mystic arts. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Skeleton\"&gt;Raise Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, Raise Skeletal Mage creates a loyal minion from a &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;. Skeletal Mages are ranged attackers that fill a valuable role in the Necromancer's fighting force. Although the &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; they deal is limited, especially at higher &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;difficulty levels&lt;/a&gt;, they have distinct advantages over regular melee Skeletons. In any case, a Necromancer can summon Skeletal Mages to distract monsters with additional targets. Monsters may struggle to reach the Necromancer when preoccupied with interposing Mages, protecting him further.\nSkeletal Mages cast &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; bolts of &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cold\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; in combat. Each Mage uses only one type of elemental attack, which you cannot decide when using this skill. However, you can repeatedly raise Skeletal Mages until you get the type of Mage that you want. Skeletal Mages have high resistance to elemental attacks, especially to those whose element they use themselves.\nAlthough they deal much less damage than regular Skeletons and grow in power much slower, Skeletal Mages can still reach decent damage with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt;. They also attack from afar, allowing a Necromancer to make novel use of &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wall\"&gt;Bone Wall&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison\"&gt;Bone Prison&lt;/a&gt;s to lend his Mages free shots against melee enemies. Use these skills wisely, however, as your other minions can be severely impeded by such obstructions. Skeleton Mages can also damage monsters who are Immune to Physical, such as &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, which may stymie your regular Skeletons. In addition, Mages that use cold attacks can slow enemies and Poison Mages can prevent monsters from healing themselves.\nHowever, Skeletal Mages also have disadvantages. Mages are physically weaker than ordinary Skeletons and are vulnerable when surrounded. They also tend to block doorways when attacking in tight spaces, limiting the maneuverability of your other minions. Mages who deal cold damage can cause monsters to shatter when killed, leaving no corpse for the Necromancer to use for &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt; or for creating more minions. Occasionally, however, this effect is desirable when facing monsters that can be resurrected, such as &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mummies\"&gt;Mummies&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, while you cannot decide what elemental attack a Skeletal Mage uses, you can &lt;a href=\"Unsummon\"&gt;Unsummon&lt;/a&gt; any offending Mages as desired.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Mastery\"&gt;Skeleton Mastery&lt;/a&gt; increases the life and damage of Skeleton Mages, as do further skill points placed in Raise Skeletal Mage. &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Mage%20Damage\"&gt;This chart&lt;/a&gt; shows the damage a Skeletal Mage can deal based on the combination of these two skills and the type of element that the Mage uses.\nSkill Progression.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Mage%20Damage\"&gt;Damage Chart&lt;/a&gt;"}

Invoking this skill causes a nightmarish jumble of animated bones to rise from a fresh corpse. Animated partially through their own will and partially through the summoned spirits of ancient warriors, Necromancers often maintain a small host of these reanimated soldiers to do their bidding. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nRaise Skeleton summons a skeleton warrior that fights the Necromancer's enemies to the death. The skill is targeted on a monster &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;, from which the Skeleton rises. Skeletons follow their master and engage his enemies in melee combat, playing both defensive and offensive roles by distracting enemies and &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;physically damaging&lt;/a&gt; them. When further strengthened with &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Mastery\"&gt;Skeleton Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, Skeletons can grow quite powerful. However, without substantial skill point focus, Skeletons usually perform poorly past &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, a Necromancer that specializes in Skeletons (by maxing Raise Skeleton and other associated skills) can create Skeletons strong enough to face all monsters throughout &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Normal difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, and with particular focus even &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; difficulties too.\nAs more points are placed into Raise Skeleton, more Skeletons can be summoned at a time and each Skeleton grows stronger. Skeletons provide excellent crowd control and deal impressive physical damage, especially when aided by &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt;. Skeletons work best in open spaces, where they can all fight at the same time and surround small groups of monsters. They heal over time and can endure substantial punishment before perishing, especially at higher skill levels. Moreover, skillful application of &lt;a href=\"Curses\"&gt;Curses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Auras\"&gt;Auras&lt;/a&gt; to bolster a troop of Skeletons further magnifies their power on the battlefield.\nHowever, Skeletons have some drawbacks. Significant skill investment is required to make them worthwhile, and even the strongest Skeletons may struggle to damage monsters found late in Hell difficulty. Their collective strength is divided across many individuals, making them vulnerable to attacks and spells that deal damage over an area, such as those used by some &lt;a href=\"Act%20boss\"&gt;Act boss&lt;/a&gt;es. Skeletons cannot harm monsters who are Immune to Physical (though Amplify Damage and Decrepify can sometimes breach this immunity). Finally, a large force of Skeletons can be awkward to maneuver, especially in closed spaces (such as the &lt;a href=\"Maggot%20Lair\"&gt;Maggot Lair&lt;/a&gt;) and versus hostile players. Maneuvering challenges can be remedied by using the &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt; skill to position the Necromancer's minions, although teleporting requires an item with this capability.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Mastery\"&gt;Skeleton Mastery&lt;/a&gt; increases the life and damage of Skeletons and changes their appearance. Points added to Raise Skeleton do not change their appearance nor the weapons they wield. Skeletons have a 5% chance to receive a shield when raised, which gives them a 3% block rate.\nDevelopment.\nIn earlier versions of the game, each point invested into Raise Skeleton allowed the summoning of a new Skeleton, potentially granting the necromancer the ability to control 20+ Skeletons at a time. These skeletons were much weaker, however, and were rarely viable outside of the first half of Normal difficulty."}

In this, they were successful (or at least in as much as summoning his &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Rakanishu\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt;), but Rakanishu was again slain, this time by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven decades after his &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, Fallen in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; could still be heard crying out the demon's name as a war cry.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Rakanishu appears in .

He first brought the faith to the Western continent past the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt;, and although the crusade was arduous and brutal at times, in the end he was looked upon favorably. Histories agree that Rakkis was a zealous Zakarum convert, known for his stern demeanor, cunning, and ferocity in battle.\nBiography.\nOrigins.\nThere are conflicting reports on Rakkis's origins. It is known that he hailed from the east, perhaps even beyond the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. It is known that he lived during the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231042\"&gt;11th century&lt;/a&gt;, and was the close friend of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tassara\"&gt;Tassara&lt;/a&gt; of Kehjistan. Throughout the course of his military career, he gained renown for defending the empire from both internal and external threats. At some point he converted to the Zakarum faith.\nThe Rise of Zakarum.\nWith the country caught in the throes of unrest, Tassara converted to the influential &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith, earning himself the support of the masses, who had been rallying against Kehjistan's ruling elite, and the Zakarum church itself. A handful of nobles had no intention of sharing power, and pooled their fortunes to recruit a mercenary army to topple Tassara and crush the Zakarum. Tassara called upon Rakkis to crush the rebellion.\nMost accounts state that the usurpers' armies outnumbered Rakkis's by a wide margin. Yet despite this, he outmaneuvered his foes at every turn, dividing and conquering the mercenary forces with incredible speed and efficiency, never losing a battle. Within &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231045\"&gt;three years&lt;/a&gt;, Rakkis had defeated the rebel forces.\nRakkis's victories made him a legend. It is said that as he traveled through cities, people of all ages would gather to catch a glimpse of their champion. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would theorize centuries later that the masses saw Rakkis as a sign of their faith's legitimacy and strength. Whatever the truth of the matter, the general used his influence to dispose of governors and magistrates whom he saw as inept, replacing them with his favored archbishops.\nAt some point, Rakkis uncovered a tome that wrote of a race of beings called &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, and of their ruined civilization in the West. Gods, by any other name, but in reality, humanity's ancestors. Rakkis wondered if the tome held the means to unlock their power. The tome also spoke of an ancient nephalem city named Corvus.\nThe Crusade.\nDeparture and Initial Battles.\nIn time, Tassara grew wary of Rakkis's popularity and sought to neutralize this new threat to his rule. Turning his eyes to the West, Tassara claimed that it was the empire's duty to conquer this dark corner of the world and 'enlighten' it with the Zakarum faith, and that only Rakkis was capable of doing so. Tassara reasoned that if Rakkis failed, he would lose much of his popularity. If he succeeded, the emperor could reap the benefits. Rakkis accepted the task, and the emperor granted him nearly a third of Kehjistan's standing military. Thus, Rakkis and his men sailed across the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; to the West.\nIn truth, Rakkis had ulterior motives. He believed that Zakarum was waning in the East, and that the West would provide a means to rekindle the faith. Additionally, he had learnt of the nephalem city of Corvus, located somewhere in the western lands. He sought to find it.\nThe fleet landed at &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; and Rakkis moved his forces out. &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28Country%29\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;'s power over &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; was shattered, though its forces continued to harass Rakkis's. The resistance was especially fierce in the &lt;a href=\"Tamoe%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;Tamoe Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt;, and as the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; moved north, they encountered resistance from the s. Neither Ivgorod nor the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt; were conquered by Rakkis, though he successfully inducted &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; into the Zakarum faith.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Rakkis re-grouped his forces after the defeats they'd sufferred at the hands of Ivgorod and the Barbarians. Morale is said to have been low, but Rakkis himself wasn't dissuaded. He believed that victory was his destiny, and gave speeches about his \"rightous cause,\" about the destined ascendancy of Zakarum, and rallied the soldiers for the next leg of their campaign.\nWestmarch.\nIn the far west, nine warring clans existed around the southern edge of what is now called the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Gulf of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Rakkis knew that their disunity was a disadvantage, but also knew that launching his armies against them would unify the clans into a larger force. Instead, Rakkis lived among them, learning the clans' culture, language, and of their gods. All the while subtly spreading the Zakarum faith to anyone who would listen. Through an arranged marriage, Rakkis bound himself by blood to the &lt;a href=\"Ortal%20Clan\"&gt;Ortal Clan&lt;/a&gt;, the third-largest of the seven clans. Using his new standing, he was able to bring four of the lesser clans under his banner.\nAfterwards, Rakkis led his combined forces against the &lt;a href=\"Hathlan%20Clan\"&gt;Hathlan&lt;/a&gt;, the largest and most hostile clan. Through a series of bloody battles, the Hathlan's army was dismantled and its leader slain. With this victory, the remaining clans pledged themselves to Rakkis and declared him their king; but even as Rakkis assumed dominion, he rallied his subjects with talk of mankind's inner Light and glory. It was his strength and conviction that truly unified the clans of the far-West into a single kingdom. In honor of his long campaign, Rakkis named the new land &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, so named as it marked the westernmost point of his conquest.\nKing of Westmarch.\nConsecration.\nRakkis ordered construction of a &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; for his new kingdom, a river-port settlement. Supposedly, he was also responsible for the construction of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Palace\"&gt;Westmarch Palace&lt;/a&gt;. According to legend, he planted the &lt;a href=\"Einfrinn%20Tree\"&gt;Einfrinn Tree&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the city, but &lt;a href=\"Rayek\"&gt;Rayek&lt;/a&gt; would later dispute this account.\nIn the meantime, he searched for Corvus in the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Marsh\"&gt;Blood Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Worn blocks of stone were found, suggesting built structures. Rakkis wondered if these ruins were all that remained of Corvus, but told himself that there was more to be found. And finally, his faith was rewarded, as Corvus was found, buried underneath the swamp. As he stepped into the catacombs, Rakkis felt a stirring in his blood, and a dim light glowed all around him. One not cast by any torch. It was as if the very stone of Corvus was acknowledging the warlord's presence. Rakkis believed that through the Light, the nephalem could be reborn within humanity.\nAfterwards, Rakkis consecrated Westmarch, the capital of his new kingdom. He took the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20of%20Corvus\"&gt;Wolf of Corvus&lt;/a&gt; as his sigil, and proclaimed himself king. Over the subsequent years, Westmarch flourished, as new roads, cities, churches and infrastructure sprung up throughout the land. Rakkis ruled with a strong but fair hand, and enjoyed the admiration of his subjects.\nWhile constructing Westmarch Palace, Rakkis searched for the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Crown\"&gt;Eternal Crown&lt;/a&gt;. However, it eluded him.\nFinal Years.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231070\"&gt;A decade&lt;/a&gt; after becoming king, the power of the nephalem still escaped Rakkis. However, he had found mention of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact that lay within the Barbarian lands of the north. With &lt;a href=\"Korsikk\"&gt;Korsikk&lt;/a&gt;, his son having been born, he rallied his banners and marched north. This was the first of many incursions against the northern tribes, but could never make any true gains against them.\nRakkis remained enthralled by Corvus and would often wander its corridors for hours on end, lost in thought. The lure of potential immortality convinced Rakkis that he might even be nephalem himself, though after many fruitless years of wandering the crumbling remnants of the city, his only consolation was to have his remains entombed within.\nIt is said that at the age of 100, Rakkis died peacefully in his sleep. In his final years, Rakkis requested that he be buried among the ruins of the lost city. This was apparently granted, and Rakkis was &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;entombed&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of Corvus. &lt;a href=\"Cullen\"&gt;Cullen&lt;/a&gt; suspected that Rakkis sought the power and protection located in the catacombs of the city.\nLegacy.\nKorsikk succeeded his father as king. He continued his father's rule and turned Westmarch into a bastion of Zakarum faith. The garb of those who succeeded Rakkis grew more ornate with each generation. In the current day, Westmarch remains one of the most vibrant kingdoms in Sanctuary, though Zakarum influence has waned in recent years.\nVarious historians have studied Rakkis's deeds, including the &lt;a href=\"Horadric\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; scholar &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20and%20the%20Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Westmarch and the Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;\" is a published work on his deeds. Works written by Rakkis include \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Testament%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;The Testament of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Rakkis%27s%20Strategies%20of%20War\"&gt;Rakkis's Strategies of War&lt;/a&gt;\". By the mid-13th century however, Rakkis's origins were known only to a few.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rakkisguard\"&gt;Rakkisguard&lt;/a&gt; was likely named after him, as was &lt;a href=\"Rakkis%20Plaza\"&gt;Rakkis Plaza&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nRakkis's &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Crown\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt; can be found in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"The%20Testament%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;journal entries of his&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the game's &lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;.

Their ranks include &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt;, shieldmen, and pikemen. Officers bear the sigil of the Rakkisguard (a wolf), and can be distinguished by their wolf pelts. They wear red and white plate armor, and their &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; display a red wolf. At least some of their helmets are plumed.\nThe Guard posted &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; in Westmarch from various patrons.\nHistory.\nMoon of the Spider.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Cornelius\"&gt;Cornelius&lt;/a&gt; passed away. Per the line of succession, &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian&lt;/a&gt; was next in line for the throne. As with every other time a king passed away, uncertainty was in the air, given Westmarch's feudal system. Justinian ordered that the Rakkisguard be pulled back from the city walls to shore up the palace, reasoning that the capital was under no threat of invasion, and that a show of force in his seat of power would discourage any noble from challenging his right to rule. Despite his misgivings, General &lt;a href=\"Torion\"&gt;Torion&lt;/a&gt; obeyed. Half of the Rakkisguard were removed from the walls for the sake of Justinian's coronation.\nIn truth, this was part of Justinian's mad scheme to secure his own ascension, albeit under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Karybdus\"&gt;Karybdus&lt;/a&gt;. The Rakkisguard facing the forest near Westmarch were ordered by Captain &lt;a href=\"Alec%20Matteus\"&gt;Alec Matteus&lt;/a&gt; to douse the lamps along the wall and take off their helmets. Despite the questionable orders, the soldiers obeyed, at least at first, but by then, it was too late\u2014in the darkness that had resulted from the doused torches, the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Astrogha\"&gt;Children of Astrogha&lt;/a&gt; had scaled the outer wall, undetected. Outnumbered and vulnerable, the guards were quickly overwhelmed. Some were killed, others were controlled by the spiders. Their human puppets then opened the gates, allowing the main swarm to enter Westmarch.\nThe Children swarmed through Westmarch. Shrieks rang through the air, and quickly fell silent. The spiders were quickly discovered by General &lt;a href=\"Torion\"&gt;Torion&lt;/a&gt;, who fought them alongside his fellow Rakkisguard. They fared better than the guards had on the outer wall, as Torion quickly realized that the spiders were controlling human hosts (and gave orders for all helmets to be secured), and were vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. However, such were the spiders' numbers, they were forced to fall back.\nThe situation was desparate. While the fires were vulnerable to fire, rain was making the flames feeble. While the spiders were no longer able to take the Rakkisguard as hosts, they were able to bite them, killing them nearly instantly given their venom. &lt;a href=\"Salene%20Nesardo\"&gt;Salene Nesardo&lt;/a&gt; realized that if things continued, Torion might have to choose between letting the spiders take Westmarch, or burning the city to the ground.\nThe battle continued to rage. Reinforcements steadily joined the front, but when it came to numbers, the Children of Astrogha had the advantage. They began pouring over every wall, and began to take Westmarch's citizens as their hosts, making them akin to the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;walking dead&lt;/a&gt;. At least a fifth of the capital was either ablaze or had been burnt to the ground, the rain was going stronger, and oil stockpiles were running out. However, with the banishment of &lt;a href=\"Astrogha\"&gt;Astrogha&lt;/a&gt;, his children stopped dead in their tracks, and withered away, the rain itself washing away their dust.\nDawn of Damnation.\nIn 1270, the Westmarch Guard vetted refugees from &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold&lt;/a&gt;, before letting them into Westmarch.\nIn a vision granted by the &lt;a href=\"Einfrinn%20Tree\"&gt;Einfrinn Tree&lt;/a&gt;, Westmarch was overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Wrathborne\"&gt;Wrathborne&lt;/a&gt;. The Westmarch Guard tried to defend the city, but were overrun by the demons. This future was apparently avoided by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Reapers.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, the guard was decimated by the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; when they attacked Westmarch\u2014many of its members were raised as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;revenants&lt;/a&gt; in the Reapers' thrall. A number of Rakkisguard were able the secure &lt;a href=\"The%20Survivors%27%20Enclave\"&gt;The Survivors' Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. Outside this area, various guards continued to fight the Reapers, and were aided by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. Of note, some Rakkisguard sided with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Wynton\"&gt;Lord Wynton&lt;/a&gt; as he attempted to seize power.\nIn-game.\nThe Westmarch Guard appear in Westmarch in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

This helps the player avoid &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; while still doing damage. They are used mostly by characters that focus on &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; as their primary attribute and have a high &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nUnlike the heavy and risky &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapon\"&gt;Melee Weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, Ranged Weapons are mostly light and made of wood. They are usually classified as &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;Bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Weapons\"&gt;Throwing Weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nBows are usually instruments that use the principle of Potential Energy to fire highly damaging &lt;a href=\"Arrows\"&gt;Arrows&lt;/a&gt; at monsters. &lt;a href=\"Crossbows\"&gt;Crossbows&lt;/a&gt; are an upgraded version of the Bow that allows the user to fire heavy and much more damaging dart-like projectiles called &lt;a href=\"Bolts\"&gt;Bolts&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrowing Weapons are a broad term that contains the various types of weapons that can be thrown towards the monsters to do damage. They include the various types of &lt;a href=\"Javelins\"&gt;Javelins&lt;/a&gt; including among some of them the precise &lt;a href=\"Pilum\"&gt;Pila&lt;/a&gt;, the accurate &lt;a href=\"Harpoon\"&gt;Harpoon&lt;/a&gt;s and the powerful &lt;a href=\"Balrog%20Spear\"&gt;Balrog Spear&lt;/a&gt;s. They also consist of &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Knives\"&gt;Throwing Knives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Axe\"&gt;Axes&lt;/a&gt; along with the many different &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Potions\"&gt;Throwing Potions&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nThe usage of Ranged Weapons depends on a good &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Attack Rating&lt;/a&gt; and Attack Speed because of the usually low damage done by such weapons. They are the weapon of choice for a character class that has the Dexterity attribute as their highest stat as it fills one of the requirements, the Attack Rating. In \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", the Ranged Weapons only contained Bows. They were expanded considerably in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", adding Throwable Spears, Knives, Axes and Potions.\nIn the original Diablo I, the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; fit the bill perfectly. She had the maximum Dexterity that helped in using Ranged Weapons to their maximum effect. The &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; focused more on &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapon\"&gt;Melee Weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and Spells respectively. The Warrior has the Bowman build that uses Ranged Weapons.\nWhen Diablo II expanded Ranged Weapons to include many more items, many players started using Ranged Weapons and started researching their benefits. The most common Ranged Weapon user is the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Bow%20and%20Crossbow%20Skills\"&gt;an entire Skill Tree&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to Bows and Crossbows and &lt;a href=\"Javelin%20and%20Spear%20Skills\"&gt;half of another&lt;/a&gt; depending on the use of Javelins. The had &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Mastery\"&gt;Throwing Mastery&lt;/a&gt; as a Skill that enabled him to use Throwing Knives and Axes to great effect. The other three classes seldom used Ranged Weapons as their primary means of attack.\nThe release of \"\" saw nothing more for Ranged Weapons as it did for Melee Weapons. Both the &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; primarily use Melee Weapons, and showed nothing new in terms of skills. The most notable Ranged Weapon users in &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Malah\"&gt;Malah&lt;/a&gt;'s son, a skilled Barbarian Archer and the &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madawc\"&gt;Madawc&lt;/a&gt; who uses Throwing Axes to attack his opponents.\nRanged weapons return in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", with the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scoundrel\"&gt;Scoundrel&lt;/a&gt; being the main (and, in fact, only) users. &lt;a href=\"Wands\"&gt;Wands&lt;/a&gt; are a weapon of choice for &lt;a href=\"Wizards\"&gt;Wizards&lt;/a&gt; as well. Ranged weapons do not smart-drop to other classes.\nThere is a total of seven types of ranged weapons in Diablo series:\nTo some extent, spells may be considered ranged weapons of sorts for &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;-oriented classes."}

{"id": "9455", "revid": "55106518", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9455", "title": "Ranger (Build)", "text": "\"This article describes the Ranger build. For info on Ranger lore, see &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe Ranger is a &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20builds\"&gt;Paladin build&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;Bows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Crossbows\"&gt;Crossbows&lt;/a&gt; as a weapon (mostly crossbows). This build uses its &lt;a href=\"Aura\"&gt;Aura&lt;/a&gt; to increase damage, usually\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fanaticism\"&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt;/Holy Shock/Holy Freeze or &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt;.\nA popular weapon for this build is the &lt;a href=\"Buriza-Do%20Kyanon%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Buriza-Do Kyanon&lt;/a&gt;, a unique crossbow with mods, primarily used to slow enemies down.\nThough this build has a lot of style, it's hard to play: Paladins don't have a special attack on the left-click button and Paladins don't have any skills (apart from the Aura) that support ranged weapons (no multiple shots, no guided shots, no further bonuses).\u00a0\nMany players use &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the wielder to use guided arrow, or a &lt;a href=\"Witchwild%20String%20\"&gt;Witchwild String &lt;/a&gt;(usually upped) for its magic arrow attack.\nPlaying a Ranger.\nThere are several ways to build a Ranger. All of them will require some strategic play and forward thinking on part of the player, as a Ranger is not tanky and lacks special attacks to get out of getting swarmed. The player will need to get used to being mobile and light on their feet, as some enemies (especially minotaurs or Extra Strong Extra fast SU packs) can rapidly chew up even a geared build if they catch it.\nAttack speeds, breakpoints, Crushing Blow, and stat Allocation.\nIAS will play a big role in what weapon base and gear you choose. The fastest attack framerate for paladins is 9 for bows, and 11 for crossbows. In almost every situation, you'll want a bow, especially if using a runeword. The Hunter's Bow/Blade Bow and Composite Bow/Great Bow each have a base speed of -10, meaning you only need 89 IAS to reach their last breakpoint. The fastest crossbow, the Demon Machine, only needs 8 IAS for its last breakpoint, but it is limited to 11 frames no matter how much IAS you stack; comparatively, a Ballista, the base for &lt;a href=\"Buriza-Do%20Kyanon%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Buriza-Do Kyanon&lt;/a&gt; needs 215 IAS to reach 11 frames.\nThe need for IAS leaves you somewhat limited in gear options. All the IAS needed for a Blade or Great Bow can be achieved from the gloves, body, amulet, and jewel socket. Some weapon options have IAS or the ability to add it, so also keep that in mind when considering gear choices.\nCrushing Blow is halved for bows, so it's not as effective as it is for melee. A couple pieces of gear below provide it, so it's a nice-to-have.\nStat allocation will remain relatively unchanged regardless of how you build your Ranger. Alter as needed if you choose to have a melee backup.\nEarly Game and Leveling.\nA Ranger can go from level 1 to killing Hell Baal without ever swinging a melee weapon, even on Players7-8 (though this requires patience and a degree of skill), so this guide assumes the player is doing so, or at the very least equipping the first bow they find and going from there. Learning to kite and reposition early on will make the build much easier in late Nightmare and Hell. \nMost players may opt to max Holy Fire while leveling and then respec once they reach Hell or are ready to equip endgame gear. It should be noted that the variants can be played without doing this, but each player has their preference on how to level.\nThe early game, regardless of build choice, will look identical in leveling gear for the most part and depends on what the player has on hand. \nNotable early-mid game gear: \nVariants.\nAll builds are assumed to have a Torch and Annihilus in inventory. A lot of the gear will be the same across builds, but there's room for customization. All variants will be lacking in resists unless you load your inventory with +res charms. While this can make Hell dicey, it's not an insurmountable drawback.\n&lt;a href=\"Razortail\"&gt;Razortail&lt;/a&gt; is pretty much required regardless of build, as it'll likely be your only source of serious multi-target hits in late and endgame. The only exception would be a nice rare with FHR, 20+ Str or Dex, 40+ Life, and decent Fire and/or Lightning res.\nA 160/60 Jeweler's Armor of the Whale is a decent source of +ED% and IAS and may beat out Hustle or Treachery, at the loss of other decent stats and mods the other two provide. If the player has access to one or can easily acquire one, it's a solid option.\nPhysical Damage build.\nThis build focuses on dealing out as much physical damage as possible. It finishes early, and leaves a high degree of room to customize via skills. It gets expensive with its charm requirements though.\nThere are two required skills to max regardless of customization:\nThis leaves you with several dozen skill points to do with as you please. You could add an elemental backup and max Holy Shock and its synergies to deal with physical immunes if not running a Sunder charm or &lt;a href=\"Witchwild%20String\"&gt;Witchwild String&lt;/a&gt;, or max Vigor for more mobility, the possibilities are almost endless.\nCharms to find for this build are life/AR/max dmg, with +res charms for durability. A Sunder charm is needed to deal with Physical Immunes if not using a &lt;a href=\"Witchwild%20String\"&gt;Witchwild String&lt;/a&gt; or a merc with &lt;a href=\"The%20Reaper%27s%20Toll\"&gt;The Reaper's Toll&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lawbringer%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Lawbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nGear:\nIt is not possible to reach the last IAS breakpoint with Windforce unless it's Shael'd and using a 160/60 JAoW. Goldstrike Arch requires the use of either Hustle or Treachery to hit its last breakpoint, and a Shael and IAS jewel may be required. Widowmaker and Witchwild String can hit the last breakpoint at lvl 20 Fananticism with listed gear, meaning sockets can be customized as you see fit. If Widowmaker is used, AR is a moot point as Guided Arrow doesn't need it.\nAn Artisan's Tiara of Speed with three 40/15s offers up more raw damage and IAS, freeing up some gear options, but like the 160/60 JAoW, it's assumed the player doesn't have one. If one or both of these armors are available to the player, gearing changes up significantly as far as customization goes.\nFortitude is a nice armor and can certainly be useful to this build for survivability and resists that don't rely on a Fade proc, but it's not possible at all to reach 9 frame attacks with it unless using a 2x Shael'd Witchwild String. A Brand made in a Demon Machine may be an interesting alternative to use with it, given its almost nonexistant IAS requirement (but attack speed locked at 11 frames).\nMercenary: An Act 2 Might merc is a solid pairing. Even better if he's wielding a &lt;a href=\"Pride%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Pride&lt;/a&gt;.\nStorm Ranger.\nAn elemental Ranger that relies on multiple auras to dish out damage. It lacks the physical damage of a physical Ranger, but makes up for it in that no Sunder charms or AR are required, and the guide author has finished the game on Players8 in LoD Classic with this build. The downside is that gear is more or less locked in place, leaving little room for customization. Conviction has a small radius of only ~13 yards, so this will require close-in fighting for maximum aura effect. This is also an expensive build, requiring two Jah runes and a couple other high runes, meaning this build will be difficult to do in single player.\nSkills are as follows:\nThis leaves a bit of wiggle room for customization--using Vigor as a dump skill is a good option. The passive bonus from Blessed Aim is not necessary, as discussed below. \nConviction needs to be raised to lvl 25 for the maximum -res effect. This is achieved with Torch, Anni, and Highlord's Wrath, meaning no skiller charms are needed.\nCharms should be a mix of +elemental damage and +res. Due to Conviction and multiple damage sources, Sunder charms are not necessary for this build.\nGear: \nHustle is the superior armor to use, but Treachery's Fade proc warrants a mention. AR for this build will be very low, barely over 1000, but it's a moot point, as lvl 25 Conviction reduces enemy armor by over 90% and Ice's ITD means your only realistic chances for missing will be on SUs and act bosses. Unsurprisingly, physical damage is kind of an afterthought for this build, but there's a reasonable amount of Deadly Strike present that it shouldn't be ignored completely.\nMercenary: This build is strong enough that the player can pick their preferred mercenary and gear, rather than beelining to a tank. Act 2 and 5 mercs will be the strongest options, but both Act 1 and Act 3 mercs will play very nicely with your Conviction aura. The author can attest to an Act 1 merc with a Harmony dishing out respectable damage.\nFire Ranger.\nAs the name suggests, this variant uses Holy Fire as its aura, thanks to the buffs it received in D2R. It's possible to do this build in LoD Classic, but it won't be as effective without a Sunder charm. Otherwise it plays similarly to a Storm Ranger. Requires a couple pricey runes, so difficult to do in single player. Otherwise, it dishes respectable damage, and is capable of higher PlayersX settings.\nSkills: \nA quick and easy one, easily finished by early Nightmare. Blessed Aim's passive bonus isn't required for this build, so customize as you see fit.\nCharms should be a mix of +fire damage, +Offensive Auras skillers and +res. A Fire Sunder charm is necessary even at the cost of resists, as there's way too many Fire Immunes in Hell and Inifinity can't get them all. Also, this build can offset the Sunder's -res, as we'll soon see.\nGear: \nFlickering Flame is the clear winner in helms here, nothing else even comes close, and its Resist Fire aura offsets the detrimental effects of your Sunder charm. Brand offers up level 15 Exploding Arrows that always hit and dishes out your fire damage at range and comes with a decent stat package, only missing out on IAS. The Bone Spear proc is something, but without synergies or the Marrowwalk bug, it's just a nice little amusement. Hustle still wins out for body armor, but Treachery gets its Fade honorable mention.\nMercenary: Act 2 or Act 5 merc will play best with this variant. Infinity is not required, so there's room for options on gear.\nElemental Ranger.\nThis is the legacy Storm Ranger build, in use before runewords like Ice or Grief or even synergies existed, and as a result, is more budget-friendly. It is Hell-capable, but probably won't be viable at higher Players-levels, though Players5 should be reasonable with the right gear in late game. Thematically, there's not much difference from a Storm Ranger, this one just relies on one aura at a time, and Conviction is unfortunately not in play. \nSkills:\nThis build is effectively a ranged Tesladin with a second element on backup for immunes. Holy Fire was buffed in D2R so it's probably the better backup, but Freeze's moderate CC ability shouldn't be overlooked. There's next to no room for customization, however. \nCharms should be a mix of elemental damage, +res, and +Offensive Auras skillers. A Lightning Sunder charm is an option, but the significant loss in resists and the build's inherent low resists might not be to most players' tastes, and Infinity is still capable of breaking most Lightning Immunes.\nGear: \nWizendraw, Witchwild String, and Widowmaker are the strongest bets. Wizendraw also comes with some buffs to cold damage, so would pair nicely with Holy Freeze, the downside being you won't be able to reach its last IAS breakpoint (to say nothing of its stat req if double-upped). Harmony can play nice with this build, but it won't shine as well without Conviction.\nMercenary: Act 2, with an &lt;a href=\"Infinity%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt;."}

A port city, it was an enigma, something that shouldn't have existed. Its builders took advantage of the natural caverns in the area above the Dyre River, which they used as storehouses for the goods they traded.

Its buildings were torched, and its denizens were slaughtered and raised as &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s. Even the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s of the graveyards had clawed their way to the surface.\nLegacy.\nRansim had a legacy of sorts in that some of the &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the East had chosen Ransim to work and hide in. They had left their secrets behind as well. The chronicler &lt;a href=\"Dumal%20Lunnash\"&gt;Dumal Lunnash&lt;/a&gt; referred to Ransim in his forgotten texts.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Tauruk%27s%20Port\"&gt;Tauruk's Port&lt;/a&gt; was built over Ransim's original site.

The &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt; hoped that Akyev's rigid demenor would temper Zhota's hesitent nature, and vice versa. When he first encountered him, he snapped Zhota's flute in half and tossed it out of the Floating Sky Monastery. They would spar together in the monestary's training grouns, Akyev wielding a scimitar he had forged himself against Zhota's bo. He easily defeated him, cutting into his staff, and commented that Zhota had \"too much of the rivers in him,\" touching on his disdain for Ymil. He would forbid Zhota from ever fixing the blemish, lest he forget the lessons imparted to him. Over the years, Akyev worked feverishly to suppress his pupil's insistence on trusting in himself when presented with difficult situations. Whether or not Zhota' insights were correct didn't matter to Akyev. He believed such reliance on the self would compromise one's ability to obey the Patriarchs' commands and prosecute their divine will. Zhota was eventually annointed as a Monk, but Akyev carried doubts as to whether he was truly ready.\nWhile training, Zhota caught the attention of &lt;a href=\"Mikulov\"&gt;Mikulov&lt;/a&gt;, who was fascinated by him. At some point, Mikulov told &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; about Zhota, and of Akyev. Cain concluded that to survive Akyev's training, Zhota would have had to have been a resourceful and resilient individual. Zhota in turn had a high opinion of &lt;a href=\"Kharazim\"&gt;Kharazim&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnyielding.\nA Touch of Mercy.\nA few weeks after becoming a Monk, the day after the sighting of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;, Zhota was summoned to Akyev's side in the monastery. Akyev sent Zhota into the &lt;a href=\"Gorgorra\"&gt;Gorgorra&lt;/a&gt;, ordering that his disciple examine all travelers within the forest, but remain wary, lest they be tainted by gods of chaos. Those touched by those gods were to be \"purified,\" he ordered, relaying the decree of the Patriarchs. \nWeeks later, Zhota was still in the forest. He found a pair of survivors from a &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; attack; a graying father and his twenty year old son. He let them share his campsite, but kept his distance emotionally. His solitude was interrupted as the trees themselves attacked the camp. He was able to sense that the trees had been tainted by a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic power. He was able to sense the demon within a black oak, directing the rest of the trees. The demon, realizing that it had been detected, attacked Zhota directly. Zhota was able to slay the demon, killing the tree, but not before it struck at the man's son, tainting him. Zhota offered a mercy killing, to which the man protested against, claiming that if his son fell to corruption, he would slay him himself. Zhota felt guilty, but remembering his master's unyielding nature, went ahead to kill the man's son. The man drew out a knife, but Zhota easily incapacitated him, and used a mantra to kill the boy. He then cremated the corpse, by which time it was dawn. He set off alone, knowing that he should feel proud for carrying out the Patriarchs' will, but instead remained haunted by the grief of the boy's father.\nThe Boy.\nThree days later, Zhota discovered a caravan, with corpses laid out around it. The bodies were fresh, and he could not sense any demonic taint. He noted that they'd appeared to have been tortured, and that one of them, a woman, was missing her head. He found a flute and picked it up, playing a few notes, reminded of the one he'd once owned before Akyev had destroyed it. At this point the canopy rustled, and he chased after the sound, finding a boy no older than ten, sobbing. He quickly realized that the boy was blind. Zhota burnt the bodies of the fallen, and the boy remained at his side over the next few days. He refused to answer any of Zhota's questions about the caravan, but in his sleep, Zhota heard the boy utter the word \"mother.\" The boy tried to flee on several occassions, which prompted Zhota to bind his hands. Zhota wondered if the boy might be a demon in disguise, but could sense no demonic taint.\nWhat hindered him was that the boy had practically no stamina. Also, every time he heard a bird or beast, he would wander off toward the sound, enraptured with childish curiosity. Zhota had a mind to leave the boy behind, but the Monk hoped to learn more about what had assailed the caravan. Zhota began to goad the boy, calling him names like \"demon child.\" Finally, the boy let out an outburst that he wasn't a demon. Smiling, Zhota handed the boy the flute. Cradling it, the boy revealed that his mother had promised that he would call him back with a song. He claimed that a demon had struck the camp, and that it was still after him. Zhota was skeptical\u2014the demons in the Gorgorra killed indiscriminatly, they wouldn't focus their efforts on one child. Still, as the child fell asleep, he was left to wonder why the gods had willed that they cross paths, if not to protect the child. He decided to take the boy to villages to the south.\nUnfortunately, the villages to the south were empty. Zhota pressed on, hoping to find another village, mentally justifying why he hadn't delivered the boy to the gods yet. The boy revealed that his name was &lt;a href=\"Mishka\"&gt;Mishka&lt;/a&gt;, and played Zhota music with the flute. Zhota began to warm to him, even carrying him on his back, but the music struck a nerve as he was reminded of his own childhood, causing him to lash out at the boy. That night, they were confronted by bandits. They claimed that the Patriarchs had hired them to enforce the peace, as the Monks of Ivgorod were spread thin. A lie, Zhota knew, but he remained silent. They revealed that the order hadn't come from the Patriarchs directly, but one of Zhota's fellow Monks, that a demon was in the woods wearing the skin of a child. Mishka was that child, it seemed, his bloody tears being all the proof they needed. Zhota wondered if Mishka had fooled him, but reasoned that he'd traveled with the boy for days. He couldn't be a demon. They told him the other Monk was to the west, and Zhota decided to find him. The bandits wanted &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, while Zhota responded that all they'd get was his gratitude. The men came to blows, and Zhota killed the bandits, but looking at Mishka once more, wondered if he'd been fooled. He demanded that Mishka tell him the truth, explain why the men were after him.\nMishka recounted that he was the son of one of the Patriarchs and his concubine. He'd been born with deformities, but his mother had convinced his father to sequester him in the palace instead of killing him. Mishka had lived in isolation until the coming of the Fallen Star, causing paronoia to sweep Ivgorod. In this climate, Zhota summized that the Patriarch had ordered that Mishka be put to death, lest his purity be called into question. Thus, through the work of his mother and a few loyal servants, he was carried into the Gorgorra. Zhota could scarcely believe it, but nonetheless, continued to carry Mishka.\nMaster and Student.\nEvents came to a head as he found the Monk the bandits had been talking about7mdash;Akyev. He commented that Zhota had succeeded where he'd failed, giving his former student praise for the first time. He told Zhota that Mishka was a demon wearing the skin of a child. Mishka called Akyev the demon\u2014lies to hide its true identity, according to Akyev. Akyev claimed that these were lies, but Zhota stated that he believed Mishka's tale. Akyev disgustedly commented that Zhota was still a boy, and gave him a second kick as Zhota claimed that the Patriarch Akyev served was no longer interested in maintaining the balance between order and chaos. It was revealed that Akyev was the one who had slaughtered the members of the caravan He scraped off the circles embodied on Zhota's forehead, stating that Zhota was no Monk. He ordered him to return to the monastery and await judgement. The two engaged in combat, Zhota once again wielding his bo against Akyev's scimitar. Akyev gained the upperhand, and was unmoved by Zhota's accusations of his brutality. For a moment, Akyev seemed to consider that Zhota was correct, that he'd been sent to kill an innocent. But only for a moment, as he swung his &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe sword was swung, but Zhota grabbed it, breaking the weapon in two. Zhota used the broken blade to decapitate his master. He played the song to Mishka, getting him to come out, revealing that it was not a demon, but a man, that had been after him, but that man was dead now. He then built a pyre to cremate his master's body. He could only hope that the Patriarch wouldn't be able to find another Monk like Akyev\u2014one who could slaughter innocents without hesitation. He reasoned that men like Akyev were aberrations, that the Monks of Ivgorod were better than that. He led Mishka by the hand out of the clearing and turned north toward &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, intent on bringing word of everything that had transpired to his order's attention. For the first time in his life, he felt as if he truly understood what it meant to be a monk."}

After he created the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;secret library&lt;/a&gt;, the Horadrim banded together to kill Kulle, putting his blood into jars and severing his head from his body in order to seal him.\nBiography.\nThe Ennead.\nKulle hailed from the &lt;a href=\"Ennead%20Clan\"&gt;Ennead Clan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan\"&gt;Mage Clan&lt;/a&gt; known for its mastery of transmutation and similar arts. Like his kin, Kulle devoted himself to the pursuit of these sciences. He wrote a number of &lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; that found their way into the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; and/or libraries of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horadrim.\nThe Hunt for the Three.\nKulle was one of the founding members of the Horadric order with the assistance of six other powerful mages. He had a great talent in alchemy, and was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Ennead%20Clan\"&gt;Ennead Clan&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; carved three &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;soulstones&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, that would be used to bind the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; that had been &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;banished&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Kulle was given custodianship over the artifacts; for as a member of the Ennead, he was deemed well suited to handling such magical objects. Of all the Horadrim, only Kulle was aware of the manner of their construction.\nOver the following years, Kulle spent many hours with the soulstones during the Horadrim's hunt, and he became intrigued by their power. &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt; often found Kulle awake late in the night, experimenting with the soulstones and documenting their properties. His knowledge of them grew, to the point where it mystified even the other members of the Horadrim. However, as the Hunt drew on, the quest took a psychological toll on Kulle. Once mirthful and spirited, he became an unfeeling husk, numb to even the basest of human emotions.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Hunt%20for%20the%20Three\"&gt;Hunt for the Three&lt;/a&gt;, the Horadrim realized they would need an artifact of immense power. Kulle provided it for them, designing a device called \"&lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt;\". The Horadrim agreed on the necessity of the device, and forged the Cube over a period of weeks. In time, the Cube became the center of Horadric works, and they found themselves relying on it greatly. Kulle was more adept at wielding the Cube than any of his breathren.\nAware of the dangers of corruption, and of the Cube's marred design, the Order determined that it was too dangerous for anyone to continue using it. That it had to be hidden from everyone, including them. Of all the Horadrim, only Kulle objected to the abandonment of the device. His experiments with the Cube were forced to end, and it was entrusted to a secret order, and Kulle was left unaware of its exact location.\nKulle was among the Horadrim that bound their &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"vessels\"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;. As the Horadrim could not conquer &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, these vessels would store their memories for future Horadrim.\nThe Binding of Hatred.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; was the first of the Prime Evils to be sealed in a soulstone. The Horadrim confronted him in one of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;'s urban centers, and the resulting battle caused great collateral damage. Kulle would later reflect that the innocents who survived might have questioned who the greater evil had been that day.\nThe Binding of Destruction.\nAfter sealing Mephisto, the Horadrim confronted &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. The main account states that during the fight, one of Baal's attacks shattered the soulstone that was supposed to imprison him. &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; however, subdued the raging demon lord and, gathering the largest of the soulstone's shards, trapped Baal's destructive essence within it. Another states that it was Kulle's inability to properly handle the stone in battle that led to its breaking. The truth appears to veer closer to the first account, for during their battle against Baal, both Tal Rasha and Kulle used the soulstone to incapacitate the Lord of Destruction, before Baal managed to shatter it, sneering \"what is the strength of man against Hell itself?\" Baal fled through a portal, and Tal Rasha &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed after him, but not before ordering Kulle to lead the Horadrim to the valley below where they would confront Baal. Kulle bitterly remarked that Tal Rasha had no idea what he was doing, but nevertheless, grimly led the Horadrim into the valley, battling their way through demons along the way.\nKulle and the Horadrim arrived, where they found Tal Rasha and Baal locked in mortal combat. In a second clash, Baal was once again subdued, and his essence bound inside the soulstone fragment. Kulle commented that the shard would not hold Baal for long. Tal Rasha suggested that they would procure another soulstone, but Kulle pointed out that only an &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;'s weapon could cleave the Worldstone, and even then, there was no way they could journey to Arreat before Baal escaped. Tal Rasha, unperturbed, stated that Tyrael would have answers.\nAccounts again differ as to whether it was Kulle or Tal Rasha who suggested the notion of a living host as a pseudo-soulstone. Kulle would later claim \"they [the Horadrim] asked the question, I merely answered it. Whatever the truth of the matter, Tal Rasha volunteered to take Baal's essence into himself, to wrestle with the Lord of Destruction for all eternity.\nAfter the Hunt.\nFollowing the capture of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, and the end of the Horadrim's quest, Kulle's demeanor darkened even further. He knew that despite the Horadrim's declarations to the contrary, the soulstones were no permanent solution to the Prime Evils, and yet, the Horadrim appeared to believe it to be so, even if they surely knew better. He warned them of the danger, but the Horadrim refused to listen.\nIt is said that Kulle became increasingly wary of the High Heavens, and on more than one occasion, ranted against the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;. It was, as he pointed out, the same body that had nearly eradicated mankind in the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, such an outcome only avoided by one vote. He believed that the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt; would eventually scour humanity from existence, in order to prevent humanity from reaching its true potential. At some point, Kulle learnt of the history of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; later wrote that Kulle's belief in mankind's \"true potential\" stemmed from its nephalem forebears. And that maybe, in the tales of the nephalem, he had found a glimmer of hope, a way to mend the tattered remnants of his humanity.\nAs the years passed, Kulle felt an emptiness within himself. He chafed at the \"arbitrary limitations\" of the Horadrim, and took leave of the order and returned to &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; in order to pursue his studies of magic.\n\"Note: The order of the events between Kulle leaving the Horadrim and his first death is unclear in some cases. It has been listed in approximated order.\"\nThe Vaults.\nSometime after the Dark Exile, Kulle worked with &lt;a href=\"Ayuzhan\"&gt;Ayuzhan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Clan\"&gt;Yshari Clan&lt;/a&gt;. They created &lt;a href=\"the%20Loom\"&gt;the Loom&lt;/a&gt;, which was located beneath an underground complex called the &lt;a href=\"Gatehall\"&gt;Gatehall&lt;/a&gt;. On the same day they began work on the Loom, a Horadric courier arrived at the Gatehall, begging for Kulle's aid in their war with the &lt;a href=\"Viz-Jaq%27taar\"&gt;Viz-Jaq'taar&lt;/a&gt;. Kulle refused.\nThey planned to use their &lt;a href=\"construct\"&gt;construct&lt;/a&gt;s as weapons against &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; so that humanity could flourish on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. However, they never designed the constructs to kill. One of Kulle's creations was the &lt;a href=\"Seneschal\"&gt;Seneschal&lt;/a&gt;, which was a one-of-a-kind construct.\nKulle insisted on the installation of elaborate traps within the Gatehall. He also constructed a number of s across &lt;a href=\"Estuar\"&gt;Estuar&lt;/a&gt;. They were protected by deadly traps of Kulle's own design, and guarded by his constructs.\nKulle and Ayuzhan disagreed on the nature of their project with the Loom. After one last argument, Kulle destroyed the device and collapsed the tunnels beneath the Gatehall. He left a sealed note for Ayuzhan, telling his friend that to attempt to rebuild the Loom without him would take a lifetime. He urged Ayuzhan to give up on the device, just as he had.\nIn his hubris, Kulle abandoned the vaults. Over time, various &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s attempted to plunder the vaults, but lost their lives. Eventually, they were taken over by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malphas\"&gt;Malphas&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed the vaults' power as his own.\nWar with the Viz-Jaq'taar.\nBurnt by his failure with the vaults, Kulle grudgingly aided the Horadrim in their war with the &lt;a href=\"Viz-Jaq%27taar\"&gt;Viz-Jaq'taar&lt;/a&gt;. All the while, he dreamt of greater wonders.\nThe Library of Zoltun Kulle.\nKulle established archives all over Sanctuary. Of note was the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, which would be the first library Kulle established. Alongside the library itself, Kulle crafted a series of unique &lt;a href=\"construct\"&gt;construct&lt;/a&gt;s to endure the shifting sands. His primary focus was the physical strength and obedience of the constructs, not their adaptability. The &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Sweeper\"&gt;Ash Sweeper&lt;/a&gt;s were one such construct; one of his early attempts at perfecting his &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt; servitors. Their priority was to curate and protect knowledge, but their interpretation of this directive led them to relieve many who traveled near the library of their possessions and lives. Fearing this behavior would draw attention to his library, Kulle sealed the constructs away.\nWithin the library, Kulle conducted a number of experiments; the creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt; proved useful to him in this regard. He also summoned demons and turned them into &lt;a href=\"Aberration\"&gt;Aberration&lt;/a&gt;s, and recorded his experiences in the Dark Exile in &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt;s. He created a &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;duplicate&lt;/a&gt; of himself, apparently letting his egomania get the better of him, but in truth, had created the duplicate to ensure the library's continuance.\nAt some point, Kulle obtained the &lt;a href=\"Sumina%20Glass\"&gt;Sumina Glass&lt;/a&gt;; a fractured shard of the &lt;a href=\"A%20Mirrored%20World\"&gt;Mirrored World&lt;/a&gt;. Kulle was wary of its power, but still used it to enter the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Plane\"&gt;Fractured Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Black Soulstone.\nAt some point, Kulle developed the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, a device which could imprison the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"angels\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. In his writings, Kulle stated his belief that he could use the stone to unlock humanity's &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; birthright, as he believed that it was inevitable that wars would be fought between Man, angel, and demon in the future. The Black Soulstone would be his \"gift\" to humanity. And, of course, it would increase his own power to that of his nephalem forebears. However, in his own research, Deckard Cain stated that by trapping the souls of angels and demons within the stone, Kulle would be granted the means to repair his own soul and emotions. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; believed likewise.\nKulle built an &lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Sands\"&gt;Desolate Sands&lt;/a&gt;, all for the sake of the research and experiments that would be required to create the Black Soulstone. He built them singlehandedly. &lt;a href=\"Li-Ming\"&gt;Li-Ming&lt;/a&gt; would later speculate that Kulle had built his archives here due to the Sands' inhospitability. As he worked on the stone, Kulle would lure unwilling Mages into his archives and subject them to gruesome experiments. He would draw their blood from their organs, all the while trying to distill their \"nephalem essence.\" Additionally, while he labored, he spent years setting traps in his archives in case the Horadrim came for him. As he worked on the stone, he developed an entirely new system of runes for trapping and summoning demons. Before long, he had marked a number of sites around Kehjistan for this purpose.\nKulle also conducted &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ation experiments in his library via &lt;a href=\"terminus\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt; devices. However, to his frustration, he couldn't get the terminus in the library to link with the one in his archives below the Desolate Sands.\nThe Horadrim learnt of Kulle's actions, and believed that they would draw the attention of Heaven and Hell to the mortal realm. Horadric Mages were sent into Kulle's library, but were struck down and resurrected as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; slaves. However, Kulle ended up abandoning the library. Believing that his actions would result in \"humanity's salvation,\" Kulle abandoned the library for his archives, as even after 1001 experiments, he couldn't get a terminus to link the two facilities.\nThe Horadrim later found and entered Kulle's archives, and triggered the wards he had set for them. Kulle was caught unaware, and labored to finish the Black Soulstone before they found him. However, find him they did. The Horadrim found Kulle in the midst of a summoning spell, and in the battle that followed, many Horadrim lost their lives, but they managed to defeat him. Centuries later, Kulle would claim that he could have easily slain the attacking Horadrim, but due to his power being invested in the summoning spell, in \"creating a miracle,\" his power was torn.\nWhile the Horadrim were able to defeat Kulle, by this stage, Kulle had become immortal. He bled sand, and mocked the Horadrim to the end. They drained the sand from his body before dismembering it cut off his head, and hid it within the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. The locks to the archives were sealed with two vials of his &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese artifacts were then hidden in vaults under the Desolate Sands, while his head was hidden in the Dahlgur Oasis. &lt;a href=\"Iben%20Fahd\"&gt;Iben Fahd&lt;/a&gt; carried Kulle's head, and the fallen mage mocked him until the end. The Horadrim subsequently made efforts to expunge all of Kulle's knowledge from the world.\nThe End of Days.\nShadows in the Desert.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Long after&lt;/a&gt; Kulle's death, &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; began to plot to overtake humanity. &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, and in order to retrieve it, they revived Kulle in his spirit form, after recovering his head. Kulle immediately recognised Tyrael's voice, but the angel revealed that he was now mortal. Kulle commented that fate was whimsical, and agreed to give them the Black Soulstone, but on the condition that he be restored to life. It was not an arrangement Tyrael was happy with, but he and his companions nonetheless agreed to Kulle's terms.\nThe Nephalem and Kulle went to retrieve his blood from the vials it had been stored in, both buried under the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Sands\"&gt;Desolate Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Kulle's head was carried in a bag. Along the way, Kulle conversed with The Nephalem (whom he knew to be a nephalem almost instantly), telling them of his time with the Horadrim, and claimed that they were the same, but that Adria and Tyrael would betray them. The verbal sparring continued, but the vials of blood were nonetheless retrieved, and they entered Kulle's old archives. Kulle instructed The Nephalem to use his blood to activate relics that were powered by the substance, and after entering the Shadow Realm, Kulle's body was retrieved. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, Kulle was revived in physical form. Walking the lands of the living (or, rather, floating above it).\nTrue to his word, Kulle accepted that the bargain they had made still stood, and ushered The Nephalem to the soulstone chamber, where the Black Soulstone awaited. To his surprise, he found that the soulstone already contained the souls of the lords of Hell sans Azmodan and Belial. He demanded that The Nephalem give up their quest, that their allies sought to betray them. Together, they could rule over all Creation. The Nephalem refused, and Kulle came to blows with his former ally/allies. The Nephalem killed Kulle, and took the soulstone into their own possession.\nKulle's Return.\nSeveral months after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, Zoltun Kulle managed to return to the Nephalem in his spirit form (but nonetheless not as powerless as he used to be when first awakened). He told the shocked hero(es) that not even they could have killed the undying Horadrim, and that he now required their help. The &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; designed by Kulle himself was hidden beneath the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Sescheron\"&gt;Ruins of Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; and could only be retrieved by someone who its guardians would deem worthy, while Kulle, obviously, would never pass their trial. The Nephalem agreed, and together with the deranged mage's spirit, managed to recover the artifact. As a token of his gratitude, Kulle unlocked its power, remaining at the Nephalem's side in their journey afterwards.\nKulle's Homily.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s genocide, Kulle was apparently able to (re)gain physical form. He delivered a homily to an unidentified individual. He recounted his history, from the time of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt; to his encounter with &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. Having finished his homily, he told the individual that history repeated itself, and asked them what they wouldn't do to free mankind.\nLegacy.\nIn life, Kulle always believed he would be famous, but his history is mired in shadow. Few ancient figures have such an extraordinary legacy, and fewer still are as reviled throughout Sanctuary.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;Five decades&lt;/a&gt; after his second death, Kulle's legacy with the vaults became manifest, as his constructs, now under the control of Malphas, threatened the world above.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nKulle appears in the \"&lt;a href=\"Destruction%27s%20End\"&gt;Destruction's End&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". The event has players reliving the sealing of Baal during the Dark Exile, standing-in as a Horadrim. Kulle is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, and both helps the player, and must be protected during segments of the dungeon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Memory of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; appears as an NPC in the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Horadrim\"&gt;Legacy of the Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; system. &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle%27s%20Ingenuity\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle's Ingenuity&lt;/a&gt; is the system's corresponding &lt;a href=\"vessel\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nKulle makes his first appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAs &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuick Route: Begin &lt;a href=\"Act%20II%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt;, Chapter 8, Part 3 - 'Soulstone Chamber'. Take the waypoint to &lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Archives of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe moment player enters the &lt;a href=\"Soulstone%20Chamber\"&gt;Soulstone Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, the battle does not begin yet, but the zone is already under lockdown (no &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;, no changing skills). To start the battle, players need to approach Kulle from either side.\nThe battle takes place on a circular arena, with the central circle being impassable. Kulle is assisted by two &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Guardian\"&gt;Eternal Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Dweller\"&gt;golems&lt;/a&gt;, which are quite slow, but very resilient and hit very hard in close combat. Upon death, they drop a guaranteed &lt;a href=\"Health%20Globe\"&gt;Health Globe&lt;/a&gt;. Zoltun Kulle himself cannot attack normally, but can use the following abilities:\nZoltun Kulle has a hard enrage timer of 3 minutes. Once enraged, he no longer has a cooldown on Cave-In, and deals triple damage with that ability.\nKulle is one of the six handpicked Boss monsters to feature an Uber appearance. His Uber appearance, named The Undying One, Depraved Zealot, has little changes in strategy, but there are a couple things to be aware of. Firstly, he has the aid of &lt;a href=\"Siegebreaker%20Assault%20Beast\"&gt;the Savage Behemoth&lt;/a&gt; instead of Eternal Guardians, which can cause trouble even for the best equipped of heroes. Secondly, his Slow Time bubbles are much worse compared to his canon encounter in Act II; they mercilessly destroy a hero's attack speed and movement, leaving him/her relatively helpless, and should therefore be escaped from as soon as possible.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Shaper\"&gt;Sand Shaper&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; variant of Zoltun Kulle.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Artisan\"&gt;Artisan&lt;/a&gt;.\nZoltun Kulle is found only in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, operating the &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; on the Nephalem's behalf. While the crafting itself is done through the cube's own interface, Zoltun's spirit is floating nearby, giving advice regarding the horadric recipes and taunting the player.\nOne of the recipes of the Cube, Law of Kulle, is named after him.\nDiablo IV.\nKulle does not appear directly in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" (sans a brief flashback) but his legacy is tied to the plot of \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Construct\"&gt;Season of the Construct&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nPersonality.\nAncient texts have portrayed Kulle in a number of different ways. Some call him a virtuous man who lost himself to the darkness of obsession. Others call him murderer, torturer, yet heroic member of the Horadrim. Monster, visionary, misguided genius, such tomes have labelled him all these things. What is known, however, is that Kulle possessed curiosity towards anything associated with &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Such fascination led to many magical experiments. He preferred to keep his creations on a tight leash.\nAs a member of the Ennead, Kulle was devoted to the pursuit of science and material manipulation. While a member of the Horadrim, &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt; described Kulle as being an intelligent and pious mage. In his early days, Kulle possessed a mirthful and spirited personality, but as the Hunt for the Three took its toll on him, his emotions deadened. By the time of Baal's defeat, Kulle had come to resent Tal Rasha, but nevertheless remained dedicated to the task Tyrael had entrusted the Horadrim with.\nAn egomaniac, Kulle's personality was laced with cynicism, sarcasm, and great ego. He regularly taunted his allies, though still afforded some respect to &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. He has displayed moments of megalomania, but also some honor. &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; commented that Kulle struck her as being spiteful, obsessed only with himself and his own vision. Adria commented that for every bit of Kulle's genius, he was surely mad; obsessed with immortality and power. Tyrael regarded Kulle as being a great man, driven mad by his experiences in the Dark Exile, while &lt;a href=\"Kharazim\"&gt;Kharazim&lt;/a&gt; considered Kulle powerful, but a fool for seeking immortality, per his &lt;a href=\"Sahptev\"&gt;faith&lt;/a&gt; stating that death was merely part of the cycle of life and rebirth.\nViews.\nAt his heart, Kulle was a humanist. In his early days, he dreamt of elevating humanity's condition. After the sealing of the Prime Evils, he developed a high opinion of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's place in Creation, believing &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s couldn't be trusted. He considered angels to be no better than demons, and he argued that it was humans, not angels, who were the true inheritors of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;, for it was only when Anu rejected his darker half that &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;true evil and suffering&lt;/a&gt; was born. In his mind, unlike Anu, humanity had to embrace its inner demons, and be all the stronger for it. In his mind, humanity embodied the \"reunification\" of Anu, given its shared demonic and angelic heritage. However, while Kulle believed in the worth of humanity, he believed himself amongst the greatest of his kind, which led to a dichotomy between his goals and his actions. \nBased on his writings, Kulle appears to have considered &lt;a href=\"Ayuzhan\"&gt;Ayuzhan&lt;/a&gt; a genuine friend. He later commented that Ayuzhan was the only person he ever met who approached his level as a peer. However, Kulle eventually came to pity others who would not share his grand vision of power. He concluded that perhaps his mind was too great for anyone else to truly comprehend his plans. By the time of his second death, Valla noted that Kulle now cared only for himself, not for humanity as a whole.\nKulle believed that truly successful experiments were often not the strongest, but the most adaptable.\nKulle had respect for &lt;a href=\"Ayuzhan\"&gt;Ayuzhan&lt;/a&gt;, who was the only person he ever considered his peer. He possessed mix feelings on Tal Rasha, whom he considered a \"selfless, noble fool,\" who, according to Kulle, never once questioned Tyrael's directions. However, he did concede that it was Tal Rasha's leadership which had held the Horadrim together.\nAbilities.\nKulle was one of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s in Sanctuary's history. As a former member of the Ennead Clan (of whom he was the greatest Mage, at least according to Kulle himself), Kulle was a master of alchemy, alteration, and transmutation. Transmuation was his specialty; he used living sand to create &lt;a href=\"Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;s and other creatures, or in the case of &lt;a href=\"the%20Eternal%20Guardian\"&gt;the Eternal Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, forge it from coalesced &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s. He was even able to create his own &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;teleportation device&lt;/a&gt;, and write &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt;s where the reader would re-live his memories.\nKulle also had the ability to summon demons.\nSuch was Kulle's magical strength that he could shape the earth itself. Kulle was able to achieve immortality, and Cain speculated that he had managed to awaken his nephalem birthright. In battle with The Nephalem, Kulle demonstrated abilities associated with &lt;a href=\"arcane%20magic\"&gt;arcane magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nKulle effectively achieved immortality by preparing artificial bodies with preserved memories for himself, just in case of tasting death again. Anticipating more \"deaths\" ahead, he referred to it as \"the sheer wonder of being Zoltun Kulle.\" In a rare moment of humility, &lt;a href=\"Li-Ming\"&gt;Li-Ming&lt;/a&gt; admitted that Kulle's magic might surpass her own.\nIn his spirit form, Kulle could sense his own &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Nor%20Tiraj\"&gt;Nor Tiraj&lt;/a&gt; considered Kulle's writings to be \"inspired,\" at least when the subject dealt with soulstones, or Kulle himself."}

Zorun Tzin was described as being a gaunt, bearded and dark-skinned mage with thinning grey hair. Zorun Tzin had been contracted by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Clans\"&gt;Council of Clans&lt;/a&gt; to discover more about the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; and their mysterious power. Zorun regularly tortured prisoners by magical means in order to extract information, and he did not hesitate to take lives. In secret, Zorun hoped to capture the Edyrem's leader, &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;, in order to harness his unbridled powers. Zorun also had an assistant, the giant &lt;a href=\"Terul\"&gt;Terul&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt bothered Zorun that the Edyrem - who he scornfully called 'peasants'- possessed tremendous powers, while it had required him a lifetime of intense studying in order to acquire his spell-casting skills. This was also one of Zorun's flaws - one that ultimately proved to be fatal: his ego. \nThrough magical means, Zorun ambushed Uldyssian as he was travelling along with Master &lt;a href=\"Fahin\"&gt;Fahin&lt;/a&gt;'s caravan. Fahin and all of the caravan's guard were slain in the process. Zorun then turned on his own bodyguards who were send by the Mage Clans to both guard and monitor their agent, killing them as well. \nUldysssian was taken to Zorun's sanctum for interrogation. However, while Zorun was distracted by emissaries of the Mage Clans, his servant Terul - who was in fact possessed by &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt; - tried to possess Uldyssian. Uldyssian managed to escape his predicament, blasting Zorun's chamber and incinerating Terul. As Zorun rushed into the chamber, Malic's vile spirit possessed him, killing the mage. \nZorun's body was later disposed of in the tunnels beneath Kehjan, as Malic's spirit found a new host to inhabit. Zorun's body was fed to a ravenous water demon, destroying any remaining traces of the mage. "}

Zov admired her, but Tabri treated him with some disdain. At some point, he fell into debt with &lt;a href=\"Emigne\"&gt;Emigne&lt;/a&gt;. No one among the Blades had their ear closer to the ground than Zov, and he was often able to weasel out of patrol duty.\nThe Light of Fahir.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, he stole a map from the Sand Scorpions, but was captured by &lt;a href=\"Thiago\"&gt;Thiago&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow bandits. However, he was saved by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;. They told him they were searching for a &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; buried beneath the sands. Zov told them that they best discuss the matter in a safer place. To this end, he led them to &lt;a href=\"Tabri%27s%20Encampment\"&gt;Tabri's Encampment&lt;/a&gt;, only to find it recovering from yet another &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt; attack, with Tabri having led a force into the desert to confront them.\nZov stayed in the encampment to aid the injured, while one of the lookouts led them after Tabri. He later joined the Shard-seeker in the desert\u2014they had helped Tabri battle the lacuni, but to his lack of surprise, had refused to aid them. Zov told them that the lacuni had abducted some of their men in their last attack. If they rescued the survivors and killed the &lt;a href=\"Alvas\"&gt;pack leader&lt;/a&gt;, Tabri might aid them. He returned to the camp, where he met with the hero(es) when they returned, bringing the pelt of a &lt;a href=\"Alvas\"&gt;pack leader&lt;/a&gt;. He took them to see Tabri. Zov tried to claim that he had killed the beast alongside the Shard-seeker, but Tabri saw through his lies.\nZov later met the hero(es) outside the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Chamber of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, after they'd found the &lt;a href=\"Fahir%27s%20Command\"&gt;first piece&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;Scepter of Fahir&lt;/a&gt;. He told them to head to &lt;a href=\"Sereth\"&gt;Sereth&lt;/a&gt; outpost to meet Tabri, while he went inside the chamber. To make sure nothing dangerous was left behind.\nZov and the rest of the Blades later came to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Chamber of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, where the hero presented the final scepter piece to Tabri. With the scepter reconstituted, Tabri declared herself to be the ruler of Shassar.

The Shard-seeker found him inside the library, and Zov claimed that he was searching for Tabri. Tabri had become suspicious of Zov, and ordered &lt;a href=\"Peth\"&gt;Peth&lt;/a&gt; to keep in eye on him. When presented with her orders, Zov laughed it off, claiming that Tabri was joking. In truth, Zov was indeed following his own agenda, and used the Shard-seeker to guide him through the library as they searched for Tabri, while he planned to make his move when the time was right.\nTabri and the Shard-seeker made their way through the library; more than once, Zov stumbled into a trap, forcing the Shard-seeker to save him. Eventually, they reached the frame of a &lt;a href=\"terminus\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt;. Zov spotted two pairs of footprints, one smaller than the other, both of them going through the frame and disappearing. The Shard-seeker was able to activate the terminus, and entered the &lt;a href=\"Obliterated%20Realm\"&gt;realm beyond&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing fight, Tabri and &lt;a href=\"Vataos\"&gt;Vataos&lt;/a&gt; were both apparently killed, and the scepter rolled out of the portal. Zov gleefully took it and ran off, intent on selling it.\nIn-game.\nZov is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

A notification is displayed onscreen whenever a Stone of Jordan is sold, indicating the number that have been sold. Once a certain number is reached, the whole screen shakes and the words 'Diablo walks the earth' appear on the screen. This message means that \u00dcber Diablo is ready to spawn. He will spawn in place of the first &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;super-unique monster&lt;/a&gt; a player encounters; &lt;a href=\"Eldritch%20the%20Rectifier\"&gt;Eldritch the Rectifier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bishibosh\"&gt;Bishibosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rakanishu\"&gt;Rakanishu&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"Corpsefire\"&gt;Corpsefire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Evil\"&gt;Den of Evil&lt;/a&gt; would be replaced by him. Therefore players can basically choose the location for Uber Diablo by going specifically to the desired super-unique location.\nHe is similar in appearance to Hell level &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and is a formidable challenge. It is recommended to have &lt;a href=\"Prevents%20Monster%20Heal\"&gt;Prevents Monster Heal&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt;, high lightning and fire &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; and physical &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; before taking on \u00dcber Diablo. Non-physical damage builds should consider items that reduce enemy resistances, to overwhelm Diablo's defences and self-healing.\nUpon killing, \u00dcber Diablo drops the only &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt; Small &lt;a href=\"Charms\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; in the game, the charm. Along with , it is one of two items in the game that gives '+ to experience gained'.\nIn game, the monster is simply named Diablo, but he is frequently referred to as \u00dcber Diablo by both official sources and fans.\nDiablo II: Resurrected.\nIn \"\", \u00dcber Diablo spawns across all worlds in a realm once enough Stone of Jordan rings are sold. \nThe following messages begin appearing to all players in the realm depending on how many of the rings are sold, in descending order until \u00dcber Diablo appears:\n1. Terror gazes upon Sanctuary\n2. Terror approaches Sanctuary\n3. Terror begins to form within Sanctuary\n4. Terror spreads across Sanctuary\n5. Terror is about to be unleashed upon Sanctuary\n6. Diablo has invaded Sanctuary\nSpawning.\nSelling Stones of Jordan to a vendor in a game gives an onscreen indicator of how many SoJs have been sold on the internet protocol (IP) of that game's server. The message \"XXXX \"Stones of Jordan sold to merchant\" will likewise appear on every game running on that IP (ladder and non ladder). Since the beginning of 2018, ladder and non ladder are separated by IP. When the required amount of SoJs are sold (between 75 and 120), \u00dcber Diablo will spawn in every Hell difficulty game running on that IP (both ladder and non-ladder). The amount of SoJs shown in the on-screen message does not represent the amount of SoJs sold since the last spawn, rather that of the total amount of the rings sold.\nDiablo III.\nAn increased-difficulty version of Diablo named the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Evil\"&gt;Soul of Evil&lt;/a&gt; appears in the Realm of Fright for players that use the corresponding &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Machine\"&gt;Infernal Machine&lt;/a&gt;. This boss has most of the same abilities as in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;normal Diablo III encounter&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of sending players to the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Realm of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, he summons two additional \u00dcber bosses from the other Infernal Machine events. Fighting up to three \u00dcber bosses at once recalls the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt; rather than \u00dcber Diablo specifically, but until &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt; 19 this was the only equivalent in the game.\nSeason 19 brought a different version, which (similar the original \u00dcber Diablo) could appear in any zone, this time triggered by a very long kill streak.

He is an enhanced version of &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Pain.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt; plodded along through the centuries, many in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; began to wonder just what it was they were fighting over. The &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evil\"&gt;Lesser Evil&lt;/a&gt;s of Hell were growing tired of the endless ebb and flow in the tides of mortal favor, as well as those in the elaborate schemes of the three Prime Evils - Diablo, Baal and Mephisto. The Lesser Evils longed to return to the epic days of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, and lay siege again to the gates of the High Heavens.\nTwo of the Lesser Evils, &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, saw the situation as their chance to overthrow the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s and take control of Hell for themselves. The two Demon lords made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; - as well as their minor brethren - assuring them that humanity would not deter the ultimate victory of Hell. Azmodan and Belial devised a plan to end the stalemate and achieve victory in the Sin War, ultimately riding the bloody crest of the Great Conflict straight into Armageddon. Thus, a great revolution was set into motion as all of Hell went to war against the Three Brothers, seeking to send them into a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the next two centuries, the three imprisoned brothers focused their Demonic powers upon corrupting the &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s that bound them to the mortal plane and began bending the will of any nearby humans. &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; was the first imprisoned and, consequently, was the first to break free from his bondage. His wrath against those who had put him such a compromised position was swift and merciless.\nAs punishment for his part in the Dark Exile that sent the Prime Evils to the mortal realm, Duriel has been left behind by &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; to guard the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tomb of Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;. Embittered by this new position of solitary servitude, the Lord of Pain has claimed the souls and blood of many bold adventurers.\nTips and Other Additional Information.\n\u00dcber Duriel uses the same attacks as before, but he is much stronger. He regenerates &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; twice as quickly as normal monsters, and his second melee attack has a 100% chance of dealing +40-50% physical damage at an Attack Rating of 8818, with a stun duration of 1.2 seconds. His &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Attack Rating&lt;/a&gt; is relatively low, so Barbarians with &lt;a href=\"Shout\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt; and Paladins with &lt;a href=\"Defiance\"&gt;Defiance&lt;/a&gt; Aura will greatly increase your party's survivability. His Drain Effectiveness is also quite high, so &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt; or weapons which provide Life Stealing will be very beneficial against him."}

The legendary deeds of the heroes of the realms beyond elicit both veneration and insight.\nThe greatest of these heroes was Izual, lieutenant to the Archangel &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and bearer of the Angelic Runeblade &lt;a href=\"Azurewrath\"&gt;Azurewrath&lt;/a&gt;. He once led a fierce attack upon the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt; as the creation of the dark demonblade &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang\"&gt;Shadowfang&lt;/a&gt; was nearing completion. During the battle that ensued, Izual was overcome by legions of Chaos and was lost to the Darkness.\n&lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; now remains as a dark, tortured soul who is trapped within the forsaken realms of Hell. Despite his valor and strength, his form was twisted by the perverse powers of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. They forced him to betray his own kind and give up Heaven's most guarded secrets. Izual became a corrupt shadow of his former self; a fallen angel trusted neither by Heaven nor Hell.\nFor his transgressions, the spirit of Izual was bound within the form of a terrible creature that was summoned from the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. His maddened spirit has resided within that tortured husk for many ages now. Although he now certainly no longer carries the weapon &lt;a href=\"Azurewrath\"&gt;Azurewrath&lt;/a&gt;, Izual still possesses great strength and powers within his new form. He is a threat to any who would oppose him, and in his current state, it is certain that he will see you as opposition.\nTips and Other Additional Information.\n\u00dcber Izual has two new abilities which make him much more dangerous. He can slow you down with and &lt;a href=\"Chilling%20Armor\"&gt;Chilling Armor&lt;/a&gt;, then close to one of your casters and hack away at them. Because he is immune to &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;, your party will have to fight more reactively, so &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es should be ready to Teleport away and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s should cast &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Armor\"&gt;Bone Armor&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for this. His melee attack also has a 100% chance of +50-80% Cold damage on striking, with a 4 second chill duration. Melee and tank characters like s and &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s should equip \"Cannot be Frozen\" gear to keep from being slowed. He deals a massive amount of damage, so gear which provides Damage Reduction and &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Resistance\"&gt;Cold Resistance&lt;/a&gt; will help immensely.\n\u00dcber Izual uses the following Skills: Frost Nova, Chilling Armor, Teleport."}

Adventurers powerful and clever enough to unravel the secrets behind this \"Pandemonium\" will obtain knowledge and treasure used only by the most powerful agents of sin.\nTips and Other Additional Information.\n\u00dcber Mephisto has become far more powerful since your last encounter. If &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Diablo\"&gt;Pandemonium Diablo&lt;/a&gt; is the tank and &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Baal\"&gt;\u00dcber Baal&lt;/a&gt; is the support caster, Mephisto is the artillery. Beware of his long range attacks, such as , , and .

To achieve mere 60% chance to hit, a level 80 Paladin requires 5,722 Attack Rating, growing exponentially. Achieving 95% chance to hit would require an impossible 1,340,640 Attack Rating.\nDue to this, an effective way of dealing with \u00dcber Mephisto is using an attack that always hits regardless of Attack Rating, such as &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Guided%20Arrow\"&gt;Guided Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nZero Drain Effectiveness means that &lt;a href=\"Life%20steal\"&gt;Life steal&lt;/a&gt; doesn't work on \u00dcber Mephisto at all. However, cursing him with &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt; allows players to leech life from him. This makes &lt;a href=\"Dracul%27s%20Grasp\"&gt;Dracul's Grasp&lt;/a&gt; gloves or &lt;a href=\"Exile%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Exile&lt;/a&gt; shield an invaluable item to bring to battle if your party lacks a Necromancer. Sometimes, a &lt;a href=\"Wand\"&gt;Wand&lt;/a&gt; with Life Tap charges is enough to curse him, as it can be wielded by any character and can be bought at NPCs."}

This will create the &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; to \u00dcber Tristram.\n\u00dcber Tristram has the same base structure as the regular Tristram, but has a pack-load of hellish &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s, like the rare and powerful s. There are also varieties of &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Monsters\"&gt;Champions&lt;/a&gt; and their minions along with the masters of the pack, the \u00dcber Prime Evils themselves. The main objective for the player(s) upon reaching \u00dcber Tristram is to find and defeat &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Baal\"&gt;\u00dcber Baal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Mephisto\"&gt;\u00dcber Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Diablo\"&gt;Pandemonium Diablo&lt;/a&gt; (called so since &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Diablo\"&gt;\u00dcber Diablo&lt;/a&gt; already exists in-game as part of another &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Jordan%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;).\n\u00dcber Mephisto has a &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aura\"&gt;Aura&lt;/a&gt;, which causes -65% to all of the player's/players' resistances, and summons &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Mage\"&gt;Skeleton Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Archer\"&gt;Archers&lt;/a&gt; everywhere, which can be a challenging task. Pandemonium Diablo is a \"tank\" for \u00dcber Baal. He has tons of &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; and summons &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Lord\"&gt;Pit Lord&lt;/a&gt;s which are &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to everything but Physical &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. \u00dcber Baal is pretty much the same as &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. He has a little more life though, and summons &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Lord\"&gt;Ghoul Lord&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, which are both &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; Immune.\nOnce the player(s) kills them, the last one of them to die will give the player(s) the , a which gives +3 to any one of a certain &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;, and random amounts of &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Character%20Attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Standard%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Standard of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;. The Standard of Heroes is a symbol that shows that the player(s) has/have completed this &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; successfully.\nTips for Players.\nOne simple way to kill all of the three \u00dcbers in particular, is with the &lt;a href=\"Smiter\"&gt;Smiter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20builds\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;.\nA fool-proof way to kill the \u00dcbers is to run straight up when you enter the portal. Then go around to the left and go halfway down. Then slowly walk toward the center of Tristram. This causes Diablo and Baal to charge at you. Run away to the left and top again so Mephisto doesn't instantly kill you. Then work on Diablo first because his Pit Lords can kill you pretty quickly. Baal comes next. It may take a few tries, but make sure you make your game permanent, so if you die, you can save and exit and come back. After the two easiest are dead, Mephisto is left. He is easily the hardest monster in the entire game, though there are a few different ways to kill him.\nDepending on your skill as a player, the speed of your computer, and the ability of your build. The first way to kill him is to just charge in and attack like a madman. If Life Tap isn't cast within the first 10-15 seconds, you will die and have to start over again, though by going to the various magic vendors (such as &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; in Act I) you can buy a &lt;a href=\"Wands\"&gt;Wand&lt;/a&gt; with charges of &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt;. Simply by having the wand in your second &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; set allows you to cast Life Tap before going in, making all of the three bosses trivial and eliminating the luck factor involved with other methods. The second way to kill him is to trigger him, then run into a building \"away\" from the portal, and let him follow you into it and get stuck. Then, either &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; out (if you're wearing ), die, or save and exit. Then, after you're back in the game, run straight to the house and attack him. Since he is kept away from his minions, his Conviction Aura is less of a threat, though this may take a few tries."}

The special &lt;a href=\"event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;s and/or locations where \u00dcber bosses appear are sometimes called \u00dcber events or \u00dcber (location). Some sort of unlocking process is generally required to access such bosses. &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Diablo\"&gt;\u00dcber Diablo&lt;/a&gt; was the first \u00dcber boss, featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", which has a total of seven distributed among five separate encounters. \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" also has seven \u00dcber bosses, with four different encounters.\n\u00dcber bosses are often encountered in pairs or triplets. The \"\u00dcber locations\" where most appear are alternate forms of regular game areas. The name \"\u00dcber\" does not appear in game, but is used by Blizzard staff to categorize the bosses and explain the events to players. An \u00dcber boss may or may not have the same name as its original form, may have a recolored visual model, and may have different abilities.\nWhile Blizzard may provide some lore or flavor for these bosses, they generally are present to provide a high level gameplay challenge, not to be a major part of the plot. Their appearances in \u00dcber form may not be canonical to the primary story.\nDiablo II.\n\u00dcber Diablo was the first \u00dcber boss released, appearing in the regular game world. He was followed later by the more complex Pandemonium Event with six new bosses in special unlockable locations. All can be quite challenging; completing the Pandemonium Event may even require specialized &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s.

While they are much more challenging than other bosses at their &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; level, they can be quite easy for highly geared characters, since they only scale with base difficulty of the game session, with no progression system like &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt; ranks.

{"id": "2118", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2118", "title": "Aranoch", "text": "Aranoch is a sand-swept desert land. Bordered by the &lt;a href=\"Tamoe%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;Tamoe Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; to the east, Aranoch serves as a natural barrier between the east and west of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nBoasting one of the harshest climates in the world, the deserts of Aranoch claim the lives of many each year. Only the most robust and highly-trained nomads survive longer than a few hours in this scorching environment. These nomadic clans either live as wandering traders or dwell temporarily in vast subterranean caverns to escape the desert's oppressive heat. Geographically, mainly comprised of vast, empty tracts, punctuated with but a few specially-adapted plants and trees. Water is a rarity among the sand dunes of Aranoch, with dry spells reportedly lasting for years. The climate of this desert ranges from life-threatening heat during summer days, to dry frigid winds during winter nights. Although a few bands of nomadic people have found ways to survive in this hostile desert, most steer clear of these sandy wastelands. Bandits are an issue however, especially along major trade routes.\nThe perilous nature of Aranoch's unique and deadly environment is without equal. Few creatures could survive in habitats so unforgiving, but some hardy beasts have managed. The &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt; are one notable example.\nThe inhabitants of Aranoch have long practiced the art of preserving the dead, in a process of &lt;a href=\"mummy\"&gt;mummification&lt;/a&gt;. Nobles were sometimes buried with their masters. Some of Aranoch's tombs have been plundered.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\n&lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28Country%29\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; once controlled the northern reaches of Aranoch. The &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Valley of the Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt; was used to bury their &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, the land's east once served as a colony of Kehjistan, with the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; establishing military outposts. However, by the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the empire had begun to pull back, which allowed for the port-city of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; to fill the power vacuum the empire left. Vizjerei temples were possibly left behind. For much of its history however, Aranoch remained a natural geographic barrier. Much of what the people of the east knew about the west was gleaned through &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt; merchants who traded in &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. \nAt some point in the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23c.%20264\"&gt;third century&lt;/a&gt;, the land was ravaged by conflict.\nSeveral hundred years before the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Aranoch was plunged into unnatural darkness by the &lt;a href=\"Claw%20Viper\"&gt;Claw Viper&lt;/a&gt;s. They errected an altar and were able to cut off the light of the sun. Through some means, the eclipse was ended.\nIn the 11th century, Aranoch would be traversed by the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;. At the behest of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tassara\"&gt;Tassara&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; would lead an army to spread the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith to the people of the west. After landing at Lut Gholein, the city's mercantile guild agreed to supply Rakkis with additional soldiers and provisions in exchange for continued autonomy. Moving on from the city into the desert's northern reaches, Rakkis's army met its first resistance in the form of the kingdom of Ivgorod, which was opposed to Rakkis's army both physically and culturally. The two sides clashed among the dunes in a series of one-sided engagements. The Kehjistani soldiers were masters of warfare in open terrain, and shattered Ivgorod's hold on the land. Never again would Ivgorod reclaim its former desert territory.\nThe army pressed on west, eventually crossing the Tamoe mountains and crossing into the lands beyond. Finally, Aranoch had been crossed.\nRecent History.\nAt some point after Aranoch was crossed, a number of major trade routes were established that ran across the desert into &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, Aranoch was beset by ill tidings. The people of Lut Gholein whispered of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; rising from their tombs, and &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; roaming the dunes at night. The land was temporarily shrouded by an unnatural eclipse caused by &lt;a href=\"Claw%20Viper\"&gt;Claw Viper&lt;/a&gt;s."}

After reading the journal, a portal leading to the &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Canyon of the Magi&lt;/a&gt; opens.\nThe four paths are essentially the same layout, but each with a specialty: one path would contain portals/teleporters, another with stairs and platforms in an impossible geometric shape (which turns out to be the bane of the minions/mercenaries' &lt;a href=\"pathing%20AI\"&gt;pathing AI&lt;/a&gt;), yet another with regular stairs, and the final one with floor traps. &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;The Summoner&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Horazon%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Horazon's Journal&lt;/a&gt; and his summoning circle, can be placed in any of these arms.\nThe thinness of the walking space and the constant turning of the paths means that people with (such as possibly Horazon himself) would have an easier time than those without.\nThe area is filled with s, &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Goatman\"&gt;goatmen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"lightning%20spire\"&gt;lightning spire&lt;/a&gt;s. The description would be that of a set of cathedral-like stone platforms suspended in outer space; stars and a black void whiz by in the background.\nWhen you and/or your battalion range-attack a &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt; while it flies above the dark, surfaceless void, the Specter's corpse will fall and land in mid-air, on the same elevation as the floor you're walking on. Due to an apparent game programming oversight, the Specter's corpse will not fall forever through the bottomless void; the void has an invisible floor inaccessible to you and your cohorts that the corpse will land on.\nArcane Sanctuary, along with Arreat Summit, is one of the two locations in the game where the \"perspective\" video setting does not work. This is because perspective requires two layers to work with: one being the ground and the other for the objects (characters, trees, etc.) that move relative to it. The Arcane Sanctuary has one layer reserved for the background that shows the stellar void, hence perspective cannot work because both the foreground and objects share the other layer and thus cannot move relative to one another."}

It is initiated by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Drognan\"&gt;Drognan&lt;/a&gt; after completing the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Sun\"&gt;Tainted Sun&lt;/a&gt; quest, who instructs the player to speak with Lord &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt;. After speaking with Jerhyn, the palace is no longer off limits for the player. The player explores the palace cellars to locate the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, where he/she must find &lt;a href=\"Horazon%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Horazon's Journal&lt;/a&gt;. After the journal has been read, a special red portal opens to the &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Canyon of the Magi&lt;/a&gt; and the quest is completed. \nBackground.\nDrognan has been researching the old records in order to find the location of the Tomb of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;. His research revealed the existence of a mythical &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, built by the great mage &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt;. In his sanctuary, Horazon summoned and enslaved demons and kept an eye on great events, such as the imprisonment of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. He also kept a record of the happenings of the outer world. Therefore, the Sanctuary should hold some clue to the whereabouts of the True Tomb of Tal Rasha. As &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt;'s palace was built on the ruins of an ancient Vizjerei fortress, &lt;a href=\"Drognan\"&gt;Drognan&lt;/a&gt; believes that there is an entrance hidden within the palace's cellars. Still there's no telling what could be waiting inside...\nFurther Information and Tips.\nEnter the Palace and fight your way through the two levels of &lt;a href=\"Harem\"&gt;the harem&lt;/a&gt; and three levels of &lt;a href=\"The%20Palace%20Cellar\"&gt;The Palace Cellar&lt;/a&gt;. There is a &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; on the first level of the palace cellar. On the third level of the cellar, there is a portal in the middle of a room. It is guarded by several &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Raider\"&gt;Sand Raider&lt;/a&gt; demons and a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; monster named &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Eye\"&gt;Fire Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the portal to open it, then click again to enter the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arcane Sanctuary consists of four \"arms\" with a &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; at the center. &lt;a href=\"Horazon%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Horazon's Journal&lt;/a&gt; is randomly placed at the end of one of the arms. At the end of the other three arms, there's typically a golden &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; filled with treasures.\nFight your way through the maze of narrow paths and red portals. There will be several &lt;a href=\"Goatman\"&gt;Goatmen&lt;/a&gt;, s and &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s waiting in ambush. The small corridors allow the player to fight them in small packs, although the fire spells from the Vampires can be nasty, so items or skills that provide &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; are helpful. The quest notification will pop up with &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Summoner&lt;/a&gt; quest upon locating the super unique of the Sanctuary, who is conveniently close to &lt;a href=\"Horazon%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Horazon's Journal&lt;/a&gt;. Defeat &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;The Summoner&lt;/a&gt; and read the Journal. A special Red &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; opens to the &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Canyon of the Magi&lt;/a&gt;, and the quest log will now display the symbol of the True Tomb of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;."}

Deals damage with every tick to all enemies within approximately 4 yards of the impact point. This damage increases by 305% as Arcane for every tick of channeling, up to 1010% damage as Arcane (that is, reaching full potency after 2 ticks, normally 2 seconds). Stopping the channeling will reset that bonus.\nIf the Wizard moves after casting, missiles will still hit the targeted location, but cannot move while channeling. Arcane Torrent has a limited range, roughly 60 yards.\nArcane Torrent is very useful against &lt;a href=\"Waller\"&gt;Waller&lt;/a&gt; elite packs, as it can shoot over walls, blocking the enemies' own fire, but not impairing the Wizard's. Moreover, its missiles are not considered &lt;a href=\"projectiles\"&gt;projectiles&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore are not slowed by &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; or Missile Dampening affix.\nDue to the delay between launch and the moment of impact, it may be challenging to aim at the moving target.\u00a0The delay varies very little with distance, hitting even the Wizard's location in no less than 0.35 seconds.\nArcane Torrent may not be used on empty air areas (i.e. off-border on some maps) and most types of impassable terrain, making it less useful against flying enemies.\nLeaving this skill with the Cascade rune or none at all (to keep its damage type Arcane) and combining it with the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Flux\"&gt;Temporal Flux&lt;/a&gt; passive ability, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weapon\"&gt;Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt; buff with the Conduit rune makes Arcane Torrent a very lethal AoE damage dealer plus &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; skill, combining the best aspects of Arcane Torrent and &lt;a href=\"Ray%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Ray of Frost&lt;/a&gt; and allowing to fire it for a very long time.\nDevelopment.\nPrior to Patch 2.1, it used the plain damage, regardless of channeling time. Developers wanted to add a 30 Arcane Power initial cost to compensate, but then decided to decrease the starting damage and add the channeling bonus.\nOriginally this skill had a Power Stone rune, which was the only existing remnant of Mana Globes (a variant of &lt;a href=\"Health%20Globes\"&gt;Health Globes&lt;/a&gt;)."}

He was a highly regarded member, but a shadow fell over him, and he began showing petulance to the senior members of the Church. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would later speculate that Lazarus was one of the first members of the faith to be irrevocably corrupted by the Lord of Hatred. Whatever the truth of the matter, his actions came to the notice of &lt;a href=\"Que-Hegan\"&gt;Que-Hegan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;Sankekur&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote him a letter demanding that he account for his insubordination. Sankekur threatened him with replacement if he did not live up to his expected duties.\nIn truth, Mephisto had been corrupting Zakarum for centuries. Sankekur became his embodiment on the mortal plane. Lazarus, under Mephisto's influence, was given the task of awakening &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, who had been imprisoned underneath a &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nAwakening Terror.\nAt the behest of the Zakarum Church, &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; and declared himself king. Lazarus was among his entourage, and indeed, it was Lazarus who had convinced Leoric to make the journey in the first place. It was also at Lazarus's insistence that the Tristram Cathedral be appropriated as\u00a0Leoric's seat of power. Not long after Leoric took power, Diablo awoke within the catacombs beneath the cathedral. Sensing that freedom was within his grasp, Diablo entered the nightmares of the archbishop and lured him into the dark, subterranean labyrinth. In his terror, Lazarus raced throughout the abandoned hallways until he at last came to the chamber of Diablo's &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. No longer in command of his body or &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;, he raised the stone above his head and uttered words long forgotten in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt;. His will destroyed, Lazarus shattered the soulstone upon the ground. Diablo once again came into the world of Man. Diablo told Lazarus of things few mortals knew of, namely of the existence of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt; that the two realms waged against one another: how this war had brought discord to the mortal realm, and how the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; had come to Sanctuary in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;. He told Lazarus of his plan to reunite with his brothers, Mephisto and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would later speculate whether Lazarus had known of the agenda that had been given to him, but regardless, Diablo had been freed.\nAlthough he was released from his imprisonment within the soulstone, the Lord of Terror was still greatly weakened from his long sleep and required an anchor to the world. Once he had found a mortal form to wear, he could begin to reclaim his vastly depleted power. The great demon weighed the souls residing in the town above, and chose to take the strongest of them - that of King Leoric.\nPrying Eyes.\nDiablo's possession of Leoric took its toll. The king became irrational at first, but soon began to show signs of madness and paranoia. Lazarus, under Diablo's sway as well, kept close to the king at all times, hoping that the demon's power would grow unnoticed. However, Diablo's effects on Leoric's mind and body couldn't be hidden as he became increasingly haggard and deranged, ordering executions of any who dared question his methods or authority. The knight &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;Lachdanan&lt;/a&gt; tried to ascertain the nature of Leoric's change of character, but Lazarus admonished him at every turn for questioning the actions of his king.\nAs Leoric grew more wary of the \"traitorous rabble\" within Tristram, he ordered the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Araneae\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt; to the east of his &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt; be sealed. Lazarus had managed to &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;ally bind some &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s to his will; a process that took weeks, with many of his servants disappearing over the time. The king ordered that Lazarus's creations be placed inside the caves. &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Eamon\"&gt;Chancellor Eamon&lt;/a&gt; sorrowfully carried out Leoric's wishes.\nLazarus was beside Leoric when he had his wife, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Asylla\"&gt;Queen Asylla&lt;/a&gt;, executed. Asylla pleaded with her husband, saying that she had never betrayed him, was Lazarus assured Leoric that these were \"lies until the very end.\" \nAs tensions grew between the two, Lazarus charged Lachdanan with treason against the kingdom. To the priests and knights of Leoric's court, the prospect of Lachdanan committing treachery was ridiculous. Lazarus's actions had now galvanized the court against their king, becoming increasingly suspicious of foul treachery. Seeking to contain the eroding situation, Lazarus convinced Leoric that &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; was plotting against him, seeking to annex his lands. Leoric flew into a rage and summoned his advisers to his side. Manipulated by the archbishop, the paranoid king declared a state of war between the two kingdoms. Those closest to the king tried to convince him that the war was unjust and unwinnable, but Lazarus was ever at his liege's side, and kept him convinced of the Westmarch's supposed intentions. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20of%20Khanduras\"&gt;Royal Army of Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; was thus ordered to march to war, with Lachdanan leading it. With the absence of prying eyes, Diablo was now free to assert his control over the king.\nDespite Diablo's free reign, he found that he could not take complete control over the king. Thus, he sought a new host, and settled on the king's son, &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;. Lazarus noted that with Asylla gone, he was free to fully 'prepare' Albrecht for what was to come. Enjoined by his dark master, Lazarus dragged the terrified youth into the darkness of the labyrinth. Diablo easily took possession of the youth. Leoric, however, was still in a state of madness, and the absence of Albrecht only increased it. Eventually it came to pass that Lachdanan and his fellow knights (survivors of the ill-fated war against Westmarch) were forced to kill their liege. While this granted Tristram some respite, it began to come under siege by strange creatures\u2014manifestations of Diablo's terror.\nIt was at this point that Lazarus emerged, assuring the townsfolk that he too had been ravaged by the evil that had gripped the cathedral. Reminding them that Prince Albrecht was still unaccounted for, and speaking of \"holy retribution,\" he persuaded many of the men to follow him into the depths of the monastery to search for the boy. With their desperate need for assurance clouding their good judgment, they armed themselves with torches to light the way and farm tools to defend themselves, then boldly followed the treacherous archbishop into the cathedral depths. He led them into an ambush and disappeared into the depths as the townsfolk were left to die at the hands of a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt;. Not only had Lazarus led his countrymen to their deaths, but their deaths strengthened Diablo as well.\nLazarus's End.\nLazarus was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moreina\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the depths of the cathedral. They found him at a sacrificial altar with a young boy. It was not Albrecht as they had first suspected, but the archbishop was slain anyway.\nLegacy.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Over twenty years&lt;/a&gt; after Lazarus's death, &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; encountered a ghostly simaculum of him standing beside Leoric in his &lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Hold\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, both presiding over Asylla's death.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nLazarus is encountered towards the end of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\". His boss fight cannot be avoided. He is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Succubi\"&gt;Succubi&lt;/a&gt;. It is recommended that after the cutscene plays, the player leave the area (in order to avoid the projectiles) and pick off the demons one by one. Afterwards, Lazarus himself can be dealt with.\nStats.\nArchbishop Lazarus: &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Advocate\"&gt;Advocate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;\nDiablo III.\nAlthough his physical form doesn't make a return in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;\"Diablo III\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; does encounter a ghostly apparition of Lazarus, along with King Leoric during the exploration of the latter's castle. In addition, the Archbishop had created a very dangerous brood of &lt;a href=\"spiders\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Araneae\"&gt;Queen Araneae&lt;/a&gt;, which he used to infest an &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Araneae\"&gt;ancient ruin&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's manor&lt;/a&gt; at the request of the increasingly paranoid king. Twenty years later, these spiders were slain by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, who passed through these caverns while trailing &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Coven\"&gt;Dark Coven&lt;/a&gt; to the manor in order to rescue the fallen &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Lazarus%27s%20Grimoire\"&gt;Lazarus's Grimoire&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Act%20I%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;first act&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", in &lt;a href=\"the%20Cursed%20Hold\"&gt;the Cursed Hold&lt;/a&gt; where Lazarus had Queen Asylla executed.\nLazarus reappears as a boss in the &lt;a href=\"Anniversary%20Dungeon\"&gt;Anniversary Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", using a recolored model (complete with a high pope hat) of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;.

He was remembered by &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt; as being a kind man once, and &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt; noted that he always seemed to care so much for the people of Tristram. &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, on her part however, sensed a conflict within his being right up to his last hours of life. Whatever the case however, Lazarus expressed full commitment to his &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Tomes\"&gt;writings&lt;/a&gt;."}

A &lt;a href=\"Portal\"&gt;red town portal&lt;/a&gt; will now open next to the pentagram on level fifteen. This leads to the &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Altar\"&gt;Unholy Altar&lt;/a&gt;.\nInside, there are two Books of Vileness on stands adjacent to circles on the floor. Reading each one will teleport the hero into a room with several &lt;a href=\"Hellspawn\"&gt;Hellspawn&lt;/a&gt;, a type of &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubus&lt;/a&gt; demon. After both Books of Vileness have been read, a new circle will appear where the hero entered the Unholy Altar. Using this will teleport the hero to Lazarus immediately following a &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;. Lazarus will declare that the hero is too late and will set off a trap, causing several more Hellspawn and an Advocate to enter the room. Lazarus also has two Succubus bodyguards: &lt;a href=\"Blackjade\"&gt;Blackjade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Vex\"&gt;Red Vex&lt;/a&gt;. The fallen clergyman himself is similar to an &lt;a href=\"Advocate\"&gt;Advocate&lt;/a&gt;, but more powerful. Defeating him completes the quest, allowing access to &lt;a href=\"Level%2016%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;level sixteen&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Diablo quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nCutscene.\nThe cutscene shows the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; with mountains in the background and the shores of a lake to the left. Inside we see a church office, and Archbishop Lazarus resembles at first, a normal man. But as the footage starts to show him up close, his eyes give off a sheer evil, bloodied glow.\nMultiplayer Mode.\nThis quest is one of the four quests that appear in Multiplayer mode. Instead of having to retrieve the Staff of Lazarus, the quest is initiated by Deckard Cain anytime after first reaching level fourteen. Lazarus is on level fifteen itself. He is in a room with the Unholy Altar (the altar itself with the sacrificed child, not the mini-level) and several other enemies (Succubi and Mages). Like in single player, Blackjade and Red Vex are guarding him, but this time he also has &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; lurking somewhere nearby. Defeating Lazarus allows the player to continue to level sixteen.\nDiablo III.\nThis quest returns as an unmarked, though mandatory, event during &lt;a href=\"The%20Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;The Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt; game event. Accessing the &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Altar\"&gt;Unholy Altar&lt;/a&gt; from floor 15, the player is tasked to activate 2 Books of Lazarus. Upon activating either one, the player is teleported into a room full of monsters and &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Succubi\"&gt;Succubi&lt;/a&gt;. After activating both books and clearing the monsters, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; will appear. On his defeat, a red portal will open in the center of the Diablo effigy leading to floor 16."}

The &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vyr\"&gt;Vyr&lt;/a&gt; claimed that it existed on another plane of reality, and constructed the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Obelisk\"&gt;Black Obelisk&lt;/a&gt; to try and gather its power.. Fearing he would bring doom upon them all, his acolytes murdered him, and the obelisk was destroyed.\nCurrently, the technique is able to be used by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;another Wizard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nArchon transforms the player, replacing all normal skills with Archon abilities. Every enemy killed while in Archon form increases all damage done by 6% for the remaining duration, stacking infinitely, making the Wizard near-invincible in combat with numerous lesser foes. This damage buff is multiplicative to other similar modifiers, but the stacks themselves are added up rather than multiplied.\nAll Archon abilities cost no &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power\"&gt;Arcane Power&lt;/a&gt; to cast. While in this form, the player is also immune to all forms of &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;, existing effects are removed.\nThe ability is very effective against numerous monsters (due to damage buff stacking rapidly) and against Illusionist elite monsters (since destroyed illusions count as kills). &lt;a href=\"Familiar\"&gt;Familiar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weapon\"&gt;Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and Armor spells remain active when Archon is activated, but cannot be renewed until the Archon fades. Because Archon attacks cost no Arcane Power and must be used in a limited amount of time, they benefit greatly from Increased &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchon Abilities.\nAll Archon abilities ignore line of sight, obstacles and &lt;a href=\"Waller\"&gt;Waller&lt;/a&gt; affix barricades, but cannot pierce through solid walls. Unless a rune with different damage type is selected, they use &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; damage type. &lt;a href=\"Vyr%27s%20Amazing%20Arcana\"&gt;Vyr's Amazing Arcana&lt;/a&gt; set picks the damage type that currently has the highest elemental skill damage bonus.\nArcane Strike (Default LMB): melee skill, slams the ground in front of Archon, blasting all enemies within a roughly 10 yards radius circle for 790% damage. Only hits the area in front of the Archon, has no effect on enemies behind the Wizard: the circle is placed so that its outer edge barely touches the Wizard.\nDisintegration Wave (Default RMB): uninterrupted beam that &lt;a href=\"piercing\"&gt;pierces&lt;/a&gt; through enemies in shape of a reversed cone (broad side is large enough to damage enemies directly to the left and right of the Archon) for 779% damage per tick. Killed enemies are disintegrated, &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;leaving no corpse&lt;/a&gt;. The beam is roughly 50-55 yards long (a little bit longer than the graphics show).\nArcane Blast (Default 1): releases an energy blast hitting enemies around the Archon within roughly 20 yards for 604% damage. Has no cooldown (technically, 0.5 seconds). Does NOT interrupt the Disintegration Wave and Arcane Strike, and can be cast while moving.\nDevelopment.\nIn the later days of 1.0, Archon lasted only 15 seconds, but also gained 1 second in the total duration for each enemy that the Wizard killed (or at least had damaged before someone else killed that enemy) while in the Archon form. This, to a certain extent, was like the perma-&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Berserker\"&gt;Wrath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, in that as long as the form was allowed to persist, the Wizard was practically unstoppable, and dealt staggering amounts of damage. It is for this reason that it was rebalanced in 2.0, being given the damage increase per kill.\nIn patch 1.0.3., a bug allowed the Wizard to become permanently invulnerable by combining Archon and &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Teleport (Fracture)&lt;/a&gt; spells. This bug existed for months, and was only fixed when someone reported it on the official forum.\nPrior to patch 2.0.5., all Archon runes were doing &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nPrior to patch 2.1, Archon was the only shapeshifting skill that did \"not\" grant the Crowd Control immunity."}

With Area &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt;, each successful hit made by characters or their &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; (regardless of its &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;Proc Coefficient&lt;/a&gt;) has a 20% chance to deliver additional damage inflicted to all enemies within 10 yards, not including the initial target. The severity of that damage depends on the damage of the base attack (which triggers the Area Damage in the first place), multiplied by Area Damage in percentage. In other words, it is an effective DPS booster against multiple foes, designed to give players more flexibility in terms of attacking more than one enemy at a time, even if they have only single-target attacks.\nAgainst a single target, it gives no additional damage. Probably for this reason, Area Damage is not taken into account for the purpose of sheet DPS.\nIf the attack hits multiple foes, each of them will have a separate 20% chance to trigger Area Damage, damage based on the damage they sustained individually.\nUp to 50% Area Damage can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; Levels, as a choice of Utility tab, 1% per point, being the most damage-oriented stat from that category.\nThe maximum possible Area Damage one can get from random item &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; is 194%. The &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Demon's Hide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; can add another 25%. Together with Paragon points, this is a maximum of 269%. Stacking this above 100% remains fully effective, ironically causing the enemies around the target to receive \"more\" damage than the target itself.\nAttacks boosted by Area Damage do not have any special graphics, and do not even cause numbers to pop up; damage will be inflicted upon the targets without any special animation. However Area Damage uses the sound effect of mortars, making it sound like small bomb explosions. \nThe extra damage from Area Damage uses the same damage type, and will not trigger any special effects, including further Area Damage procs. Area Damage has a Proc Coefficient of zero (0) and may not trigger any other special effects at all.\n&lt;a href=\"Pet\"&gt;Pet&lt;/a&gt;s can trigger Area Damage (Patch 2.3.0, August 2015).\nNote that channeled and &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; calculate Area Damage as per tick, and not per second."}

Suspicious by nature, he was both cunning and brutal. He had a goatee, and a \"cruel scar\" touched the right corner of his mouth, giving him a \"cold leer.\" He was primarily interested in obtaining treasure.\nBiography.\nOnce a sailor in the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Navy\"&gt;Westmarch Navy&lt;/a&gt;, Raithen left the navy to become a (rather successful) pirate lord. He became captain of the \"&lt;a href=\"Barracuda\"&gt;Barracuda&lt;/a&gt;\" after assassinating the previous captain. Raithen soon commanded his own pirate fleet, which he used to raid trade fleets and small settlements, often killing everyone on board. His brutality earned him the nickname \"Scarlet Waters,\" and most of his raids occurred in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, Raithen's identity was unknown to Westmarch, though Captain &lt;a href=\"Tollifer\"&gt;Tollifer&lt;/a&gt; suspected that Raithen might have been the identity behind this \"Scarlet Waters\" pirate.\nc. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;1263&lt;/a&gt;, Raithen was contracted by the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; priest &lt;a href=\"Buyard%20Cholik\"&gt;Buyard Cholik&lt;/a&gt;. They formed an alliance\u2014Cholik provided information to Ransim on which ships were transporting Westmarch's &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Gulf of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ocean\"&gt;Great Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Cholik to easily prey on them. Cholik was given his share of the gold, which he gave to Raithen to purchase slaves for his excavation project at &lt;a href=\"Taruk%27s%20Port\"&gt;Taruk's Port&lt;/a&gt;, which the texts of &lt;a href=\"Dumal%20Lunnash\"&gt;Dumal Lunnash&lt;/a&gt; had led Raithen to. Because of the high mortality rate, there was a constant demand for slaves.\nExactly what Cholik was doing at Taruk's Port was of little interest to him, at least initially, as he was simply interested in the treasure that could be found there. Over time, however, he became more curious as to what Cholik was actually after, while his crew were simply interested in gold. He assigned members of his crew to infiltrate Cholik's circle with each delivery of slaves.\nLater in the year, Raithen kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Lhex\"&gt;Lhex&lt;/a&gt;, nephew of King &lt;a href=\"Cornelius\"&gt;Cornelius&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. While this was by chance, in one of his usual raids to obtain gold from Westmarch vessels, Lhex made a valuable hostage. Five days later, at their base in Taruk's Port, Raithen and Cholik came to blows as their motives clashed, Raithen being primarily interested in treasure, while Cholik's faith and contempt for &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity drove him forward. Cholik manipulated the water around them to seize Raithen, using tendrils of water to strangle him and hold him over the edge of the balcony they were standing on. Raithen realized that he was dealing with no mere priest. Cholik spared him, but warned Raithen not to take up arms against him. Told him that he was a tool, and nothing more.\nRaithen retired to make love to a woman; the wife of a husband he'd killed in his many raids. She tried to kill him, but he killed her in turn, though not without being wounded himself. Afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Pettit\"&gt;one of his crew&lt;/a&gt; told him about a door that Cholik had found in his excavations. He ordered the crew to assemble, while he went to talk with Lhex. He showed the boy the paper that Pettit had given him, wanting to know its meaning. Lhex recognized the writing as being some kind of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic script, and likewise recognized the symbol of &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Kabraxis&lt;/a&gt;. Raithen insisted that demons didn't exist, but putting two and two together, realized that Cholik was hunting some kind of demon in Taruk's Port, real or not. Lhex told him more about Kabraxis, and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Road\"&gt;Black Road&lt;/a&gt;. Listening to Lhex, Raithen concluded that Cholik was interested in achieving the immortality the demon was said to provide. However, the conversation was interrupted as one of Raithen's crew reported that the \"Barracuda\" was under attack. Getting to the deck, Raithen saw his ships had been set aflame.\nWhen Cholik released the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Kabraxis&lt;/a&gt; from his prison, Raithen confronted both the wayward priest and the demon. Though many of his pirate crew were slain or turned by the demon, Raithen defiantly attacked the demon. Though he actually managed to hurt the demon with his fire-enchanted &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, Kabraxis easily destroyed the pirate lord."}

However, his plan to break Uldyssian by abducting his friend and 'beloved', &lt;a href=\"Serenthia\"&gt;Serenthia&lt;/a&gt;, failed utterly as the traders-daughter was actually possessed by the demoness &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;.

If a player wants to increase their item power, one should kill monsters at a higher level than their character. The higher the item power, the higher the armor stats it provides. There is a baseline for how much damage mitigation a player has.\nAs mentioned above, the armor stat mitigates physical damage. However, in \"Diablo IV\", it also mitigates a percentage of non-physical damage.

Sky Terrors)\u00a0are &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; enemies encountered in of\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn-game.\nArmored Destroyers are shock troops only slightly above average in terms of Life pools. They are, however, very quick for their physique, and run swiftly towards the hero, attacking with their bladed arms.\nThe real danger of these monsters is their 'deep striking' ability, which they often use to gain a dynamic entry. Most of the time, Armored Destroyers are found waiting somewhere above. As soon as a player comes close, they descend quickly, indicated by a golden circle moments before the impact (time given seems to depend on their rarity: normal monsters give 2-3 seconds, whereas &lt;a href=\"elites\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt; hardly give a second or two). If they land atop the character, the latter will suffer &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; (being pushed out of the impact area) and heavy &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage. In early versions, this damage could be lethal if attacked by by many Destroyers at once, especially on higher difficulties.\nDue to the Destroyers' threat range, even players who have just used a &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; may be in danger, which is, again, more apparent on higher difficulties. However, the blast radius is small, and Knockback often saves player from multiple hits, so getting away in time will keep character safe.\nUnlike other monsters with the ability to descend upon the battlefield, Armored Destroyers are completely immune to damage 1 second after they land, which is exactly the amount of time they need to recover from the impact. Once descended, they cannot ascend again."}

{"id": "26999", "revid": "2011810", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26999", "title": "Armory", "text": "The Armory is a gameplay feature of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" that allows different character &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s to be saved and loaded quickly.\nDiablo III.\nThe Armory made its debut in \"Diablo III\". It is available for both the PC and &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Evil%20Edition\"&gt;console&lt;/a&gt; versions added in patch 2.5.0. It is located in the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; hub of each act, near the &lt;a href=\"Stash\"&gt;Stash&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Armory allows for the quick updating and switching between up to 10 (per character) saved loadouts or &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s. Loadout data includes items equipped, socketed &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt; \"types\", &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; powers, and &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s selected. When equipping a previously saved set, all items must still be present in the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stash\"&gt;Stash&lt;/a&gt;. Currently equipped items that become unequipped through this process will be placed into the locations their counterparts were located, even if they were in the Stash. Unfortunately, this does not happen for gems, which tend to simply be placed into the inventory as if they had just been looted. Off-hand items do the same if they are being replaced by a two-handed item.\nGems, both normal and &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt;, are included in Armory loadouts. However, only the type is saved, not the specific gem, so loading from the Armory will always use the highest level of that gem type the player has. This does make it possible for one character's use of the Armory to take a (higher level) Legendary Gem from the stash which is part of a second character's Armory loadout(s), even though it was not the Gem that was originally saved in the Armory. If the original Gem has not been placed back into the stash, which the Armory does not do automatically, this could deprive the second character of the Gem until resolved manually from the first character.\nThe ten loadouts saved per character can be named and given an icon for ease of reference. A preview button for each loadout displays the attire, skills, and Cube choices, although legendary gems can be hard to see clearly. If any items previously saved are not available, the preview will show a warning but will \"not show\" the original item. Since this is based on the \"individual\" identity of items, the Armory does not automatically detect replacements or upgrades for the original, such as an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Item\"&gt;Ancient Item&lt;/a&gt; to replace a lesser &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Item\"&gt;Legendary Item&lt;/a&gt; of the same variety (which will itself not be visible in the preview if it has already been &lt;a href=\"salvage\"&gt;salvage&lt;/a&gt;d).\n&lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; points, and the items and skills of &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt;, are not saved by the Armory.\nDiablo Immortal.\nThe Armory features in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". Players can save up to 10 &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; loadouts. It remembers &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; choices, as well as gear, skills and &lt;a href=\"Familiar%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;familiars&lt;/a&gt;. There is no cooldown for choosing builds. The UI includes checkboxes allowing players to toggle whether specific equipment is saved to a loadout or only the Legendary Essence and Gems, whether to save &lt;a href=\"Reforge\"&gt;Reforge&lt;/a&gt; layouts, and to save &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; points.\nHistory.\nThe update added the ability to save reforge layouts.\nSaving familiars was added in the update.\nUpon the introduction of the reworked &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; trees in the &lt;a href=\"Unending%20Storm\"&gt;Unending Storm&lt;/a&gt; update, the \"currently selected Paragon tree\" no longer made sense, so the Armory was left with an option to either not save any Paragon skills, or save both the skills and the points assigned, which meant players had to re-assign and re-save every loadout as they gained Paragon points. This was resolved in the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shattered Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; update, by making the useless option save the skills and not the points. The same update added a view that lists the names of the items and essences in a loadout.\nDiablo IV.\n\"Diablo IV\" did not launch with an Armory feature. Because \"respeccing\" - reallocating &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; points - costs &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; in the game, some of the details of how an Armory feature would work are unclear. Nonetheless, game staff have stated they are considering the concept. It is intended that the feature be implemented at a later date."}

He butchered entire villagers, and those he slew were possessed and transformed into demonic soldiers. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would later speculate that while Baal could have approached Arreat by stealth, every act of mayhem he and his minions committed boosted his &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; fragment's power. Thus, Baal intended to wreck havoc along his journey so that when he reached the Worldstone, the shard would be pulsing with untold corruptive energies.\nAssault on Mount Arreat.\nWhatever Baal's motives, his army came into contact with the tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. As hard as the Barbarians fought however, they could not stop Baal's advance, nor prevent the sacking of their capital of &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;. The Army notably fought against the Barbarians at &lt;a href=\"Daken-Shar\"&gt;Daken-Shar&lt;/a&gt;, where they wiped out the mortal army, leaving only &lt;a href=\"Renit\"&gt;one survivor&lt;/a&gt;. Elements of the Army also fought against the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, all that stood between Baal and Arreat was &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;, a fortress nestled in the mountain's foothills. To stave off Baal's advance, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt; cast an ancient warding spell, creating a protective barrier around the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;. This prevented any demon, including Baal, from entering Harrogath. However, the army was still able to encircle it. They were also able to seize and control the watchtowers and barricades on the slopes of Arreat. In the early days of the siege, &lt;a href=\"Qual-Kehk\"&gt;Qual-Kehk&lt;/a&gt; attempted to break Baal's siege lines. He failed, and lost a third of his &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s in the process. Others were wounded, others were captured. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Shenk%20the%20Overseer\"&gt;Shenk the Overseer&lt;/a&gt;, Baal's legions dominated the battlefield, and were able to bombard the defenders with their catapults. While the Barbarians had to ration food and water, Baal's demons feasted on the flesh and blood of their dead foes.\nRemnants.\nDespite Baal's defeat, and the destruction of Mount Arreat, remnants of the army remained in the snowy wastelands of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. Only the Barbarian tribes could keep the army at bay, but they were scattered and isolated. If they did not unite, they would surely die divided.\nIn-game.\nThe Army of Destruction features in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", and in the Frozen Tundra zone in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". The army's assault on Sescheron is briefly seen in a flashback in \"&lt;a href=\"Destruction%27s%20End\"&gt;Destruction's End&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The army was practically without limit, as more demons poured out of Hell with every passing hour.\nThe Army of Sin nearly conquered the \"impregnable\" fortress, having slaughtered hundreds of defenders until &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; allies arrived to drive them back after they were tipped off by &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; via vision through the Black Soulstone. With the arrival of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, the tide began to turn against the army. When they allowed the keep's catapults to be raised, the war machines caused Azmodan's lines to fall into disarray almost immediately.\nThe army was repelled from the keep, but its war machines continued to bombard it. However, even then, The Nephalem was able to fight their way through, destroying them. However, Azmodan could count on a steady supply of demons to reinforce his army, prompting The Nephalem to descend into the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt; to bring the fight to him directly. By this point, Azmodan had dragged up &lt;a href=\"Sin%20Heart\"&gt;Sin Heart&lt;/a&gt;s from his &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Sin\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;, in order to empower his legions. The Nephalem destroyed the Hearts, slew &lt;a href=\"Cydaea\"&gt;Cydaea&lt;/a&gt;, and finally, Azmodan himself.\nBy the end of the siege, the bodies of Azmodan's legions littered the battlefield, and their corpses lay smouldering in the crater.

Despising the brutal tactics employed by these groups, she eventually forged the Iron Wolves, a group that would hold honor and duty above all else.\nMephisto's Jungle.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, Asheara and her mercenaries were at &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, which was being overtaken by the surrounding jungle. The Iron Wolves spent months hunting down &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, but no matter how many they killed, they just kept coming. An &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Natalya\"&gt;Natalya&lt;/a&gt; was also present, but when Asheara tried to recruit her into the Iron Wolves, Natalya began lecturing her about the \"dangers of magic.\" Another resident of Kurast, Alkor, commented that she purchased a \"&lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; of manliness\" from him every week.\nShe encountered a &lt;a href=\"classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; who were pursuing the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. She let them hire some of her mercenaries to aid them. She was suspicious of the heroes at first, suspecting that they might be &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; spies, but came to trust them over time. She was satisfied with the carnage the heroes wrought against the Zakarum thralls, and upon their defeat of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, named them honorary Iron Wolves.\nThe Child Emperor.\nKurast fell, despite the efforts of the Iron Wolves. Later, Asheara and her mercenaries retrieved a young boy to be the new ruler of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, as per the wishes of Zakarum. The boy, named &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt;, became the new emperor. Asheara personally brought him to &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, the Iron Wolves became his personal guard.\nThe Scouring of Caldeum.\nOver &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;twenty years&lt;/a&gt; after the fall of Kurast, Ashaera was in Caldeum, still leading the Iron Wolves as they served the people of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. A few months before the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;, refugees began arriving at Caldeum; fleeing from the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; and their summoned &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s wrecked havoc. The Iron Wolves were sent out in the desert to fight them, while the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; was created to \u201cprotect\u201d the citizens from the refugees. Eventually, the Imperial Guard supplanted the Iron Wolves' former role.\nAfter the coming of the Star, the situation was even more desperate. Within Caldeum, Asheara encountered &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, who was in search of the Coven's leader, &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;. She informed them that Maghda was headed for &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt;, and while she'd blocked the road behind her, there was another path through the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on, she managed to grant the Nephalem an audience with Hakan. When the emperor ordered The Nephalem and &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; executed for the \"massacre\" of &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt;, Asheara covered their escape into the city's &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20of%20Caldeum\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt;. Later, when The Nephalem returned to Caldeum, Belial rained fire down upon the city. Meeting with the heroes, Asheara explained that the Iron Wolves were doing what they could to evacuate the populace. The Nephalem aided them in evacuating the people into the sewers.\nAfter Belial's defeat, &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%20Eamon\"&gt;Haedrig Eamon&lt;/a&gt; stated that he was unconcerned about the city's future, since it had Asheara to keep the peace.\nReign of Enmity.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, as Kehjistan fell to demonic invasion, Hakan II ordered the gates of Caldeum sealed; that it would weather the plague besetting the empire. After the gates were sealed, Asheara led her Iron Wolves out of the city knowing full well they would never return. Instead they roamed Kehjistan, pledging their blades to any who were in need.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nAshaeara appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". She will offer the heroes the services of the Iron Wolves for a premium, since they are needed at the docks.\u00a0\nShe is not just their employer, but the leader of their clan. She does not dress the part, preferring a leather bikini, but with leadership comes some perks.\nAfter completing the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Old%20Religion%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Blade of the Old Religion&lt;/a&gt; quest, Asheara will inform the heroes that several mercenaries have volunteered to aid them free of charge, since Ormus's use of the Gidbinn has freed up their time and they are eager for action.\nDiablo III.\nAshaeara returns as an NPC in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". She wears a more ostentatious and (slightly) less revealing outfit in keeping with the other Iron Wolves and the overall opulence of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. Asheara does not appear to have aged since the events in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; and oddly, speaks with a completely different accent. Her signature snake is also gone. In combat, she wields a sword, but strangely, does not use spells.\nShe is the namesake for the \"Diablo III\" &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;item sets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Asheara%27s%20Uniform\"&gt;Asheara's Uniform&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Asheara%27s%20Vestments\"&gt;Asheara's Vestments&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo IV.\nAsheara is referenced in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" in the flavor text of &lt;a href=\"Asheara%27s%20Khanjar\"&gt;Asheara's Khanjar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nAsheara shares an unspoken bond with her mercenaries, always fighting on the frontlines with them, and getting into tavern brawls with them as well. She vows that no harm will come to anyone who is safeguarded by the Iron Wolves. \nWhile friendly, Asheara is strict and tough, but even-handed with those under her command, and has a strong moral code, holding the Iron Wolves above the more brutal methods used by other mercenary companies. She is always looking for ways to pay off her expenses. She is both self-conscious and proud of her womanhood. She is considered to have a \"fine form\", and at least one hero regarded Asheara as \"the most beautiful woman [they] had seen on this &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;new continent&lt;/a&gt;\" as her attire in Kurast consisted of a leather bikini. She speaks in a blunt tone, but is unable to hide the genuine concern she has for those under her protection. During this time, she carried a &lt;a href=\"Misty\"&gt;serpent&lt;/a&gt; with her, draped around her shoulders.\nShe is intrigued by the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;s, noting that their skills seem to be a mix of both martial and &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al prowess. She has a dim view on &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, considering it to be a \"false religion.\" In comparison, she is more favorable towards &lt;a href=\"Skatsim\"&gt;Skatsim&lt;/a&gt;."}

When &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; betrayed Inarius's followers, Lycander fled back to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, but maintained contact with Philios through a device called the &lt;a href=\"Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;. In time however, Lycander's fellow angels discovered that she was communicating with someone outside Heaven, though they did not know who. Lycander ended the romance and insisted that Philios hide the Eye so that Heaven would not learn of Sanctuary's existence. A grieving Philios obliged, and hid the Eye on Skovos.\nPhilios wandered the world, and in time, met the mortal woman &lt;a href=\"Askarra\"&gt;Askarra&lt;/a&gt;. The two fell in love, and Askarra gave birth to twin girls. The girls grew, and upon hearing tales of the Sightless Eye, vowed to recover it. Finding the Eye on Skovos, they discovered that while they could not use it to communicate with Heaven, they could use it to see the future. So it was that their culture grew with the Sightless Eye at the heart of their society. From the more stalwart sister, the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Caste\"&gt;Amazon Caste&lt;/a&gt; descended, while from the more ethereal one would come the &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Caste\"&gt;Oracle Caste&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater Events.\nThe Askari once found their city of &lt;a href=\"Tran%20Athulua\"&gt;Tran Athulua&lt;/a&gt; under siege by pirates.\nAt some point, during an incident of sectarian conflict a number of renegade Askari women made off with the Sightless Eye, establishing their own &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;sisterhood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Askari society experienced the \"Time of Troubles.\"\nAskari oracles predicted the events of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt; thousands of years before it occurred; their predictions also included the fact that the three Prime Evils would rise again. Thus, the warriors of the Amazon Caste trained for millennia. This came to pass when an Amazon warrior named &lt;a href=\"Cassia\"&gt;Cassia&lt;/a&gt; took part in the battle against the Prime Evils in the 13th century, allying with a number of other heroes and the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; scholar, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. However, their predictions did not end there, and they believed that the demonic hordes would rise again. Thus, Cassia returned to her homeland to train an army.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; sent a delegation of Horadrim to Skovos, bearing a powerful gift for the Askari. None of the Horadrim returned, and were never heard from since. \nAt some point after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; retrieved a relic from &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, an arrow called the Breath of Philios. After an argument, Lorath convinced a ship captain to sail to Skovos' capital in exchange for an \"absurd\" amount of gold. Lorath hoped the gift would satisfy the Askari and he would be able to get information on the missing Horadrim. While they were sailing along the coast of Skovos, they were ambushed by several Askari ships and forced aground. The Askari did not respond well when Lorath announced he was Horadrim, and he never got the chance to offer the gift nor ask about the delegation as the Askari ordered them to leave their waters.\nCulture.\nGovernment and Society.\nThe Askari operate under a matriarchal government. Men are responsible for any number of positions in the community, government, and clergy, as well as merchant and agricultural occupations. However, their voices carry less weight in Askari affairs, and males are prohibited from holding the highest offices. In truth, political power is shared between two castes\u2014the warrior amazons, and the mystic oracles. Each caste is represented by a queen, and thus, both queens rule the Skovos Isles in tandem. There is evidence that princesses exist in the Askari monarchy.\nAskari hold their architecture as a source of pride. Having had millennia to adapt to their tropical home, their cities are an architectural phenomenon. They hold the destruction of the Prime Evils as their destiny, ushering in a new era when mortal men and women can at long last take their rightful place in the universe, no longer merely playthings for the beings of the &lt;a href=\"Outer%20Realms\"&gt;Outer Realms&lt;/a&gt;.\nA saying exists in Askari society that a gray head is a crown of glory. It is common for male Askari to remove head and facial hair, given the warmth of their homeland.\nExternal Relations.\nIn regards to the wider world of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, the Askari are a relatively isolated culture. That being said, as a seafaring culture, the Askari were one of the first civilizations to make contact with both the kingdoms of the West, and &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; of the East. Their prominence in the world's trade establishment has afforded their warriors the reputation they currently enjoy as cunning strategists and skilled combatants. They are much sought after as mercenaries, being both expert soldiers as well as extremely loyal, as long as the assignment does not conflict with their strict sense of ethics. At times though, nomadic bands of Amazon warriors roaming the &lt;a href=\"South%20Sea\"&gt;South Sea&lt;/a&gt; come into hostile contact with other peoples. The Askari maintain vast merchant fleets that sail to the far corners of the world.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; traces its ancestry to a dissident group of Askari warriors that fled their homeland and settled in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;.\nMartial Prowess.\nIn Askari culture, originally, only women served as warriors, as their lithe bodies and superior dexterity were better suited than men for the dense jungles of their homeland. An exception to this existed by the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ravens\"&gt;Death Ravens&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed/was composed of men in its ranks.\n&lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; warriors are known for their deftness, superior hand-to-eye coordination, and the ferocity of their attacks. In the jungles of their homeland, Amazons are adept at the tactics of misdirection, and can even draw on the jungle to support themselves. The jungle itself can be a hindrance though, and early in training, Amazon warriors are taught how to overcome these conditions. Indeed, all Askari are taught how to hunt and fight during the night of the jungles.\nIntense training and stern discipline make Amazon warriors formiddable foes. Their agility and combination of magical and martial prowess make them flexible and adept opponents in battle. Specific training is carried out to help Amazon warriors avoid potentially devastating blows. Through strict martial discipline and focus, an Amazon warrior can attune herself to her environment and the dangers around her, allowing her to react to these hazards with superhuman agility. One aspect of this ability is her knack for avoiding missile fire.\nOn the martial side, Amazon warriors are highly regarded with their skill with the &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, their ability rivaled only by the Sisters of the Sightless Eye. Unlike the Sisterhood though, Amazons are also adept in the use of the &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; and other such weapons. In regards to magic, Amazons can wield &lt;a href=\"prime%20magic\"&gt;prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"holy%20magic\"&gt;holy magic&lt;/a&gt;. \nSome Amazons take upon the path of the healer, a worthy path due to the toxicity of many native plant species in their homeland. They may also be blessed by their deities should they prove worthy. \nCenturions are (or were) employed by the Askari.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Philios%20Games\"&gt;Philios Games&lt;/a&gt; were once held in Askari society.\nReligion.\nAskari religion is polytheistic. The core of their mythology revolves around Philios and Lycander, but otherwise, their pantheon of gods consists of a well-defined hierarchy of two prime deities and numerous lesser ones, each member upholding some segment of the balance of Order. It is this strong sense of order that drives the Amazon people to achieve greatness in even the smallest of their endeavors. The Amazons believe this pantheon is the remnant of the original inhabitants that settled the islands centuries ago. According to ancient records, they share the same names as these gods, although aspects of their personalities seem to have evolved over the centuries. Known deities include: \nOther figures of note include &lt;a href=\"Palashia\"&gt;Palashia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Celestia\"&gt;Celestia&lt;/a&gt;, though these individuals are not deities. It is also worth noting that the Askari appear to have a concept of the afterlife."}

It is impossible (or at least exceedingly difficult) to pass through this fire without his consent.\nThe demon makes a deal with &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; to grant her passage through the barrier, after she frees him from his &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; and gives him a host. Due to his control of hellfire, and desire to use it as his main source of attacking and torturing mortals he is called \"The Charred Duke\".\nAstaroth, like most demons, is sadistic. He relishes in &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; suffering and loves watching innocents burn. He rides a multi-headed &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Amalgam%20of%20Rage\"&gt;Amalgam of Rage&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAstaroth's reign of terror in Scosglen was known as &lt;a href=\"Days%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Days of Ash&lt;/a&gt;, until he was defeated by a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s; the scorched land where he fell became known as \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Scar\"&gt;the Scar&lt;/a&gt;\", his fires still burning underneath the stone. Amongst the surviving victors were the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Donan\"&gt;Donan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Airidah\"&gt;Airidah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nafain\"&gt;Nafain&lt;/a&gt;, who became revered as fabled heroes in the region. However, unbeknownst to most, Astaroth wasn't slain, but instead was sealed in a &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; by Donan, who retreated to &lt;a href=\"Laglend%20Fern\"&gt;the edge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvered%20Edgelands\"&gt;the wilderness&lt;/a&gt; near Kyovashad, where they sealed it within an underground cave., and built &lt;a href=\"Eldhaime%20Keep\"&gt;Eldhaime Keep&lt;/a&gt; above its hiding place.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;Years later&lt;/a&gt;, Lilith, seeking safe passage into &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, sought the soulstone by visiting the heroes who defeated Astaroth. Once the stone was in her hands, she bargained with Astaroth for his freedom. As a bonus, she used &lt;a href=\"Yorin\"&gt;Yorin&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Donan, as his host, shoving the soulstone on the young man's forehead.\nYorin was strong, having been trained by his father to resist possession, as well his belief steeling his resolve. In order to give Astaroth the motivation to fight harder and fully take control over the young man, Lilith took Yorin to the capital of Scosglen, &lt;a href=\"Cerrigar\"&gt;Cerrigar&lt;/a&gt;, and began slaughtering its residents, allowing the pain and suffering of the victims to fuel Astaroth's power to consume Yorin in order to partake in the carnage.\nDonan, knowing Astaroth's behavior, predicted Lilith's destination. When he arrived with at Cerrigar, it was too late. Lilith awaited them atop a ruined tower. When he asked about the fate of his son, Lilith called Astaroth forward. Donan recognized Astaroth, and the remnants of armor he was wearing as that of his son. As he cried in grief, Astaroth taunted him, saying that his son cried for him. Astaroth was later killed by the Wanderer, and his soulstone was removed.\nA Pact Completed.\nDuring the march on Hell towards the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cathedral of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;, Astaroth met Lilith and commented on her wound, which was inflicted in her confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. Lilith told him to let her pass, and Astaroth complied, commenting that we \"all return home sooner or later\" before disappearing and allowing Lilith to traverse the hellfire barrier protecting the Cathedral of Hatred.\nIn-game.\nAstaroth is featured as a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".

He can also summon hellfire &lt;a href=\"meteor\"&gt;meteor&lt;/a&gt;s, and to channel his flames through his mount to make it &lt;a href=\"Inferno%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;breath fire&lt;/a&gt; in different formations (straight, sweeping and diverging).

{"id": "3399", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3399", "title": "Cold", "text": "Cold is one of the types of &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt;. It is unique in that it not only damages targets, but it also often &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt;s enemies. The effect is visible by a blue hue, and is commonly known as &lt;a href=\"Chill\"&gt;Chill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Frozen\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt; effect is a more powerful consequence, often added to Cold skills. Usually Cold is associated with colors blue or white.\nCharacteristics.\nCold damage is taken rather seriously by players because of its versatility. Cold is not known for its damage range or amount but more for its effects of slowing, freezing and &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;shattering&lt;/a&gt; opponents.\nThe amount of the cold damage can be decreased by building up &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Resistance\"&gt;Cold Resistance&lt;/a&gt; (either from items or from a &lt;a href=\"Thawing%20Potion\"&gt;Thawing Potion&lt;/a&gt;).\nCold damage is especially useful for &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; in both single-player and multiplayer experiences. If a monster takes Cold damage, it might become totally &lt;a href=\"frozen\"&gt;frozen&lt;/a&gt; and stay still for some time. &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, cannot be frozen. They can only be &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt;ed, reducing their &lt;a href=\"movement\"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;. If you take Cold damage from a monster or from &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, you will just slow down.\nIf a monster dies as a result of taking Cold damage, it will sometimes shatter into pieces, leaving no corpse. This is especially useful when fighting against groups that can resurrect slain comrades like the &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;their Shaman&lt;/a&gt;. The shattered bodies simply fall apart into ice shards, which quickly melt into the ground and leave no &lt;a href=\"corpses\"&gt;corpses&lt;/a&gt;, which could be revived by the Shaman.\nCold damage is used by the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; classes. Out of these, the Sorceress has the greatest repertoire of &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Spells\"&gt;Cold Spells&lt;/a&gt; in a single skill tree than all the other classes combined. This makes her an ideal candidate for a crowd controlling member in parties.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", Cold damage is used by the classes, using &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; skill modifications. Only &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; has skills that deal cold damage in their base forms. Enemies suffering cold damage are chilled, and have a chance to freeze if they receive a critical hit. Chilled enemies shatter to ice blocks if killed while still under the effect. Some cold attacks temporarily leave a patch of ground frosted over, which damages any enemy that stands on it.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Cold damage is used by all classes except &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s, often chilling or freezing its target. &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0from Cold skills freeze the slain target solid, making it shatter afterwards. Note that \"any\" Cold damage hit has a chance (lower than the &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;Proc Coefficient&lt;/a&gt;, though) to Chill enemy on hit.\n,\u00a0, &lt;a href=\"Utar%27s%20Roar\"&gt;Utar's Roar&lt;/a&gt;, , , &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Bone%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Bone King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Flurry\"&gt;Winter Flurry&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Etrayu\"&gt;Etrayu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gesture%20of%20Orpheus\"&gt;Gesture of Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0, &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Land%20Waders\"&gt;Swamp Land Waders&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Point%20Shot\"&gt;Holy Point Shot&lt;/a&gt; are the items with unconventional bonus to Cold skills damage. &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20of%20Aranoch\"&gt;Talisman of Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; amulet will render the character completely immune to Cold damage (the attacks will actually \"heal\" &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;).\nNotable users.\nCold has many effects, but the most annoying one is their slowing effect. This is especially true in the case of &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Enchanted\"&gt;Cold Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; monsters. They have been known to slow the pace of the game forcing players to lose precious time in their games.\nCold is used by the Lord of Pain, &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"aura\"&gt;aura&lt;/a&gt; that slows down the player character to a grinding halt, often killing the player before &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Chamber&lt;/a&gt; is even loaded.\nThe Lord of Terror himself, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, uses Cold damage in his slowing &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Touch\"&gt;Cold Touch&lt;/a&gt; attack. He raises his right hand in the air like the initiation of the deadly &lt;a href=\"Red%20Lightning%20Hose\"&gt;Red Lightning Hose&lt;/a&gt;, but his palm glows an eerie blue before he strikes down on the player with all his force. Most players avoid this due to the initiation action making players run before being struck by a possible red death.\nThe Lord of Destruction, &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, also uses Cold in a more noteworthy style in his &lt;a href=\"Hoarfrost\"&gt;Hoarfrost&lt;/a&gt; attack. A crushing triangular wave of cold is launched towards the player, causing heavy damage, slowing and a severe &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;. A very deadly attack that can be seldom avoided at range.\n&lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; has a great affinity with Cold, causing the chill of Hell to sap the life from his victims.\n&lt;a href=\"Phangwrth%2C%20Warmth-Feaster\"&gt;Phangwrth, Warmth-Feaster&lt;/a&gt; has a great affinity for cold. He surrounds himself with a freezing field that moves with him, and inflicts hypothermia; a unique status effect that deals large &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt;, except the player gets warmth at a camp fire.\n&lt;a href=\"Vitaath%20the%20Shivering%20Death\"&gt;Vitaath the Shivering Death&lt;/a&gt; also causes cold damage, though seldomly. She summons icicles to rain from above, or call down giant ice crystals like hail. She can also shoot icicles in a spiraling nova, or immobilize players by directly freezing them.\n&lt;a href=\"Sargoth\"&gt;Sargoth&lt;/a&gt; favours cold spells when fighting. He can summon ice crystals that deal AOE cold damage for some time before exploding.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Colossus\"&gt;Glacial Colossus&lt;/a&gt; uses Cold extensively, channeling four beams of frost around itself that quickly freezes the player and deals moderate cold damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;) often attack with Cold, likely symbolizing the chill of the grave fueling their attacks. Same applies to Undead-based abilities (like &lt;a href=\"Haunt\"&gt;Haunt&lt;/a&gt;)."}

Powerful storms rage around the islands, the storms themselves having birthed many strange and dangerous creatures, such as the &lt;a href=\"Stormlost\"&gt;Stormlost&lt;/a&gt;. Savaged by torrential rain, incredible winds, deadly beasts, and a toxic, ever-present mist, it is only by the tireless protection of the &lt;a href=\"Unmoored\"&gt;Unmoored&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tempest\"&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt;s that the nation survives.\nThe storms that beset the isles have consumed settlements and islands each year. Islanders who brave the storm storm wear clothing with patagia that brace the wind, and taut cowls that seal to protect their eyes and face. This protects them from being soaked or windburned.\nCulture.\nCold Isles are ruled by sages, councilors and the Unmoored. Each refuge isle is led by one or more sages. They live in a constant state of voyaging, moving back and forth between Pelghain and their home isles to ensure they are schooled in the empire's history and trusted by those they represent. Few accomplish both. Sages in turn answer to a council based in pelghain. The council acts on the pronouncements of the Unmoored. \nThe architecture of the Cold Isles was inspired by that of &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt; and other northern cultures.\nThe people of the Cold Isles tell many stories. Those of faith, love, and honorable &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are few in comparison to the tales of terror, of floods and crushing sea ice. Few tales terrify the children of Pelghain more than the myth of &lt;a href=\"Xekorendaag\"&gt;Xekorendaag&lt;/a&gt;. The legend says &lt;a href=\"Mehrwen\"&gt;Mehrwen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ksathra\"&gt;Ksathra&lt;/a&gt;'s fury cursed the isles so long as their descendants remained on Pelghain. When the people began to brave the deluges and hurricanes, arrogantly building tall cities and monuments, a great serpent drove into their settlements, consuming families and carving the isles apart as it did. Reproached, the people moved their settlements away from the capital, and the serpent faded to memory. The myth ends with a warning of Xekorendaag's return, reminding the people that they must protect their land and keep their settlements humble or again face the freezing of the seas and the devouring of their children.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s have been living on the for thousands of years as part of the empire of &lt;a href=\"Pelghain\"&gt;Pelghain&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenturies ago, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aeyntragga\"&gt;Aeyntragga&lt;/a&gt; roosted upon &lt;a href=\"the%20Spiral\"&gt;the Spiral&lt;/a&gt; and stalked the outskirts of the Cold Isles.\nPelghain was ruined by violence between its sister priest-empresses. The battle roiled sea and sky, drowned their mainland cities, and left only their island capital standing, beset by permanent deluges and hurricanes, and surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Maarozhi\"&gt;Maarozhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s of the deep. The battle roiled sea and sky, drowned their mainland cities, and left only their island capital standing.\nPost-Collapse.\nThe aftermath of Pelghain's civil war left the Cold Isles beset by permanent deluges and hurricanes, and surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Maarozhi\"&gt;Maarozhi&lt;/a&gt;. The once-proud people clung to the vestiges of their empire, relying on their &lt;a href=\"Tempest\"&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt;s to endure the weather and enemies that haunt them. Other than imperial ruins, the largest relics of Pelghain\u2019s rule are the mists of &lt;a href=\"the%20Spiral\"&gt;the Spiral&lt;/a&gt;, a winding network of snowy fjords. The people of the Isles believe these mists are the dying breath of their empress &lt;a href=\"Mehrwen\"&gt;Mehrwen&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the centuries, the people of the Cold Isles have been fighting a losing battle. Storms continue to batter the Isles, and more Tempests are required to curb them each year. With every beasts the Tempests slay, two more lurk below. However, the rulers of the Cold Isles were unwilling to abandon the islands, even as they continued to dwell in ruins. Over time, a number of Tempests abandoned their homeland, believing they were only delaying the inevitable, and those who did so were deemed pariahs, in an effort to prevent others from leaving.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Unmoored\"&gt;Unmoored&lt;/a&gt; increasingly occupied with the ever-roiling storms, Aeyntragga was able to venture further inland from the Spiral.\nIn-game.\nThe Cold Isles are explored in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", introduced in the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Crucible of Justice&lt;/a&gt; update."}

Enemies that are not Cold Immune can have their Cold Resistances lowered below zero, making a Sorceress' Cold Spells especially effective, but the only ways to break resistances are the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; aura.\nCold Mastery is a direct subtraction modifier from the enemies' resistance, so if a target has 75% Cold Resistance and the Sorceress has only the first level of Cold Mastery, the target's resistance will be 75% - 20% = 55%. Cold Mastery reduces cold resistances to -100% by level 17. As resistances cannot fall below -100%, extra points after level 17 only reduce resistances for monsters that had resistances to Cold in the first place. Extra points in Cold Mastery become completely pointless past level 37 (to the point where even creatures with near-immunity to cold has -100% cold resistance), although the lack of monsters with such high cold resistances make investing in the skill relatively superfluous after level 27 (where cold resists are at -150%).\nLightning and Fire sorceress who specialize in cold skills only secondarily will often find their cold skills being their most potent upon reaching the highly-resistant creatures in Hell difficulty, due in no small part to Cold Mastery.\nPatch Notes.\nPrior to patch 2.6, Cold Mastery paired very well with the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Rupture\"&gt;Cold Rupture&lt;/a&gt; sundering charm, as it did not suffer from the 1/5th resistance reduction penalty that the other resistance reducing skills, &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt;, had. A sorceress with a high level Cold Mastery and Cold Rupture could easily bring any monster's resistances into the negatives on Hell difficulty. The 1/5th resistance reduction penalty applies as of the current patch."}

Note that increased damage only applies against the current Commanded target.\nVisually, skeletons glow brighter while Commanded, the target will have a runic circle beneath it, and the icon on the UI will glow with a golden outline. The skeletons will also rush to their target when Commanded, effectively &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ing up to 60 yards to reach their mark.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally, this spell included several &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Mage\"&gt;Skeletal Mage&lt;/a&gt;s in addition to normal Skeletons.

The team wanted to relieve players from the burden of having to raise the skeletons themselves, but having them all at once made it not seem fun to use as a skill. This led to the current design: the skeletons summoned slowly over time which feels like they are being raised from bodies, but no actual need for corpses to do it."}

Kenton was able to rally the guards and make a &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint%20Battlement\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Lift\"&gt;prison lift&lt;/a&gt;; both to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Transformed%20%28monster%29\"&gt;transformed prisoners&lt;/a&gt; from getting out, and the cultists from reaching the prison. The battlement was under constant assault from the cultists.\nSometime later, &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; convinced him to unseal the prison and let them in. As a precaution, Kenton assigned a steady rotation of guards to stand watch in the outskirts of the prison.\nAll Wolves Starve.\nAt a point, there was no news from the guards stationed in the prison. The keep was short-handed, as guards were still needed to man the walls. Fortunately, Kenton saw the Shard-seeker passing by. He asked them to check on the prison guards, reminding them of the favor they owed him for letting them into the prison. The Shard-seeker descended, and discovered that &lt;a href=\"Transformed%20%28monster%29\"&gt;Transformed&lt;/a&gt; had attacked the guards, killing them before they could light a signal fire. The Shard-seeker lit the beacon themselves, and Kenton and his fellow guards arrived, aiding the Shard-seeker in killing the Transformed. Kenton declared that by the next sunrise, a full squad would be stationed in the prison, despite leaving the walls further unmanned.\nIn-game.\nCommander Kenton is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

Berserk's additional magic damage is also helpful against Physical &lt;a href=\"immune\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; monsters after about ten points due to the amount of magic damage done without having to switch to Berserk (which has the disadvantage of reducing the user's defense).

Thus, once they strike each other, a big cascade effect can occur where a whole group of these is almost instantly destroyed. Beware of the charged bolt storm that emanates from such as event, as this can be very damaging to you and your minions. \nIn the endgame, usefulness of this skill declines, as monsters do not do enough damage to each other, and other players (especially melee fighters) are not guaranteed to be safe in chaos.\nItems.\nSeveral items grant Confuse skill:\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 13"}

This makes Confusion a less potent effect than Charm, but in return, Confusion effects last much longer and / or affect multiple foes.\nCC resistance reduces the duration of Confusion.

This makes conviction a very useful skill for both groups, and for Paladins utilizing &lt;a href=\"Vengeance\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; or .\nConviction is one of only four skills (the other three being the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt;) in the game capable of breaking an &lt;a href=\"immunity\"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt;, which means lowering a monster below 100% resist. In &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Difficulty\"&gt;Hell Difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, where almost every monster possesses an immunity, this is an incredibly powerful trait. All other resistance reduction abilities cannot affect a monster whose resistance is 100% or greater.\ufeff When breaking an immunity, this aura will only function at 1/5 effectiveness, though. Enemy resistances cannot fall below -100%. Max reduced resistance is -150% received from 25 level conviction aura (which can help reduce normally-resistant monsters to negative numbers but doesn't impact already vulnerable monsters more than -100%); subsequent points in this aura only serve to continue reducing defense. The radius of this aura is fixed at 13.3 yards regardless of skill level.\nConviction stacks with the effects of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt; (when breaking immunities, the 1/5th effectiveness rule still applies). Even with the two working together, many monsters in Hell mode are still immune to some elements.\nWhen two Conviction auras from opposing sides clash against each other, the higher level aura will \"out-Convict\" the weaker level aura, disabling the latter altogether. This is particularly important when fighting &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Mephisto\"&gt;\u00dcber Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, who projects his own, 20-leveled Conviction aura. Two identically leveled Conviction Auras do not cancel out each other; instead, both function as they otherwise would normally.\nThe rune word grants a level 12 Conviction when equipped (regardless of class). This rune word works on &lt;a href=\"polearms\"&gt;polearms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; (D2R), which a &lt;a href=\"desert%20mercenary\"&gt;desert mercenary&lt;/a&gt; can equip. Nearly every elemental attacker can benefit from having a mercenary with this rune word equipped; although a level 12 Conviction won't break all immunities, it certainly breaks most encountered even in Hell difficulties.\nMonsters with Elemental attacks and &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Enchanted\"&gt;Aura Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; affix rolling Conviction are generally very dangerous opponents. An &lt;a href=\"Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gloam\"&gt;Gloam&lt;/a&gt; with Conviction, for example, is extremely potent. "}

{"id": "26338", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26338", "title": "Cooldown", "text": "Cooldown is a property of some powers in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" and subsequent games, primarily character &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s, which prevents it from being activated again until a set time has passed. The concept was first introduced as &lt;a href=\"Casting%20Delay\"&gt;Casting Delay&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", but that system did not interact with any other game mechanics. Certain item powers and &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Skill\"&gt;Monster Skill&lt;/a&gt;s also have cooldowns.\nCooldown Reduction (CDR) is a percentage-based character stat which reduces the length of skill cooldowns, available from many sources. It is an important stat for some &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing more frequent or even continuous use of some skills.\nSkills.\nActive skills with cooldowns start a timer when used (a few instead start the timer after their effects end), as do &lt;a href=\"charge\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt;-based skills that are not already recharging. Until the timer expires, attempting to re-use a cooldown skill simply does nothing; the same is true for skills with no charges remaining. The skill is said to be \"on cooldown\" during this time. For charge-based skills (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Dashing%20Strike\"&gt;Dashing Strike&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt;), when the timer expires for one recharge period, a charge is restored, and the next recharge period begins immediately if the maximum has not been reached. Recharging benefits fully from Cooldown Reduction.\nCooldown time is visually indicated by a pie chart / clock-style shaded area on the skill icon in the action bar. When a skill is used, the icon becomes fully gray, indicating the cooldown has just begun. Then an increasingly large angle becomes uncovered as time passes, progressing clockwise. The shading turns from gray to orange as the cooldown approaches completion. When it finishes or is reset, the button briefly flashes to indicate the skill is ready for use again. Longer cooldowns move slowly through the 360 degree rotation, while short ones move quickly.\nCooldown skills range from short-cooldown utilities to attacks with a massive impact on the battlefield that may serve as centerpieces or \"finishing moves\" to a fight. Some have cooldowns of just a few seconds, while the most powerful may go up to 60, 90, 120, or even 180 seconds. Cooldowns longer than that are very rare.\nCooldowns are one of two major limitations skills may be designed with to avoid them being over- or underpowered; the other is its &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; cost. Some skills have both limitations, while others such as \"Diablo III\" Primary Skills have neither, and can therefore be used as much as &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; allows, but have correspondingly low power.\nSome skills have durations of effect. Those that strongly empower the character, such as &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Berserker\"&gt;Wrath of the Berserker&lt;/a&gt;, are designed with cooldown timers \"longer\" than durations. This means the character cannot be empowered all the time by re-using the skill before the duration expires by default, but this \"is\" possible with high enough Cooldown Reduction. On the other hand, some skills instead do not start cooling down until their effects have ended, generally skills that grant &lt;a href=\"immunity\"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt; to damage, like &lt;a href=\"Serenity\"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Falling%20Sword\"&gt;Falling Sword&lt;/a&gt;, or make it difficult to be targeted by enemies, like &lt;a href=\"Smoke%20Screen\"&gt;Smoke Screen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Walk\"&gt;Spirit Walk&lt;/a&gt;. This prevents characters from achieving permanent immunity with high Cooldown Reduction - they must \"always\" wait some time before the the effect can be reused.\nSkills like &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Anomaly\"&gt;Unstable Anomaly&lt;/a&gt;, which trigger automatically and have exploitable effects like cancelling death, are designed with hard limits to how frequently they can take effect. While the concept is similar to other cooldowns, such skills do not use regular cooldown mechanics, and do not benefit from Cooldown Reduction or other interactions. They usually show a debuff icon on the screen after they have activated. Only death cancels this restriction.\n&lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;Follower&lt;/a&gt; active skills all have cooldowns (and do not use resources). However, none of them benefit from normal Cooldown Reduction, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt;'s Heal skill. The AI will generally use the skills shortly after they are off cooldown, if appropriate for the current circumstances.\nMechanics.\nCooldown management is a vital part of gameplay, although some cooldown-independent &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s exist as well.\nThere are two quantities involved when using a cooldown skill, both of which can be updated by effects during combat:\nA skill cannot be replaced by another in the action bar while it is cooling down, preventing rotation through multiple high-cooldown skills in a single action bar slot. All cooldowns are reset immediately when a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt; is started.\nCooldowns continue to recharge even while a character is dead.\nInteractions.\nMany effects and character statistics can change skill cooldown times. These changes are not accounted for in the &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toughness\"&gt;Toughness&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Recovery\"&gt;Recovery&lt;/a&gt; \"estimated stats\" on the \"Diablo III\" &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt;, but they can have a huge impact nonetheless.\nEach skill has a set base cooldown time, possibly 0. Some &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Runes\"&gt;Skill Runes&lt;/a&gt; change this base, remove the cooldown entirely (often adding a &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; cost in its place), or add one that was not present in the un-runed version. Certain &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Item\"&gt;Legendary Item&lt;/a&gt; unique powers and a few s make similar changes. All further interactions are relative to this base cooldown period.\nMost non-rune cooldown modifiers affect either the \"overall cooldown time\" or \"current time remaining\" of one or all skills, as described in the section above. Most of them are locked in during combat, but some changes in these values can occur while adventuring.\nCooldown Reduction.\nForemost among modifications is Cooldown Reduction (CDR), a percentage that is removed from the overall cooldown time of all skills. This stat is the only cooldown modifier listed as an explicit secondary stat in the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt;. It is categorized under \"Offense\", although \"many\" defensive skills benefit from CDR as well. CDR applies the moment a skill is activated, so subsequent changes to the stat have no effect on a skill that has already started cooling down.\nCooldown Reduction can appear as a random primary &lt;a href=\"magic%20property\"&gt;magic property&lt;/a&gt; on items, stated as \"Reduces cooldown of all skills by X%\". For maximum level &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt;, it can appear in the 6-10% range on any weapon, and 5-8% on &lt;a href=\"gloves\"&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pauldrons\"&gt;pauldrons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rings\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"amulets\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; items including &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Items\"&gt;Ancient Items&lt;/a&gt; have the same ranges.\nCDR can also be granted by &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;s socketed into helms, &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; points, &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Shrines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Passive%20skill%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;passive skills&lt;/a&gt;, unique &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Item\"&gt;Legendary Item&lt;/a&gt; powers, and &lt;a href=\"item%20set\"&gt;item set&lt;/a&gt; bonuses.\nMultiple sources of Cooldown Reduction apply \"sequentially\". For example, a 20% CDR passive results in a cooldown length 80% of the original. If a 10% CDR item is also equipped, it reduces 10% of that 80% (8% of the original cooldown time), resulting in a final cooldown time 72% as long as the original. This can also be thought of as \"multiplicative stacking\" of CDR effects, if they are stated in terms of the relative \"remaining\" cooldown times: .8 * .9 = .72, with the same example. Note that regardless of the order of the effects or how many there are, the result will be the same. This is a form of diminishing returns for Cooldown Reduction (e.g. a new source is only half as effective if the character already has 50% CDR), and it is impossible to achieve 100% CDR through combinations of smaller effects.\nThere are some &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s focusing on keeping lower cooldowns for long-recharging spells, but the cap for most classes is around 72-75% (84.5-88.5% with &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Crown\"&gt;Leoric's Crown&lt;/a&gt;).\nAside from the normal benefits of Cooldown Reduction, also grants a direct bonus to damage equal to a character's Cooldown Reduction stat.\nFollowers, items and passives.\nGenerally, cooldown modifying effects do not apply to anything but active skills used directly by player characters. This rules out:\nSome special powers may trigger an active skill of a player character. If the player also has that skill in their action bar, its cooldown is usually separate from the specially-triggered one."}

He was aware of the true origins of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity in regards to their &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic parentage, despite the Cathedral of Light omitting the latter in its teachings. &lt;a href=\"Varshan\"&gt;Varshan&lt;/a&gt;, a senior priest, served as his mentor, and the pair resided at &lt;a href=\"Velkhova\"&gt;Velkhova&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Malignant.\nCormond's fortunes changed in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; made her way through Velkhova. As with other places, the townsfolk were driven mad by her presence, and attacked him and Varshan. Cormond begged Varshan to flee, but he refused to abandon his flock. Thus, Cormond fled by himself. In his guilt, he searched for a way to cure his people. Cormond travelled to &lt;a href=\"Orbei%20Monastery\"&gt;Orbei Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, where he found designs for &lt;a href=\"Cages%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Cages of Binding&lt;/a&gt; within the ruins, as well as some still functioning ones. He returned to his village with a Cage in hand, only to find it in ruins. Entering the church's &lt;a href=\"Velkhova%20Church%20Undercroft\"&gt;undercroft&lt;/a&gt;, he found Varshan, maddened by Lilith's words, the only one left. Cormond used one of the Cages on him, hoping to remove the corruption, but something went wrong; the corruption burst out of Varshan. Consumed him, body and &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Varshan became the first &lt;a href=\"Malignant\"&gt;Malignant&lt;/a&gt;, but he would not be the last, as the corruption spread to everyone he touched.\nCormond found a way to use the Cages to &lt;a href=\"Malignant%20Heart\"&gt;rip out&lt;/a&gt; the dark power of the Malignant, and use it to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's advantage in destroying them. To this end, he allied with a trio of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s (a , &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;), but one by one, they were killed by the Malignant. Without allies, and with his own strength failing, Cormond wrote to , requesting their aid.\nCormond's letter never made it to the Wanderer, but he encountered the adventurer nonetheless. On the road to &lt;a href=\"Menestad\"&gt;Menestad&lt;/a&gt;, he was attacked by a Malignant, and fled into a &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Clearing\"&gt;nearby forest&lt;/a&gt;. The Malignant pursued him, but was slain by the Wanderer. A greatful Cormond gave the Wanderer a &lt;a href=\"Cage%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Cage of Binding&lt;/a&gt; and told them to meet him at Orbei Monastery, where he would continue his research on how to stop the Malignant.\nThe pair reunited at Orbei, where Cormond explained how he'd found designs for the Cages of Binding earlier. If he could delve further, he might learn how to best use them, perhaps even cure the Malignant. However, he needed the Wanderer to buy him time, as the Malignant had spread to the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and would soon reach them at Orbei. He asked the Wanderer to buy him time for his research by holding the Malignant at bay. He also left some new cage designs for the Wanderer, albeit untested.\nWhile investigating Orbei, Cormond found a hall of records beneath the old archive. He requested the Wanderer's presence, and explained the crypt was full of &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s. The Wanderer acted as his bodyguard as they made their way through the crypt, before finally emerging in the hall. Cormond ordered them to search for any mention of the Cages of Binding. In this, the Wanderer succeeded, and found an entry confirming that the Cages were an invention of old &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, and had been distributed among their outposts in &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;. Cormond was overjoyed, but his joy turned to ashes as Varshan burst into the chamber, causing Cormond to flee in terror.\nThe Wanderer defeated Varshan, but was unable to capture him, and the creature escaped. On the surface, they demanded answers from Cormond, who explained what had happened between him and Varshan, how he was inadvertantly responsible for the creation of the Malignant. While he apologized for his deception, Cormond still believed that Varshan and the other Malignant could be cured. He rode to Hawezar to find the Cages of Binding mentioned in Orbei, and hoped the Wanderer would join him there.\nThe Wanderer obliged, meeting Cormond outside &lt;a href=\"Zarbinzet\"&gt;Zarbinzet&lt;/a&gt;. Cormond directed them to explore old Zakarum structures in Hawezar. The Wanderer returned with a collection of writings, which Cormond poured through. He deduced that the Cages had come from &lt;a href=\"Karamat%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Karamat's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden Zakarum outpost, sealed long ago. He and the Wanderer travelled to the site, and managed to gain entrance. Inside, they found a place of death. The &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Inquisition\"&gt;Zakarum Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; had conducted experiments with Cages of Binding on Malignant, or at least Malignant-like creatures. The Wanderer found a stronger cage, but told Cormond that Varshan wouldn't be able to survive. Cormond was aghast. All those people corrupted, as good as dead, because of what he'd done? The Wanderer told him that they'd done all they could, and Cormond declared they would return to his village. Where it started, and where it would end.\nThe pair reunited at Velkhova, still abandoned, and showing signs of Malignant infestation. After the Wanderer cleared the town of the Malignant, the pair descended back into the church undercroft, where Varshan was summoned and defeated. The Wanderer used the advanced Cage of Binding on Varshan's heart, finally ending him. A regretful Cormond returned to the surface.\nBack at his wagon, Cormond explained that without Varshan, the Malignant would start to diminish, but that would take time. When the Wanderer asked him why he hadn't told them the truth about Varshan from the outset, Cormond asked \"how could I confess to someone like you?\" He explained that the Wanderer did not understand how people saw them, how they inspired fear and awe alike. \nDespite the impending end of the Malignant, Cormond continued to make Cages of Binding, hoping that he could help those infected by Malignancy find peace. He believed Varshan would rest easier for it.\nIn-game.\nCormond appeared as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Malignant\"&gt;Season of the Malignant&lt;/a&gt;\" in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". He was usually found alongside his wagon, where he acted as a vendor for items pertaining to &lt;a href=\"Malignant%20Hearts\"&gt;Malignant Hearts&lt;/a&gt;.

Silent, and originally pale-skinned, she was an accomplished huntress, her knives easily able to take down her prey, and had the greatest skill in stalking unseen when compared to her peers. Due to her madness, her skin turned a mottled red.\nBiography.\nThe Hunt.\nIn the early days of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, during the time of the Firstborn, Corvik rode in the company of &lt;a href=\"Bersarik\"&gt;Bersarik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helgrotha\"&gt;Helgrotha&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gratian\"&gt;Gratian&lt;/a&gt;. No &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; could escape them, and the four were as close as &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;-kin. While their prey met &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, neither they nor any other nephalem had died in these early days. They dwelt in a golden city on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;s western continent.\nOn what would be their final hunt, Bersarik led them on a hunt to slay &lt;a href=\"aurochs\"&gt;aurochs&lt;/a&gt;. After three days of preparation, they left the golden city in which they dwelt, and travelled into the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;lands of the north&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst in the mountains, they were attacked by flying creatures similar to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Hawk\"&gt;Blood Hawk&lt;/a&gt;s. The creatures were slain, and they continued their journey. Reaching the steppes, they tracked the aurochs' trail. They tracked the herd for five days before coming across them. They planned to separate one from the herd.\nThe plan worked, initially, and they cornered their prey, but they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Ahduma\"&gt;Ahduma&lt;/a&gt;, the aurochs' queen. She slew Gratian, and got the aurochs to safety. Corvik and the others were shocked, for in these early days, death was an alien concept to the nephalem. After standing in silence, they realized that they were no different from the beasts that populated Sanctuary, that they too, could be slain. As &lt;a href=\"the%20moon\"&gt;the moon&lt;/a&gt; rose, Helgrotha declared that she would go to the place where death could not find her. Corvik doubted that death could be so evaded, for as she looked at Gratian's &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;, she believed that they all carried death somewhere within them. However, she kept these thoughts to herself, and accepted Helgrotha's parting embrace.\nA short time later, Bersarik declared that he would hold their makers to account for making them mortal. Telling him that &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were more powerful than Ahduma, Corvik took out her knives, and reached into Gratian with her fingers and blades. She searched for the secret place where he had carried his death with him, but could not fid it. Defeated, she instead fashioned his splayed bones and cords into a &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; which she named &lt;a href=\"Severian\"&gt;Severian&lt;/a&gt;. She entrusted it to Bersarik. Bersarik thanked her, and asked what she would do after they parted. She responded \"there are questions I would put to death. But first, I must find the camp of our hunter.\" Bersarik did not know what she meant by that, but neither did she want him to. Looking at Corvik, stained in Gratian's blood, Bersarik suspected that she had already traveled some distance down a very different road from he. Regardless, they bid their farewells.\nDeath.\nYears passed, and Corvik built herself a temple near a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, where she abducted numerous nephalem and carved them up, seeking mastery over death, and in so doing, power over her creators. The causeway to the temple was decorated with the skulls of nephalem and animals alike, and the land itself sickened. Kalmor, upon confronting her and her actions, suggested that she did not commit such acts to master death. Rather, she did them to master her fear of death. And now that death had come for her, perhaps she was afraid.\nWhatever the truth of the matter, Corvik attacked Kalmor. During the fight, Kalmor told her that he'd slain Bersarik, and she asked what had become of Severian. He explained that the blade he was wielding had been Severian. That it been remade. Looking closely at the sword, and recognizing its linneage, Corvik lowered her knives and asked, \"Gratian?\" It was the opening that sealed her death, as Kalmor swung the blade, nearly cutting Corvik in two. She lay there, and as tears washed some of the dark stain from her eyes, she whispered her last words...\n\"I am afraid.\"\nLegacy.\nKalmor, feeling no pity for her, dragged her body out into the open, leaving it for carrion eaters. No-one knew exactly what had happened, but the pass where Corvik's temple was located remained a haunted place for generations after, avoided by all save the foolish and those drawn to evil."}

According to legend, it was primarily a place of peace and shelter, shielding them from powerful spells of some kind. Passages in the \"&lt;a href=\"Books%20of%20Kalan\"&gt;Books of Kalan&lt;/a&gt;\" indicate that the city was built by &lt;a href=\"Daedessa%20the%20Builder\"&gt;Daedessa the Builder&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lidar%20the%20Noble\"&gt;Lidar the Noble&lt;/a&gt; infused the city with some form of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; that could ward off trespassing &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Cullen%20%28First%20Ones%29\"&gt;Cullen&lt;/a&gt; suspected that the power that shielded Corvus was tied to the creation of Sanctuary itself, and the interaction between the physical and &lt;a href=\"Ether\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; planes. He further suspected that the city existed within its own realm.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; altered the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; to stymie the nephalem's abilities, the nephalem became &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;, and forgot their past heritage. Thus Corvus was forgotten and left to come to ruin. Powerful defenses left behind by its nephalem inhabitants deterred most adventurers from finding the city.\nOver the years the &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt; have made several expeditions to the ruins of corvus in search of the lost knowledge\u2014and treasure, of the nephalem.\nRakkis.\nMillennia later, &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, having heard of the existance of the nephalem and Corvus, established &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; near where Corvus was said to lie. Obsessed with the nephalem and the power they held, it was his ambition to locate Corvus. He succeeded in locating the city, and took the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20of%20Corvus\"&gt;Wolf of Corvus&lt;/a&gt; as the sigil for his new &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The lure of potential immortality convinced Rakkis that he might even be nephalem himself, though after many fruitless years of wandering the crumbling remnants of the city, his only consolation was to have his remains entombed within.\nIt is said that at the age of 100, Rakkis died peacefully in his sleep. In his final years, Rakkis requested that he be buried among the ruins of the lost city. This was apparently granted, and Rakkis was &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;entombed&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of Corvus.\nRecent History.\nThe destruction of the Worldstone did not appear to weaken the magic guarding Corvus, potentially due to its 'pocket realm' magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Long after&lt;/a&gt; the death of Rakkis, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; was hidden in Corvus by &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and the reformed &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;. However, it was taken by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins were later entered by &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, as she searched for Malthael's whereabouts. She was tracked down by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and killed, but not before discovering that Malthael was residing in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nCorvus is explored in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".

They are usually collectible: by completing &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; and other tasks, with random &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; drops, through participation in special events, or via microtransactions or product purchases. Cosmetics range from non-combat pets, to modifications or special appearances for equipment, to &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt; customization options, to portraits in the user interface.\nMost cosmetic options are shared across all the characters on a player's account, although some are restricted from use within other game modes, such as &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;al characters.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" has taken a cautious approach to the introduction of cosmetic items in an effort to maintain a darker, gritty atmosphere for the game.\nTransmogrification items.\nTransmogrification, or \"transmog\", is the process of changing the appearance of one item to look like another item of the same or similar type. The \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Mystic\"&gt;Mystic&lt;/a&gt; can perform this service for a fee in &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. Transmogrification requires that the item whose appearance is desired has actually dropped for a character in the current game mode, although it still works if the item has been subsequently salvaged or sold. If it is a , it must also have been be identified. When a new appearance is gathered this way, the icon representing the item briefly appears on screen with the message \"new appearance unlocked\". A character can transmogrify as many items as they wish.\nTransmogrification does not require cosmetic-specific items, but several exist for this purpose in \"Diablo III\". They are usually &lt;a href=\"Normal%20Items\"&gt;normal quality&lt;/a&gt;, although some awarded for special events or purchases are &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt;. They often drop from defeating specific bosses or completing specific events.\nAlmost all \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" cosmetic customization is via transmogrification. Transmog items are designed to be closely connected to the character concept and setting to keep the style grounded. They can be purchased in the game's &lt;a href=\"Cosmetics%20Shop\"&gt;Cosmetics Shop&lt;/a&gt;.\nBanner customizations.\nEach character in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" has a banner which sits by the &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;Waypoint&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; of their current act, and can also be summoned by pressing the 'G' key. The banner design can be customized with different shapes, patterns, sigils, accents, and colors. An account can unlock additional options for these by completing various achievements and events. Customization choices are set for the entire account, not individual for each character as with most cosmetics, and can be adjusted by clicking on the banner while in town or on the character select screen.\nWings.\nWings are fantastic appendages that emerge from a character's back when equipped. Some look simply like biological wings, while others look like the wings of &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s or otherwise magical in nature. \nWings can be equipped in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" via the &lt;a href=\"Wardrobe\"&gt;Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; or Collection screen. They can be collected from several sources:\nWings can be purchased and equipped in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" for large amounts of Resonance.\nCosmetic Pets.\nNon-combat or cosmetic &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s are small creatures that follow the player character in the game world once \"equipped\", sometimes performing minor useful functions.\nPets can be collected in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", and used from the &lt;a href=\"Wardrobe\"&gt;Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; or Collection screen. Only one cosmetic pet can be active at a time, although they do not interfere with use of combat pets from &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt;s. Pets automatically pick up nearby &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for the player, and one &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt; unlockable allows them to pick up and &lt;a href=\"salvage\"&gt;salvage&lt;/a&gt; non-&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; items the same way.\nPortrait Frames.\nPortrait Frames are visual elements in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" that show in the user interface around a character's portrait, appearing to themselves and party members. Many portraits are granted for reaching various &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; levels, and many &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;s each introduced a new series of portraits unlocked with each stage of &lt;a href=\"Season%20Journey\"&gt;Season Journey&lt;/a&gt; progression. Some portraits are also granted for special events, achievements, or purchases. Portraits are selected via the &lt;a href=\"Wardrobe\"&gt;Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; or Collection screen.\nPennants.\nPennants are large banner-like devices mounted on a character's back. They can be collected in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" and equipped via the &lt;a href=\"Wardrobe\"&gt;Wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; or Collection screen. Only one pennant can be used at a time per character. Several types of pennants can be earned:\nCosmetic Sets.\nCosmetic Sets are \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" collectible appearances that provide a complete look for a character without being attached to specific items they are actually equipping for combat reasons. Each &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; has associated Cosmetic Sets, while other Sets are available for purchase or can be earned in other ways.\nMiscellaneous.\nPlayers who participated in the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" beta could unlock a &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Wolf%20Pup%20Pack\"&gt;Beta Wolf Pup Pack&lt;/a&gt;, a wolf pup carried in a sling on a character's back. It does not run around or perform any functions like typical cosmetic pets."}

Once faithful and generous leaders of their people, the ruling members of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; were twisted in form and spirit, and took their followers down a darker path. Ruling from the shadows and speaking only through ensorcelled priests, these corrupted holy men abused their positions and misguided the faithful into attacking those who followed the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Their betrayal to their people did not go \u2018'unrewarded' by Mephisto, however, as they were granted abilities far beyond those of their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; followers.\nIn-game.\nCouncil Members are a special type of monster which are only found as super-unique bosses. They never spawn as normal monsters unless as the minions of their respective bosses. Even so, the normal ones gain their bosses' magical bonuses.\nAll Council Members were once powerful human warriors. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt; Council Members were members of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; and the lone &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; Council Member, &lt;a href=\"Bartuc%20the%20Bloody\"&gt;Bartuc the Bloody&lt;/a&gt; may have been the legendary &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;, the Warlord of Blood.\nCouncil Members appear only in &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Temple\"&gt;Blackened Temple&lt;/a&gt; and on the third level of the &lt;a href=\"Durance%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Durance of Hate&lt;/a&gt;.

There are a total of 7 Council Member bosses in the entire game, 6 of which are found in &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt;. It is interesting to note that for the Act III Council Members, their special attributes are related to the second part of their names:\nAs stated above, Council Members can prove to be quite challenging.\nCouncil Members cast , which in turn spew out &lt;a href=\"fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;s.

Council Members don't regenerate health naturally, though they can &lt;a href=\"Heal%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; themselves and others, so it's essential to burn them down as fast as possible.\nThere are three normal Council Member types which are different only in statistics.

The Council was erected in order to prevent the growing hostilities between the different clans from erupting into an all-out war. Along with the &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20Guild\"&gt;Merchants Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the Council of Clans was the effective ruling body of Kehjan. \nThe Council consisted of one chosen member from each of the seven dominant clans, in addition to a member of the next seven (less-powerful) clans. Only the dominant clans had a vote, but the lesser clans could bring up articles for debate. The Council was presided over by a chairman. In addition, there was an enforcement arm of consisting of spell-casters who had given up their essence to the Council, effectively removing any tie to their old Clans. These mages were to track down renegade spell-casters who had broken the covenants set up by the Council. \nThe Council also held a close watch over all mages.

The final test of every Coven initiate involves drawing a symbol on the ground with powdered amethyst that inflicts a fatal curse. The initiate must conduct the ritual perfectly, then immediately reverse the effect with a counter-spell. If they fail, the result is certain death.\nSome Coven members willingly accept demonic possession, believing that in doing so, they ascend to a higher plane of existence.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Coven is a\u00a0remnant of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;. While the Triune worshiped the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, the Coven was formed as a collection of \"lost souls,\" seeking their destiny. The Coven's existence became known to some extent within the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, but they were looked upon with contempt by both lords and peasants. \nEarly History.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, the Coven had lost its way prior to their coup; content to consort with lesser &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and dabble with &lt;a href=\"dark%20magic\"&gt;dark magic&lt;/a&gt;. With no vision or ambition beyond this, Adria later claimed that if not for the change in leadership, the Coven would have died a slow, pathetic death.\nWhatever the truth of that matter, it is known that at the suggestion of &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;, she and Adria poisoned the leaders of the Coven so they could take control. The cult had been floundering prior to their arrival, but they took control and poisoned its leaders, reforging it into a dangerous new order that practiced torture and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic summoning. It is said that these witches were fueled by the belief that they were destined to become mortal heralds of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. Adria compiled a &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; for the Coven, collecting all she had learned over her travels, so that the Coven might turn this knowledge to its advantage. She declared that the final war between Heaven and Hell was coming and that demon lords had whispered to her, telling her of two possible outcomes. In one, Hell recognised the worth of the Coven and they ruled alongside them. In the other, they saw the Coven as being less than useless, their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s tormented for eternity. She urged the Coven to look at sources of power beyond demonology, from the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;, to even &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; itself. While these groups were not servants of Hell, she insisted that the only pertinent question was whether they were powerful.\nThe Lord of Lies.\nYears after taking control of the Coven, Adria and Maghda had a falling out and Adria left the group, around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Her departure nearly tore the cult apart and left Maghda wracked by jealousy and rage. Fuelled by her dark emotions, she redoubled her efforts to contact the Burning Hells. At some point, they made contact with &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Lies, and they pledged themselves to his service. Under Maghda, the Coven expanded its influence back into the East, in the deserts around &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is also known that, while the cultists were serving Belial unquestioningly and zealously, every member of the Coven was to be sacrificed to their demonic master sooner or later (as soon as there is enough taint in their bodies). In addition, the Coven paid generously for &lt;a href=\"Behistun\"&gt;Behistun&lt;/a&gt; Magi artifacts, whose knowledge they were hoping to resurrect and use for their own purposes. The most favored servants were given &lt;a href=\"Gloves%20of%20Worship\"&gt;special gloves&lt;/a&gt; made of &lt;a href=\"Deceiver\"&gt;Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; flesh.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the Coven was a fledging group. It took advantage of the chaos wrought by the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;five years prior&lt;/a&gt;, its members spreading corruption wherever they trod.\nThe End of Days.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; withdrew support from the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;. The Coven and their summoned demons terrorized the populace, causing them to flee to Caldeum.\nThe Search for the Sword.\nThe descent of &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; of Justice, did not go unnoticed by the denizens of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. Belial was aware of the fallen star and sent Maghda and many members of the Coven to retrieve &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt;, the sword of Tyrael, which had been broken into three pieces. &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; encountered cultists attempting to turn the &lt;a href=\"Templar%20Order\"&gt;Templar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt; to their side. The Nephalem freed the Templar and aided him in tracking down and killing &lt;a href=\"Jondar\"&gt;Jondar&lt;/a&gt;, another Templar who had turned his back on the order and joined Maghda and the Coven as a necromancer.\nThe Coven hounded the heroes' steps as they neared the pieces of El'druin. In the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Misery\"&gt;Fields of Misery&lt;/a&gt;, they had taken control of the &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; and used them to kill those who opposed them, and tried to 'turn' the first piece of the sword for their own purposes before being thwarted. In the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Temple\"&gt;Drowned Temple&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Festering%20Woods\"&gt;Festering Woods&lt;/a&gt;, the cultists were teleported in by Maghda in order to claim the second piece, but fell to the Nephalem. Finally, they descended upon the town of &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt; and burned it to the ground, murdering many people in order to get their hands on the final piece of the sword. Unfortunately for the heroes, not only were the Coven successful in claiming the final piece, but were also successful in invading &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and capturing &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrael and the other two pieces.\nThe heroes rushed back to New Tristram to rescue their friends from the Coven, learning that Maghda sought the sword on behalf of Belial. Leah killed the cultists that had her captive when her hidden power unleashed itself and annihilated them all. Seeing that her advantage was lost, Maghda spitefully spirited Tyrael away, telling the heroes that the blade would be hers. Dying from the wounds inflicted on him by Maghda's magic, Deckard used the last of his power to restore El'druin. After the death of Deckard Cain, the heroes made it their next goal to return the now reconstructed El'druin to its original owner and exact vengeance upon Maghda and the Coven.\nThe Vengeance of the Nephalem.\nThe Coven took Tyrael through the Highlands and into &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt;, where they spirited him down into the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;'s old torture chambers. Along the way, they also captured many villagers to torture and sacrifice in order to summon &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. It soon became apparent to the Coven that they had made a terrible enemy of the Nephalem. Nothing that the cultists could send their way -- not men, not khazra, not even demons -- was enough to even slow the heroes down. Worse still, Maghda cared nothing for their fates except as a means to delay the heroes while she prepared their demise in the depths below.\nBy the time the Nephalem reached Tyrael, the Coven had tortured him nearly to the point of death. As Tyrael lay dying, the Nephalem gave him El'druin back, restoring both his body and his mind. Maghda escaped to &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, where her master Belial had seized the city of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, and where the rest of the Coven dedicated to him had gathered. Tyrael remembered the warning he had set out to deliver about the forces of the last two Lords of Hell planning to invade Sanctuary and take control, and about how Belial had descended upon the Jewel of the East. With this in mind, after paying their final respects to Deckard Cain and giving him a proper burial, the heroes set out for Caldeum in order to free the city from Belial's reign. \nThe Massacre of Alcarnus.\nHunted by the Nephalem, Maghda and the Coven descended upon the city of &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt;, torturing and slaughtering its people, the survivors fleeing the city and seeking refuge in Caldeum. They tortured and killed innocent villagers, knowing that it would draw The Nephalem out. The Coven attempted to stop the heroes from reaching Maghda by means of deceptive illusions, among them obscuring the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Canyon%20Bridge\"&gt;Black Canyon Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, an effort foiled by the arrival of the enchantress &lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt;, who directed them to the sites of the torturous rituals the Coven were using to create the illusions. They also attempted to lure the heroes into a trap at the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, where the heroes learned that the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; responsible for what was happening in Caldeum were the &lt;a href=\"Deceiver\"&gt;serpent demons&lt;/a&gt; of Belial in disguise. After freeing the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; that Maghda had marked for sacrifice to Belial, the heroes tracked Maghda and the Coven to Alcarnus, killing every demon in their path, freeing those the Coven still held prisoner, and killing every one of the cultists before confronting Maghda herself and exacting final vengeance for Deckard Cain.\nThe Coven may have been suppling Belial with slaves up to this point. At any rate, after the destruction of the Coven at Alcarnus, Belial ordered the Imperial Guard be dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, in order to procure new slaves.\nAfter Maghda's fall, a final remnant of the Coven in Kehjistan were seen in the &lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur Oasis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Sands\"&gt;Desolate Sands&lt;/a&gt;, presumably taking orders from Belial himself as they tried to claim the head and blood of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, and met with about as much success as their endeavors to stop the heroes under Maghda.\nThe Reaper of Souls.\nThe Coven endured the loss of their master. They had a presence in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; when Malthael led his &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; against the realm. The Coven intended to oppose him. During this time period, a reformed Coven member informed &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; that there was a stash nearby, that it would have been better served in their hands, rather than his own.\nAfter Malthael's defeat, the Coven was, by this time, in shambles. Its scattered remnants established themselves in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nThe Coven serves as a major antagonist force in both \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Very talkative, he can annoy &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; with his ramblings on certain occasions.\nBiography.\nShen has gone by many names throughout his life, the alias \"Covetous Shen\" being the latest. He has, at times, been compared to &lt;a href=\"Zei\"&gt;Zei&lt;/a&gt;, the Trickster God in Xiansian mythology; it is implied several times that the connection might go deeper than mere comparison. He does not deny that he is far from normal, and has lived longer than a normal man.\nEarly Life and Adventures.\nShen hails from &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt;, a land he would come to express negative sentiment about. He left due to his wanderlust. During his youth, he had \"interesting experiences\" with &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; priestesses. Another interesting experience Shen had at a (relatively) young age was during the &lt;a href=\"Festival%20of%20Masks\"&gt;Festival of Masks&lt;/a&gt;, where a woman stole his money pouch, with only a kiss in return. Mask still attached, Shen chased her halfway across the city's rooftops. He lost her, but still remembered her laugh.\nShen claims to have met &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; at some point in the past, considering him to be \"perfectly reasonable\" for a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his travels, Shen came to search for a cursed jewel, said jewel containing a terrible creature named &lt;a href=\"Dirgest\"&gt;Dirgest&lt;/a&gt;. It had killed thousands, and could not be held without harm by anyone but himself. The jewel had, in Shen's own words, taken everything and everyone from him that mattered. The danger it presented was, in his view, similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. He spent his life searching for it. One location his search took him to was &lt;a href=\"Skovos\"&gt;Skovos&lt;/a&gt;, said adventure including sea monsters and poisoned arrows. It evaded his grasp, but the adventure wasn't entirely without gain, as, when the theater's ceiling collapsed, he literally fell into the arms of the woman who would be his seventh wife.\nShen once travelled with a &lt;a href=\"Vecin\"&gt;Vecin&lt;/a&gt; wagon tribe for six months. He later commented that it was one of the happiest times of his life. It came to an end when he drunk too much &lt;a href=\"flaming%20cider\"&gt;flaming cider&lt;/a&gt;, and ended up in a married woman's bed with his trousers on his head. It was at this point that her husband came in. He had to leave in a hurry, but followed the wagon train for three more months, sneaking into her wagon whenever her husband fell asleep.\nDuring his travels, Shen came to &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, where he saw King &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; when he was building his &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt;, though never knew the monarch personally.\nShen was married to Myriam Jahzia at one point. Their relationship was sexual in nature.\nThe End of Days.\nJewels in the East.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Shen was in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Waterway\"&gt;aqueducts&lt;/a&gt;, searching for a crucible that could combine jewel fragments. Upon finding it, his guide, &lt;a href=\"Gavin\"&gt;Gavin&lt;/a&gt;, stole his crucible, and stuffed Shen in a barrel, where he was recued by The Nephalem. They found Gavin, but the crucible was cursed, and had turned him into a &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating him, Shen retrieved the crucible and offered his services to The Nephalem. They agreed. The truth was, Shen suspected that they might have an eventual hand in finding the jewel he sought. Until then, he would provide them with his services. He remained evasive as to his true identity, frustrating The Nephalem to no end. \nShen realized that the jewel he sought wasn't in &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. When The Nephalem retrieved the Black Soulstone, he asked if he could study it. The Nephalem was wary, but Shen pointed out that he was well versed in the knowledge of jewels and ancient stones, and that the object he sought was potentially just as dangerous.\nPrime Evil.\nAfter the defeat of Belial, Shen followed The Nephalem to &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. When The Nephalem prepared to head out of the fortress to confront &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;, he told them to bundle up, in order to protect themselves from the cold. He suggested that after &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, the heroes could travel with him. This wasn't to pass however, as the heroes had to enter &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; itself to thwart &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion.\nBecause of &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal, sacrificing &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; to allow Diablo to be reborn, Shen fell into despair, his shift in demeanor noticed by The Nephalem. He expected that his life was at an end, though since the whole world was about to end, and he'd lived a long life, maybe that wasn't so bad. Still, he urged them to find hope where they could, and resolved that, with the fate of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; hanging in the balance, he had to set aside all thoughts of Dirgest's jewel for now. He suggested that Leah's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; could still endure, despite the Nephalem's doubts. He suggested that after Diablo was defeated, they could travel together in search of Dirgest's jewel.\nTowards the end of the battle, Shen dropped his usually jovial demeanor, and confided to the Nephalem that he could hardly bear to think of Dirgest's jewel, that The Nephalem had to save them. In this, the Nephalem was successful, defeating Diablo. Overjoyed, Shen declared that it would be a story he would tell for many years...and that he wouldn't leave out the part he himself played.\nChasing the Jewel.\nSoon after coming to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; along with The Nephalem, Shen told a tale about &lt;a href=\"Zei\"&gt;Zei&lt;/a&gt;, the thief who once cheated a demon god, &lt;a href=\"Dirgest\"&gt;Dirgest&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to seize his most prized possession, &lt;a href=\"Liria\"&gt;Liria&lt;/a&gt;. Zei imprisoned the demon inside a priceless jewel, the one Shen had been looking for all this time, but not before Dirgest slew Liria and everyone Zei held dear.\nOnce the gates to &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt; opened, Shen revealed that the jewel was buried in the &lt;a href=\"Unearthed%20Ruins\"&gt;Unearthed Ruins&lt;/a&gt; close to the city. Together they managed to fight their way through the ruins, only to discover, much to Shen's horror, that the jewel had been shattered, and the demon god has been freed from his imprisonment. After the Nephalem defeated &lt;a href=\"Vekriss\"&gt;Vekriss&lt;/a&gt;, the demon guarding Liria's spirit, Shen suddenly changed his manner of speaking beyond recognition. Liria's liberated &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; asked Shen if he was Zei (as did Vekriss before the battle), to which he replied he was just a simple jeweler, and that Zei was long gone, but sadly said he was happy to see Liria's face one final time. Later in Westmarch, despite all attempts of The Nephalem to get some answers, he only explained that now it was crucial for him to find Dirgest, no matter the cost.\nAt some point prior to these events, foreseeing that he might meet Dirgest one day, Shen had made a precious jewel to face him, but eventually traded it for food.\nHunting Dirgest.\nShen disappeared not long after his brief reunion with Lira. He took little with him when he departed, leaving the tools of his trade behind. The tools became objects of interest to fellow jewelers, who believed that such tools could produce works like what Shen was able to accomplish.\nOver the next fifty years, little was seen of him. To &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt;'s best knowledge, he remained focused on his quest to recapture Dirgest.\nIn-game.\nIn the events of \"Diablo III\", Shen provides the Nephalem with Jewel-crafting services (combining gems and adding or removing them from items), after rescuing him from a barrel in the &lt;a href=\"Waterlogged%20Passage\"&gt;Waterlogged Passage&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. The hero proceeds to kill Shen's possessed companion, &lt;a href=\"Gavin\"&gt;Gavin&lt;/a&gt;, after he touched a cursed crucible. Shen will then be found at the base camp of &lt;a href=\"Act%20II%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent acts, where he provides Jewel-crafting services or conversation. Exhausting his dialogue earns the &lt;a href=\"Everybody%20Loves%20Shen\"&gt;Everybody Loves Shen&lt;/a&gt; achievement. In \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", Shen can also craft &lt;a href=\"jewelry\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ring\"&gt;Hellfire Ring&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Amulet\"&gt;Hellfire Amulet&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs with all artisans, Shen only needs to be recruited once per account. He will be present in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, from the beginning, in all subsequent play-throughs on all difficulty levels. He will briefly disappear from his normal spot when the player reaches his recruitment quest, but will return following quest completion.\n&lt;a href=\"Stolen%20Ring\"&gt;Stolen Ring&lt;/a&gt; was once owned by Shen. A &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Shen%27s%20Delight\"&gt;Shen's Delight&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to appear in game, but it was cut prior to release of the content patch.\nPersonality and Traits.\nShen is filled with wanderlust and has a carefree nature, giving every appearance of being a man without ambition, and trusting in fate to guide him to where he needs to be. Shen\u2019s lax attitude only changes when jewels are involved. His greed for glittering precious stones is legendary; he may even love them more than he loves his own life. \"Covetous\" is a name that he lives up to, though he claims to not be greedy. In fact, while he's had well over seven wives over the course of his life, he's never had more than two at the same time. His tenth wife was a , two heads taller than Shen himself. Shen also enjoyed mocking the Nephalem by evading any direct answers regarding who he really is, giving hints that Shen is much, much more than a simple jeweler.\nFor all his mysteries, Shen is widely known for his skill working with precious metals and stones. It is said that his genius can turn the lowliest bauble into a powerful relic, so long as the customer can pay the price. Stories also say that he would sometimes refuse to sell his work, at a cost to his business, simply because he loved his jewels and saw them as his children. Shen's tools appeared shabby, and many of them were ancient, while others were of poor or rustic quality. Many jewelers refuse to believe that such tools could produce work like Shen's. &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; knew little on the subject of crafting, but made two notes. First, enchanted objects didn't always look like enchanted objects. Second, with enough skill, perhaps the tool mattered less than the artisan.\nShen constantly wears the same set of clothing. He doesn't even bundle up for the cold, instead stuffing &lt;a href=\"fire%20opal\"&gt;fire opal&lt;/a&gt;s in his pockets and under his shirts, keeping him warm."}

Although they may appear tedious to make, Crafted Items have the potential to be extremely powerful, and even more valuable than even Unique Items.\nCrafting Basics.\nAll crafted items are made with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic Items&lt;/a&gt; as the base items, and a variety of other items (most often perfect &lt;a href=\"Gems\"&gt;Gems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jewels\"&gt;Jewels&lt;/a&gt; of any kind, and specified &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt;). Any magical item can be used, including &lt;a href=\"Ethereal\"&gt;Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; items, or items &lt;a href=\"socketed\"&gt;socketed&lt;/a&gt; due to a magical prefix such as &lt;a href=\"Mechanic%27s\"&gt;Mechanic's&lt;/a&gt;. However, after the crafted item is made, the Ethereal or socketed condition would be gone, as crafting an item gets rid of any preexisting mods. This is important to remember: magical items with mods that have been crafted by a player should not be then crafted again, as doing so would erase them.\nMods.\nA crafted item always has a set of pre-set mods that depends on the recipe used in its crafting and the type of item that is crafted. There are four types of basic recipes, that correspond to four types of pre-set mods:\nAlong with this set of pre-set mods, a crafted item is also imbued with a set of random mods: 1-4 suffixes or affixes that would normally be found on magic items or rare items. Higher character levels and item levels spawn higher numbers of mods, as well as higher level mods: for instance, crafting a &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Shard\"&gt;Dimensional Shard&lt;/a&gt; at level 81 would spawn 4 higher level random mods, as opposed to crafting a &lt;a href=\"Jared%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Jared's Stone&lt;/a&gt; at level 20, which would most likely spawn 1 lower level mod. Using the same logic, Crafted Items can also have very high character level requirements: sometimes even over level 100, making them unusable.\nPros and Cons.\nCrafted Items can be compared and contrasted to a Rare Item. The main advatange of Crafted Items is the ease of accessing them - unlike Rare Items which can only be found or &lt;a href=\"gamble\"&gt;gamble&lt;/a&gt;d for, Crafted Items are far easier to create - the runes used are generally fairly common, there is no specific requirement about the Jewel, the base item can be easily &lt;a href=\"gamble\"&gt;gamble&lt;/a&gt;d for (although if the player desires an elite item as base, it will take more effort to obtain), leaving the perfect gem as the rarest item to obtain, which is far easier than trying to obtain a Rare Item of a specific base. The preset mods also give the player some control over what they want on the item. In addition, some of those preset mods are normally not found on Magic or Rare Items, while some others can stack with normal randomly generated affixes - for example, normal amulets can only obtain 10% Faster Cast Rate, while a caster amulet can obtain up to 20% if it spawns \"of the Apprentice\" suffix as well.\nOn the other hand, Crafted Items can only be generated with up to 4 affixes, compared to Rare Item's 6. More importantly, Crafted Items have a higher level requirement than Rare Items. Some otherwise truly monstrous Crafted Items are rendered pointless because they could require something like level 96 to wear. They also cannot obtain affixes that are exclusive to Magical Items, although Rare Items cannot obtain them either.\nPatch Differences.\nCrafted Items went through a variety of changes from to , including changes in recipes. Although no differences have been made from Patch 1.09 to the current , those few players not updated to the latest patch may find Crafted Item recipes quite different from those listed.\nEarly patches also had quite a few problems with Crafted Items: Prior to Patch 1.09, players could imbue Crafted Items with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt; quest. However, since then, the bug has been fixed."}

It is here spirits go after &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarious &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; cultures/groups have their own terms for the Spirit Realm. These include the Hall Beyond, Realm of the Dead, Mbwiru Eikura (\"Unformed Land\"), \"the Spirit World,\" the Unformed Lands, or the Plane of the Dead. \nLore.\nThe Spirit Realm is said to have \"empyrean topography;\" a ghostly reflection of Sanctuary shaped by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; beliefs. It warps around powerful &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;(s) to form a reflection of real locations. Inhabitants of this realm include human and animal spirits, insect and plant spirits, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spirit\"&gt;vengeful spirits&lt;/a&gt;, along with creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"Skitterwright\"&gt;Skitterwright&lt;/a&gt;. Over time they evolve with some becoming &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Guardians\"&gt;Spirit Guardians&lt;/a&gt; who grew to be massive from magical energy concentrating within them. The Guardians protect the realm from &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. A veil exists between this realm and &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Hallow's Wake&lt;/a&gt;, the boundary between the realms of life and death becomes paper thin, and for a short duration, the two realms become one. In this period, vengeful spirits spread across the land.\nThe Spirit Realm is sub-divided into various realms, each of which is overseen by a Spirit Guardian. A human spirit under a Guardian's patronage may roam their respective realm.\nHistory.\nThe has existed since &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s creation. When &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; altered the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; between these two great powers released a clouded veil of magical energy which created the realm.\n&lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt; is the first known human to have discovered the Spirit Realm. When he returned to &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;, he discovered the veil between the Spirit Realm and Sanctuary\u2014a place uninfluenced by angels and demons. He knew such a place had to be protected, and he and his most trusted acolyte &lt;a href=\"Ysevete\"&gt;Ysevete&lt;/a&gt; spent many fortnights studying the Spirit Realm until Akarat became the first living body to cross the veil into the Spirit Realm.\nAkarat\u2019s acolytes continued his studies of the jungle while he was abroad. Returning for his twilight years, Akarat spent them exploring the uncharted territories of the Spirit Realm. When it was time for Akarat to make his final crossing into the Spirit Realm, it would be under the watch of his devoted followers. Ysevete's cries of sorrow would reach the Realm and were met with support from the spirits. Ysevete would go on to form the basis for the &lt;a href=\"Spiritborn\"&gt;Spiritborn&lt;/a&gt; culture.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231286\"&gt;1286&lt;/a&gt;, spirits of the realm were consumed by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, as he sought to increase his strength. His actions weakened the divide between the realm and Sanctuary.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; made her way through &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt; carrying &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, his corruption began to seep into the Spirit Realm.\nBeliefs and Practices.\nPriests of Rathma.\nIt is from this realm that &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s can summon these spirits, upon which, they will rip a portion of their foe's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; and carry it with them back into their realm.\nNecromancers can tap into the spirit realm, channeling bitter and mischievous spirits into the minds of nearby enemies. The victims are bombarded with the gibbering of the dead, which, indistinguishable from their own thoughts, urge them to strike at friend and foe alike. The discordant wailing of these spirits builds to a crescendo, eventually driving the victim mad.\nSpiritborn.\nThe Spirit Realm is integral to the practices of the &lt;a href=\"Spiritborn\"&gt;Spiritborn&lt;/a&gt;. The Spiritborn were founded by Ysevete, who formed the group after Akarat passed into the realm for the last time. Spiritborn culture endured well into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, using the tenets Yveste and Akarat created.\nSpiritborn believe that if they devote themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Guardians\"&gt;Spirit Guardians&lt;/a&gt; sufficiently in life, that once they cross the veil after &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, they will become Spirit Guardians themselves. The desired transfer of their soul to the Spirit Realm upon death is one they prepare for while alive. Rejoining with the Spirit Realm upon death is thought to be the highest honor someone can bring upon themselves.\nSpiritborn can visit the Spirit Realm while alive, although it is a dangerous, honor-laden undertaking usually reserved for elders who\u2019ve mastered every other facet of their skillset. The uninitiated can still experience vestiges of the Spirit Realm in the form of visions or dreams, whispers from the other side of the veil, and unsolicited intuitions.\nUmbaru.\nThe Unformed Land is the central tenet of the &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt;'s belief system, that the mortal realm is merely a veil for the true reality that is the Unformed Land. It is through the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s that the Umbaru gain insight into the realm, who can purportedly see and experience it, in a state they call the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Trance\"&gt;Ghost Trance&lt;/a&gt;. They believe that every being senses the Unformed Land, even if they do not know it. It has been demonstrated that (supposedly) being severed from this connection results in excruciating pain. It is from this realm that they draw their &lt;a href=\"dark%20magic\"&gt;dark magic&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Enkasi\"&gt;Enkasi&lt;/a&gt;, the Unformed Land is the 'true world,' and Sanctuary is its shadow.\nAccording to the Umbaru, gods dwell within this realm, their life force flowing from the Unformed Land into Sanctuary (it has been said that a 'thread' flows from the Unformed Land into all living things). Thus, the Umbaru hold ceremonies involving ritual sacrifice to keep this life force flowing. Among these gods is &lt;a href=\"Giyua\"&gt;Giyua&lt;/a&gt;, who is said to greet the spirits of the departed once they enter the realm.\nThe gods aside, the denizens of the land are mischievous and drawn to power, always seeking to intrude upon the mortal world, but fail to stay for long. An Umbaru priest once crossed into the realm, but returned as a &lt;a href=\"Phantasm\"&gt;Phantasm&lt;/a&gt; (and was subsequently slain). \nOther.\nVarious cults have believed that the souls of virtuous humans are rewarded in &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; while the souls of wicked sinners are punished in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; noted there was little evidence for this belief. He believed that human souls passed on to an unknown location, beyond the reach of Heaven or Hell.\nScrolls found by &lt;a href=\"Kamien\"&gt;Kamien&lt;/a&gt; described a river of tar that separated the living from a \"land of the dead.\" Any unfortunate &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; who tried to cross would be dragged into oblivion.\nSome believe that &lt;a href=\"Duskprowler\"&gt;Duskprowler&lt;/a&gt;s escort the dead into lands beyond Sanctuary.\nSome s believe in \"the Hall Beyond\"; apparently their version of the Spirit Realm. In this belief system, those who face their end without fear will be able to keep their form in the titular Hall."}

Creating Spirit in weapons for end-game builds is less common as there are many other better options (such as ), but it can be constructed in a &lt;a href=\"Phase%20Blade\"&gt;Phase Blade&lt;/a&gt; to help &lt;a href=\"Trapassin\"&gt;Trapassin&lt;/a&gt;s increase their speed when using and increase their trap damage at the same time. This is a very popular option when not dual-wielding claws. Lower levelled Wind Druids can also benefit from the skill bonus and Faster Cast Rate, not having Staves or Wands to adequately fill their weapons slot.\nWhen made in shields, the level requirement of Spirit is misleading for every class except Paladins. While the runes are easy to obtain, getting a shield with 4 sockets may be challenging: the only non-&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; shields that can roll 4 sockets are &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Items\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Monarch\"&gt;Monarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ward\"&gt;Ward&lt;/a&gt; and , none of which can drop early in game and all of which require relatively high character levels. Building this runeword in a weapon is easier, as 4-socket swords can be obtained in late Normal difficulty.\nFor many end-game builds, Spirit is often made in a &lt;a href=\"Monarch\"&gt;Monarch&lt;/a&gt; and is rolled many times to get 35% &lt;a href=\"Faster%20Cast%20Rate\"&gt;Faster Cast Rate&lt;/a&gt;, which is designed to allow most characters to reach a new breakpoint when using standard caster items. Spirit Monarchs are also used as a switch shield to help increase the amount of life and mana the player gets when casting &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Orders\"&gt;Battle Orders&lt;/a&gt; when using the &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20Arms%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Call to Arms Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;, due to being the only shield that bestows +2 to All Skills.

It will work even if player has no Corpse Spiders skill equipped, but then Spider Queen will not be able to be controlled (and will simply move into the closest enemy). It does not attack by itself, only deals damage with webs. The queen leaves a trail of webs, creating a patch every attack period (normally, 1 per second), each patch roughly 20 yards in radius. Damage of the webs is increased by any bonuses that might affect Corpse Spiders. Multiple patches in same location do not stack. The queen is not killable.\nThe second bonus \"adds\" the Toad of Hugeness rune to any other, so each cast of Hex will summon two minions, or summon a Toad and transform the Witch Doctor (with the Angry Chicken). The Witch Doctor \"may\" have more than one Toad of Hugeness at a time, and each, upon summoning, will apply the healing/damage reduction effect properly (though it does not stack, only being refreshed). The Toad will no longer swallow the enemies, but instead will lick them, applying the damaging debuff and &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt;ing them by 60% for the duration.\nThe last bonus is especially deadly when coupled with enhancing items and skills: for instance, for &lt;a href=\"Locust%20Swarm\"&gt;Locust Swarm&lt;/a&gt;, one may combine it with &lt;a href=\"Wormwood\"&gt;Wormwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quetzalcoatl\"&gt;Quetzalcoatl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Creeping%20Death\"&gt;Creeping Death&lt;/a&gt;.

This can be checked easily by just using the skill and standing far from the spirit - you will get the aura anyway. This is also not the \"summon range\", since that is never effectively limited here.

It became playable in the \"&lt;a href=\"Vessel%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Vessel of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, which players will have to purchase in order to play as the class.\nLore.\nRanked amongst the apex predators of the jungle, Spiritborn are members of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt; civilization. They are entwined with ethereal spirits from the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt;. \nAbilities.\nSpiritborn are versatile warriors who fuse devastating three-hit-combo attacks and acrobatic fluidity into a potent display of their ferocity. They are masters of hand-to-hand combat, doling out lethality at close range through the ability to extend their wrath with the aid of spirit energy and their favored demon-slaying implement, the glaive. Their physical prowess allows them to block or dodge incoming strikes, absorbing this power for themselves or redirecting it back at their aggressors. In times of need, Spiritborn will call upon the most suitable &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Guardian\"&gt;Spirit Guardian&lt;/a&gt; for the task at hand, championing their prowess. It is this adaptability, coupled with their devotion to the Guardians, that makes the Spiritborn the agile and flexible jungle warriors they are.\nAs children, prospective Spiritborn are sent into the jungle to be judged by the spirits, in a ritual known as the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20Mists\"&gt;Trial of Mists&lt;/a&gt;. Only a few are deemed worthy to become Spiritborn, and those who are not called by the Spirit Guardians are culled. The chosen children are granted power beyond compare through their unbreakable bonds with the Spirit Guardians, and have a sacred charge to wield their power well.\nSpiritborn can visit the Spirit Realm while alive, although it is a dangerous, honor-laden undertaking usually reserved for elders who\u2019ve mastered every other facet of their skillset. The uninitiated can still experience vestiges of the Spirit Realm in the form of visions or dreams, whispers from the other side of the veil, and unsolicited intuitions.\nCulture.\nThe Spiritborn are a loyal people who endlessly strive to honor their rich traditions, the jungle, and the powerful Spirit Guardians. Spiritborn believe they must devote their lives to Akarat's and &lt;a href=\"Ysevete\"&gt;Ysevete&lt;/a&gt;'s tenants to protect the Spirit Realm, its spirits, and ensure harmony between it and Sanctuary. The highest honor in Spiritborn culture is to have their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; rejoin the Spirit Realm upon their &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Some Spiritborn can travel to the Spirit Realm while alive, though this is seen as an honor-laden and dangerous endeavor, reserved mainly for elders who have mastered every other facet of being a Spiritborn. Those who cannot visit the Spirit Realm itself are instead visited by it and will experience aspects of the Spirit Realm in visions, dreams, whispers from the other side of the veil, and through unsolicited intuitions. Spiritborn believe that if they devote themselves to the Spirit Guardians sufficiently in life, that once they cross the veil after &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, they will become Spirit Guardians themselves.\nIn Spiritborn culture, it is believed that is through one's &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; flows into being, that one's blood carries the voice of one's ancestors, along with their emotions.\nHistory.\nUpon returning to his mother's homeland of Nahantu, Akarat discovered a veil between the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; which was outside the influence of both &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Akarat and &lt;a href=\"Ysevete\"&gt;Ysevete&lt;/a&gt;, a Nahantu native who was his most trusted acolyte, spent many weeks studying the Spirit Realm, and Akarat became the first living being to cross the veil into the realm. Akarat's acolytes would continue to study the Spirit Realm as he resumed his travels throughout Sanctuary, and Akarat himself would return in his twilight years to continue exploring the Spirit Realm.\nWhen Akarat's life was at its end, he made one final crossing into the Spirit Realm. Ysevete's cries of sorrow reached even into the Spirit Realm and she gained the support of the spirits. Ysevete would go on to form the basis for the Spiritborn culture, which was based upon the tenets that Akarat and herself had created.\nWhen the Zakarum became corrupted by Mephisto, Spiritborn rebels buried dead drops of coin and supplies in the deep jungle as part of their efforts to resist the Hatred infecting Nahantu.\nThe Spiritborn were still operating during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; entered &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;, and through the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; containing &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, inadvertently spread the Lord of Hatred's corruption into the river and jungle, killing flora, and leading to the rise of &lt;a href=\"the%20Hollows\"&gt;the Hollows&lt;/a&gt;. Spiritborn engaged in battle with the newly created &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGameplay.\nThe Spiritborn are versatile warriors who call upon the unique strengths of four Spirit Guardians (the Jaguar, Gorilla, Eagle, and Centipede) and can fuse devastating three-hit-combo attacks and acrobatic fluidity into a potent display of their ferocity. The Spiritborn are perhaps the most complex class in the game (as of \"Vessel of Hatred\") in that while most classes tend to focus on a build based around 1/2 skill categories, Spiritborn are designed to be played through mixing and matching skills from all four Spirit Guardians.\nSpiritborn can only use two-handed weapons, and can wield the quarterstaff, polearm, and glaive. They can shift between physical and elemental attacks. &lt;a href=\"Vigor%20%28Resource%29\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt; is the class' primary resource.\nBalazan, the Centipede.\nThe Centipede Spirit Guardian's skills are a manifestation of the inescapable cycle of death, and focus on damage over time, crowd control, debuffs, thorns, healing, and Vulnerability. Centipede skills use the element of Poison.\nKwatli, the Eagle.\nThe Eagle Spirit Guardian's skills are lethal and precise, and focus on movement, enhancing the Evade skill, critical hits, barrier, and Vulnerability. Eagle skills are mid-ranged and use the element of Lightning. The Eagle ultimate skill, The Seeker, is the first ultimate with multiple charges.\nRezoka, the Jaguar.\nThe Jaguar Spirit Guardian's skills are relentless and violent, and focus on aggression, attack speed, killstreaks, critical hits, dodge, and healing. Jaguar skills use the element of Fire and feature a new Class Resource called Ferocity, which provides additional attack speed with each stack.\nWumba, the Gorilla.\nThe Gorilla Spirit Guardian's skills are the embodiment of resilience and retaliation, and focus on defenses, blocking, barrier, dodge, thorns, and retribution. Gorilla skills deal Physical damage and feature a new Class Resource called Resolve, which provides 20% damage reduction while you have a stack. Resolve can stack up to 8 times by default, and taking direct damage will consume a stack.\nSpirit Hall.\nThe Spiritborn's Class Mechanic is the Spirit Hall, which allows the player to choose a Primary and a Secondary Spirit. Primary Spirits provide a unique bonus and tag all of the player's skills as that Spirit Guardian type in addition to their base type. Secondary Spirits provide or enhance a mechanic based on that Spirit Guardian, such as Ferocity stacks from Jaguar or Resolve stacks from Gorilla.\nDevelopment.\nThe positive reception of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;, and later, the &lt;a href=\"Tempest\"&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt;, in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" gave &lt;a href=\"Team%203\"&gt;Team 3&lt;/a&gt; the confidence to commit to creating a new class and experience \"that's not instantly understood as a classic archetype of the D&amp;D world.\" Another reason for choosing the Spiritborn was because of the expansion's Nahantu setting, which led to the creation of a class that fit the game's theme. A third consideration was that the launch classes of \"Diablo IV\" were all pre-existing classes, hence the need for a unique one. By extension, the developers didn't want to reimagine a pre-existing class. One of the main points of making the Spirtborn was that the would be able to make it exactly as they wanted rather than needing to draw from older classes. In this case, they wanted the Spiritborn to excel in hybridization.\nInspiration for the Spiritborn was taken from martials arts and Mesoamerican cultures. While inspiration was taken from said cultures, the developers did not want to \"copy and paste from them.\" While the inspiration is there, it is intended that the Spiritborn be a version of how these cultures would exist in Sanctuary.\nThe developers did not want to create a \"&lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; class\u2014rather than having the Spirit Guardians accompany the Spiritborn, the idea was that they would emerge from the Spiritborn's 'core.' The developers intended that the player's emotions would translate into what the spirits were doing, depicting a sort of back and forth between the human and spiritual sides of the class.\n60 skills were prototyped for the Spiritborn. Some skills were cut, but could be implemented in the future.\nIn October 2023, the alpha build of \"Vessel of Hatred\" was datamined and indicated the existence of the class, which would be nature-themed and use glaives as its primary weapon. The Spiritborn was fully revealed on July 18, 2024. The reveal was met with controversy, as players had been clamoring for a \"sword and board\"-type class since the release of \"Diablo IV\", represented in classes such as the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Spiritborn was first playable at Gamescom 2024."}

The Bestia Acerbus are the descendants of doglike creatures that lived by feeding upon the remains of Baal's nightmarish feasts. The variety of vile substances that the creatures consumed, along with their close proximity to the Lord of Destruction, twisted and warped the viscera of these Hounds of Hell. These quadrupedal creatures are scavengers, able to move with insidious agility, and their armored backs are festooned with scales and ridges.\nSpitting Terrors are capable of spitting up a variety of caustic fluids and projecting them from a considerable distance. Packs of these terrors are especially devastating, as their bile has been known to eat through the strongest of armor and poison the most hearty men. They will move in on their prey that seems weak or crippled.\nGreat care must be taken when within the lair of these Bestia. Their venom retains its potency for a considerable amount of time and puddles of it may be found everywhere. When killed, the beast's inner toxins eat through the now-dead flesh, leaving a dangerous trap for those foolish enough to tread upon the corpse.\nIn-game.\nSpitting Terrors appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\". They can expel bile as a projectile, and are also very nimble and very aggressive in close-quarter combat. These nasty critters can be encountered from the middle levels of the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; all the way up to &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nSpitting Terrors will usually fire their acidic bile from afar. These projectiles deal &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage on impact. In addition, when a bile-projectile hits the ground or any target, it expands into an exploding orb forming a nasty pool of corroding acid. For several seconds after landing this puddle will remain 'active' and deal damage if players step upon it. It is best to kill Spitting Terrors from range in order to avoid exposure to their bile projectiles. They are relatively weak in melee combat and do not possess much &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, so killing them should not be a daunting task. One should be careful fighting in melee against a large group of these foul creatures, however, as they are aggressive and attack relatively fast compared to some of the other denizens of the labyrinth. Also, Spitting Terrors have one more surprise: upon death, their bodily fluids are spilled, producing another acidic puddle which does damage when stepped upon. It's best to wait a few seconds: when the puddle-animation stops, it's safe to move on.\nAll three Unique Spitting Terrors are fast-spitters, which means they spit their magical acid projectiles much faster than other Acid Beasts like a firing machine gun and have mobs with the exact same ability, however they will only spit and never attack using their paws to hit unlike the others fighting melee of this same species. Undoubtedly as a result of this, the mobs in question will flee from melee attackers just like a &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubus&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0would, serving as an annoyance to mentioned attackers."}

Before &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0.1%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, it also offered bonus &lt;a href=\"magic%20find\"&gt;magic find&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts unique legendary power grants a stacking debuff each second increasing damage \"dealt\" by 10% and damage \"taken\" by 5% per stack, reaching the full 10 stacks after 10 seconds.

This power was added in &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.6.6%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.6.6&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaking damage immediately resets the stack count to 0 under most circumstances, but there are some exceptions: some attacks, such as the Blood Springs in Act V do not reset the stacks, even if they do damage. Moreover, damage that occurs after a delay (such as from the &lt;a href=\"Desecrator\"&gt;Desecrator&lt;/a&gt; affix) will only trigger a reset after the damage begins.\nNote that \"taking damage\" means taking damage to &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;.

However, unions between its people and the Northerners were common before the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. The town is surrounded by a tall wooden wall, and has a town square where executions are carried out. The &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Wards\"&gt;Gray Wards&lt;/a&gt; are a dangerous part of the city; a place where one is liable to have their throat slit if they're not careful. \nThe city was originally ruled by a laird.

People begged for access and plotted revolution.\nThe Rage Plague.\nStaalbreak's people came to be afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Plague\"&gt;Rage Plague&lt;/a&gt;. The Barbarians that were infected attacked the town, which led to Constable &lt;a href=\"Staalek\"&gt;Staalek&lt;/a&gt; being infected in the ensuring battle. Consumed with rage and paranoia, he ordered his Barbarian wife executed. His son, &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Staalek\"&gt;Jacob&lt;/a&gt; confronted him, and killed him in the ensuring fight. Jacob was forced to flee, wanted for his father's murder. &lt;a href=\"Varik\"&gt;Varik&lt;/a&gt; took the position of constable. Under Varik, the town descended into a state of paranoia in regards to the Barbarians. When Jacob returned and was strung up, he saw that many of the townspeople bore the mark of the Rage Plague. With the death of &lt;a href=\"Khelric\"&gt;Khelric&lt;/a&gt;, the Rage Plague was lifted, and Staalbreak saved."}

Since there is no way to increase the maximum charges on a staff, this skill should never be used on a staff of higher value.

It limits movement options once it is drained, but recharges when stopped or moving slowly.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"Diablo II\", a character's ability to &lt;a href=\"Running\"&gt;run&lt;/a&gt; is measured by Stamina level, displayed as a yellow bar within the main action bar. The maximum amount of Stamina a character has depends on their &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; as well as some item &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt;es.\nRunning depletes stamina over time at a constant rate. When standing in one spot, including while using skills or attacking, Stamina recovers relatively quickly. Walking does not deplete Stamina, but rather refills it at a slow rate. Some monsters, mostly insects (such as &lt;a href=\"Swarm\"&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt;s), can drain Stamina on each attack, making escape more complicated. When in &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, running does not expend Stamina.\nWhen the bar is nearly depleted, the color changes from yellow to red. When Stamina is completely emptied and the player continues to move, even walking, the stamina bar does not refill. For it to begin, the player must stop moving for a moment, then may begin walking while regaining stamina slowly if they wish. Toggling to \"walk\" before the bar is empty is often the preferred approach.\n&lt;a href=\"Stamina%20Potion\"&gt;Stamina Potion&lt;/a&gt;s refill the bar entirely and give unlimited stamina for a short period of time. Stamina give the player unlimited Stamina for a long period of time. During periods of unlimited Stamina, the bar is colored blue. Drinking from a &lt;a href=\"Well\"&gt;Well&lt;/a&gt; also recovers a large amount of Stamina.\nThe rate of depletion of Stamina depends upon the type of &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; the player wears. Heavy Armor, such as , causes 10% more Stamina loss than Light Armor, such as ; medium armor causes 5% more stamina loss, and light armor does not increase stamina loss at all. Stamina is drained per second, not per distance, therefore having increased &lt;a href=\"movement%20speed\"&gt;movement speed&lt;/a&gt; decreases the cost of Stamina per &lt;a href=\"Yards\"&gt;yard&lt;/a&gt; covered. Moving with skills (such as or ) does not drain Stamina.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; can temporarily increase his Stamina, as well as the Stamina of his party members, by the use of the &lt;a href=\"Vigor\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aura\"&gt;Aura&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, the has the &lt;a href=\"Increased%20Stamina\"&gt;Increased Stamina&lt;/a&gt; skill for permanent Stamina increase. \nStamina plays a lesser role in the game as characters level, thanks to the fact that both character level and the Vitality stat increases it, as well as the availability of gear that decrease stamina depletion rate or increase its regeneration speed. At higher levels, stamina almost never runs out. \nDiablo Immortal.\nIn \"Diablo Immortal\", stamina only applies during a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20War\"&gt;Shadow War&lt;/a&gt; and only to one character. Whoever becomes The &lt;a href=\"Immortal\"&gt;Immortal&lt;/a&gt; gains a Stamina bar. As they move throughout the battlefield, the bar drains, and when fully depleted, the Immortal incurs a movement speed penalty. The stamina bar recharges only when the Immortal stands completely still."}
