Tornadoes would ravage their plains as summer turned to the harvest season. The shaman of the tribe would interpret the tornadoes as an omen of evil during times of peace, and as a harbinger of great victory during wartime. Observing the strength of the whirlwind, these Barbarians learned to emulate the swirling m\u00e9lange of the cyclone in their attacks. As time went on and the tribes intermingled, the ability to attack in the manner of the whirlwind was passed down to all of the Barbarian people. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nWhirlwind is one of the most valued high-level Barbarian skills, as it quickly inflicts massive damage to multiple foes, and has the ability to cut a path through enemies, preventing them from surrounding the Barbarian. However, hits are not automatic, and are subject to &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Attack Rating&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitially, Whirlwind deals reduced damage compared to normal blows, but even against two foes, it is beneficial. Adding new skill points negate this penalty, eventually leading to spinning strikes being more powerful than usual attacks.\nWhirlwind is not channeled; instead, for a fixed cost of 25 Mana, it cuts the path from the current point to the destination, moving in a path as straight as possible, or to the closest available point (if no direct path is available due to impassable obstacles). Until it finishes, no other skills can be used. Destination can be either ground or monster (in latter case, it pursues the fleeing foe).\u00a0Long Weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Spears\"&gt;Spears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Polearms\"&gt;Polearms&lt;/a&gt; make Whirlwind even more effective as it will hit monsters in a wider radius.\u00a0Since Whirlwind consumes a lot of Mana, &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Steal\"&gt;Mana Steal&lt;/a&gt; is highly useful. When high enough, it allows the skill to be used non-stop. &lt;a href=\"Potions\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and any inventory items cannot be used while using Whirlwind.\u00a0\nWhirlwind does not work with: \"On Attack\", \"On Striking\", or \"When You Kill an Enemy\" item properties.\u00a0While under this skill, the user cannot die, but if &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; drops to zero, death occurs when the cast ends. It can be used to advantage (for instance, to Save and Exit before the Whirlwind ends). Whirlwind cannot be interrupted by effects that normally would stop the Barbarian. It is even possible to be stuck in this state, if, for example, target is rapidly escaping the player. &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; attacks have no effect on spinning hero, and &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0does not affect them. Even if the weapon breaks, it breaks only after Whirlwind ends.\nWhirlwind against Players.\nOn Casters, this attack usually deals a lot of damage, and hits often unless the enemy is of a much higher level or has very high defense. However, whirlwind can be tricky to use against ranged opponents due to its predictable speed.\nWeapon Speed.\nWhirlwind is affected by weapon speed. After clicking to start the Whirlwind attack, the game checks for a hit on a target in range at the 4th and 8th animation frames (recall that the game runs at 25 frames per second). After the first two \"free\" hit-checks, the frames elapsed in-between subsequent hit-checks will depend on the weapon speed. Increased &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt; from items outside of the weapon\u00a0does not affect Whirlwind; only the speed of the weapon itself counts.\nThe dependence on weapon speed is obtained by subtracting the weapon's increased attack speed (IAS) to its base weapon speed and checking where the number obtained fits in the table:\nTwo-handed swords are treated as one-handed weapons for Whirlwind purposes, regardless of the sword being held in one-handed or two-handed mode."}

It causes the Barbarian to whirl wildly in a twister of blows, dealing &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage per tick to all enemies within 9 yards. While channeling, the Barbarian is forced to move, and even moves unhindered through enemies, with full &lt;a href=\"movement%20speed\"&gt;movement speed&lt;/a&gt;. Whirlwind does not break &lt;a href=\"Immobilize\"&gt;Immobilize&lt;/a&gt; effects when activated (and cannot be cast while Immobilized), but makes the Barbarian immune to them while channeled. It also appears that whirling Barbarian cannot be affected by &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vortex\"&gt;Vortex&lt;/a&gt;."}

It will next run in &lt;a href=\"Season%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 32, from October 25 to November 1, 2024.\nGameplay.\nWild Brawl is a battle royale-esque gameplay event that takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;. Four teams of six players start at &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 1 and work together to explore an expansive map and endure to become the last surviving team. Players can level up, equip gear, and must slay everything in sight to win the battle. Set Gear and Normal Gems equipped prior to battle will not be available in battle, but each player starts the match with &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gear\"&gt;Legendary Gear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt; equipped at reduced power. Earn access to higher level gear by ranking up equipped gear through slaying &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s and other players, or by finding treasure and looting defeated rivals for their Legendary Gear. Players can level up by killing monsters and enemy players, along with increasing the power of their equipped gear and gems. &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Chests&lt;/a&gt; can also be found that contain increasingly powerful items, and &lt;a href=\"shrines%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;shrines&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the deepest reaches of the forest.\nAs the match progresses, unstable darkness encroaches on the wood, forcing all players to fight in an ever-shrinking space. Being caught in the darkness will cause a player to slowly lose &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. The match ends when one team is remains. Fallen players can spectate, or choose to leave immediately.\nTo initiate Wild Brawl, a player must talk to &lt;a href=\"Roater\"&gt;Roater&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20Overlook\"&gt;Immortal Overlook&lt;/a&gt;. Roater provides the option to review the rules of engagement for the Wild Brawl, or the option to continue straight to the Wild Brawl event. Once a match has been secured, players will decide on which area bodes best for their hunt. Players can see their allies' selected teleport spot to make tactical decisions as to where to enter the Dark Wood.\nThe event has its own leaderboards.\nHistory.\nWild Brawl first ran from August 8 to August 23, 2023. It also ran from October 20 to 27 the same year, and has been on the rotating event schedule since."}

Mindless, Willowisps seek out the energy contained in all living things and enjoy ambushing good creatures. While not evil in nature, their feeding habits make them a serious threat to adventurers.\nThough they must manifest to attack, Willowisps project a vague, ghostly presence even when incorporeal. When they do manifest, Willowisp attack with either their claws or &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;. As long as they are manifest, they are vulnerable to corporeal forms of attack. \nIn-game.\nWillowisps are encountered in and of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", specifically in the &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; jungles in the former act, and also in , as &lt;a href=\"Guest%20Monsters\"&gt;guest monsters&lt;/a&gt;. When they move around they are virtually invisible, save for a tiny light radius. Before they attack, they become visible again. Willowisps attack in large packs and use spells. In large packs they can easily confound players and zap them down before even a single Willowisp is killed.\nIt is best to have some &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Resistance\"&gt;Lightning Resistance&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0when fighting these monsters, along with a large amount of life. As with many enemies, though their attack is powerful they do not have a lot of &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. Willowisps also drain &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; when attacking.\nDue to a bug, their ranged attacks deal additional damage (their melee attack damage added to the spell), making them iconic tough enemies on high difficulties.\nIt is highly recommended to wear gear like or &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20Projector\"&gt;Wisp Projector&lt;/a&gt; to help stay alive. They are extremely dangerous, especially for &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; players. A monster pack with the &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; aura is one of the hardest boss packs in the game. &lt;a href=\"Dim%20Vision\"&gt;Dim Vision&lt;/a&gt; skill is a great help to prevent unexpected death from afar.\nTheir &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Uniques&lt;/a&gt; don't use random colors because of their base lack of color (&lt;a href=\"Gloam\"&gt;Gloam&lt;/a&gt;) that can't be color swapped.\nDevelopment.\nWillowisps have an unused golden color palette."}

Until then, perfect sapphires in armor or helms, items that give mana per kill. mana leech or items that regenerate mana will help.\nSkills.\nA player can diversify a bit and add a few summons if they feel they want to keep the mobs at bay a little more, especially with skill bonus items:\nItems.\nWeapons.\nCreatures which are both cold and physical immune are not very common, but it does happen enough to be a nuisance. If Infinity is considered a problem to construct because it is expensive, items which produce &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt; effects might be worth looking into for either the druid or the mercenary. Wands can have Lower Resistance charges, Items like &lt;a href=\"The%20Vile%20Husk\"&gt;The Vile Husk&lt;/a&gt; and can have those effects as procs. There would still be a matter of having those effects activate in a timely manner, however.\nHireling.\nAlthough many players solo with their characters, Hirelings can certainly increase the survivability of any character if maintained properly. Typically, most choose the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Act 2 Defensive Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; in Nightmare Difficulty (the \"Holy Freeze Merc\") or the Offensive version (the \"Might Merc\"), but the others have plenty of potential if geared properly. The Helmet and Armor are standard choices, the only thing that would vary are the weapons. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Act 3 Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; with cold attacks used to be popular, but are rare now due to many monsters being immune to their attacks. Although &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarian Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are quite rugged, they can be overcome by large mobs. On the other hand, properly equipped, he can definitely play a major factor in increasing the character's survivability. And the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt;s should not be counted out either, although without particular gear her ability to assist in later stages of the game diminishes by quite a bit. Although the weapons vary, the armor and helmet choices are mostly stock, with some variance in regards to armor.\nWeapon.\nBarbarians (Act 5).\nThere are numerous swords that a Barbarian can use that listing them all would be impractical. Here are four uniques and four runewords particularly beneficial to them:\nTactics.\nThe usual tactic is summon any minions you have, activate Cyclone Armor and combine Tornado and Twister if the monsters are immune to Cold. Tornado and Twister are difficult to aim, and you may want to be quite close to your foe when firing them off. If the monsters are immune to Physical, combine Hurricane and Artic Blast for addition damage. For other monsters, combine Hurricane and Tornado for massive damage.\nA common tactic for PvP to use is Teleport to jump on top of your opponent and shred them with the Hurricane and Tornadoes/Twisters (Twisters is preferable for PvP as they have a stun effect, and Naj's Puzzler, Steelspell or an amulet with Teleport charges if Enigma should be out of reach), the slow from the Holy Freeze aura and the lowered resistances from Infinity.

After the Wanderer reported that the demon in question was &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, Vigo opened the mines and the trio entered.\nAfter the events, where Lilith killed the knights stationed in the mine, Reverend Mother &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt; appointed a new watch commander, and ordered them to replace the forces they lost in the mine.\nIn-game.\nThe entrance to the zone is located at &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Hill\"&gt;Pine Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Passing through the mines will take players to &lt;a href=\"Kasama\"&gt;Kasama&lt;/a&gt;. To gain entry, one must play through the &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line. On a first playthrough, players must take the right path through the mines to descend to the lower level, passing through the &lt;a href=\"Condemned%20Mines\"&gt;Condemned Mines&lt;/a&gt;. Later, they must use the mine's ore hoist on the left path. They can jump down to the Zeleny Lowlands as well in the right side of the mines."}

Using infernal abilities granted to them through their arcane pact, they formed small bat winged imps that they believed would prove useful in carrying out deeds that were too trivial for their own efforts. Each of the sorcerers created an entity that reflected his magical specialization. The creatures thus created were small, nimble and possessed an unnatural cunning.\"\n\"At first the corrupt sorcerers were overjoyed at the success of their experiment, but they soon began to notice that the Alae did not serve them as loyally as they had hoped. The creatures had taken to secretly feeding from the very essence of their masters, weakening them and eventually killing them. The sorcerers tried to destroy their creations, but the fiends banded together to combat them. The Winged Fiends had been secretly breeding outside of the sorcerer's domains, and swarms of them attacked, killing their former masters. To this day, the descendants of these creations terrorise the countryside.\"\n\"Do not underestimate these foul demons. They are physically weak, but possess great speed. Many of them possess unearthly abilities reflecting the powers of their creators and they also enjoy using their razor sharp claws and hooked wings to tear the flesh from the faces of their victims.\""}

This is most useful to prevent the enemy from escaping their doom, or from chasing down a hero willing to run with their life. It can also be used to kite the enemy without leaving combat, giving the advantage and keeping the victim at safe range.\nChill.\nChill is a special form of Slow, triggered by &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; attacks and Cold-related skills only. In both games,\u00a0\"any\u00a0\"Cold damage may trigger Chill. Chilled targets are blue in color and move (and sometimes attack) much slower. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt; that paralyzes the target completely, Chill only slows the victim down. General rule is that a Slow effect applied by a Cold skill will most likely count as Chill. Another way to determine it is to look at the color: blue or light blue coverage (like that of Freeze effect) will mean a definite Chill.\nDiablo II.\nIn Diablo II, Slow can happen\u00a0due to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0attacks,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Aura,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Curse,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt;'s slowing attack, items with \"Slows Target By X%\" and Cold Skills. Even monsters that are immune to Cold can be slowed.\u00a0Cast rate is not affected by Slow. \nSlowing has two main types: non-elemental Slow and Chill.\nDiablo Immortal.\nChill is a special form of &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt; used by the player and monsters in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". It is caused by &lt;a href=\"cold\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; attacks. When used by the player, it is accompanied by &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt;. Some monster cold attacks also cause DoT, in addition to chill. When stacked up to times, the player &lt;a href=\"freeze\"&gt;freeze&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDiablo III.\nIn Diablo III, Slow and Chill are again separate effects. Chill can happen only due to Cold skills and Cold damage, but always has a small chance to trigger on non-player targets, even if no equipped items have the \"chance to Slow on hit\" affix. Many &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Runes\"&gt;Skill Runes&lt;/a&gt; that change the damage type to Cold also add a chance, or a guaranteed Chill or Freeze. Consequently, being immune to Cold damage is guaranteed to protect the target from Chill, but has no effect on non-elemental Slow. Slow is also common, and affects both players and monsters. For example, &lt;a href=\"Spiders\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt; leave pools of web that slow the players stepping on them by 60%.\nThere are three types of Slow: 30%, 60% and 80%. They stack, but cannot go over 80% at any time. The monsters' CC resistance does not change Slow duration, but reduces its potency, to a minimum of 5%. Some effects, like &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt;, reduce not only the enemy's movement speed, but the &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt; as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Elites\"&gt;Elites&lt;/a&gt; also have innate 25% reduction to Slow effects on movement speed and 65% reduction to attack speed penalties. The\u00a0\"reduces duration of control impairing effects\u00a0\"affixes on players' items reduce the duration, but players cannot reduce the potency of Slow effects.\nChilled enemies do not give a chance to shatter anymore (but &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s from Cold attacks do). Chill and Slow count as single type of CC for the purpose of CC resistance, and most\u00a0effects that require the target to be Slowed to trigger do so regardless of whether it is a common Slow or Chill. However, in some very rare circumstances, such effects may specifically require the target to be Chilled: &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Blooded\"&gt;Cold Blooded&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frostburn%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Frostburn&lt;/a&gt; are examples of that.\n&lt;a href=\"Immobilize\"&gt;Immobilize&lt;/a&gt; can be considered the extreme variant of Slow, just as &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt; is an extreme degree of Chill. However, Slow and Immobilize effects do not stack, do not override each other, and are not interchangeable for all purposes.\nDiablo IV.\nChill returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", as a class mechanic, also used to a lesser degree by . Unlike the previous incarnation, it stacks with every application, until it turns the foe &lt;a href=\"Frozen\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt; at 100% slowdown, and after death, &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;shatters them and leaves no corpse&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternatively, Sorceress may acquire an &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Winter\"&gt;Endless Winter&lt;/a&gt; talent which adds 30% &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt; chance against Chilled and Frozen enemies, but Chill will no longer become Freeze from repeated applications."}

One aspect of this ability is her knack for avoiding missile fire. Just as the Amazon must master the bow and javelin, she must also learn to defend herself from these same weapons. When an Amazon uses this ability, incoming projectiles appear to move slower than normal, enabling her to avoid them.\"\nGeneral Information.\nAs its name suggests, this spell slows incoming missile attacks: for as long as the spell lasts, all missiles coming into its range will fly slower until they are out of the area of effect. The area is always around the Amazon, and moves with her.\u00a0Slow Missile reduces both the\u00a0speed\u00a0\"and\" the\u00a0damage of projectiles.\nThe usefulness of this skill is debatable. Slow Missiles can, for instance, come in handy in large parts of &lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt; where\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fetish\"&gt;Fetish&lt;/a&gt; blow-darts are common. It can also come in handy in PvP situations. \nAdding points into this ability lengthens the duration linearly, but missile speed and damage reduction with diminishing returns. Usually it's best to just spend one point in Slow Missiles as a prerequisite for &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis skill may backfire horribly on the player if used against MSLE monsters, however. Due to the game engine only able to render a finite number of missiles, having too many of them slowed on screen will make some missiles invisible and thus harder to avoid.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 5\nRadius: 18 yards"}

It resembles the classic &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Missiles\"&gt;Slow Missiles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nIn-game.\nSlow Time creates a 20-yard radius sphere (commonly known as 'bubble') anywhere within 60 yards from the Wizard, at the cursor's location, but within line of sight (ignoring enemies and most obstacles). The sphere &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt;s enemy &lt;a href=\"missiles\"&gt;projectiles&lt;/a&gt; within itself by 90% (damage of the projectiles does \"not\" change), and enemies' &lt;a href=\"movement%20speed\"&gt;movement speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt; is reduced as long as they remain within the area.\nIf the Wizard dies, the sphere does not disappear. The Wizard may summon as many Slow Time spheres at once as they can hold, but multiple spheres in the same area do not stack.\nMultiple Slow Time spheres (from different Wizards) intersecting with each other will not stack either, but multiple spheres with \"different skill runes\" will grant all rune effects at once.\n&lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; will use this ability against players in combat. Same for the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Clone\"&gt;Shadow Clone&lt;/a&gt;s of the Wizard spawned by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Realm of Terror&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Monsters\"&gt;Rare Monsters&lt;/a&gt; may have an affix called &lt;a href=\"Missile%20Dampening\"&gt;Missile Dampening&lt;/a&gt;, which works very similarly to Slow Time sphere.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; is used, the copies will cast Slow Time centered on themselves when engaging with the enemy.\nOnly the actual projectiles are slowed by the sphere. Grenades, torrents, beams, Mortar affix bombs and other ordnance missiles are not affected.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; spell of same name and similar functions benefits from most enhancements and runes that your regular Slow Time might have, including\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Crown of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; that gives the effect of all runes at once.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally the sphere was summoned at the Wizard's location, but as of patch 2.2.0, it may be summoned at the cursor's location if needed. Previously only a Time and Space rune allowed to place Slow Time at a targeted location."}

Generally, sockets refer to 'holes' in items that can be used to insert other special items in those, thereby adding their properties to the properties of the item that holds the sockets. Socketing (or to socket) refers to the process of performing the named action.\nA socketable item means both an item that has sockets and an item that can be inserted into a socket.\n&lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; socket Recipes for magic and rare items :\n&lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; socket Recipes for white items (base for runewords) (NOT &lt;a href=\"Low-quality\"&gt;Low-quality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Superior%20Items\"&gt;Superior&lt;/a&gt; or socketed):\n1 &lt;a href=\"Hel%20Rune\"&gt;Hel&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Scroll of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; + Socketed Item = Remove Gems, Jewels, and Runes from Socketed item\nLow quality item (Crude), after repair in Cube (any Item properties are removed/re-rolled) have \nLow-quality item, after recovery in Cube with Eld Rune (Weapon) or El Rune (Armor) + Chipped Gem (any type) = normal (standard) quality, but iLVL=1 (can have minimal sockets), loke:\nNoun.\nA socket is a placeholder for &lt;a href=\"Gems\"&gt;Gems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jewels\"&gt;Jewels&lt;/a&gt;. These 3 kind of items won't have effects unless you place them into a &lt;a href=\"%23verb\"&gt;Socket&lt;/a&gt; in the item. In the User Interface you will see grey circles. The number of grey circles on the item corresponds with the number of sockets it has. Each socket may only hold one socketable item. Names of socketable items are displayed in gray, and some &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt; may have sockets as affixes.\nThe number of sockets per item type is limited (up to 6 in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;\"Diablo II\"&lt;/a&gt; and up to 3 in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;\"Diablo III\"&lt;/a&gt;). In \"Diablo II\", the maximum number of sockets depends on the level of the monster that dropped the item: most of the time, up to 3 sockets at &lt;a href=\"Normal\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt;, up to 5 at &lt;a href=\"Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and up to 6 at &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;; items can never have more sockets than the number of tiles they occupy in the &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt; (that is, 1x2 and 1x3 smaller weapons are limited to 2 and 3 sockets, whereas 2x3 and 2x4 weapons can have up to 6).\nThe sockets are a way of customizing your gear, putting the bonuses of your choice. Many socketable items change their effect depending on what item type they are socketed into (weapon, armor, helm, off-handed item). Runes are a special type, as they can form &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt; if socketed into a proper item in the correct order; while it is possible to use them as Gems, the effect of several runes is always much weaker than that of the combined Rune Word. Jewels always grant the same effect regardless of the item type, so one can gain, for example, bonus &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage\"&gt;Fire Damage&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;, or increased Chance To &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Helms\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of socketable items (numbers in parentheses show maximum number of sockets possible):\nOnce the item is socketed, it may be unsocketed (i.e. the gem, jewel or rune may be extracted, leaving the socket vacant for a new socketable item). In Diablo II, you will need to use a &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;, losing the old gem (rune, jewel) in the process. In Diablo III, the &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Shen\"&gt;Jeweler&lt;/a&gt; can take care of that, which will clear the sockets and return gems to the player; originally he did so for a fee, but in later versions, this was changed to free of charge. Alternatively, the socketed item may be &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%20Eamon\"&gt;salvaged&lt;/a&gt;, returning the socketed gems to the owner for free, but destroy the item in process.\n&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt; can only be inserted into &lt;a href=\"Rings\"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amulets\"&gt;Amulets&lt;/a&gt;. The only exceptions are &lt;a href=\"Gem%20of%20Ease\"&gt;Gem of Ease&lt;/a&gt;, which must be socketed into &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Red Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;, which must be socketed into &lt;a href=\"helms\"&gt;helms&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving socket(s) counts as one affix for an item (always one property, regardless of the number of gems). In Diablo III, it is always a Primary property. &lt;a href=\"Ramaladni%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Ramaladni's Gift&lt;/a&gt; can be used to grant a Socket to a weapon that does not have one.\nVerb.\nSocketing is the act of placing socketable items (see above) in the item. You use the mouse to drag the Rune, Gem or Jewel you wish to socket to the item you want it to have. Socketing does not require any special actions, but unsocketing (see above) does.\nCare is advised when moving gems and runes around the inventory, for a misclick may cause an act of socketing to the wrong item."}

It is also much tougher than the Carrion Vine, having 165 Health Points at Level 1.\nThe usefulness of the Creeper is situational, based on the Druid build the player is using. If they are prone to using a great deal of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Skills\"&gt;Elemental Skills&lt;/a&gt;, then the Creeper will help to take the sting out of their constantly-disappearing Mana pool. The amount of mana given by the Creeper is a percentage of the Druid's total Mana. At Level 1, the vine returns a meager 4% of total mana per corpse.\nThe Creeper has a secondary effect that makes it valuable both for PvM and PvP combat: Corpse Denial. Keeping dead bodies away from the enemy prevents them from being &lt;a href=\"Revive\"&gt;Revive&lt;/a&gt;d, &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Exploded&lt;/a&gt;, or assimilated by enemy &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Vine\"&gt;Carrion Vine&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"Solar%20Creeper\"&gt;Solar Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s.

They were known for their horses.\nEarly Battles.\nThe Sons of Rakkis were formed in the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231045\"&gt;1045&lt;/a&gt;, by order of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tassara\"&gt;Tassara&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. Wary of &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;'s growing popularity within the empire, he declared &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Crusade\"&gt;a crusade&lt;/a&gt; to \"enlighten\" the West of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Tassara reasoned that if Rakkis failed, he would lose much of his popularity. If he succeeded, the emperor could reap the benefits. Rakkis accepted the task, and the emperor granted him nearly a third of Kehjistan's standing military. The \"Sons of Rakkis\" were thus formed, and Rakkis and his men sailed across the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; to the West.\nThe fleet landed at &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; and Rakkis moved his forces out. Their first opponent was &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28Country%29\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, which at the time, held sway over portions of &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt; and the northern deserts of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Across the dunes, the two sides clashed in a series of one-sided engagements, the Sons claiming easy victory. The &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt; were masters of desert warfare, and they crushed Ivgorod's forces at every turn. After their first losses to Rakkis's army, Ivgorod's legendary breaching towers were converted to mass pyres.\nIvgorod and the Northern Steppes.\nThe Sons moved north through the &lt;a href=\"Tamoe%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;Tamoe Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt; into Ivgorod proper, and the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. In both cases, the Sons suffered setbacks. In the case of Ivgorod, its forests and mountains were much better suited to Ivgorod's style of warfare, and it was here that the &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monks of Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; were unleashed upon the Sons. Both steel and faith clashed, and while Ivgorod would never recover from Rakkis's crusade, the Sons were forced to turn back.\nIn the Northern Steppes, the Sons had similar setbacks. While the s lost control of much of the West,the Sons were never able to conquer the Northern Steppes. The Sons pulled back to &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which had been constructed to guard against enemy counterattacks. Morale is said to have been low, but Rakkis himself wasn't dissuaded. He believed that victory was his destiny, and gave speeches about his \"rightous cause,\" about the destined ascendancy of Zakarum, and rallied the soldiers for the next leg of their campaign.\nThe Conquest of Westmarch.\nIn the far west, nine warring clans existed around the southern edge of what is now called the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Gulf of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Rakkis knew that their disunity was a disadvantage, but also knew that launching his armies against them would unify the clans into a larger force. Instead, Rakkis lived among them, learning the clans' culture, language, and of their gods. All the while subtly spreading the Zakarum faith to anyone who would listen. Through an arranged marriage, Rakkis bound himself by blood to the &lt;a href=\"Ortal%20Clan\"&gt;Ortal Clan&lt;/a&gt;, the third-largest of the seven clans. Using his new standing, he was able to bring four of the lesser clans under his banner.\nAfterwards, Rakkis led his combined forces against the &lt;a href=\"Hathlan%20Clan\"&gt;Hathlan&lt;/a&gt;, the largest and most hostile clan. Through a series of bloody battles, the Hathlan's army was dismantled and its leader slain. With this victory, the remaining clans pledged themselves to Rakkis and declared him their king; but even as Rakkis assumed dominion, he rallied his subjects with talk of mankind's inner Light and glory. It was his strength and conviction that truly unified the clans of the far-West into a single kingdom. In honor of his long campaign, Rakkis named the new land &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, so named as it marked the westernmost point of his conquest.\nLater History.\nThe Sons of Rakkis rooted out the followers of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Astrogha\"&gt;Astrogha&lt;/a&gt; in the region.\nThe Sons later became defunct within Westmarch. However, they left their mark. The wolf sigil was adopted by the &lt;a href=\"Rakkis%20Dynasty\"&gt;Rakkis Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, and even after its succession by the &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20Dynasty\"&gt;Justinian Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, the hallmarks of the Rakkis Dynasty remained. Many in Westmarch bore the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of the Sons of Rakkis.\nSentinel's Watch.\nThe splinter of the Sons of Rakkis remained active centuries later at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt;. The Sons manned the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Sentinel's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which stood guard over a nearby village. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the outpost came under attack by &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;."}

Sorcerers have developed a greater understanding of spellcasting when compared to the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, which is in the form of enchanted &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"elixirs\"&gt;elixirs&lt;/a&gt;.

They are the game's most effective spell casters. Since they have the highest maximum &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28attribute%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; out of all the character classes, they can effectively use the high-end spells. These high-end spells require more than just a level-one proficiency. With the sorcerer's naturally high &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt;, the class can use spells repeatedly, and the class has the highest casting rate out of any other classes.\nStaff Recharge Spell.\nThe Sorcerer's skill should be used in moderation. Recharging a staff can be handy for saving gold, but every time the staff is recharged, the max number of charges is lowered by 1. This is inadvisable if you have a lot of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, or in higher &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; levels, where it is good to have more charges on your staves.\nBuilds.\nThere are two distinct playstyles for the sorcerer. One is Artillery Mage, which sacrifice AC on equip for extra spell level bonuses (typically &lt;a href=\"Naj%27s%20Light%20Plate%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Naj's Light Plate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thinking%20Cap\"&gt;Thinking Cap&lt;/a&gt; and either an Arch-Angel's staff or &lt;a href=\"Dreamflange\"&gt;Dreamflange&lt;/a&gt; with shield). The other is Tank Mage, which is more defensive, using high AC armor and helm (typically &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Circlet\"&gt;Royal Circlet&lt;/a&gt; and an Awesome Plate with a good suffix) along with Dreamflange and shield. For either of these Dreamflange can be substituted for &lt;a href=\"Civerb%27s%20Cudgel%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Civerb's Cudgel&lt;/a&gt; for taking down triple immunes. It is also advised that your items have the +attribute bonus or +magic bonus because that will help a lot.\nBecause of how immensely powerful the sorcerer is in almost every way, even in effective vitality with Mana Shield, many players began playing variants. Arguably, one of the most famous is Beyond Naked Mage (or BNM for short). The rules are fairly simple: the BNM must only use equipment which will negatively affect his stats.\nDevelopment.\nA class called the magician existed in the original design document for Diablo. The magician would have the perk of being able to cast more powerful spells, and would choose from one of four schools of magic."}

Some Lightning spells, with the right talents, leave behind a ball of energy that can be collected (not unlike &lt;a href=\"Health%20Globe\"&gt;Health Globe&lt;/a&gt;), restoring some &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; (25 by default).\n&lt;a href=\"Chill\"&gt;Chill&lt;/a&gt; works in a distinct way for Sorcerer: multiple casts of Cold spells on the same target stack the slowdown. Upon reaching 100%, the enemy will be &lt;a href=\"Frozen\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt; for the remaining duration.\nFire spells often place the Burning effect on enemies, dealing &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Over%20Time\"&gt;Damage Over Time&lt;/a&gt; and, with the related talents, providing additional effects.\nAs a Sorcerer, &lt;a href=\"Primary%20stat\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; increases skill damage, Dexterity grants critical chance, and Willpower hastens mana recovery. \nEnchantment.\nThe Sorcerer utilizes an Enchantment system as a unique class mechanic. With this system, Sorcerer skills can be placed into any of the six active skill slots (that every other class also has access to), or three Enchantment slots, for a total of 9 different skills.\nIf the player places a skill in the Enchantment slot, they can no longer use it as an active skill, but the character instead gains a passive or semi-passive secondary bonus power related to this skill. Known effects include:\nSkills that are already passive by nature cannot be placed into Enchantment slots."}

Despite this disadvantage, they are considered one of the best, if not the best, PvP class due to their ability to move quickly across the map with ation and ranged attacks, which makes them ideal for Hit-and-Run tactics.\nCommon Sorceress builds.\nThe most popular builds are the Frozen Orb, Fire Ball &amp; Blizzard sorceress in both single-player and multi-player and are argubly the most effective builds of this class. Most, if not all Sorceress builds use the &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Shield\"&gt;Energy Shield&lt;/a&gt; &amp; skills for protection and fast movement.\nUnlike other builds, Sorceress builds are highly dependent on mana &lt;a href=\"synergies\"&gt;synergies&lt;/a&gt; to do damage. A Blizzard Sorceress or Chain Lightning Sorceress will most likely put almost all their points into Cold and Lightning spells respectively, to increase the damage of their apex spells, whereas spells like Enchant, Frozen Orb, Fire Wall, or &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Storm\"&gt;Thunder Storm&lt;/a&gt; all have little to no synergies, making them easy to use effectively in combination with other spells. &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Spells\"&gt;Cold Spells&lt;/a&gt; Sorceresses are arguably the most powerful of the three elemental build-types, due to &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Mastery\"&gt;Cold Mastery&lt;/a&gt;'s -% Cold Resistance.

They can be used as catalysts in some processes, and skilled &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s are able to manipulate a soul directly, putting its energy to use.\nPractitioners of &lt;a href=\"Skatsim\"&gt;Skatsim&lt;/a&gt; refer to the soul as \"the essential\". They believe that it is a source of energy that is created when a person is born, subsumed throughout their life, and reborn upon &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of the flesh. They also believe that the soul could go, see, and even dwell in places the flesh could not; only if it was given a connection to the beyond, and a means of returning.\nWith the proper tools, a soul may be separated from flesh. Souls may be stored in objects, and can be split apart. Human souls can be used to empower objects through certain means. Part of a soul may be torn away from its greater whole, leaving the victim still alive. &lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt; can be extracted from souls. \nThrough &lt;a href=\"Resurrect%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;resurrection&lt;/a&gt;, a soul may be returned to the body of the deceased, but must be performed at the deceased's body. Additionally, Necromancers may summon spirits to inhabit bodies.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; may exist without a soul. &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; was able to create &lt;a href=\"the%20Eternal%20Guardian\"&gt;the Eternal Guardian&lt;/a&gt; using coalesced souls.\nAngel Souls.\nAngels, in theory, have some kind of essence that would allow absorption by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; in a manner similar to &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\u00a0Each angel is a manifestation of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;'s power. A deceased angel is effectively reborn through the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt; as a manifestation of this power, but the reborn angel is a different individual from the one preceding it.\nThe only two (known) angels to ever break that pattern are &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. Izual's spirit was bound to a creature of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, and he took on demonic traits, including the ability to be reborn in Hell. No replacement for Izual came from the Arch. Tyrael was able to regain physical form after his destruction at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; and return to Heaven on his own accord, an event that was without precedent.\nWhen angels die, sometimes a burst of light (in rare cases it is of humanoid form), can be seen being released from their broken bodies.\nDemon Souls.\nThe souls of demons are always reborn in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; have souls capable of being stored in &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHuman Souls.\nEvery human has a soul, and &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; likewise possess them. Their souls appear to be fundamentally different compared to those of angels and demons. &lt;a href=\"Mendeln%20ul-Diomed\"&gt;Mendeln ul-Diomed&lt;/a&gt; suspected that this is part of why angels and demons fear and covet humanity in equal measure.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, when a human dies \"before they are ready,\" their soul, strong or weak, will try to cling to the mortal realm. Devoid of concious thought, their continued existence is a scream of denial. They care for nothing for their own lingering rage. Some angry spirits will cling to any corpse that has its muscles and sinew intact, puppeteering them in a macabre imitation of life.\nVarious cults have stated that the souls of virtuous humans are rewarded in &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; while the souls of wicked sinners are punished in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; noted there was little evidence for this belief. He believed that human souls passed on to an unknown location, beyond the reach of Heaven or Hell. That said, the souls of the most ruthless, hate-filled and aggressive soldiers of mortal wars often come to reside in Hell, residing in fires of eternal punishment. A human soul may be reborn in Hell as a demon, provided that they have the patronage of a demonic lord. Souls tortured in Hell have manifested in Sanctuary in the form of &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; believe that the souls of the departed enter the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Unformed Land&lt;/a&gt; and become spirits. The &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; believe that when one dies, their soul passes to the next plane of existence, where they will carry out a role in maintaining the &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt;. Malthael found that by following the 'sound' of human souls, he discovered that they had come to reside in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; (or perhaps more specifically, the former resting place of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. The souls in the fortress were later bound there and used to amplify his power, before &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; defeated him, apparently allowing the souls to move on.\nHuman souls are malleable. Both the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"darkness\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt; that are found within can be used to empower weapons, and a human soul can inhabit armor and weapons. Parts of a human soul can be torn away, while the greater whole of the soul remains intact. This soul can be 'mended' by taking from the souls of others. &lt;a href=\"Succubi\"&gt;Succubi&lt;/a&gt; have the ability to extract human souls and take them to Hell. Some human souls are said to be stronger than others. Very rarely, perhaps twice every ten millennia, there is a human soul so full of life that death cannot claim it. If the human perishes, they return to walk the world of the living. This is not the same thing as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Only two individuals are known to have this gift (or curse), one of them being &lt;a href=\"Siggard\"&gt;Siggard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe nature of a human's soul apparently has a relationship with the human's lifespan. For instance, nobles of the &lt;a href=\"Fahiran%20Empire\"&gt;Fahiran Empire&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"dark%20magic\"&gt;dark magic&lt;/a&gt; to forge necrosis-warding threads that breathe longevity into their spirits, making them effectively immortal.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Spiritborn\"&gt;Spiritborn&lt;/a&gt; culture, it is believed that is through one's &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; flows into being.\nOther.\n&lt;a href=\"Khazra\"&gt;Khazra&lt;/a&gt; possess souls.\nSouls can physically manifest in the &lt;a href=\"mortal%20realm\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt; in the form of &lt;a href=\"Wraith\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s. Spirits also exist outside Sanctuary\u2014some materials act as a beacon for them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Soul\"&gt;Primordial Soul&lt;/a&gt; came into existence before the beginning of time.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are said to possess souls."}

Only the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Maiden\"&gt;Death Maiden&lt;/a&gt;s had power to operate these constructs, and even they could not create more in the field. Visually, Crucibles appeared as black orbs sucking in energy, with twisted, agonized faces of tormented &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s periodically emerging from their surface, only to be drawn back inside.\nCrucibles varied in size and power, with the smallest ones connected to the so-called Master Crucibles. If a Master Crucible was destroyed, the Death Maidens would not be able to create more (according to &lt;a href=\"Myriam%20Jahzia\"&gt;Myriam Jahzia&lt;/a&gt;, at least). Crucibles were, in fact, soul traps, absorbing and storing the soul energy from nearby corpses and surroundings, leaving nothing but soulless husks.

Numerous Crucibles were deployed in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nLarger soul energy vaults could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jamella\"&gt;Jamella&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that Soul Crucibles had limited capacity, and were to be emptied into the vaults (Soul Prisons) when full.

The seasonal Soul Shards would later emulate this concept with another shard for Diablo (the &lt;a href=\"Sliver%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Sliver of Terror&lt;/a&gt;), and expand it with two other head-socketed gem-like shards for the other two &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s as well as weapon-socketed shards for the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;, although these shards are not actually Legendary Gems.\n&lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Items%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Ethereal Items&lt;/a&gt; of Season 24 had affixes similar to those that would appear on Soul Shards in the subsequent season. The Soul Shard concept made the affixes more versatile by making them socketable on any weapon or helm, rather than being bound to a particular weapon.\nThe Soul Shards themselves were introduced as the unique mechanic for the Season 25 theme, \"The Lords of Hell\". This was the first of the seasonal themes to be repeated, in Season 30."}

Originally, a trio were created to contain the essence of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. While they were successful in this regard, they were eventually corrupted by the same entities they had once imprisoned, making the Evils even stronger. They are considered separate from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nAll soulstones (bar the Black Soulstone) were created from shards of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Each soulstone needs to be attuned to the demon to be sealed before it can be used. This is done using traces of the demon's &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; (or that of a closely related demon) extracted from objects bearing its corruption. Once this is done, the color of the soulstone changes to match that of the essence of the demon to be sealed. When a demon is sealed within it, the soulstone glows with an inner light. \nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;'s observations, soulstones are attuned to non corporeal beings and have no power over living, breathing creatures. They emit a powerful spiritual vacuum when invoked and entities caught in the field are drawn into the crystal recesses to be trapped forever. Only the destruction or deactivation of a soulstone can release the entity sealed within. Fragments of a destroyed soulstone mirror the properties of the greater whole, though at reduced effectiveness. However, the diminished effectiveness can be augmented by a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; body.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; expressed his mistrust for soulstones, stating that they offer nothing more than a temporary illusion of control over the powers of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nThe original soulstones were created by the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; in order to contain the spirits of the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; when they were &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;exiled&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Three soulstones were fashioned, each of them a shard of the Worldstone. Their colors were sapphire, amber, and crimson; they would be used to bind &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The task of using these stones to bind the Prime Evils was entrusted to the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, and of their number, it was &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; who bore them (who would eventually go on to create &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;a darker yet similar weapon&lt;/a&gt; of his own). Because the soulstones were inexplicably attuned to the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' essence, the Horadrim were able to track each evil down.\nMephisto was the first evil to be captured, and his soulstone was entrusted to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, who buried his soulstone under the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Baal was second, though his intended soulstone was shattered in the effort to capture him. This left the Horadrim in a precarious position, as there was not enough time to reformulate the soulstone. The Horadric &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; however, volunteered himself as a surrogate soulstone. Plunging the largest shard into his chest, he was &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;entombed&lt;/a&gt; beneath the sands of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, fated to wrestle with Baal's spirit for eternity. Finally, in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo was defeated and imprisoned, his soulstone hidden in a cave network above which a &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; was erected.\nCorruption.\nWhat even the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; did not know was that the soulstones were the centerpiece of a diabolical plan by the Prime Evils in order to make way for the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The Prime Evils were told by &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; that they could use the power of the Soulstones to tap into the power of the Worldstone while they were in Sanctuary. According to their plan, they orchestrated their own exile into Sanctuary and used their powers to corrupt the very soulstones that held their essence.\nThe first one to take control of his soulstone was &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;. He spread his influence across the higher ranks of the Zakarum priesthood and corrupted the surrounding lands of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. The second to awaken was Diablo, courtesy of &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, who shattered his soulstone and allowed Diablo to take &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;hosts&lt;/a&gt;. Diablo was ultimately defeated, but his shattered soulstone could no longer hold his spirit. Like Tal Rasha before him, &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt; plunged the soulstone into his flesh, hoping to contain Diablo's essence. It was an attempt that ultimately failed and soon, Diablo, in the guise of the Dark Wanderer, was headed east to reunite with his brothers.\nBaal was freed from his prison and Tal Rasha served as his host, though his soulstone fragment was taken from him by &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;, an individual who had traveled with the Wanderer. Regardless, Mephisto was soon freed also, who took his &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;own host&lt;/a&gt;. Yet it was here that the Evils' plans began to awry\u2014a group of adventurers who had pursued the Wanderer from Khanduras confronted Mephisto in the depths of the Temple of Light. Even with the soulstone, Mephisto had yet to recover his true strength, therefore the Prime Evil was defeated and his soulstone taken.\nSoulstones' End.\nAccess to Hell had provided the heroes with the opportunity to end the threat of the Prime Evils once and for all. Within the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20of%20Annihilation\"&gt;Anvil of Annihilation&lt;/a&gt;, and it was said that anything broken upon the anvil would be forever negated. Were the soulstones to be destroyed upon it, the Evils they contained would be themselves obliterated, and their souls cast into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this regard, the heroes were successful, as the soulstones of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto%27s%20Soulstone\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and a recently defeated Diablo were destroyed using the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge%20Hammer\"&gt;Hellforge Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Baal and his soulstone remained at large however. And tracking down Marius, Baal retrieved his stone (now named the Shard of Destruction), intent on using it to corrupt the Worldstone.\nWith soulstone in hand, Baal led his forces against the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt;. As Baal wrought havoc in his march north, so too did the shard's destructive essence increase. Eventually, Baal gained access to the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20Chamber\"&gt;Worldstone Chamber&lt;/a&gt;. The same heroes who had defeated his brothers eventually fought and defeated him, but not before he had fused his shard into the Worldstone, corrupting it with the destructive energies the shard had accumulated. Tyrael, realizing that humankind would be irrevocably corrupted if the Worldstone was left to spread the corruption, was forced to destroy it. The Worldstone and the last soulstone were destroyed, and Baal's spirit presumably sent to join his brothers.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;Five years later&lt;/a&gt;, the demon &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; unintentionally created a soulstone after he attuned a shard of the Worldstone to himself. When the shard was destroyed after his defeat, his soul was freed from the shard.\nOver &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;fifteen years later&lt;/a&gt;, a fragment of what looked like the red soulstone was found beneath the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Soul Shards.\nAfter the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, lingering fragments of the artifact containing the essence of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; persisted in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. These Soul Shards (effectively a type of soulstone) thus contained great power\u2014the power of the Evils themselves. A number of &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; were able to find and wield these shards, but they had to be careful, given the allure of such power.\nHatred Resealed.\nSimilar to their predecessors, the Horadrim fashioned shards of the Worldstone into soulstones. One such shard was used to seal &lt;a href=\"Astaroth\"&gt;Astaroth&lt;/a&gt;. After Astaroth was defeated and returned to Hell, &lt;a href=\"Donan\"&gt;Donan&lt;/a&gt; purified his soulstone and attuned it to &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; using traces of Mephisto's corruption in &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;Sankekur&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;. At the end, that piece was used to seal Mephisto.\nNeyrelle carried Mephisto's soulstone all over Sanctuary before she entered &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;. As Neyrelle continued to make her way down the river, the corruption from Mephisto's soulstone continued to not only affect just her, but the surrounding environs. Clutching the soulstone, a black, tar-like liquid began to spread from the stone and onto her hand, burning it. She plunged her hand into the water, and in so doing, spread Mephisto's corruption into the surrounding environment. The black liquid was left in her boat's wake and spread to the adjacent jungle. This resulted in the creation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Hollows\"&gt;the Hollows&lt;/a&gt;. By this point, Neyrelle's boat was just drifting, and she held the stone, as if entranced, the black liquid spreading to her body.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nThe soulstones are usually seen in cinematics of the games in which they appear. In &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo's soulstone is seen directly in the Lord of Terror's head. Interestingly, the soulstone is only seen in the Dark Wanderer's head in the closing cinematic of Diablo- in the Diablo II cinematics, the soulstone is not seen until the Wanderer undergoes his final transformation. Although Aidan's head can clearly be seen at several points throughout the game, the soulstone is not visible in any of them. In Diablo II Resurrected, the tip of Diablo's soulstone emerges from the Wanderer's forehead during his initial transformation.\nDiablo's soulstone is a quest item found in the game files, but it's not used in the actual game.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephisto%27s%20Soulstone\"&gt;Mephisto's soulstone&lt;/a&gt; is a quest item dropped by Mephisto, which the player needs for &lt;a href=\"The%20Hellforge\"&gt;The Hellforge&lt;/a&gt; quest in &lt;a href=\"The%20Harrowing\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt;. If the player forgets to pick it up, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; will give it to the player if he/she enters Act IV without it. Upon destroying the soulstone, the player gets a &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt; (if the is installed) and some flawless or perfect &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter his transformation, &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; is seen wearing the Soulstone on his neck. He has a habit of stroking it when thinking, and touching it when about to cast spells. Interestingly, his yellow stone is depicted as red during the final battle, but it retains its original color at the siege of &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Red%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Red Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained in the &lt;a href=\"Anniversary%20Dungeon\"&gt;Anniversary Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;Soul Shards&lt;/a&gt; were introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 25.

The time of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be the greatest age of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, when untold discoveries in the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; arts were made. These powerful mystics used every ounce of power at their command to preserve humanity. Although the Eastern &lt;a href=\"mage-clans\"&gt;mage-clans&lt;/a&gt; keep watch over vast libraries of magical tomes, it is suspected that a great part of this knowledge was lost when the last of the Horadrim died. There may be lost works beneath the church that could bring some of these ancient magics to light\u2026\"\nIn-game.\nThey could be found in various places in the Labyrinth such as &lt;a href=\"Bookcases\"&gt;Bookcases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Tomes\"&gt;Skeleton Tomes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chests\"&gt;Chests&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, they could be obtained by killing enemies or purchased from Adria. They teach you spells of whatever the book's title was. For example: A Book of Firebolt teaches you the Firebolt spell. If you happen to find the book again, you can learn the higher leveled version of the spell.\nNot all who wish to improve their spells through reading books may have a chance, however. There is a enforced requirement on a hero's &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Attribute%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; attribute. If the hero does not possess that requirement, they are unable to use the spellbook.\nThe effect of spellbooks for already-learned spells can vary. In some cases it decreases mana requirement, in other cases it improves spell effect.\nFor each level earned for a spell, the Magic requirement to gain another level increases by 20% until the requirement reaches at least 192 Magic. After that, the next level (and all subsequent levels, if applicable) require a Magic attribute of 255. The only way to get by without such an imposing restriction is to make use of a certain shrine, namely the &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Enchanted Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, and even then is that type of shrine making the hero suffer from a trade-off which may decrease the level of a desired spell and increase the levels of the others, it would be too harsh for the trivial gains.\nHere are the all the available spells you can learn:\nIn other games.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", the spell system was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;Skill Trees&lt;/a&gt;, eliminating the need for books. Instead of using books, you would have to spend skill points/choose the desired skills and runes from the list on Skill Trees in order to make your spells/skills more effective."}

Such is their lot to be predator one moment, and prey the next.\nThere are many kinds of spiders in the world, but they all share an affinity for magic, being sensitive to spells and artifacts. This susceptibility is due to their adaptability; an unfortunate side effect. When exposed to magic, arachnids will increase dramatically in size and even cast spells. Over time, exposure to magic has caused some spiders to expand their minds and create desires that feel all too human. The most powerful of these mutated spiders are called queens, which rule over clusters of lesser spiders. The queens rarely travel alone.\n&lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt;s can be considered a sub-species.\nCultural Impact.\nSpiders have had a significant impact on &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; cultures. They can represent many things; creation, destruction, power, and fear. They are bearers of omens, good and ill. Spotting a spiderweb on the eastern side of bushes and buildings is regarded as a sign of impending hardship. Most humans find spiders hideous, though some have developed affection for them.\nSpider silk is a useful reagent in making paralysis and sleep potions, as well as being good for casting blinding and entrapment skills. Their venom can also be collected; to do so, one has to pierce the spider's body once with a needle to draw out the ichor. The venom must be stored for three days before it can be used to make poisons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; breed a type of spider called the &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Spider\"&gt;Corpse Spider&lt;/a&gt;. They carry it on their persons to use as weapons.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nSpiders, referred to as \"Giant Spiders,\" are found in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". \nDiablo Immortal.\nSpiders are encountered as enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo III.\nSpiders in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" count as Beasts and are of four major subtypes:\nIn addition to this, a fourth sub-type is found via queens. However, the only known Spider Queen is &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Araneae\"&gt;Queen Araneae&lt;/a&gt;. She is the largest of them all, but is essentially an overgrown Lurker. She serves as the second boss of .\n&lt;a href=\"Charlotte\"&gt;Charlotte&lt;/a&gt; is a non-combat spider pet.\nDiablo IV.\nSpiders appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".

Diablo ordered Iskatu to ambush &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20Vestibule%20of%20Light\"&gt;the Vestibule of Light&lt;/a&gt;.

To make the player run faster, &lt;a href=\"Meteor\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;s (similar to those launched by &lt;a href=\"Morlu%20Incinerator\"&gt;Morlu Incinerator&lt;/a&gt;s) fall onto the arena every few seconds. Each Meteor releases several Shadows too.\nAbilities that can be used on multiple enemies at once is essential to surviving this fight. Iskatu himself isn't all that tough without his minions backing him, and should go down easily once you've polished off his Shadow Vermin. Beware of his deadly melee attack, though, which is combined with vanishing power, teleportation and healing debuff. A warning players will want to consider is that the debuff Iskatu (as well as all other Terror Demons) inflicts on a successful hit will reduce the effectiveness of all sources of healing. Players dependent on life regen may want to tread carefully, or risk death. &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; per Kill helps a lot in this battle, though, for you will have to massacre Shadow Vermins anyway.\nIskatu is the only &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in the game that does not have his own model, being a recolored version of the one shared by &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Demon\"&gt;Terror Demon&lt;/a&gt;s encountered later on in the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Spire\"&gt;Silver Spire&lt;/a&gt;.

Each year it prowled longer into the night, passing through shadows to steal pigs and chickens from townsfolk, and string entrails about. \nIn autumn, the people prepared for Issatar with pitchforks and spears. They found it feeding from their livestock, and stabbed it through the windows of the barn, and wrapped it in chains. Issatar's brood attacked Hezerit that night. They leapt upon the distracted humans, and their screams coursed through the valley. When the brood found Issatar chained, they mutilated Issatar, and Issatar too screamed.\nIssatar's brood had taken innumerable captives into the shadows, none taken had ever returned alive. The people broke Issatar's coiled claws, but did not slay it, and it came to understand mercy.\nThe humans left to attack Issatar brood. They charged with burning torches, and drove them into the darkness. Issatar though bleeding from its wounds, took a spear up, and stood before the people, and slew its siblings. After the battle Issatar slumbered in Hezerit, and in the morning the humans swept up the ash and blood. They offered livestock to appease Issatar, and it guarded them with spear and shadow for a hundred years.\nAt this point, Issatar was old and close to death. It limped from Hezerit with a debt repaid. Its shattered claws were ingrown; its gait halting. Though the people beseeched it to stay, their need had become what animated Issatar. It could not pass on under their gaze. This, too, was mercy.\nLegacy.\nDepictions of Issatar vary in the Hezerit. Some show it in its monstrous prime; others as an avenger, more human than beast. None capture the meager and quiet way it perished, and thus its legend remains. \nIn-game.\nIssatar is mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", in the flavor text of the pieces of \"&lt;a href=\"Issatar%20Imbued\"&gt;Issatar Imbued&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"item%20set\"&gt;item set&lt;/a&gt;."}

This is generally done through the process of comparing an affix's Quality Level to the item's Item Level. To name an example, an Item with an Item Level of 3 can access affixes that are in the quality level range 1-3. These generally include the weakest bonuses to stats, resists, and other things.\nDiablo II/Lord of Destruction.\nItem Levels at first cannot be seen anywhere for vanilla \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" players, enabled or not. You are required to use a plugin called PlugY to even see the Item Level. A key detail to keep in mind, though, is that an item's Item Level is always equal to the &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; that has dropped the &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;- if you know the monster's level, be it through a guide or memory, you then know the Item Level of its drops. If you have &lt;a href=\"gamble\"&gt;gamble&lt;/a&gt;d the item, it is then &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; -5 through +4. If you have bought the item in or from a vendor, it is then Character level +5. Shopping in is slightly different. You still get the clvl+5 = ilvl but there are max ilvls set by act:\nItem levels are used mainly for verification of modifier possibilities.\nDiablo III.\nItem Level returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", and once again, it is a level players cannot see at all ingame. They must view the items over in the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/d3/en/game/\"&gt;Game Guide&lt;/a&gt; to know its exact level. Item Level is specific to a piece of gear, and more often than not, is not equal to the level of the monster that dropped the item in the first place. That being said, just because it is that way, does not mean affixes are rolled with the Item Level in mind. As of the pre-expansion patch, the main determining factor in an item's power is the monster level, but the hero's own level can also account for drops, to some extent; to name an example, a level 60 playing with a level 70 &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, although commonly thought of as more beneficial drop wise, due to the tougher monsters that the Crusader must deal with, will only be offered items that match the power of the Barbarian, while the Crusader will receive items worthy for his/her level. The reverse is not true, however; if the same Crusader were to join a game made by the same Barbarian, both would be getting drops with their level equal to that of the latter."}

If an item reaches 0 maximum durability in result, it is broken and permanently lost, though in fact, any item will be eventually lost from continuous field repairs.\nBecause of the penalty, it is generally considered a useless skill outside of Ironman runs. Lowering an item's maximum durability also increases the risks that the item would break and be lost. In nearly every situation, it is better to return to &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; to repair gear, and only a dire need of emergency repair on higher difficulties, of extreme lack of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, can justify its use.\nIt is considerably more useful in \"\", thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Oil\"&gt;Blacksmith Oil&lt;/a&gt;s, as one may use those to increase the maximum durability. Even then, though, they're not always there to help restore the item. Regardless, the decrease in maximum durability is probably the reason neither class in subsequent games possesses a repair skill: such mechanic is by definition imbalanced if it does not have a negative effect, and useless if it does.\nItem durability can also be increased via &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Hidden Shrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nItem Repair doesn't cost any gold or &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt;, and does not decrease the item's selling cost. Beyond the very first levels, when the player might change gear on a regular basis, it will not save any real repair expenses.\nItem will always lose at least 1 point of maximum durability, regardless of how damaged it is, the higher &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt;, the less this penalty. A sword worn down to 2/50 would be replenished to 49/49, for example.

Wielding &lt;a href=\"Talus%27ar\"&gt;Talus'ar&lt;/a&gt;, the Scroll of Fate, he is clad in grey and appears neither male nor female, though is often referred to as a male in conversation.\nBiography.\nOrigins.\nAs with all angels, Itherael was born from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;. He was among the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s, and among the five who best represented the five virtues of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; (in his case, fate). Alongside &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, Itherael formed the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; to lead angelkind.\nThe Great Conflict.\nAs angels were of Anu and &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, so too were &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;. And as such, the result was the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the endless war, Itherael maintained a steadfast dedication to victory. However, he never shared his views on the ultimate fate of the war with his fellow archangel &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, but it was recorded that the war would end with Hell's victory.\nIn one battle against the forces of Hell, Itherael was present when the Council succeeded in capturing &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0after slaying many demons they faced.\u00a0Though &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; advised taking the Lord of Terror hostage, a hot-headed Imperius ignored them and slew the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; outright, allowing him to return later. Itherael remained silent the entire time.\nThe Sin War.\nThe Great Conflict ground to a halt with the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. It was later discovered that it had been stolen by renegade angels and demons who had used it to create the world of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. It was also discovered that some of these angels and demons had interbred, giving rise to the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and ,in turn, humanity. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, the Angiris Council was left with a choice, as to whether Sanctuary and its inhabitants could be allowed to exist.\nItherael cast his vote for humanity, knowing that they could eclipse either angels or demons, depending on the path it took. His vote was shared by Auriel and Tyrael, while Imperius voted for humanity's end, and &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; abstained. As such, Sanctuary was spared, and humanity allowed to start over. Where their end might be, Itherael did not know, for their fate was unwritten.\nFate Fulfilled.\n3000 years after the events of the Sin War, the Great Conflict reached its end, as Itherael knew it would. Diablo, having absorbed the essences of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; into himself to become a singular Prime Evil, led an invasion of Heaven. The tides of war were in Hell's favor, with Imperius wounded and Auriel captured. However, the arrival of a group of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; turned the tide in Heaven's favor. Itherael helped them save Auriel. \nAt some point during the battle, Itherael helped &lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt; translate a document that had been given to her by an angel within the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt;. They confirmed that the writings came from an angel who called himself &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet\"&gt;The Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, but they did not know if the fallen angel was the Prophet himself. Itherael knew nothing of the writings prior to this point.\nThe Nephalem went on to defeat Diablo, saving the Heavens. Itherael arrived alongside Auriel in the aftermath of The Nephalem's victory. Afterwards, Itherael watched on as a recently banished and now-mortal Tyrael retook his place in the Angiris Council, now embodying wisdom.\nFate Unclear.\nItherael was present a short time later when Imperius and the other council members discovered the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; from the Heavens. When deciding over its fate, Ithereal was inconclusive as to whether the stone should be destroyed by Imperius' demand or whether it should be sealed in a chamber of light and sound by Auriel's suggestion. Itherael remained silent through most of the debates, before asking Tyrael what should be done. After all, Tyrael had taken Malthael's place as the Aspect of Wisdom. Tyrael remained silent, and Imperius repeated his suggestion that they destroy the stone at the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;. Itharael objected; the stone was forged by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; hands, and the Scroll of Fate did not say what might result from such an attempt. Tyrael suggested hiding it on Sanctuary, but the other members objected.\nTyrael ended up departing Heaven before returning with a group of &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, successfully stealing the stone from Heaven. Itherael accompanied Auriel as the pair confronted Imperius, who was in the midst of berating his erstwire brother. Auriel called for an emergency vote on Tyrael's fate, as to whether he be put on trial for his actions, or be allowed to remain as the Aspect of Wisdom and act as an ambassador between angels and Man. She voted for the latter, Imperius the former. After a long silence, Itherael declared that Tyrael was no longer an archangel, but as he had acted with good intentions, would remain a member of the Angiris Council. Tyrael's fate was unknown to him. But he wished him well.\nThe Realms of Fate.\nAfter Malthael's defeat by the Nephalem, the High Heavens were still recovering from Diablo's assault. During this time, Itherael discovered that &lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Library of Fate&lt;/a&gt; were changing Heaven itself, transforming into small pockets reflecting the past, present, and potential futures. Though none could make sense of why this has occurred, it still posed a threat to Sanctuary. Tyrael bid the Nephalem to investigate.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nItherael appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".

He represents Heaven's bishop piece.\nPersonality and Traits.\nItherael has the unique ability to read the esoteric and arcane writings of fate. By all accounts, his prophecies are not always dark, and he holds a balanced view of all things. It is also written that Itherael is capable of predicting the actions of his enemies, and even slow time itself. It is important to note that he cannot see the future outright though, but rather has the ability to see various possibilities played out as the result of actions in the present. He cannot apply this ability to human actions though, for humans are not part of the natural order of things\u2014a source of frustration for him.\nItherael is not particularly vocal and rarely speaks and has been described as inscrutable or aloof, at least in part due to his adversarial relationship with Imperius. It has also been observed that of all of Heaven's archangels, Itherael is closest to Auriel.\nItherael's corresponding domain in Heaven is the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Library of Fate&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that angel ascetics peer into crystals reputed to be shards of the Crystal Arch, recording their visions for Itherael to interpret.\nItherael is also capable of doing battle with his enemy directly. He is capable of wielding a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and has demonstrated the ability to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;."}

Ivgorod once held sway over its surrounding lands, including portions of &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt;, and the northern deserts of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the land's rulers were interned in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;Valley of the Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231060\"&gt;11th century&lt;/a&gt;, Ivgorod found in conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, as they marched west to spread the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith. Sahptev was (and is) a vastly different religion from Zakarum, and as such, Ivgorod vehemently opposed &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; and his beliefs. Across the dunes of Aranoch, the two sides clashed in a series of one-sided engagements. The &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt; forces were masters of warfare across open terrain, and crushed their adversaries at every turn. After their first losses to Rakkis's army, Ivgorod's legendary breaching towers were converted to mass pyres. \nIvgorod's control over Aranoch was shattered, and the kingdom would never again reclaim its desert territories. However, the forces of Ivgorod continued to hound Rakkis as he led his crusade across the &lt;a href=\"Tamoe%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;Tamoe Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Rakkis to construct &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt; as a safeguard against their attacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20and%20the%20Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;History&lt;/a&gt; would downplay Ivgorod's actions in this stage of Rakkis's campaign, though other sources speak of Ivgorod's forces being far more effective in the mountains than they had in the deserts. It has been said that Ivgorod intentionally lured the Kehjistani forces further north into the dense forests and craggy terrain that suited its kingdom's style of warfare far more than Aranoch. Here, the &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monks of Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; were unleashed, hounding the Sons of Rakkis at every turn. Rakkis's crusade turned into a true clash of faiths as his &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s went toe to toe against the Monks. A clash of faiths on this martial scale has never since been seen.\nAs the Kehjistani pushed north, they also had to deal with the s as well. Ultimately, the Sons of Rakkis failed to conquer either Ivgorod or the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and he was forced to retreat to Eastgate. Ivgorod's culture survived, but the conflict had taken its toll. Ivgorod was reduced to a &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28City%29\"&gt;city state&lt;/a&gt;."}

He and his fellow demonic knights sowed horror across the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; as they solidified &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s rule. However, days before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, Izilech defied his master. Diablo defeated Izilech, and let his body lie twisted and broken, earning him the title of \"the Misshapen.\" His &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was forever bound to the cursed form forced upon him. However, Izilech's will endured, and Diablo and &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;brothers&lt;/a&gt; were banished into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. \nIzilech reviled his new form, but the Hells proclaimed him bound to the greatest of all Evils, and the Misshapen has fed greedily on his legend. He established his own rule in Hell, revered by the the lesser demons who cowered under his tyranny.\nIzilech apparently became known to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s in some manner\u2014journal entries spoke of his martial prowess and gargantuan size.\nRecent History.\nIn time, the Wrathborne turned their attention to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Izilech was apparently the demon that the &lt;a href=\"Einfrinn%20Tree\"&gt;Einfrinn Tree&lt;/a&gt; was preventing from entering the mortal realm. However, over time, the &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; became weaker. In a vision bestowed by the tree to an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, a day came when Izilech was able to enter &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; through the tree, killing it in the process. In the vision, Izilech unleashed the Wrathborne on &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, razing it.\nIn-game.\nIzilech first appears in cutscenes in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", in the &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Helliquary\"&gt;Opening the Helliquary&lt;/a&gt;.\" Izilech is not fought himself however.\nIzilech is a &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; boss, made available in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Nightmares\"&gt;Forgotten Nightmares&lt;/a&gt; update. He was first encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal%20quests\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; . When defeated, Izilech dropped the &lt;a href=\"Wrathborne%20Crown\"&gt;Wrathborne Crown&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, defeating Izilech was required to open &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; V &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, but after the difficulty rework in the &lt;a href=\"Unending%20Storm\"&gt;Unending Storm&lt;/a&gt; update, this was scrapped. He can now be challenged on Normal difficulty.\nPersonality and Traits.\nThe most wicked of the Wrathborne, Izilech's cruelty knew no bounds. He was revered by lesser demons who cowered under his tyrannical rule.\nJournal entries recounting Izilech's martial prowess made note of his massive &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, pinpoint accuracy, and penchant for flaming arrows. For those fearless enough to close the gap, they were met by massive hooves designed to flatten even the sturdiest adventurers. Records also mentioned a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;bone prison&lt;/a&gt;\u2014unfortunately, there seemed to be no explanation of what happens to those who lingered in it for too long.\nIzilech is also a good battlefield general, organizing his army to attack in different formations."}

The two were close friends, and would walk together in Heaven. Bearing the &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azurewrath\"&gt;Azurewrath&lt;/a&gt;, Izual came to be venerated for his deeds. He was present at the &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Battle%20of%20the%20Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Fifth Battle of the Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt;, where he was able to keep the forces of Hell at bay.\nFallen Angel.\nThe beginning of Izual's fall from grace came when he led an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an assault against Tyrael's wishes, but\u00a0was carried out nonetheless. A new &lt;a href=\"demonblade\"&gt;demonblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang\"&gt;Shadowfang&lt;/a&gt;, was nearing completion, and Izual was intent on destroying both the wielder and weapon. Izual, however, was overcome by the &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Legion\"&gt;demonic legions&lt;/a&gt; and was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. Twisted by their perverse power, he betrayed his own kind and give up Heaven's most guarded secrets. He became a corrupt shadow of his former self\u2014a fallen angel trusted neither by Heaven nor &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. To add insult to injury, Izual's spirit was bound within the form of a terrible creature which was summoned from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne secret Izual gave up to the Prime Evils was that of the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s, and how to corrupt them. He helped the Three Brothers mastermind the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the soulstones would be corrupted, the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; would be corrupted through them, and through the Worldstone, humanity would fall under the dominion of Hell.\nThe demon, &lt;a href=\"Rakanoth\"&gt;Rakanoth&lt;/a&gt;, served as Izual's jailer during his time of imprisonment, but eventually abandoned the angel to roam the &lt;a href=\"Plains%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Plains of Despair&lt;/a&gt;. Izual's maddened spirit remained bound to the tortured husk it had been forced into.\nThe Harrowing.\nCenturies passed between the Dark Exile and the re-emergence of the Prime Evils, but eventually, the time came where the plan Izual had set in motion came to pass. &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, now fully in control of his &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;mortal host&lt;/a&gt;, returned to Hell...albeit with a group of heroes led by Tyrael in pursuit. From the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrael requested that the heroes put the soul of his old comrade to rest, believing that Izual had suffered enough. The heroes obliged, but found that Izual was past redemption. Though long bereft of Azurewrath, Izual was a formidable foe, but the heroes were still able to strike him down.\nUpon his defeat, Izual's spirit rose from his body, and told them of the role he had played in the Dark Exile, stating that humanity was doomed.\nThe Return.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;21 years&lt;/a&gt; after being struck down in Hell, Izual, now reborn, was called to serve Diablo during his hellish &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20the%20High%20Heavens\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the High Heavens following his resurrection as the Prime Evil. Diablo hoped that by resurrecting Izual, he would be able to break Tyrael's spirit.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and a now-mortal Tyrael encountered him while pursuing Diablo through the Great Span.\u00a0Izual showed great amusement about how Tyrael had become a fallen angel like himself. However, history repeated itself and Izual was once again struck down.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", players encounter Izual wandering on the &lt;a href=\"Plains%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Plains of Despair&lt;/a&gt; in the game's &lt;a href=\"The%20Harrowing\"&gt;fourth act&lt;/a&gt;. His exact location is randomized, but upon approaching him, the quest log notification should appear and Izual can be heard grunting,\u00a0\"Save yourself!\"\nIzual mainly uses melee and &lt;a href=\"cold\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; attacks, so it's useful to have some &lt;a href=\"cold%20resistance\"&gt;cold resistance&lt;/a&gt;. His can be a nuisance to deal with and Izual has a lot of health. However, he has no other special abilities, making the encounter a pretty straightforward fight. In Normal, Frost Nova has a fifteen-second &lt;a href=\"Chill\"&gt;Chill&lt;/a&gt; duration, which increases to eighteen and twenty-two in Nightmare and Hell, respectively. As stated previously, there is Cold damage added to his attacks. In Normal, the addition is 7-15 damage with a two-second Chill and increases to 24-39 with a three-second Chill, and 49-78 with a four-second Chill in Nightmare and Hell\u00a0difficulties. He is just as fast as all &lt;a href=\"Megademon%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Megademons&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Izual appears as a boss during the quest &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;, shortly before the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; reaches the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt; in . His model is almost identical to his previous model. As before, he fights with his Frost Nova, but instead of a sword, he now utilizes a giant mace. He can also summon &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Angel\"&gt;Corrupted Angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Tongue%20Lasher\"&gt;Tongue Lasher&lt;/a&gt;s to his side.\nDefeating him will unlock his lore entry.\nThe battle begins only after the player enters the blue crystal-framed circular arena with the hole in the middle. In combat, Izual moves and attacks quickly, using four attacks:\nEvery 25% life (at 75%, 50% and 25%), Izual also summons two Oppressors or two Corrupted Angels. There is no Enrage timer.\nA player who makes use of a set of &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Climbers\"&gt;Ice Climbers&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20of%20Aranoch\"&gt;Talisman of Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; may have a somewhat easy time against Izual; his cold attacks are useless against them. This, however, still leaves them vulnerable to the Opressors and Corrupted Angels that are summoned.\nRelated Achievements.\nUpon defeat, Izual can drop a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Herding\"&gt;Staff of Herding&lt;/a&gt; plan, if you don't have one yet.\n&lt;a href=\"Cold%20Snap\"&gt;Cold Snap&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; variant of Izual.\nPersonality and Traits.\nAs an angel, Izual possessed great valor and strength. However, his capture by Hell left him a shattered individual, his spirit maddened. By the time he was struck down, anything that remained of his once noble self appeared to be long gone. He has taken on demonic traits, such as the ability to be reborn within Hell. Even without Azurewrath, Izual still possessed great strength, and was a threat to any who opposed him."}

In the wake of its destruction,splinter-storms ravaged the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Dreadlands\"&gt;Southern Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;, and people caught in it fell ill to what the locals called storm sickness. Laird &lt;a href=\"Aymer\"&gt;Aymer&lt;/a&gt;, in his paranoia exiled most of the residents from Staalbreak. His parents made &lt;a href=\"Outsiders%20Camp\"&gt;a camp for the refugees&lt;/a&gt;, which was led by his mother, while his father along other volunteers, plotted a revolt against the laird.\nSword of Justice.\nBlood is the Spark.\nOne fateful day, sometime after the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, Staalbreak was attacked by a force. While the men fought the Barbarians in the field, Jacob and &lt;a href=\"Ivan\"&gt;Ivan&lt;/a&gt; were among those ordered to man the walls. Following Ivan's lead, Jacob climbed over them, and the pair rushed ahead to join the fray, despite Jacob's misgivings. Arriving in the battle, they found things to be much bloodier than they'd imagined, and Ivan was pinned by Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Khelric\"&gt;Khelric&lt;/a&gt;. Jacob took up his sword and declared his intention to defend his friend. Khelric laughed and brought down his &lt;a href=\"axes\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, cleaving Jacob's sword in two, but otherwise sparing the boys.\nThe battle ended in Staalbreak's favor, though it was a hollow victory, as many of their own had been maimed or killed. Jacob's father found him by Ivan's &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;, and berated Jacob for following Ivan over the walls. Jacob angrily pointed out that his father often spoke of his oath to protect their people, and asked how he could let Ivan or anyone else go into danger without protecting them himself. Jacob's father hugged him in response. Afterwards, Jacob worked with Staalbreak's &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; to mend his sword.\nYears later, things took a turn for the worse. While none knew it at the time, the Barbarians Staalbreak had fought against had been infected with the &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Plague\"&gt;Rage Plague&lt;/a&gt;, and on that day, Jacob's father had been infected as well. This drove him to paranoia, and he accused his wife of being a traitor. On the day of her execution, Jacob's father told him that he would attend the execution and remain silent. That if he detected the slightest whiff of treason, he would share his mother's fate. Jacob bid his mother a tearful goodbye before she was executed.\nLater that day, Jacob confronted his father, declaring that instead of the justice his father preached, all he'd seen was the murder of an innocent woman. His father, his rage increasing, drew his sword on his son. To Jacob's horror, he saw that his father had rent his own flesh, but had little time to dwell on that as the two began their duel. Jacob impaled his father, who in his last words, seemed to regain a modicum of sanity. He told Jacob to run and never return, lest &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; find him. Jacob fled Staalbreak, but was charged with murder in absentia, and was hunted by his former kinsmen.\nAranoch.\nStill on the run, Jacob fled to &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. While in &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, he listened to a storyteller named &lt;a href=\"Bahman\"&gt;Bahman&lt;/a&gt; tell the history of Creation, from the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt; to the then-recent destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. After his story concluded, Jacob snidely told him to get the story of Arreat's destruction correct. However, to Jacob's surprise, Bahman grabbed him, revealing that one of his countrymen from &lt;a href=\"Staalbreak\"&gt;Staalbreak&lt;/a&gt; was a mere ten paces behind him. Jacob was astounded that Bahman knew his place of origin, let alone his name, to which Bahman explained that he had the gift of foresight. He instructed Jacob to head to Lut Gholein's northwestern gate and walk until he saw a great peak. Under it lay a boon that Jacob could claim as his own.\nJacob went with Bahnuk to the northeastern gate and thanked Bahman for his aid (unaware that Bahnuk had pickpocketed his sword). To his surprise, Jacob kept heading northwest, despite his self-assurances that Bahnuk was mad. He travelled through the night and into the next day, considering himself a fool to have trusted the beggar's words. However, he came across a mountain that appeared to have been cloven in two. Entering it, he came across water inside, and a &lt;a href=\"Shanar\"&gt;shadowed figure&lt;/a&gt; who conjured water inside it. Jacob greatfully gulped it down, but when he looked up to thank them, found that the figure had vanished.\nEvents became even stranger, as a flash of golden light enveloped Jacob. In it, he saw the outline of an &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;angelic figure&lt;/a&gt;, and further into the mountain's interior, a &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; before him. On the mountain walls, he saw a carving of a boy facing up to a giant Barbarian, seemingly depicting the day when he and Ivan had faced the Barbarian outside Staalbreak. The carvings told his story to the moment where he killed his father. Turning his attention back to the blade, he saw the shadowy figure beside it. He heard music, and wondered if the blade was making it, the figure, or both. He took the blade in hand, and in a flash of light, the figure was set free, able to speak and interact with Jacob normally. Her name was &lt;a href=\"Shanar\"&gt;Shanar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, and explained that the blade had been forcing her to guard it. She claimed that Jacob had been chosen by \"a higher power,\" and that she'd made the carvings, as she'd had little else to do besides wait for Jacob to arrive. Now that he'd taken up the blade, the &lt;a href=\"angelic\"&gt;angelic&lt;/a&gt; resonance that had kept her here for months had disappated.\nTheir meeting was interrupted as Jacob's kinsmen closed in on them. Jacob begged Shanar not to kill them, but that was easier said than done as a fight brought out. Jacob came face-to-face with Ivan, somehow alive, and intent on avenging Jacob's father. At first, Jacob heeded his father's words, on the need to keep his cool in a fight, but within his mind's eye, a more violent version of his father took hold. The one who'd been corrupted by the Rage Plague. The two fought with increased ferocity, until Ivan knocked Jacob out.\nKhanduras.\nThe following day, Jacob awoke to find himself in chains. Ivan told him that Shanar had saved her own skin, before marching into &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. That night, Ivan returned to camp with a still living boar and threw it into the camp. Jacob watched in horror as his kinsmen devoured the still-living beast, tearing it apart with their hands and teeth. He was approached by Shanar, who explained that she'd been given the choice of leaving, or watching Jacob die in that mountain. She freed him and they fled into the night with El'druin, as the hunting party began devouring one of their own.\nThe following afternoon, the pair discussed their next move. Jacob suggested that he return home, but Shanar pointed out that he'd be relying on the mercies of madmen, given the horror they'd seen last night. Jacob angrily claimed that the Barbarians had brought their curse to Staalbreak, but Shanar, who was familiar with Barbarian history, told him that the Barbarians who'd attacked his town weren't the same ones who'd once stood in vigil over Mount Arreat. Ivan and his crew closed in on them, but Shanar &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed them to safety, landing them in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Later, they arrived outside the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Shanar bid them hide, just in time to escape the eyes (if not the noses) of &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe two hid, and watched Jacob's kinsmen and the khazra converse. Ivan, his eyes bleeding, began to speak, as if possessed, offering an alliance with the khazra, and referring to the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s as his slaves. An alliance formed, the khazra revealed where Jacob and Shanar were hiding (thanks to their sense of smell). Unable to flee, all they could do was fight, and while Jacob sought to avoid the deaths of his kinsmen, he had no problem slaughtering khazra. Even then, however, the flow of battle directed him to again face Ivan, who appeared unaware of what had happened earlier, who had apparently blanked out when the entity had spoke through him.\nJacob eventually surrendered, and agreed to return home, on the condition that he be allowed to do so freely, and not as a prisoner. That he would be given a fair trial upon his arrival. Aside to Shanar, he expressed his concern for his people, and that he still felt responsible for his father's death. The two had a falling out, as Jacob mocked Shanar's suggestion that the sword was acting through him. She headed north with him, but the two remained on non-speaking terms for much of the trip.\nReturn to Staalbreak.\nShanar eventually responded to Jacob as they entered the Dreadlands. She discussed the marks Jacob had made on Ivan's chest, how they resembled divinity glyphs. She pointed out that Jacob couldn't have known what they were, but the sword might have guided his hand.\nThey arrived at Staalbreak, and Ivan reminded Jacob that he was on a short leash, and that while Shanar would enter Staalbreak, the use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; was forbidden. As they trudged across the snow, Jacob pointed to the frozen bodies in the snow, claiming it as proof that the Barbarians had wished them harm, but Shanar pointed out that such attacks did not match the Barbarians she'd read about, and besides, the more immediate issue was the madness that had beset Staalbreak. Outside the town walls, they witnessed countless heads of townsfolk mounted on pikes, and inside the gates, piled khazra skulls. Circumstances deteriorated further as upon entering, Jacob was pelted by stones from the townsfolk, accusing him of being a murderer. Battered and bruised, he was turned over to Constable &lt;a href=\"Varik\"&gt;Varik&lt;/a&gt;, who despite Jacob's demands for a trial, stated that Jacob had been found guilty the moment he ran away. He offered Jacob the chance to address the crowd provided he remove El'druin (which he did), but Jacob was strung up. He could, as Varik pointed out, address the people, but he didn't specify how, or whether the people would listen to him. Rocks were pelted at him until he lost conciousness.\nJacob was later awoken by Varik and the town council. Before the nobles, Varik claimed that Ivan and his band had found Jacob far to the south, betraying Staalbreak to the Barbarians to sack the city. That he'd sworn under oath that he'd killed his father, that the Wizard he was in league with was involved in the plot. Ergo, he did not require a trial. Jacob begged them to see reason. To see the scars on their flesh that they seemed oblivious to. Each of the nobles gave their own excuses as to why they were so scarred, as if unable to comprehend what was happening to them. His execution was scheduled for the morrow.\nAs night fell, Jacob was visited by his father's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; (or hallucinated it), who reassured him that he wasn't a murderer. That he had to save Staalbreak before it was too late. The vision transformed into the madman his father had been in his last moments, but the hallucination/vision ended as Shanar, wielding El'druin, cut Jacob's bindings. Unfortunately, their escape was noticed by the town guards.\nShanar teleported them into the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Wards\"&gt;Gray Wards&lt;/a&gt;, but they lost El'druin. To make matters worse, they were attacked by giant rats, infected by the same disease that had consumed the townsfolk. She fried them with her magic, and they headed to their goal; a structure that was owned by &lt;a href=\"Bertram%20the%20Apothecary\"&gt;Bertram the Apothecary&lt;/a&gt;. Only his body remained as a twisted, distorted mess. Shanar revealed that he was actually a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had been studying Mount Arreat and an artifact. When the plague hit, he tried to study its effects. While dead, his writings gave the pair insight into its origins and means of transmission. His body was the end result of the infection.\nThe guards caught them, and Jacob once again gave himself up, still intent on trying to save his people by explaining what had happened to them. Varik confronted him, 'thanking' Jacob for giving him the impetus he needed to have Staalbreak march on the Barbarians, and claim the mantle the &lt;a href=\"Owl%20Tribe\"&gt;Owl Tribe&lt;/a&gt;'s kin abandoned. Like Ivan before him, Varik began to speak as if possessed, and like Ivan, appeared unaware of what had happened when the moment passed. Come dawn, Varik addresed the gathered townsfolk, declaring that Jacob's execution would occur before they marched. Jacob pleaded with them to see reason, but his people were too far gone. The executioner stood ready, but instead, turned his axe on Varik, before freeing Jacob. It was Ivan, who appeared to have regained his senses. He held off the other guards while Shanar freed Jacob.\nInterim.\nSometime after his adventure, word of Jacob's deeds reached the ears of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, and he expressed interest in writing more on the hero. However, the scholar was killed before this could come to pass.\nStorm of Light.\nFollowing Tyrael's reformation twenty years after he was seemingly destroyed at Mount Arreat, El'druin returned to him leaving Jacob's possession. The sudden disappearance of El'druin devastated Jacob. Without its power and guidance he was no longer the avatar of justice he once was. The loss of El'druin was followed by a second, possibly greater one, as Shanar left Jacob soon after. Jacob fell into depression after this, and began wandering Sanctuary.\nAfter the defeat of Diablo by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, Jacob found himself in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. Following a mention of El'druin's whereabouts Jacob stumbled into a trap set by a demon out for revenge. Fighting the demon he slew a few of its cultist minions but was helpless without El'druin. He was saved by Shanar, who foresaw this event, killing the demon and cultists. Jacob then accompanied her to journey to New Tristriam. He came to be recruited into the newly reformed &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;\nIn-game.\n (as a child) appears as an NPC in the questline of the \"&lt;a href=\"Splintered%20Souls\"&gt;Splintered Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" update of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Clicking it causes it to rise into the air, starting the event with a one minute timer, during which &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and some &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Executioner\"&gt;Skeletal Executioner&lt;/a&gt;s emerge from dirt trenches on all four sides. When time expires, the &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tartus\"&gt;Tartus&lt;/a&gt; appears, and all remaining monsters must be killed. The Jar can then be clicked one more time, destroying it, dropping &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, and completing the event.\nThe timer runs down regardless of how many or how fast the skeletons are killed. This is even true if the player leaves the event area entirely, or &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;dies&lt;/a&gt;. The gates surrounding the room do not lock, so a player can clear the rest of the Crypt while time runs down, or even return to &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;. Upon return to the event room after time, the player will find a relatively small number of skeletons to kill in addition to Tartus to complete the event. On the other hand, if the player stays in the room and destroys skeletons, they will spawn in greater and greater numbers.\nObjectives.\nThe &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; version of the requires killing 50 enemies, which is unusual - only \"kill bounties\" normally include this sort of secondary objective. The skeletons that spawn from the event itself can provide most or all of the required kills.\nContrary to the objective, the player does not need to survive the skeletons to complete the event.\nRewards.\nThe low &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; reward for this event is compensated by the fact that the swarms of skeletons give experience when killed.\nAvailability.\nThe Jar of Souls only appears in one of the false Defiled Crypts, not the \"true\" crypt with multiple levels leading to the &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Chancellor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. When this event appears as a bounty, the location of the correct (false) crypt is marked on the map in the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20the%20Forsaken\"&gt;Cemetery of the Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis event is a guaranteed mutually exclusive \"shared spawn\" with &lt;a href=\"The%20Matriarch%27s%20Bones\"&gt;The Matriarch's Bones&lt;/a&gt; - exactly one of the two events will appear in every game."}

{"id": "9555", "revid": "1687225", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9555", "title": "Javazon", "text": "The Javazon is an umbrella term used to describe a number of Amazon Builds that focus on the use of &lt;a href=\"Javelins\"&gt;Javelins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Javelin%20and%20Spear%20Skills\"&gt;Javelin and Spear Skills&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn terms of Javazons, there is much versatility in terms of specialization, much like &lt;a href=\"Bowazon\"&gt;Bowazon&lt;/a&gt;s. There are many types of Javazons that require far different variation in build, yet still go by the same name.\nHowever, all Javazons generally have some traits in common: the use of &lt;a href=\"Pierce\"&gt;Pierce&lt;/a&gt; to maximize the damage of their javelins against groups of monsters.\nLightning Javazons.\nJavazons are characterized by their very high damage output against both mobs and single enemies, their fairly durable defense and their ability to fight well even without good gear (though it certainly aids them considerably). Typically, javazons use Lightning Fury to kill large groups of enemies, Charged Strike to take on single, powerful enemies, and Jab to deal with lightning immunes.\u00a0\nWith proper gear and skill point distribution, Javazons are perhaps the best crowd-killers in the game and excel in open spaces. Great places for running include the Secret Cow Level, the Chaos Sanctuary, and Baal runs.\u00a0\nSkill Point Distribution.\nLightning javazons focus on\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Skills\"&gt;Lightning Skills&lt;/a&gt;, and appropriately max out &lt;a href=\"Power%20Strike\"&gt;Power Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charged%20Strike\"&gt;Charged Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Strike\"&gt;Lightning Strike&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Fury\"&gt;Lightning Fury&lt;/a&gt;. The best skills to use out of this set are Charged Strike and Lightning Fury, the combination of which are capable of handling mobs and bosses even in 8-player mode, and even with mediocre gear. The remaining points are invested in Pierce, which works extremely well with Lightning Fury, and other useful Passive and Magic skills such as &lt;a href=\"Dodge\"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avoid\"&gt;Avoid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evade\"&gt;Evade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt;.\nGear.\nGenerally, javazons look for resistances, +skills, mana, health, &lt;a href=\"Increased%20Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Increased Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; and faster run/walk. One of the best mods for javazons is reduction to enemy lightning resists, though this is an extremely rare attribute granted by only a few items and skills.\u00a0\nBelow are some good item choices for javazons, from best/rarest to decent but common.\nMercenary.\nAct II mercenaries are some of the best mercenaries to javazons thanks to their auras. Prayer mercenaries with the runeword allows javazons to quickly regenerate mana, a trait very useful in the early to mid game. The absolute best weapon, though it is very expensive, is the rune word, which grants a powerful &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; aura that reduces enemy lightning resistance by 85% and tremendously increases javazon damage output.\u00a0\nPoison Javazons.\nPoison-based javazons are much rarer. Such Javazons will max out &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Javelin\"&gt;Poison Javelin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Javelin\"&gt;Plague Javelin&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on a Poison-themed character. Although certainly not as safe as a Lightning Javazon, a Poison Javazon also requires fewer synergies, and can therefore focus on other abilities like &lt;a href=\"Fend\"&gt;Fend&lt;/a&gt; or another of the &lt;a href=\"Passive%20and%20Magic%20Skills\"&gt;Passive and Magic Skills&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn solo play, one of the ways to increase your effective DPS in wide-open areas would be to equip some good faster run/walk boots. Poison a group of monsters, then evade them and look for another group, poison them, evade and look for a third group, poison the third group, then circle around to the first group. Usually by the third or fourth group the first group will be dead and you can go pick up their drops. Spreading out your damage this way lets you get an effective total DPS (total summed over all monsters you've poisoned) rivalling those of top spellcaster builds, though this strategy is unusable in party play."}

He later worked at Monolith Studios, Cavedog Entertainment, and Relic Entertainment. Apart from Relic, he mainly worked on FPS games. At Relic, he was the lead designer on both \"Impossible Creatures\" and \"Dawn of War\", and was the design director of \"Company of Heroes\". He worked together with &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Mosqueira\"&gt;Josh Mosqueira&lt;/a&gt; on this game. He became aware of the first \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" game after seeing it advertised on the back cover of \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowpedia.org/Warcraft_II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;\". He ended up purchasing the game soon afterwards. He played \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" for three to four days straight when it came out.\nCareer at Blizzard.\nWilson joined &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; in 2006. He agreed to the interview not expecting to work at Blizzard, but rather to get some information that might help his current position. He was hired, and became the lead designer of Diablo III. He described his intent as being to make a good sequel, but not to stagnate the series. He was responsible for all final decisions regarding the game.\nWilson was responsible for Diablo III's combat design and physics engine. After the game's launch, and in the midst of negative player reception, he generated controversy with a \"fuck that loser\" comment regarding &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt;'s commentary on the game. Wilson later appologized for his words. Threads were removed on &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; due to the amount of community vitriol. \nWilson worked on the development of \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". He remained as game director of \"Diablo III\" until 2013 when he was replaced by Josh Mosqueira. Wilson cited burnout as the reason for his departure from Team 3, as he had spent nearly a decade working on the same game. He moved to an unannounced project within the company. Wilson is known to have worked on \"Titan\", \"World of Warcraft: Legion\", and \"Avalon\".\nWilson resigned from Blizzard in 2016 in order to pursue a career in writing, The decision was also prompted by his family, who wanted to move back to the Pacific northwest. In 2016, Wilson commented that in recent years, the amount of online harassment he had received had dropped, and that such vitriol was part of the reason why he left the games industry. He was later interviewed by Jason Schreier in his book \"The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment\", where Wilson detailed the effects the \"Diablo III\" backlash had on his mental health."}

Once a member of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; and opponent to &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, he fell into evil and was struck down by a new group of heroes.\nBiography.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt; sent many of its members to investigate the town of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, rumours of an awakening evil having reached their ears. Jazreth was but one of them, though he of course eventually became the most prominent. Jazreth also had an interest in discovering lost tomes and magical artifacts that might be hidden away in the labyrinth beneath the town &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nArriving at the town, Jazreth found two allies: &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, prince of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. Entering the cathedral, the trio encountered and dispatched many horrors, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, the monarch having now become the Skeleton King. Eventually, they reached the horror in the labyrinth's darkest depths: Diablo, Lord of Terror. After a mighty battle, the demon was felled.\nThe Arcane Sanctuary.\nScarred by his experiences, Jazreth travelled to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; to find the mystical &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; of the great mage &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt;. He met &lt;a href=\"Drognan\"&gt;Drognan&lt;/a&gt;, an old comrade of his, and told him of his fight against Diablo, but such were his ramblings that the man dismissed much of what he had said. Later, the sorcerer managed to talk his way into &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt;'s palace, where he found the &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; to the Sanctuary hidden within the palace's cellars.\nHe entered the portal, but by doing so, he opened a rift into the palace, allowing scores of &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; (that had been enslaved and imprisoned within the Arcane Sanctuary) to invade the palace where they massacred the local guards and harem women. Drognan would later speculate that the Summoner had possibly been possessed by the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Summoner believed that he could bend evil forces to his will. What he didn\u2019t know was that evil uses man, not the reverse. Ultimately, he met his end at the hands of a new group of heroes, pursuing the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, who realized the Summoner was the same sorcerer he knew in Tristram, hoped that the Summoner would find peace in death. However, he acknowledged that it was more likely that the Summoner would be dragged into the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; by the demons he was bound to\u2014a warning against the hazards of demonic magic.\nDecades later, Jazreth's &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Elemental%20Command\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; resurfaced.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe Summoner is the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; character of the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;first game&lt;/a&gt;, though he remains unnamed in said game.

Killing him completes the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Summoner%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Summoner&lt;/a&gt;\". For closed Battle.net players, he can drop the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Key of Hate&lt;/a&gt;, a key component to unlocking the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThough his magical attacks are strong and deadly, the Summoner has little health and defense, making physical attacks very effective against him; a quick kill is almost guaranteed upon reaching him.

Bringing &lt;a href=\"Thawing%20Potion\"&gt;Thawing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s and gear with &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Resistance\"&gt;Cold Resistance&lt;/a&gt; should limit the damage. Dodging The Summoner's magic attacks also helps.\nThe Summoner stands on a platform, but he is not alone. Usually, there are several &lt;a href=\"Goatmen\"&gt;Goatmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s near him. The Goatmen can be especially troublesome as they block the corridor, preventing players from moving towards him. Lure them away and kill them out of range of his spells.

He did so in a very controversial manner, however. Apparently, he himself did not fully realize exactly how his potions worked, yet was sure of being the greatest apothecary of his time.

Jentulf was put to trial afterwards and sentenced to imprisonment. The apothecary genuinely did not understand what did he do wrong, accusing the judges of being simply jealous.\u00a0In prison, stripped of his title, he pleaded the king for early release, promising to create more invigorating potions. Later, Jentulf was granted freedom and reinstated. However, he became more sinister afterwards, believing that fear is the greatest motivation, which reflected on his new creations. His contempt towards the other apothecaries grew greatly, as Jentulf believed they all expected him to lose his talent during imprisonment.

He was, in the words of &lt;a href=\"Dumal%20Lunnash\"&gt;Dumal Lunnash&lt;/a&gt;, \"a most forgettable member\" of the Vizjerei. As a young acolyte, he aspired to one day represent his clan on the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Council\"&gt;Mage Council&lt;/a&gt;, but he was always outshined by his more talented peers. His growing frustrations came to a head when his parents and sister were killed during a short lived fued between the Vizjerei and &lt;a href=\"Ammuit\"&gt;Ammuit&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs his heart roiled with anger and rage at the tragedy, Harash reached out to the spirits and made contact, succeeding where his contemporaries had failed. Yet the entity he summoned into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was no spirit, but rather a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;. In this instant, Harash had alerted the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; to the existence of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and changed the course of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; history forever. And, by extension, had etched himself into history's annals. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would theorize thousands of years later that Harash's success hinged on the dark emotions he was feeling at the time. Perhaps his anger and rage somehow attuned him to one of the realms of Hell. Whatever the root cause, Harash quickly recognised the perils of the murderous creature he had summoned. After restraining it with binding spells, he informed the Vizjerei elders of his discovery.\nThe official records of the Vizjerei, written by Lunnash, give a different account of these events. In them, it was written that Harash had discovered the power to command the spirits of the dead. The young boy had claimed the insight was given to him through a dream. Soon, his power became a thing of legend. The boy perfected the process whereby the &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s drained the energy of the dead, making anyone who used it more powerful than anything that had gone on before. As a result of this new knowledge, the Vizjerei became known as the Spirit Clan. The account further claimed that Harash\u2019s last attempt to master the spirit world completely would prove to be his undoing, however. Upon the young man\u2019s attaining the trance state necessary to transfer the energy to the spells he wove, a spirit had taken control of his body and gone on a killing rampage. Later, the Vizjerei had learned that the spirits they called on and unwittingly unleashed into the world were, in fact, demons of the Burning Hells.\nLegacy.\nLunnash was said to have witnessed Harash's end personally. Although he wrote the false account of Harash's interactions with \"spirits,\" he did write at least one manuscript that detailed what had actually happened with Harash. Nonetheless, it was the false account that endured, though Lunnash was overlooked for the most part, when it came to Vizjerei history. It was Cain who uncovered Lunnash's original account of Harash's actions. But either way, Harash's actions sent a chain of events into motion that would culminate with the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, and much misery beyond. Indeed, Cain held Harash as being responsible, to at least some extent, for every event that affected Sanctuary afterwards\u2014such was his mark on history."}

From his youth, he was known for his perspicacity; his sisters tried to get him spare vellum, and his father bargained for parchment from travelers. Despite this, Cain resented his family's superstitions.\nWhen he was ten years old, plague swept through his village. Heeding his words, Cain's family remained healthy, while the rest of the villagers succumbed to the plague. He experimented on cadavers in search of a cure, and it never occurred to him to sit and pray for salvation.\nAt some point, Jered joined the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a great &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;. Some accounts state that he was troubled by a terrible event in his past (it is unclear if this event was the plague or something else).\nThe Dark Exile.\nJered was among the Horadrim that took part in the hunt for the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would express the belief well after Jered's death that through the Horadrim, Jered found a new purpose in his life.\nJered was among the Horadrim that bound their &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"vessels\"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;. As the Horadrim could not conquer &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, these vessels would store their memories for future Horadrim.\nWhile in the group, Jered documented his experiences with &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;; the Horadrim who had been entrusted with the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s. At some point, a prophet told Jered that his bloodline would end the Horadrim.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; used himself as a surrogate &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; to seal &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, Jered took leadership of the Horadrim and led them into &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, where they defeated &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, and sealed him in a series of catacombs beneath the surface, above which they constructed a &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Jered would spend the rest of his days living inside the monastery, and would later &lt;a href=\"The%20Nature%20of%20the%20Soulstones\"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; on his experiences, and reflected on Tal Rasha. How if he ever escaped, Baal would have the &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s powers added to their own. That in sealing Baal in this manner, the Horadrim may have created an evil greater than the one they originally contained.\nIn time, leadership of the Horadrim passed from Jered to &lt;a href=\"Iben%20Fahd\"&gt;Iben Fahd&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nJered's line would continue through the decades. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; named his own &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain%20%28The%20Order%29\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; after him. Much of Deckard's own knowledge of the Horadrim, &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, and various arcana, came from the texts that Jered had written and passed down. However, Deckard reflected that he knew very little of Jered's early life.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; activated the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Memory of Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt;, which imparted tales of its progenitor.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\n&lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain%27s%20Vision\"&gt;Jered Cain's Vision&lt;/a&gt; is Jered's correspondent &lt;a href=\"vessel\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Horadrim\"&gt;Legacy of the Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; system. It corresponds to the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Memory of Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nJered is referenced in the \"Hope of Cain\" recipe for &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nAssuming that the Memory of Cain's personality is accurate to his progenitor, Jered was inquisitive from his early childhood, and apparently irreligious (or at least, had contempt for the idea of praying for salvation). Despite saving his family from the plague, Jered apparently resented them. He also appeared to resent &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, given that they were slaves to their natures, while humanity had the ability to choose its own path. \nHe valued knowledge, and its ability to improve the world, though noted that everywhere light's reason shone, there were forces that would snuff it out. His cynicism extended further, as he wary of compliments, his memory even commenting that it was better that the mighty remain ordinary, given that so many used power for their own ends. This showed in his emphasis on planning for the worst. He considered his fellow Horadrim to have \"ungainly rhetoric.\"\nDespite this, Jered also had a virtuous side, stating that if one led a good life, they need not worry about &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;what came after death&lt;/a&gt;, and that it was incumbent on those who could improve the world to do so.\nJered lost a number of his writings over the years. Hence, he resorted to tatooing his own body to record them."}

At some point. Jerhyn succeeded his father as sultan of Lut Gholein. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;1263&lt;/a&gt;, he was visited by &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt;, who was interested in the history of the palace. Jerhyn gave him a tour. When he found ancient seals over a passageway in the cellar, he became very agitated. He asked for some time alone to study them, and Jerhyn granted it. Shortly after, he left with no further word. Jerhyn never saw him again.\nThe Siege of Lut Gholein.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;following year&lt;/a&gt;, his city was beset by troubles that began with the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. His people began whispering of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; rising from their tombs, and &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; roaming the dunes of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; at night. Jerhyn himself witnessed things that he could not explain. He ordered the port closed and all trade ships moored until he could be sure that his city was safe. When the troubles began here, he allowed the terrified harem guilds to join him within the safety of the palace. All was fine, until one night, screams echoed up the stairwells from the harem. His guards arrived to find the girls being slaughtered by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. The guards were able to push the demons back through the rift from which they'd come from, but the demons kept coming through, and the palace guards were left to fight a losing battle. Jerhyn hired &lt;a href=\"Greiz\"&gt;Greiz&lt;/a&gt; and his mercenaries to protect the city, but knew that matters were growing worse by the hour. Still, he had to choose his confidantes carefuly, lest he send the city into a panic.\nSuch confidantes came in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, who were in pursuit of the Dark Wanderer. After witnessing their deeds, he told them of the evil that had beset the palace. They successfully slew the Summoner (the same &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; that Jerhyn had seen a year ago), ending the threat to the palace. Impressed with their skills and bravery, he confided that &lt;a href=\"Drognan\"&gt;Drognan&lt;/a&gt; and himself had concluded (correctly) that the Dark Wanderer was &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself, that the Lord of Terror sought the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tomb of Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, in a bid to free &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. The heroes set out in pursuit, but the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; escaped. Jerhyn authorized &lt;a href=\"Meshif\"&gt;Meshif&lt;/a&gt; to take them over the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, so that their hunt may continue. He gave them his final thanks, and told them they would always be welcome in his city.\nIn-game.\nJerhyn appears as an NPC in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". Upon the player's arrival in Lut Gholein, Jerhyn greets them at Warriv's camp. In addition to his introduction and his suggestion to talk to &lt;a href=\"Atma\"&gt;Atma&lt;/a&gt;, he has a special dialogue option breaking down what services the player can get from which vendor. Jerhyn will subsequently be found at the steps of the palace.\nGossip about Jerhyn.\nSome of the other locals give their thoughts concerning Jerhyn.\nPersonality and Traits.\nJerhyn was a young man during the time of the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and its aftermath. He has good leadership ability, and he is well liked by his people. &lt;a href=\"Warriv\"&gt;Warriv&lt;/a&gt; believed that he had his father's strength and wits, and in time, would grow into a fine sultan. &lt;a href=\"Greiz\"&gt;Greiz&lt;/a&gt; considered him to be a fine businessman."}

She saw many friends fall, and it never became any easier. At some point during her research, she stumbled across the name &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;. Reading up on him, she decided that he \"sounded a bit mad.\"\nWhen she vanished, leaving her &lt;a href=\"Guard%20of%20Johanna\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johanna%27s%20Argument\"&gt;favorite flail&lt;/a&gt; behind, many speculated that she was dead. At the least, it appeared that her journey was unplanned. In truth, she had departed for &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, in search of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;. She did not have an apprentice, though was aware that she would have to take on one soon.\nOn her journey west, Johanna passed by &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. She didn't stop, as she knew that other Crusaders were investigating the city.\nJohanna's story was recorded in the annals of the Crusader order.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nJohanna has two &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; items in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" named after her; &lt;a href=\"Johanna%27s%20Argument\"&gt;Johanna's Argument&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"flails\"&gt;flail&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Guard%20of%20Johanna\"&gt;Guard of Johanna&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Shields\"&gt;Crusader shield&lt;/a&gt;).\nThrough \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", she can be considered to be a possible representation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; in a similar manner to characters such as &lt;a href=\"Valla\"&gt;Valla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Li-Ming\"&gt;Li-Ming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sonya\"&gt;Sonya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nazeebo\"&gt;Nazeebo&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo IV.\nJohanna can be found during a &lt;a href=\"side%20quest\"&gt;side quest&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Zarbinzet\"&gt;Zarbinzet&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"Remnants%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Remnants of Faith&lt;/a&gt;,\" where her apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Tomyris\"&gt;Tomyris&lt;/a&gt;, asks the &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; to guide her from &lt;a href=\"Hawezar%20Wetlands\"&gt;Hawezar Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Maugan%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Maugan's Folly&lt;/a&gt;, so she can retrieve her late master's armor. The player finds her corpse near the &lt;a href=\"Maugan%27s%20Works\"&gt;Maugan's Works&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player finds the armor inside the dungeon, Tomyris dons the armor and the name Johanna to carry on her master's legacy.\nAlthough initially believed to be the same Johanna from &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;\"Diablo III\"&lt;/a&gt;, the different face, hair color and hair style suggest it is in fact a different person. It's commonly theorised that the corpse found outside &lt;a href=\"Maugan%27s%20Works\"&gt;Maugan's Works&lt;/a&gt; likely belongs to the apprentice of the playable crusader from the previous game, who, just like Tomyris, took on the name of her master after her death. \nCompleting \"&lt;a href=\"Remnants%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Remnants of Faith&lt;/a&gt;\" rewards the player with a rare chest armor called &lt;a href=\"Johanna%27s%20Namesake\"&gt;Johanna's Namesake&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nJohanna appears as a Crusader hero in \"Heroes of the Storm\". In her standard equipment, she wears the , (with respective armor tier components), but her &lt;a href=\"flails\"&gt;flail&lt;/a&gt; does not match any existing item. She uses &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Shield\"&gt;Blessed Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falling%20Sword\"&gt;Falling Sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Glare\"&gt;Shield Glare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Punish\"&gt;Punish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Condemn\"&gt;Condemn&lt;/a&gt; skills, as well as &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Skin%20%28Crusader%29\"&gt;Iron Skin&lt;/a&gt; as a passive trait.\nUnlike other heroes representing playable classes, visually, Johanna does not follow the classic phenotype of the in-game Crusader class, having a different face, hair color and haircut.\nPersonality and Traits.\nJohanna dislikes &lt;a href=\"Lyndon\"&gt;Lyndon&lt;/a&gt;. She is confident that she will be able to cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith, but believes that even after that, there'll still be something that needs a good smiting. She is not unnerved by &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Like many of the Order's number, he apparently was conscripted, and subjected to torture in an effort to remove the memories of his former life.\nEventually, he found a set of what he called \"key words\" hidden in a dusty libram. As he read the words, memories of his past returned to torment him. He also discovered plans for &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic weapons made for human hands, set with runes similar to those that graced the armor of &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;.\nJondar fled the Templar Order, and fell into the service of the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt;. He was pursued by the Templar, &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt;, who was captured by the Coven. After being freed from tortures by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, he asked his companion(s) to help him kill Jondar. After Jondar was defeated, he told Kormac that he had been led astray by the Coven's dark &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Kormac, unforgiving of betrayal, killed him as he lay mortally wounded.\nKormac recovered Jondar's journal and discovered the series of events which had led Jondar to the Coven. As he recovered his own memories of what the Templar had done to him, he took a softer view on his former ally, reflecting that if he hadn't been betrayed by the Order, Jondar might not have come under Maghda's thrall.\nIn-game.\nJondar appears in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20the%20Black%20King\"&gt;Reign of the Black King&lt;/a&gt;.\" He is killed as part of a scripted event with Kormac.\nUpon his defeat/death he will not immediately drop his loot: there is a delay where Kormac finishes him off after his last words, then the loot is dropped. Players can pass the time by destroying nearby scenery since even if they don't want that loot, they can't pass the barricade under Kormac breaks it, even though they have no trouble destroying other wooden barricades.\nHe appears a &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; in the game's &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;. There is also another Necromancer Betrayer in Adventure Mode named &lt;a href=\"Rad%27Noj\"&gt;Rad'Noj&lt;/a&gt;, whose name is 'Jondar' spelled backwards.\u00a0They both have the ability to shoot multiple &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; bolts in five directions simultaneously, much like &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Nova\"&gt;Poison Nova&lt;/a&gt;, and can summon &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s (named Servants of Jondar) at their side."}

He also served in the Black Watch (Royal Highlanders of Canada) Regiment for eight years. Before arriving at Blizzard, he held positions at Ubisoft Montreal, Relic Entertainment, and Vicarious Visions. His experience as a creative director, design director, and lead designer has spanned numerous genres, including real-time strategy games, first-person shooters, and action games. His prior credits include \"Far Cry 3\", \"Company of Heroes\", \"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War\", and \"Homeworld 2\". He worked with &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt; as part of the \"Company of Heroes\" team.\nBlizzard Entertainment.\nMosqueira was contacted by Jay Wilson in February, 2011. At the time, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; was hiring for a lead designer for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", and someone from Ubisoft had applied. Wilson had contacted Mosqueira in order to get information on Ubisoft's company culture. During the conversation, Wilson offered the position to Mosqueira himself. Mosqueira responded that he'd have to think about it, but quickly accepted the offer. \nMosqueira joined Blizzard in May of 2011 as the lead designer for the game's console version. Mosqueira and his team were given creative freedom in altering their version of the game to suit the control scheme of a controller. As the PC version entered its \"crunch period,\" Mosqueria and his team were temporarily transferred to work on the main game. After its release, they returned to work on the console version.\nIn 2013, he replaced Jay Wilson as \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\"\"s game director. Initially, he wasn't going to apply to take Wilson's position, as he preferred overseeing the small console team as opposed to a team of 400. However, Wilson and other figures within Blizzard encouraged him to take on the role. As game director for &lt;a href=\"Team%203\"&gt;Team 3&lt;/a&gt;, Mosqueira was responsible for overseeing the overall game design of the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Series\"&gt;\"Diablo\"&lt;/a&gt; franchise, including its transition to a new platform and for a new audience. This involved maintaining the game\u2019s creative vision, and overseeing a team of designers as they refined the game\u2019s critically acclaimed gameplay experience. He specified the setting, &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;antagonist&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", wanting the two to balance out. \n\"Reaper of Souls\" released to positive reception. This gave Mosqueira the reputation of being Team 3's \"golden boy,\" both within and outside Blizzard, as the man who'd saved \"Diablo III\" from failure. After the cancellation of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20King%20in%20the%20North\"&gt;The King in the North&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; entrusted Mosqueira with creating a fourth \"Diablo\" game.\nAfter the release of Reaper of Souls, Mosqueira headed up development of &lt;a href=\"Project%20Hades\"&gt;Project Hades&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, Mosqueira had worked on the \"Diablo\" franchise for years, and wanted to do something different to the prior games. However, Hades had a rocky development cycle, and as it went on, Mosqueira became harder to track down, coming into the office only two or three days a week.\nIn December, 2014, Mosqueira and other members of Team 3 provided consultation with Bungie on the development of \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.destinypedia.com/The_Taken_King\"&gt;The Taken King&lt;/a&gt;\", as Activision had noticed similar complaints leveled at \"Destiny\" as the original version of Diablo III.\nMosqueria left Blizzard Entertainment on July 1, 2016. Afterwards, Blizzard executives looked at Hades, and declared the project non-viable without Mosqueira. Team 3 was subsequently began work on &lt;a href=\"Project%20Fenris\"&gt;Project Fenris&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-Blizzard.\nMosqueira is currently a member of Bonfire Studios."}

With a slight, almost mocking smir, she whispered in a ragged voice, \"&lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; comes...and destruction follows him like a storm.\" She then sank into the bed and with a shudder, breathed her last. By the gods, Elora, as long as I draw breath, I will never forget her terrible portent.\"\n5th day of Montadht, Vespers.\n\"If Caldra's prophetic words were not enough to mvoe &lt;a href=\"Qual-Kehk\"&gt;Qual-Kehk&lt;/a&gt; and his men to take up arms, then the black clouds of smoke rising in the south surely proved to be! We surmised that a &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;great army&lt;/a&gt; was marching towards us, led none other than Baal, the Lord of Destruction. Our worst fears were confirmed when we lost all contact with our capital, &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"I fear the worst, but I put my faith in Qual-Kehk. He's always defended us against those who would attempt to assault sacred &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Arreat\"&gt;Mt. Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. It's likely that Sescheron was taken by surprise\u2014may the Ancients watch over them\u2014but we, the sons of Harrogath, remain vigilant. The ancient barricades and watchtowers built for this day stand as they always have.\"\n\"The old prophecies speak of a dark day, when destruction will wash over us like a torrent of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, leaving nothing but the ashes of our people in its wake. As I look south towards the darkening skies, I know that &lt;a href=\"Uileloscadh%20M%C3%B3r\"&gt;day of doom&lt;/a&gt; has finally come.\"\n7th day of Montadht, Matins.\n\"It seems that I am not the only one who cannot sleep. Qual-Kehk readies his men even now as I ready myself. This morning, I shall propose that we perform one of the long-forbidden &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;ic spells of warding. As Elders, we alone are capable of summoning such tremendous energies. Though the ward may drain us of vital &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al reserves, if our &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;land&lt;/a&gt; is to be saved, we will do what we must.\"\n\"Our people once considered the Druids breathren\u2014but after the terrible &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the Druids were exiled to the &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;harsh wilds&lt;/a&gt; beyond our homeland. SInce then, our Elders have kept their fearsome Druidic powers a closely guarded secret.\"\n\"The danger of unleashing such powers once again terrifies me. If done incorrectly, the warding spell could consume us all well before the arrival of Baal's army. However, I have studied the rites, and am confident that I can cast the warding correctly with the Council's help. The ward will bar passage of any &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;\u2014even Baal himself. I intend to place it around the entirety of Harrogath.\"\n\"Casting the spell in this fashion requires that all seven Elders venture outside the protective walls of our city. The danger is great...We may all be killed. However, I see no alternative. I go now to take this matter before the assembled Council of Elders.\"\nCompline.\n\"My meeting with the Elders was as trying as I suspected it would be. They vehemently disagreed with my plan. &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; argued that there must be another way to stop Baal's assault, but neither he nor the others could offer a real alternative. In time, five of the Elders came to see that my plan was the only way. Regrettably, Qual-Kehk remained unconvinced.\"\n\"Though Nihlathak reluctantly agreed to participate in the spell, he refused to help convince Qual-Kehk of my plan's merit. I must admit, I was intimidated by Nihlathak\u2014even though I am older than he and of higher standing within the council.\"\n\"When I pressed Qual-Kehk to support my plan, he bristled with anger. I cannot recall ever seeing him so upset\u2014not even when his &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;finest prot\u00e9g\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; left in search of adventure never to return. But I stood firm in my resolve and finally convinced him that this alone could ensure the safety of Harrogath. Even now, he readies his men to guard us while we cast the Druid ward.\"\n\"As I write this, I can hear the screams of the dying in the distance...calling to us...mocking us. But before I cast what may be my final spell, I must see our beloved Anya one last time.\"\n\"Aust, Elder of Harrogath\"\n\"7th day of Montaht\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anno%20Kehjistani\"&gt;Anno Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt;\""}

One of them died as a youth. However, it was expected that &lt;a href=\"Cornelius%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Cornelius the Younger&lt;/a&gt; would succeed his father as the next king, and as such, little preparation was made for Justinian to take on the role.\nMoon of the Spider.\nCornelius the Younger died in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, and Cornelius the Elder perished the same year, after a battle with illness. This made Justinian, fourth of his name, heir to the throne, despite the lack of planning for such an eventuality. His claim to the throne was not as secure as some would like, and not all of the noble houses supported him.\nReign.\nJustinian came into his own in the years following his ascension to the throne. Rumors persisted about &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic activity surrounding his coronation. He developed a fascination with gathering magical artifacts (such as &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Stone\"&gt;Rift Stone&lt;/a&gt;s) and the &lt;a href=\"Einfrinn%20Tree\"&gt;Einfrinn Tree&lt;/a&gt;.\nJustinian mourned his brother, and believed he was never meant to be king. The nobles threatened to bend him to their will; that they would abandon him if he didn't \"keep the peasants in their place.\" Weary, Justinian believed his position was hopeless.\nThe nobles' influence led Justinian to some bad decisions, such as reducing the standing of the &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt; and ignoring warning about the coming &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint\"&gt;Stormpoint&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, Justinian promised to send aid. Unfortunately, the aid didn't arrive until well after the cult had mostly left the island, having completed their objective.\nAs the year wore on, Justinian became more and more unpopular with his subjects. The people were hungry, and while Justinian promised to grant favor to his people, they desired food more than anything else. However, never able to refuse a bit of extra coin, the people took him up on his offer. Still, tensions continued to simmer, and people gathered in dark corners of the city, whispering of change. Restless, and with their concerns ignored time and again by the king, champions rose up amongst Westmarch's citizens in an act of revolt.\nSons of the Wolf.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;besieged&lt;/a&gt; by an &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Sin\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Justinian refused the fortress's requests for aid, declaring that he would not send reinforcements to fight \"imaginary demon lords.\"\nMonths later, &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; was besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly overran the &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. The attack shook Justinian out of his stupor, as he realized that his feelings were irrelevant when his people were dying around him. To his surprise, Lord &lt;a href=\"Wynton\"&gt;Wynton&lt;/a&gt;, who had long agitated against his reign, offered his aid. Overjoyed, Justinian declared that their resistance would begin, and that Westmarch would not fall. \nIn truth, Wynton had no intention of working with Justinian, and assassinated him, declaring that the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;line of &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; (of whom Wynton was descended) would take the throne of Westmarch.

He was first summoned into Sanctuary by the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt;, before the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, and was summoned into Sanctuary more than once. He was killed and banished numerous times. In one of his earlier incarnations, he was known as \"Iceclaw the Merciless,\" and united a number of tribes under his rule, before being killed by a warrior named &lt;a href=\"Hauklin\"&gt;Hauklin&lt;/a&gt;, who wielded an enchanted &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormfury\"&gt;Stormfury&lt;/a&gt;; specifically forged to slay Kabraxis, and rumored to be the only weapon that could do so. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the Vizjerei, employing a number of &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s, banished Kabraxis from Sanctuary and eradicated the temples built in his name within &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt; and other locations.\nOne of his disciples was &lt;a href=\"Kreghn\"&gt;Kreghn&lt;/a&gt;, who imparted the concept of the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Selves\"&gt;Three Selves&lt;/a&gt;. He returned again to Sanctuary during the Mage Clan Wars. There was a rumor that one of Kreghn's disciples had managed to open a portal to Kabraxis again, but this was never confirmed.\nThe Black Road.\nAt around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Kabraxis had already been banished and had been waiting for an unknown period of time, the runic portal to his plane of Hell, which he referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Road\"&gt;Black Road&lt;/a&gt;, being buried in a long-lost city called &lt;a href=\"Ransim\"&gt;Ransim&lt;/a&gt;. His wishes were fulfilled, however, when his portal was unearthed and opened by an ex-Zakarum priest, &lt;a href=\"Buyard%20Cholik\"&gt;Buyard Cholik&lt;/a&gt;, who had come seeking him in order to pledge his loyalty to him and offer to be his conduit to the mortal realm. This offer was accepted and Kabraxis was able to return to Sanctuary by anchoring himself to Cholik. He began his plan anew by establishing a new religion in a &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; town named &lt;a href=\"Bramwell\"&gt;Bramwell&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and hatched a complex scheme to convert the King of Westmarch himself in order to create an army of believers that he would use to fight Zakarum. However, his plans come to an end when he and Cholik were killed by &lt;a href=\"Darrick%20Lang\"&gt;Darrick Lang&lt;/a&gt;, who was armed with Stormfury. In killing Kabraxis, however, Darrick became the next portal to the Black Road, his own body becoming a demonic host that he was only able to keep in check with the aid of Stormfury. Kabraxis, reduced to being just a voice in Darrick's head, taunted him in the hopes of one day driving him to suicide or defeat, which would possibly be enough for Kabraxis to return yet again. Darrick however, discovered he now had access to Kabraxis' mighty powers, and, deciding to be a force of good, used them to become a healer.\nPersonality and Traits.\nKabraxis is described as being massive and having black flesh, his body riddled with a blue fire and his horrific face crowned with a nest of vipers, all bright and different colours of the rainbow.\nAbilities.\nKabraxis is an enemy of the Three Brothers who feared him despite their superior power because Kabraxis is extremely intelligent and quite patient and content with waiting throughout the centuries for his complex machinations to slowly unfold, while &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and his brothers are more confrontational in their methods and wage war openly in the mortal realm. His ultimate plan is to eclipse &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; in Sanctuary, replacing it with a religion that worships himself as the prophet and eventually enslaving all of mankind. To this end, he has established several false religions in Sanctuary in the past. Such is the wisdom of his teachings that even after being revealed as a demon and ultimately banished numerous times, his tenets have been integrated into other religions and teachings over time."}

She only accepts &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s as payment for the unidentified items she has for sale.\nGameplay.\nKadala has permanent availability for all major item types, but items are only \"identified\" - really, generated randomly - as they are purchased from her. Most of the time these items will be magic or rare, with 10% chance to roll a , regardless of difficulty or &lt;a href=\"magic%20find\"&gt;magic find&lt;/a&gt;. There is an even smaller chance that a Legendary item will be Ancient or Primal, although as with other Primal drops, they will not appear until the player has unlocked them by completing a level 70 solo &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;. Kadala does not sell items that are only found in &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cache\"&gt;Horadric Cache&lt;/a&gt;s, but will sell &lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt;-exclusive items.\nPrices in the store:\nAll of the above can be bought in class-specific variations, if any, but that is randomly determined: for example, purchasing a weapon has a chance to award any type the character can use, including class-specific weapons. &lt;a href=\"Smart%20Loot\"&gt;Smart Loot&lt;/a&gt; \"always\" kicks in, tuning &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt;es to match the class of the buyer (unless they buy an item they cannot use).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt; available in later &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;al play has one Seal which grants a larger chance that Kadala's items will be legendary. Additionally, the Altar requires several large payments of Blood Shards to unlock all seals, and while this is mainly a check for the player's completion of the required Greater Rift level to achieve the necessary Blood Shard capacity, it does require building up Blood Shards rather than spending them immediately.\nAside from the Altar, Kadala's gambling business is the only place in the game to use &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStrategy.\nIn a new &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;, Kadala can be used to try for some early &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; upon reaching level 70. However, repeated use of her services is best avoided until her upgrade is unlocked from the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt;, so players should bank Blood Shards until then. Blood Shards can also be banked as the player nears the ability to complete a level 70 &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;, so that they are not wasted before the (admittedly slim) chance to receive a Primal item from Kadala is unlocked.\n&lt;a href=\"Amulets\"&gt;Amulets&lt;/a&gt; and to a lesser degree &lt;a href=\"Rings\"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt; are more expensive than armor items from Kadala. &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt; are even worse - in addition to the higher cost, the type of weapon cannot be chosen, unlike when using &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; to upgrade rares into s. Therefore, those item types should generally be prioritized via the Cube, while Kadala should be used to try to find armor.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally Kadala was selling items cheaply (5 Shards per armor, 10 per ring, 20 per amulet and 15 per weapon), with 0.5% (1.5% after several patches) chance to get a Legendary or Set item.\nIn patch 2.1.1, this was changed: prices increased dramatically, blood shard costs are 5x as high, but the chance to get a legendary from Kadala is now 10%. The drop rate of shards has been raised as well, for the same number of shards as before players will now walk away with 1/3 more legendary items on average.\nPrior to Patch 2.1, she always referred to items she sells in a taunting manner (for example, calling her merchandise a \"good paperweight, for which you can find a use... someday\"). However, she was originally supposed to congratulate players on winning a Legendary/Set item, and does so as of 2.1."}

He would ultimately become a master &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, an apprentice of the Guardian Dragon, &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt;. He has been elevated to the status of \"Teacher\" or Kalan in Trag'Oul's own language for his exceptional skills.\nPhysically, Mendeln was plain of feature, with dark hair and a broad nose. From the outset, he was intrigued by the mysteries of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAfter both his parents and several of his siblings succumbed to a plague that ravaged the countryside, Mendeln and his elder brother Uldyssian were left behind to tend the farm near &lt;a href=\"Seram\"&gt;Seram&lt;/a&gt;. However, this was not Mendeln's true calling: though a lifetime on the farm had hardened him, his strength was not nearly as great as that of his nine years older brother. His countenance was narrower and longer, and he had eyes that were black and glistened like dark jewels - if he stared he could unsettle almost anyone, save his brother and his good friend &lt;a href=\"Achilios\"&gt;Achilios&lt;/a&gt;.\nMendeln had pursued a scholarly life, insofar as his obligations to the farm and Uldyssian allowed him to. He used to study in &lt;a href=\"Cyrus\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;'s house, and the merchant often provided Mendeln with odd scrolls he obtained through trade. Mendeln was a scientist, fascinated by all things; be the bugs burrowing in the ground or parchments loaned to him by Cyrus. He read because he wanted to \"learn\", something his brother never truly understood.\nMendeln's life took a strange turn around the same time the other incidents occurred near Seram. It all began when Achilios showed him a strange stone-like object he had encountered in the wilderness outside town. Upon touching the stone, Mendeln experienced a queer sensation of 'agelessness', a concept which baffled him. Achilios felt something more sinister - death. When touching the stone, Mendeln froze in motion and he even stopped breathing, much to the alarm of his friend. After the initial examination, both men covered the strange stone and went back to town. However, something had changed in Mendeln.\nKeeper of the Balance.\nIt was after the contact with the strange object that Mendeln started having odd visions: he relived the final moments of the murdered cleric of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Mendeln knew it was a vision of the past. In addition, Mendeln started having blackouts - he found himself covered in dirt without knowing how it got there. As the party journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Partha\"&gt;Partha&lt;/a&gt;, even more, sinister events transpired - Mendeln could now see the spirits of the dead.\nIn Partha, Mendeln was inexplicably drawn to an ancient graveyard, where he caught a glimpse of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;. He also seemed to unconsciously learn ancient magic connected to the spirit realm. After the &lt;a href=\"morlu\"&gt;morlu&lt;/a&gt; attack, Mendeln managed to dispatch their undead leader through mysterious words of power. He also administered the dead.\nMendeln accompanied Uldyssian throughout his travels and was later introduced to both &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt; and Rathma. The latter started to train Mendeln as his successor, after noticing his affinity towards the &lt;a href=\"Balance\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt;. Mendeln bonded with the spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; through the bones of &lt;a href=\"Helgrotha\"&gt;Helgrotha&lt;/a&gt;. Later Mendeln managed to summon the &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit and imprison said spirit to a bone fragment - a feat thought impossible, even by Trag'Oul. Mendeln later returned to aid Uldyssian in the final confrontation with the Triune. During this battle Mendeln sustained heavy injuries - his right arm was severed from his body. Mendeln later managed to reanimate his severed arm, though it would never truly be a living part of him again.\nMendeln continued to assist his brother during his exploits against the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. He managed to conjure a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wall\"&gt;Bone Wall&lt;/a&gt; in the tunnels below &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;, saving his brother from enemy spellcasters. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Golden%20Path\"&gt;Battle of the Golden Path&lt;/a&gt;, Mendeln finally managed to send the ravenous spirit of Malic back into the afterlife.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; decided to spare Sanctuary, Mendeln was the only one of the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; to retain his memory, due to the intervention of Trag'Oul.\nThe Priests of Rathma.\nAs Linarian had done before him, Mendeln shed his mortal name and was given the name \"Kalan\" by Trag'Oul, meaning \"Teacher.\" The name was chosen to represent how the nature of the Balance had to be passed on to future students.\nIn the years that followed, Kalan founded the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, which would be known as \"Necromancers.\" He began to teach others his skills and impart his understanding of the Balance, while recording said knowledge in the \"&lt;a href=\"Books%20of%20Kalan\"&gt;Books of Kalan&lt;/a&gt;\". These early priests established their &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; in the jungles east of Kehjistan. Once properly trained, each of his followers ventured out on their own, seeking places where the Balance had been disrupted and working to restore it. Each of these students would continue the tradition of finding and taking apprentices. For his new priesthood, Kalan declared that all priests would display bones in their armor as symbols of their mastery over death.\nKalan became the priesthood's first &lt;a href=\"deathspeaker\"&gt;deathspeaker&lt;/a&gt;. He appointed &lt;a href=\"Daros\"&gt;Daros&lt;/a&gt; as his successor. He expressed sympathy to Daros for his nature (driven to ponder the mysteries of death), while also congratulating him for the appointment. \nLegacy.\nThe \"Books of Kalan\" were later studied by &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. He incorrectly guessed that they were written during the Sin War itself and later edited and compiled by other unknown hands.\nOver 3000 years after Mendeln's death, his &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Mendeln\"&gt;signet ring&lt;/a&gt; was recovered.

The crew members tried their best to support the ship through the storm, yet, their efforts were not paying off and the ship began to break down.\u00a0The armor of &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;, however, determined to reach Lut Gholein decided to act through\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Norrec%20Vizharan\"&gt;Norrec Vizharan&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and summoned &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to fix the ship. The sailors and passengers on board of the ship were too terrified of what Norrec had unleashed in front of them that they neglected the fact that it saved their lives. That same night, everyone save for Captain &lt;a href=\"Casco\"&gt;Casco&lt;/a&gt; decided to ride the lifeboats and abandon the ship. Those of them who survived the rising waves were later attacked by a giant squid-like demonic creature which devoured them all but Kalkos, who nonetheless was badly injured.\nKalkos's body was later found by Captain &lt;a href=\"Hanos%20Jeronnan\"&gt;Jeronnan&lt;/a&gt;, his crew,\u00a0and a young &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; known as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kara%20Nightshadow\"&gt;Kara Nightshadow&lt;/a&gt;. The dark mage used a spell to communicate with the dead body and figure out who he was and whether he was on board the ship that carried the armor of Bartuc and its presumed thief. Kara's theory proved true as the dead body confirmed witnessing a &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; summoning vile demonic creatures. As Kara continued her questioning the spell began to fade which forced Kara, who was now sure that Kalkos has been with the armor,\u00a0to cast a different spell that allowed her consciousness to\u00a0personally relive and witness Kalkos' death. Right when\u00a0her vision of what was happening began to diminish, she realized that a demon\u2014later discovered to be &lt;a href=\"Xazax\"&gt;Xazax&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was present during Kalkos's death and similarly sought to find the armor of Bartuc and the\u00a0\"fool\"\u00a0 wearing it."}

Seeing signs of Bersarik\u2019s ordeals, he asked if he was well. Kalmor realized that Bersarik intended violence against their makers, and the two came to blows. For half a day they dueled, until Kalmor used Bersarik\u2019s own axe to mortally wound him. Both warriors were shocked, for never had one of the Firstborn given such injury to another. Kalmor apologized for what had occurred, but Bersarik told him not to be. He further told Kalmor to watch him die, and in doing so, understand what had brought him here.\nAs such, Kalmor learned that the nephalem could indeed die. That \u2018\u2019he\u2019\u2019 might have died if the battle had gone differently. He did know what to do with Bersarik\u2019s &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;, but not wanting the carrion eaters to feast on it, laid Bersarik in the ground and made a cairn. True to what Bersarik had said, Kalmor understood Bersarik\u2019s rage, and he shared some of the dead warrior\u2019s anger.\nWith his task complete, the gate of the temple opened, and an &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic herald approached with a summons, saying Kalmor\u2019s battle with Bersarik had been observed from on high, and a council had been called. Kalmor obeyed the summons and entered, believing he would be punished for slaying another nephalem. However, they instead praised him for his service. They explained that the nephalem had never been given eternal life, for it was not within their power to provide it. That while the nephalem would not age or succumb to plague, they could still perish. \nKalmor asked what would be done with Bersarik\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Severian\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt;, and was ordered to destroy it. The council filed out sans &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, who took the blade and led Kalmor into the depths of the temple. There, she reforged it into a new weapon and gave it to Kalmor, ordering him to hunt down those who had travelled with Bersarik, for they shared his lust for vengeance against their makers. Kalmor obeyed.\nCorvik.\nKalmor searched &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; for Bersarik\u2019s companions, &lt;a href=\"Corvik\"&gt;Corvik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helgrotha\"&gt;Helgrotha&lt;/a&gt;. He explored the uninhabited regions, in the deep shadows beneath silent, towering forests, and across the hot sands of distant deserts. In his travels, he witnessed more nephalem succumb to death. His journey lasted years\u2014so many years, in fact, that he witnessed the Firstborn give birth to children, and their children give birth in turn. His journey took him through &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s and villages and camps, but everywhere he asked, none had seen his quarry.\nOver time, Kalmor grew disheartened in his inability to complete his quest, until one day, he came across a fellow traveler on the road. She told him of a rumor about a village where several had gone missing in a pass through the nearby hills. If Kalmor was seeking an evil that defied their forebears, perhaps it could be found there.\nKalmor thanked the traveler and went to the village, where they begged him to go no further. They promised him that only death awaited him beyond the hills. Kalmor agreed to eat and rest, but left them at dawn. As he ventured through the hills, he was reminded of Bersarik\u2019s cairn, and felt a sickness upon the land, blighting everything that attempted to grow there. \nHe eventually found Corvik in a temple she had built. The sight of her lair gave him pause, and he questioned his ability to triumph. Regardless, he entered the structure, and found Corvik, clearly insane, carving up a corpse. She claimed to worship death, that its power was greater than their makers, and through it, she would rule over them. Kalmor responded that it was Corvik\u2019s fear of death that had driven her to commit these atrocities, and asked if she was afraid, now that her death was here.\nCorvik attacked, and drew Kalmor back, claiming that he was the one who reeked of fear. Kalmor was indeed afraid, but shouted that he would slay her as he had Bersarik. Corvik accused him of lying, and asked that if this was true, what had become of his blade. Kalmor raised the blade, and claimed it had been remade. Reminded of &lt;a href=\"Gratian\"&gt;Gratian&lt;/a&gt;, Corvik was taken aback, which gave Kalmor the opportunity to cleave her in two. In her last words, she told Kalmor that she was afraid.\nKalmor was unmoved, and left Corvik\u2019s body out in the open for the carrion eaters to feed on her. He left, not bothering to stop at the village, though they beheld his exodus. \nHelgrotha.\nFor many more years, Kalmor searched for Helgrotha, the last of Bersarik\u2019s companions, and for each of those years, she eluded him. Though the nephalem continued to grow and prosper, Kalmor became discouraged. The sword felt heavier in his hand, as if it knew of its failure, and had begun to revoke the strength it afforded him. By the night, he talked to the sword, suggesting that Helgrotha was perhaps dead, that she did not move under the sun. The sword replied with a dark glint that reminded Kalmor of the midnight sky above him. He concluded (correctly) that Helgrotha only moved during night.\nKalmor took this to heart, and his wanderings acquainted him with creatures of the night, and the depths of shadow cast by moonlight. One day, he came across a great woodland, where he found no road, or even a footpath that led to it, but could feel the eyes of its creatures looking upon him. He went to a nearby inn, but none there would speak of the woodland, and the very mention of it appeared to dim the candles. Then a hunter arrived, and while Kalmor was told that only a fool would enter the forest, he nevertheless told Kalmor of a being called \u201cthe Wood Witch,\u201d who could speak with the forest\u2019s animals and have them do her bidding.\nKalmor thanked the hunter and waited at the inn for daylight. With the sun having risen, he entered the forest. Despite its dark atmosphere, he reached a glade where he found a tall stone; one that reminded him of the cairn he had built Bersarik. He sat down and waited for nightfall, where upon its arrival, he shouted Helgrotha\u2019s name.\nThe wood sent one animal after another to confront Kalmor\u2014a fox, a spider, an owl, then finally, a bear, which unlike the others, attacked him. Kalmor was disarmed and the beast rose over him, before an order was given for it to halt. Helgrotha emerged from the gloom, and having heard her call the bear \u201c&lt;a href=\"Bersarik%20%28Bear%29\"&gt;Bersarik&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d he told her that he knew that name, and asked if she had named him after the original man. She admitted as such, and that she mourned him even now. Kalmor admitted to slaying Bersarik and Corvik, but Helgrotha showed no surprise. She told Kalmor of how she had long tried to flee death, but that now, death had found her, and she was the fool. To rage in defiance of death was to hasten it, and Kalmor responded that death was earned. \nHelgrotha claimed that death was a natural part of life, but Kalmor disagreed. He saw mortality as a weakness, and given that the nephalem were immortal, he believed that they should be grateful for that. Still, he kept these thoughts to himself. He saw that Helgrotha carried no blasphemy in her heart, nor a desire for vengeance against her makers, so when asked, he told her that he had no intention of killing her. He broke his blade in two, and buried the pieaces in the glade. He told Helgrotha that he would leave, if he might go in peace. Helgrotha gave him safe passage, but told him that peace was something he would have to find for himself.\nThe Last Ancient.\nAs their powers were diminished due to &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;'s tampering with the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0he watched on with disgust as subsequent generations of nephalem became &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; and weaker. He considered killing these humans a mercy, but despite possessing the same loathing for himself, could not bring himself to end his own life. He decided that he had to seek another to end his life for him.\nBy &lt;a href=\"timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, he was apparently the last living Ancient in Sanctuary. That same year, he was confronted by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, though he did not recognise the hero as one of his kind, but merely as an ordinary human. He decided that he would put them out of their misery, but instead the Nephalem put him out of his, killing him in the battle that ensued.\nLegacy.\nMany stories were written about Kalmor after his parting with Helgrotha. The manner of his death was recorded at some point. \nIn-game.\nKalmor is a &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Brigand\"&gt;Brigand&lt;/a&gt; that can be found during the named &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Ancient\"&gt;The Last Ancient&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Passage%20to%20Corvus\"&gt;Passage to Corvus&lt;/a&gt; in of\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Note that he spawns in the fake version of the passage.\nIn combat, he has Arcane Enchanted, Fast, Teleporter and Jailer affixes, as well as triple &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Risen Servitors&lt;/a&gt; constantly come to his aid, &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Shieldman\"&gt;some of them&lt;/a&gt; carrying shields and having Reflects Damage affix. Kalmor is located in the far end of the chamber. Killing him ends the event.\nUpon death, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;The Last of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;\" lore book can be looted from his bag."}

Characters can use it in any &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; once retrieved. It was added in patch 2.3.0 and quickly became a centerpiece of endgame character &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s and item management.\nKanai's Cube allows players to benefit from 3 additional &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Item\"&gt;Legendary Item&lt;/a&gt; powers without actually equipping them, providing a significant boost to power level. It also has a variety of recipes which can improve or transform &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, making it the spiritual successor to the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLore.\nKanai's Cube is able to siphon and archive the energies of powerful items. None understand its power better than &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Hunt%20for%20the%20Three\"&gt;Hunt for the Three&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; realized they would need an artifact of immense power. Such an artifact came in the form of a device simply called \"the Cube.\" Designed by &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; the Horadrim forged the Cube over a period of weeks, as smiths hammered and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s chanted, feeling their sanity slipping all the while. The Cube was completed, but was marred by the dark methods used to complete it and disastrous results.\nFor an extended period of time, the Horadrim used the Cube as they hunted the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. None were able to wield its power more adeptly than Kulle. In time, the Cube became the center of Horadric works. Every initiative or action required it, and those who survived its creation became increasingly haunted by its presence. Aware of the dangers of corruption, and of the Cube's marred design, the Order determined that it was too dangerous for anyone to continue using it. That it had to be hidden from anyone, including them. Of all the Horadrim, only Kulle objected to the abandonment of the device, but his experiments were forced to end. As such, they created the weaker &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; in its stead, and entrusted the first Cube to a secret organization of s on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, who kept it safe from everyone, including the rest of their tribe. Throughout the years, these Barbarians served as guardians over the Cube, keeping it safe from prying eyes and those who would use its powers for evil.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, the cube was guarded by the elder &lt;a href=\"Kanai\"&gt;Kanai&lt;/a&gt;, and was his most prized possession. It was buried beneath &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Army of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Sescheron\"&gt;overran&lt;/a&gt; the city, Kanai was killed. However, his spirit could not rest, due to the destruction of Mount Arreat and the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Doomed to stand eternal vigil over his home and greatest treasure, he awaited a powerful and honorable individual to whom he might pass on his task. Such an individual came in the form of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, as the hero(es) and the spirit of Zoltun Kulle were able to retrieve the artifact and unlock its power. Many &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s have since come to learn of the power that dwells within the artifact.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; looked at the Cube. He discovered something within the artifact that caused him to reflect that everything he thought he knew about human history was now, at best, uncertain.\nThe Cube was lost at some point after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Maltheal\"&gt;Maltheal&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Order of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; searched for it, hoping to recreate the artifact without the dangers inherent with Kulle's design.\nIn-game.\nPlayers may obtain the Cube if they survive through what remains of &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; and open the ancient king's lost tomb. It is found in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Sanctum\"&gt;Elder Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, within The &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Sescheron\"&gt;Ruins of Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; in on &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; only.\nOnce recovered, the Cube is found in any &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;'s main &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, for any character on the account with the same &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;al and/or &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; status, almost like a fourth &lt;a href=\"artisan\"&gt;artisan&lt;/a&gt;, but only in Adventure Mode. It is not carried in the &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit stands next to the Cube in town and makes snide comments when its recipes are used. It allows &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; to use three additional Legendary item powers beyond those from equipped items, and also can transmute items for a variety of effects not provided by other artisans.\nAdditional Legendary powers.\nKanai's Cube provides a significant and direct gameplay impact by allowing the player to select one &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; power (which includes &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"offhand\"&gt;offhand&lt;/a&gt; items), one &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; power, and one &lt;a href=\"jewelry\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; power (&lt;a href=\"ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"amulet\"&gt;amulet&lt;/a&gt;), which then apply to the character as if those items were equipped. The powers must first be extracted from the original item using the Cube's first crafting function, \"\". These powers last indefinitely until replaced with a different power, even in &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt; when the Cube itself is not available. Thus, the Cube effectively grants three extra \"partial\" equipment slots, with the player gaining the unique power (but not the statistics) of each item selected, making it a large increase to Nephalem power. Because of the importance of these powers to character builds, they are saved and loaded along with items and skills within the &lt;a href=\"Armory\"&gt;Armory&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtracted Legendary powers are shared across all characters in any gameplay mode (&lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;al and/or &lt;a href=\"hardcore\"&gt;hardcore&lt;/a&gt;), and can even be used by multiple characters at once. The acquisition of these powers is permanent for a given gameplay mode, and powers may be replaced and reselected without additional cost. Finding Legendary powers for the Cube is just as important as finding Legendaries to equip when a new Season begins or a new account is created.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"/Archive%20of%20Tal%20Rasha%20powers\"&gt;sub-article for the extraction recipe&lt;/a&gt; for full details on usage of extracted powers.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;s have used variations on the one weapon, one armor, one jewelry arrangement.\nTransmutation recipes.\nThe Cube has several different crafting functions via transmutation, much like its predecessor the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;. Transmutation consumes most ingredients placed in the Cube to improve or manipulate &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;, or crafting ingredients, or to open portals. The known transmutation recipes are listed below.\nAn important quality of life addition compared to the Horadric Cube interface is that Kanai's Cube uses smart materials allocation: one may put \"more\" materials than needed into the Cube, the excess will simply be returned to inventory. There is no need to split materials into smaller packs with exact numbers. A recipe book also appears when using the Cube, allowing players to easily page through most recipes - although single items consumed to make portals are not included. The Fill button under each recipe automatically places the required materials for the active recipe into the Cube.\nLegendary Abilities: Archive of Tal Rasha.\nThis recipe extracts the \"essence\" from nearly any with special (orange) item power, destroying it. Characters can select three such essences at a time, causing their special legendary powers to be active as if they were actually equipped. Selecting or reselecting various powers can be repeated as much as desired without actually using a recipe; only the initial extraction costs materials.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"/Archive%20of%20Tal%20Rasha%20powers\"&gt;sub-article for this recipe&lt;/a&gt; for full details on usage of extracted powers.\nRequired materials to extract a Legendary power:\nThe transmutation will fail with no effect or consumption of materials if the item's power has already been extracted or cannot be extracted.\nCrafting Materials: Pleasure, Regret and Wrath of Iben Fahd.\nThese three recipes allows converting between any of the three non-Legendary &lt;a href=\"salvage\"&gt;salvage&lt;/a&gt;d crafting materials, in batches of 100 at a time. No other materials but these three can be converted this way.\nRequired Materials:\nThe resulting material matches the rarity of the \"controlling ingredient\" used to perform the transmutation:\nNote that the choice of recipe determines which materials are \"converted\", not the materials \"produced\", which varies based on control ingredient. Therefore, for any material desired, two different recipes could be used to obtain it. \"Pleasure\" converts to another material, \"Regret\" converts , and \"Wrath\" converts . For example, to get , either \"Pleasure\" or \"Regret\" could be used depending on which other ingredient should be converted.\n&lt;a href=\"Normal%20Items\"&gt;Normal Items&lt;/a&gt; become significantly more valuable due to this recipe - arguably more than &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt;. Their can be easily converted to , and &lt;a href=\"salvage\"&gt;salvaging&lt;/a&gt; non-magical items produces a relatively large amount of compared to the minimal received from Rares. The recipes are quite low in overhead, costing only one and one item easily purchased from a vendor. Therefore, it allows the player to treat the three materials as almost interchangeable, making quantity rather than quality the primary limitation on crafting with these ingredients.\nGems: Darkness of Radament.\nConverts exactly 9 &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt; (obviously, not &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt;) of the same color and quality into 9 gems of the same quality and different color. The result color is determined by the player's choice of \"controlling ingredient\", one of five Essences sold by &lt;a href=\"Squirt%20the%20Peddler\"&gt;Squirt the Peddler&lt;/a&gt; for 500,000 gold each.\nRequired Materials:\nObviously, it is most efficient to use this recipe with Flawless Royal gems, the highest quality possible. Of course, if the player is in urgent need of a certain gem type but does not have enough Flawless Royal ones to convert, lower quality may be used. In the long run, each quality level lower than the maximum triples the costs in Essence and time.\nThis recipe may be rendered unnecessary with frequent use of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Crown\"&gt;Broken Crown&lt;/a&gt;, which allows players to focus which type of gems they find, as well as doubling the total quantity.\nReforge Legendary: Law of Kulle.\nThis recipe completely re-randomizes \"all \" powers and statistics of any . The item is treated as if it just dropped anew; the resulting item will have none of the modifications the original may have received after being obtained, for example from &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ramaladni%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Ramaladni's Gift&lt;/a&gt;. Reforged items have a chance to be &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Legendary\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;, Primal, or non-Ancient items, \"regardless of the original item's quality\", at approximately the same rate as a regular drop. &lt;a href=\"Smart%20Loot\"&gt;Smart Loot&lt;/a&gt; is always active when reforging, so the resulting item will never have the primary stat of another class.\nThe item's identity as a Legendary item will remain the same - reforging &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Signet\"&gt;Leoric's Signet&lt;/a&gt; always results in another Leoric's Signet of some variety. Reforging also keeps the same item level, not updating the item to the current character level. Outdated items - those buffed or reworked in a patch after the original drop - will \"NOT\" change to use the patched attributes and Legendary powers, since the original and patched versions have different \"item identities\" in game code.\nRequired Materials:\nIf the item was &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed, the gem will be returned to the player's inventory without being consumed or affected by the transmutation.\nSet Items Conversion: Skill of Nilfur.\nWhen used, replaces a &lt;a href=\"Set%20item\"&gt;Set item&lt;/a&gt; with another random item of the same set, as a fresh roll, nullifying all modifications. The new Set item will never roll as an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Item\"&gt;Ancient Item&lt;/a&gt;, even if the old one was Ancient.\nRequired Materials:\nOnly Sets with at least 3 items may have their items converted. If an item that cannot be converted is placed in the cube for this recipe, the transmutation will fail with no harm to any ingredient. If the item was &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed, the gem will be returned to inventory when it is converted, with no harm or effect on the gem.\nUpgrading Rare Items: Hope of Cain.\nTurns a level 70 Rare item into a random of the same item type. The probability of rolling a specific item for a given class varies with that item's normal drop rate. Thus it cannot\u00a0award items from &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cache\"&gt;Horadric Cache&lt;/a&gt;s.\u00a0All modifications are lost, but any gems socketed are returned to inventory.\nOverall, it may be an efficient way of farming specific Legendary items or missing set pieces, even more effective than &lt;a href=\"gambling\"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kadala\"&gt;Kadala&lt;/a&gt;. It is especially useful when options for a class are limited \u2014 for example, there are only so many class-specific items, so the chances of rolling the desired one are pretty high. It is also vastly preferable to gambling for weapons, where Kadala does not allow players to select a specific weapon type, and to a lesser extent rings and amulets with their higher gambling cost.\nRequired Materials:\nCharacter Level: Work of Cathan.\nSets Character Level requirement of that item to 1, without any other effect. Cannot be used on &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt;, but can be used on items of any quality, including &lt;a href=\"Set%20items\"&gt;Set items&lt;/a&gt; and those produced or modified by other recipes. Does not use up any item power slots or &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThis recipe is of little use to regular characters, due to the fact that death is not a permanent setback in that mode. On the other side of the coin, however, it can prove extremely helpful for any &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; character, whether in a &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; or not, so long as the player has a good set of equipment in their stash to fall back on in the event of a character's untimely death.\nRequired Materials:\nAugmenting Ancient Items: Caldesann's Despair.\nThis recipe can be applied to any\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Item\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(or Primal) item, including both s. It will not work on non-Ancient Legendary or Set items.\nWhen transmuted, it will upgrade the item by adding +5 to the primary &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; of player's choice \"for each rank\" of the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt; consumed in the process. The stack of Flawless Royal &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt; consumed is the \"controlling ingredient\", using the choice of gem color to determine the core stat gained.\nThe enhancement is applied as a separate modifier, displayed below and in addition to the other bonuses of the item. This applies even when the augmentation is for a stat the item already provides, for instance two separate bonuses to Vitality, which would both be fully functional and additive. While the recipe can\u00a0be used multiple times on the same item, additional uses are \"not\"\u00a0additive: the new bonus will overwrite the old one, even if the new bonus is lower.\nRequired Materials:\nIf any extra gems are in the stack provided, only 3 will be consumed, and the rest will remain in the inventory unaffected.\nUpgrade Legendary Item: Curiosity of Lorath Nahr.\nThis recipe allows &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; to be upgraded into &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Item\"&gt;Primal Item&lt;/a&gt;s. Only one upgraded Primal Item may be worn at a time. The exact bonuses of the resulting Primal Items are freshly randomized without regard to the properties of the Legendary Item that was consumed in the process, but it will still have the same identity, similar to the process of Reforging. This recipe was introduced for &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 28, but was made permanent thereafter.\nRequired Materials:\nBecause of the very high impact &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; have on character power, both in bonuses and base damage, using this recipe on a weapon is often the first choice. However, if a high quality &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Item\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; weapon has already been obtained, it may be better used on other slots.\nPortals.\nCertain items can be placed into Kanai's Cube without any other \"recipe ingredients\", and transmuted to create a portal to a special zone:\nWhile a portal is still open, transmutation of another portal of the same type will fail, even in a different &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese \"recipes\" are not in the recipe book; players must learn about them independently and manually insert the required item.\nGreen Hills of Stranglethorn.\nConverts a page of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rock%20Ledger\"&gt;Black Rock Ledger&lt;/a&gt; into a page of same number from the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" lore book, \"Green Hills of Stranglethorn\". There is a total of 6 different pages.\nThis \"recipe\" is not in the recipe book; players must learn about it on their own and manually insert the required item.\nInfuse Legendary Power: Natala's Prayer.\nNatala's Prayer was a future planned recipe for Kanai's Cube, expected to come after patch 2.5.0."}

It is often viewed as an upgraded variant of &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wall\"&gt;Bone Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\n\"Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wall\"&gt;Bone Wall&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; with this skill can summon a spirit wall of bone in the form of an enclosing ring. This prison traps all enemies within its circumference. Imprisoned within a cage of bone, the captives are held helpless until they can summon the strength to break through its skeletal confines or the Necromancer loses his hold over the spirits. \"\nUsage.\nBone Prison is the third and last defensive skill of the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%26amp%3B%20Bone\"&gt;Poison &amp; Bone&lt;/a&gt; skill tree. It works just like &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wall\"&gt;Bone Wall&lt;/a&gt; except it surrounds and traps anyone in the targeted area, even the caster, in the middle of bones. In a defensive capacity, it can serve as a better Tank than &lt;a href=\"Golems\"&gt;Golems&lt;/a&gt;.\nBone Prison can't trap monsters and some monsters can shoot projectiles through bones.\nThe Bone Prison base hit point values are different for &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare (difficulty)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; difficulties, becoming stronger with each higher difficulty.\nSkill Progression.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; values below are for Normal difficulty.\nDuration: 24 seconds\nNote that most skill points increase prison Hit Points by +5, but every 4 skill points it is only +4, and that all synergies increase the wall HP by 8%, which is relative to the base health of the wall from direct skill points. Therefore, the optimal upgrade path, not factoring in mana cost, is to get the base Hit Points to where a synergy point gives about as much HP as a direct skill point. Then, loosely alternate between synergies and direct points so that codice_1 stays about equal to codice_2.\nThis results in an optimal strategy (roughly): Direct skill points up to level 13, synergies up to 6, direct points up to 17, synergies up to 7, direct points up to 16, synergies up to 10, direct points up to 20. There is a discontinuity on direct skill point tiers that only give +4 HP, where the immediate benefit of the point is not as great as a point in a synergy, but after a certain amount of synergy it is better to take the point anyway because the next point makes up for it.\nVariants.\nOther Bone Prison variants also enclose the target with bones, but are narrow cages of a few large, pointed bones rather than the large wall-like conglomeration of the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" Necromancer skill. Both the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;Bone Prison&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; in several games (marked as \"An Evil Force\" in \"Diablo II\") as well as the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" version of the Necromancer skill take this form. The \"Diablo III\" &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;version of the skill&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Passive%20skill%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;passive skill&lt;/a&gt; that triggers from other bone attacks rather than being cast directly, and has a much shorter duration."}

They will be called \"An Evil Force\" if you hold your mouse over them.\nDiablo is capable of casting Bone Prison from quite a long distance, so you may find your Portals trapped even if you have been fighting the Lord of Terror a screen or more away. Diablo often won't follow you that far if you run from him, so you may still be able to smash the evil force without immediate risk, however, this can still be quite dangerous as you probably ran because you were about to die. To play it safe, you can open Town Portals \"very\" far from the battle zone, such as near one of the five seals. You can also simply open another Town Portal, if you have a tome or scrolls. However, these methods are useless if you are the one trapped. At this time, the only reasonable safe method for escaping from one is to destroy it as fast as possible, or, if you're lucky, open a Town Portal inside* (Note, however, that as Town Portals return you to the same place, and the \"Evil Force\" has a very long duration (It is unconfirmed if it expires, due to the fact that most players stuck in one were more concerned about escaping before they died), it is safest to return through an alternate method, such as a Waypoint). \nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, this skill summons several Prisons, one by one, and instead of blocking a portal, it imprisons the player, allowing Diablo to teleport to them and drain a huge portion of their &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;.

It accumulates their fossilized remains and summons forth from the ground a barrier of dense, fossilized bone. This spell is an effective method for keeping adversaries from reaching a Necromancer, while allowing him to attack from range or make his escape. \"\nUsage.\nBone Wall acts as a temporary wall, allowing the user to safely attack with ranged attacks or run away. If leveled and used correctly, this skill can last the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; even into &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hit Point numbers below are only for &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Normal difficulty&lt;/a&gt;; the life of the barrier scales up with &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and Hell. It is possible for some enemies to ignore the wall and run around it to pursue the Necromancer without bothering to attack through the wall's health total.\nThe wall does not block most of the Necromancer's own missile attacks. However, in a group, this skill is of more harm than use, as for other classes it blocks both pathing and projectiles.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 17\nDuration: 24 seconds\nNote that most skill points increase wall Hit Points by 5, but every 4 skill points it is only 4, and that all synergies increase the wall HP by 10%, which is relative to the base health of the wall from direct skill points. Therefore, the optimal upgrade path is to get the base Hit Point total up to about 50, at which point a synergy point gives about as much HP as a direct skill point. Then, loosely alternate between synergies and direct points so that codice_1 stays about equal to codice_2.\nThis results in an optimal strategy (roughly): Direct skill points up to level 8, synergies up to 3, direct points up to 12, synergies up to 7, direct points up to 16, synergies up to 11, direct points up to 20. There is a discontinuity on direct skill point tiers that only give +4 HP, where the immediate benefit of the point is not as great as a point in a synergy, but after a certain amount of synergy it is better to take the point anyway because the next point makes up for it."}

When touched, the skeleton will sit up and shake its head with a rattling noise before returning to an eternal slumber, it may be enchanted with demonic magic to frighten the faint in heart, or perhaps the body still contains its tortured soul that is trying to cry out to the human that approached it.\nBurial Chests may possibly have been hurriedly constructed by humans within which to place their companions that fell in battle."}

{"id": "6702", "revid": "1263357", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6702", "title": "Bonemancer", "text": "A very popular build for the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; is the Bonemancer. This normally involves dumping most of the skill points gained into bone spells, with limited summon capability.\nBonemancers will find some elements of play difficult, as they are an abnormal form of a caster. Although there is a distinct advantage to having non-elemental magic damage, the spells take quite a while to gain potency when soloing. At higher levels and with improving gear, however, the bonemancer will become quite powerful - especially in player versus player.\nThere is slight controversy as to whether to use &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spear\"&gt;Bone Spear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spirit\"&gt;Bone Spirit&lt;/a&gt; (bone spear pierces enemies, flies faster and costs less mana, while the spirit deals slightly more damage and is homing at skill level 20 (at higher levels Spear does more damage than Spirit). Most opt for Bone Spear, as the spirit drains mana reserves very quickly, and a higher level can be achieved with the White Rune Word.\nSkills.\nThe skill settings for a Bonemancer can vary somewhat depending on gear and personal preference - some will want to max damage alone, though most will want some curses too. Lastly, some also choose to put a point in Clay Golem and its synergies, due to the fact that it makes a great tank, both for player versus player and player versus monster (it's highly recommended to at least put one point in it). Some &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; players (or people who want to play very safe) even opt to take points in &lt;a href=\"Revive\"&gt;Revive&lt;/a&gt; for the same reason.\nThe build is unique in that each offensive skill has no less than \"four\" synergies, not including the skill itself, so a fully synergized bonemancer is extremely rare.\nEquipment.\nBonemancers, like most casters, will want mostly equipment that increase their total damage output through +skills. Due to the availability of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;White Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to obtain a wand with +8 total to &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spear\"&gt;Bone Spear&lt;/a&gt;, along with a variety of other perks. But there are many choices in general, ranging from cheap to very costly. All items are listed top to bottom from the most to the least preferred (generally) though obviously, some will have different preferences or needs.\nMercenary.\nAs opposed to other necromancer variants that might choose a mercenary based on how they complement the additional minions, a Bonemancer is more concerned with his own safety and damage output. Therefore, choosing either a &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Defiance\"&gt;Defiance&lt;/a&gt; Act II &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Desert Mercenary&lt;/a&gt;, and equipping him with is the common choice.\nOthers may opt for an Act III cold &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Iron Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, who will also keep enemies at bay.\nPlaying in a group.\nIf you are intending to play in groups often, allocating some points into curses might be very helpful, particularly &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt;. The first complements casters;\u00a0the latter two are more directed at melee fighters. If it seems a heavy toll to pay skill point wise, you can always try to obtain a wand with the proper skills on it, and keep it on switch - or perhaps even implement it into your &lt;a href=\"White%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;White Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;.\nLastly, bonemancers are used in &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Uber Tristram&lt;/a&gt; in special leveling groups to keep one of the uber bosses trapped in bone walls, while the rest of the team kills off the spawned minions. This gives high amounts of experience if executed correctly.\nMaximum Damage Spearmancer.\nThis variant maxes out the unavoidable magic damage Bone Spear (or any Bone spell) can deal per second while providing substantially strong Revives that benefit from the Amplify Damage curse, as well as the Might, Concentration, and Thorns auras. This build also utilizes the high-level Bone Wall and Bone Prison spells by combining them with Iron Maiden and Thorns. A Clay Golem is employed to attract and slow enemies. Decrepify and Lower Resistance are also available without switching weapons. This build is both effective and versatile.\nStat Point Allocation.\nStrength: Place no points here; use a belt, amulet, and rings to boost strength at onset of each game then switch back to usual gear once benefiting from Enigma's strength bonus.\nDexterity: If you take melee damage often, place points here.\nVitality: Everything (except that placed in Dexterity).\nEnergy: Place no points here; equipment will compensate.\nEquipment.\nWand.\n+3 Bone Spear, +3 Skeleton Mastery, +1-3 Revive with White runeword. Skeleton Mastery mod can be replaced with +1-3 to Lower Resist or Decrepify, but this is unnecessary if using the Splendor shrunken head.\n+3 Bone Spear, +1-3 Lower Resistance, +1-3 Decrepify with White runeword. This wand eliminates the ability to use Revive, and is unnecessary with the Splendor shrunken head.\nArmor.\nArchon Plate with Enigma runeword\nShrunken Head.\n+3 Bone Spear, +1-3 Lower Resist, +1-3 Decrepify with Splendor runeword. It is necessary to have both the Magus circlet and Apprentice amulet to achieve the 90 FCR breakpoint with this head. Heavy Revive users may wish to replace a curse mod with Skeleton Mastery.\nDarkforce Spawn with Scintillating Jewel of Knowledge. Allows 90 FCR breakpoint to be achieved if the Magus circlet and Apprentice amulet are unavailable, but Bone Spear loses 1-3 points while Decrepify and Lower Resist head mods are unavailable.\nHomunculis upgraded to Bloodlord Skull with Ber or Zod if ethereal. Along with excellent blocking and defense benefits, +40 to Resistances allows the helm jewel to be replaced by a Ber rune, however, Bone Spear's rate of damage suffers while Decrepify and Lower Resist head mods are unavailable.\nHelm.\nNecromancer's Great Wyrm's Prismatic Circlet of Magus with Scintillating Jewel of Knowledge for\nHarlequin Crest with Scintillating Jewel of Knowledge\nGloves.\nMagefists (upgraded to Crusader Gauntlets)\nBelt.\nArachnid Mesh\nBoots.\nMarrowwalks\nAmulet.\nNecromancer's Great Wyrm's Prismatic Circlet of the Apprentice\nMara's Kaleidoscope\nRing.\n2 Stone of Jordans\nInventory.\nHellfire Torch; Annihilus; 6 Fungal Charms of Vita; 3 Fungal Charms of Balance; 9 Small Shimmering Charms of Vita; 1 Small Shimmering Charm of Balance\nMercenary.\nMax-Damage Revives\nAura: Might.\nEquipment (preferably all ethereal): Sacred Armor with Bramble runeword; Andariel's Visage with Ber; War Pike with Pride runeword.\nPVP Variant\nAura: Defiance.\nEquipment (preferably all ethereal): Sacred Armor with Bramble or Fortitude runeword; Guilluames's Face with Realgarl Silver Shimmering Jewel of Virility (Virility necessary to equip Sacred Armor); War Pike with Doom runeword (or Infinity runeword to benefit Corpse Explosion in PVM)\nTactics.\nTeleport close to an opponent then step away, placing your minion(s) between you; cast Amplify Damage once and attack with Bone Spear until a corpse is available for Corpse Explosion. Corpse Explosion can usually be removed from this progression in PVP.\nBone Wall can be used strategically with terrain, or be recast quickly to barricade an entire screen. Bone Prison can trap an enemy or group with a single cast, but an enemy must be present to cast it so cannot be used preemptively. Iron Maiden and Thorns is effective with both skills.\nClay Golems instantly attract even high-level monsters. They also have an abundance of Life, so benefit well from Iron Maiden and Thorns, and are sometimes useful to cast inside a Bone Prison."}

As of patch 2.7.0, it only applies to \"permanent\" minions (not to &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Mage%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Skeletal Magi&lt;/a&gt;), but in return, also makes the Revived minions permanent.\nNote that infinite Revived minions are capped to 10 at a time, making this bonus not as game-breaking as one would suspect. Trying to raise more will destroy the oldest ones. However, &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20Scarlet%20Death\"&gt;Mask of Scarlet Death&lt;/a&gt; allows raising 10 empowered minions, each composed of up to 10 corpses, even if each only counts as one minion for the purpose of the set bonuses.\nThe second bonus offers a multiplicative reduction in all damage received, and each hit has a 100% to add a stack and refresh the duration of all stacks, resulting in near permanent 75% protection.\nThe final bonus is multiplicative to other similar effects. The buff affects the Revived due to first bonus, as well as &lt;a href=\"Command%20Skeletons\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Command%20Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; only counts if coupled with &lt;a href=\"Haunted%20Visions\"&gt;Haunted Visions&lt;/a&gt;. It takes 18 minions (which is, full Skeletons + Golem + 10 Revived) to get the full effect.\nThis set works best with &lt;a href=\"Jesseth%20Arms\"&gt;Jesseth Arms&lt;/a&gt;, which complement the Skeletons damage, as well as damage of other minions. Also couples well with &lt;a href=\"Bonds%20of%20C%27Lena\"&gt;Bonds of C'Lena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Defiler%20Cuisses\"&gt;Defiler Cuisses&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally and until July 10, 2017 hotfix buff, Bones of Rathma 6-piece bonus worked slightly differently:\nThis way players would need to summon ten (instead of four) Skeletal Mages to receive the full six-piece set bonus. This made maintaining the bonus time consuming and did not allow damage to ramp up quickly at the start of combat. \nUntil patch 2.7.0, it relied on skill and minion damage, resulting in a hectic, but not player-dependent gameplay; this was later changed to empower the player's own skills instead."}

Life has taught me well that evil is inevitable and can never be truly destroyed. It can be banished, it can be thwarted, it can be driven back, but only for a time. &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; are weak, evil is seductive, and those who would do nothing in the face of malevolence are cowards.\"\n\"You seek a weapon against the Darkness rising in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I can arm you with is knowledge, so when evil finds a foothold and flourishes once again, at least I can say it was not due to ignorance.\"\n\"For untold eons, an &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt; has raged between the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic hordes of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;angelic host&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. Scholars have spilled gallons of ink and spent their eyesight in grim scriptoriums writing and debating how these two factions began, and what came before them, before us. It is said the first being, &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;, was the sum of all things good and evil, light and dark, physical and mystical, joy and sadness. The One. Anu wished to be free from the malignance of evil, and so separated and expelled the darkness within.\"\n\"But what is cast off does not simply disappear, and that darkness found its shape in the seven-headed dragon &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;, who fought ceaselessly with Anu to their mutual destruction. It is said, when the remains of these two titans settled, the universe as we know it, came into existence - all the realms of the High Heavens, the Burning Hells, and &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Tathamet's blackened husk gave birth to the Burning Hells, and each of the seven heads transformed into the Seven &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;, each with dominion over their own realm. The three most dominant of these inherited the title of Prime Evil, feeding off one another to maintain dominion and rule over the legions of the Burning Hells.\"\n\"There was &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Hatred, intelligent and cunning, father of &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, the Mother of Sanctuary. &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Destruction, corrupter of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Terror. As &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; once wrote, \"For as long as man fears the dark, Diablo will remain the most insidious and I would argue, the most powerful of all the Evils.\"\"\n\"The four &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;, no less dangerous to the people of Sanctuary, are not to be discounted on the basis of their title. Underestimating their capabilities and intentions is a sure path to our destruction. &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Lies, uses poisonous untruths to create an ever darker, fractious world. &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Pain, revels in the cacaphonous screams of those in physical agony. Even demons are no strangers to his torment. &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, the Maiden of Anguish, is the counterpart to Duriel. Whereas he delights in bodily torment, Andariel derives pleasure from anguish of the mind and &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Sin, a clever manipulator and master of temptation, loves vice in all its forms, but revels most in the failures of others.\"\n\"Demonic hordes spawned from the vile cavities of the Burning Hells - a host of ravenous, furious monstrosities that reflected the poisonous elements of their progenitor. There are demons beyond counting in the Burning Hells.\"\n\"At the center of the High Heavens lies the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;, said to be formed of Anu's spine. When it vibrates in perfect harmony, an &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; is created, embodying an aspect of what Anu had once been. The purest of these became &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s, and five rose above the rest to lead the host of the High Heavens.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, Archanel of Valor, a brilliant tactician who commanded the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s of Heaven and led them into battle with Hell, but whose pride has led to much destruction.\" \n\"&lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, former Archangel of Justice, who abandoned his rigid dedication to Justice and took up the Aspect of Wisdom instead. He supported the many causes of humanity, renounced his angelic nature, and fell to earth as a mortal. Sanctuary would have fallen to Darkness, long ago, without his aid.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, Creator of Sanctuary, served under Tyrael, and was an advisor to the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt; until he rebelled.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Archangel of Hope, who embodies the shining light of a bright future, and sees the potential for good in all things, but who is no less a warrior than the others, dispatching those who spread despair and darkness. She is said to lead the chorus of the High Heavens in harmony.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;, the Archangel of Fate, who comprehends the tangled web of fate and time - though the future of humanity remains obscure to him, unseeable, because we are not of the natural order of creation.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, the former Archangel of Wisdom, who fell to darkness and brought ruin to Sanctuary when he abandoned the Aspect of Wisdom and took up the Aspect of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;. I encountered him once, long ago, and barely escaped with my life. Few who met him after his transformation survived. After all, no one can stop Death.\"\n\"These five archangels formed the Angiris Council and ruled Heaven in harmony until Malthael abandoned Heaven. The Council fell to confusion and dissension, their unity diminished.\"\n\"Alongside Heaven and Hell, there is a third realm, and this is where our story begins and ends. Where Anu and Tathamet slew one another, their violence scarred the cosmos and birthed the plane of Pandemonium. It was here the Worldstone, also called the Eye of Anu, came to rest - a mountain sized artifact of infinite power that embodied the endless cycles of birth and death, destruction and creation. Desire to control its infinite power fueled the Eternal Conflict until Inarius and Lilith stole it and used it to create Sanctuary.\"\n\"The hour grows late. The fire is dying and the cold is unending. Come back tomorrow, if you're still alive, and I'll tell you the tale of our creation, of our creators, Lilith and Inarius, mother and father of Sanctuary, and the long, bloody history of the Eternal Conflict. For now, we should rest...and I pray your dreams are not as dark as mine.\"\nEpisode 2: Sanctuary.\nLorath narrates the creation of Sanctuary, from the theft of the Worldstone, to the rise of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, to their degradation into &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity.\nTranscript.\n\"You've returned. And with ale this time. A wise choice for this dark story. The shadows will seem longer when it's done.\"\n\"Before, we talked of Anu and Tathamet, the High Heavens and the Burning Hells, and all who reside there, embroiled in the Eternal Conflict. Now, let us speak of the creation of Sanctuary and our creators, Inarius and Lilith. Angel and demon. Our father and mother.\"\n\"The Eternal Conflict raged on, endless and all-consuming. Led by the Angiris Council, the angelic forces fought countless battles against the armies of the seven demon lords who sought to conquer all of creation. Though the High Heavens often defeated their adversaries, they also failed to destroy them, allowing evil to return again, and again, and again, ceaseless, unrelenting. Both sides claimed victories. Both suffered crippling defeats. The Conflict was a never-ending slaughter.\" \n\"Many of these battles were fought in Pandemonium, the plane said to be formed from the violent death of Anu and Tathamet, where the Heart of Creation lay: the mountain-sized artifact that would come to be known as the Worldstone, housed within the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Any who control the Worldstone would have the power to create new worlds, or unmake them with a thought. A desirable and dangerous prize indeed, it became the focus of the Eternal Conflict.\"\n\"Over the eons, the Pandemonium Fortress changed hands many times, and became a strange place, embodying the warped reality of Pandemonium as a whole, a structural and liminal place affected by the High Heavens and Burning Hells alike. Angels and demons too numerous to count have fallen at its gates. Over and over and over again.\"\n\"This endless cycle caused Inarius, advisor to the Angiris Council and under Tyrael's command, to eventually conclude that the war could never be won, and he resolved to abandon it. Elsewhere, Lilith, Daughter of Hatred, was arriving at a similar conclusion. On her father, Mephisto's role in the Eternal Conflict, Lilith once wrote: \"My father is content to fight the same battles and the same foes while everything turns to ashes. The war will never be won so long as he and his brothers lead. There is an end to it, but fools like my father are too blind to see it.\"\"\n\"Inarius and Lilith. Angel and demon. Separated by a vastness in distance and experience that is difficult to comprehend, they came to the same conclusion: they must escape the Eternal Conflict. I wonder if the cosmos had ever contemplated such an unholy alliance and divine union. I wonder if creation shuddered in horror and awe as Inarius and Lilith gathered others to their cause, fellow renegades seeking escape from the ceaseless fighting.\"\n\"The details of their meeting, like so much of our history, is obscured by the relentless passage of time and myth. But the great &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; scholar Deckard Cain tells us of Inarius, wounded or marooned in the Pandemonium Fortress, meeting with Lilith. Lilith was not spared the hatred of her father, Mephisto, and from time immemorial had awaited an opportunity to rebel. For the first time, combatants in the Eternal Conflict not only set aside their differences but also formed a union. It's difficult to imagine, but legends tell us that Inarius and Lilith formed an alliance that would alter the course of the war, reality itself, and all of existence.\"\n\"Inarius and Lilith pledged themselves to their joint cause of escaping the Eternal Conflict. United in purpose, both resourceful and wise in their way, they managed to gain control of the Worldstone, and hide it from the watchful eyes of the Heavens and the Hells. Working together, they shifted the Worldstone into a pocket dimension, hiding it from the opposing powers of the Eternal Conflict. There, they used its extraordinary power to shape a new world. A refuge free from war, free from unending strife. A Sanctuary.\"\n\"The renegade angels and demons came together to create new life, and the nature of the Eternal Conflict changed. The joining of the opposing natures within these Firstborn made beings unlike any before - beautiful abominations called &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, from which &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity would descend as inheritors of both lineages. The birthrights of the Firstborn graced them with the potential to resist the evil of the Burning Hells and to defy the dominion of the High Heavens. Because of this, many of the angels and demons who rebelled with Lilith and Inarius feared what these children might become.\"\n\"The burden of children can strain even the strongest of allies, and it seems that angels and demons are not immune to this simple truth. Surely, Inarius and Lilith could not have foreseen the cosmic consequences of their actions. Inarius was alarmed when he realized his children might surpass both angels and demons in potential. The other angels and demons fought fiercely over what should be done - whether to spare the nephalem or exterminate them. The dissent between the two groups alarmed Inarius, who called for a period of reflection.\"\n\"Lilith, driven into a mad frenzy by the threat of her children's extinction, ruthlessly murdered each and every renegade angel and demon, leaving only Inarius to discover the carnage she had wrought. Horrified by the loss of his comrades at Lilith's hand, Inarius became enraged...but still, he could not kill Lilith. Instead, he banished her from the Sanctuary they had created together. Inarius then attuned the Worldstone to diminish the powers of the nephalem over time, and disappeared in the aftermath.\"\n\"As their strength faded, generation by generation, they came to resemble mortals. No longer angelic or demonic, simply human. And as their power diminished, so too did their collective memory, until only legends of what came before remained. It is said that the Firstborn remained, immortal and undying as humankind took shape, giving rise to the cultures, kingdoms, and tribes of Sanctuary, before themselves fading into myth.\"\n\"Now you know the birth of our world and our inheritance, demonic and divine. The Eternal Conflict that rages ceaselessly in each of us. Think on that, young scholar, until we meet again. None of us is above sin, or immune to evil's seduction. Even the most righteous may fall, given the right push in the wrong direction.\"\nEpisode 3: Lord of Terror.\nLorath narrates the history of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, and the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"\".\nTranscript.\n\"Another night, and you've brought more ale.\" \n\"Stronger stuff this time.\" \n\"Essential for keeping warm here in the Fractured Peaks.\" \n\"Pour me a cup.\"\n\"Tonight is a long, sad tale of bravery and betrayal, and a great blight of destruction that changed the very fabric of our world.\"\n\"When last we spoke, we spoke of Inarius and Lilith and humankind's creation, how humanity found itself caught by the Eternal Conflict, a battle that does not belong to humankind, but one we must fight nonetheless.\"\n\"Two rival groups, the Temple of the Triune and the Cathedral of Light, sprang up on the world of Sanctuary and strove to win over the hearts of mankind.\"\n\"The Triune was secretly backed by the three Prime Evils, Mephisto, Baal, and Diablo, who had discovered Sanctuary's existence.\"\n\"Inarius secretly founded the Cathedral of Light in response, an attempt to counter their malevolent influence.\"\n\"Unbeknownst to either the Prime Evils or Inarius, Lilith returned to Sanctuary to reawaken her children's dormant powers, knowing they had the ability to banish the agents of the Burning Hells and Inarius for good.\"\n\"Soon after, Sanctuary was engulfed in what will become known as the Sin War, a catastrophic proxy war over the souls of humankind.\"\n\"Humanity won the war, but they faced another kind of battle.\"\n\"The High Heavens, too, became aware of Sanctuary and her blasphemous children, and now deliberated on humanity's ultimate fate.\"\n\"With the Angiris Council split, the Archangel Tyrael cast the final vote to spare us from extermination. Instead, the memory of all that came before was taken from humankind, including knowledge of their inherited power.\"\n\"In exchange for their part in leaving Sanctuary alone, the Burning Hells took Inarius into their custody, and it is said that he has suffered unending torment at their hands ever since.\"\n\"Of course, it is not the nature of the Burning Hells to leave well enough alone, and before long, more attempts to corrupt humankind were underway.\"\n\"The Lesser Evils, led by Azmodan and Belial, staged an uprising that upset the established order of the Burning Hells.\"\n\"Convinced the Prime Evils had abandoned the Eternal Conflict in favor of corrupting humanity, the usurpers set out to banish the three Prime Evils to Sanctuary. They lost fully one third of their army, but they succeeded in banishing Mephisto, Baal and Diablo into the mortal realm, in what would come to be known as the Dark Exile. They spent decades spreading terror, hatred and destruction across the land.\" \n\"It is here that the story of the Horadrim begins, when Tyrael assembled a group of powerful mages and tasked them with humanity's defense, standing fast against the tyranny of the Prime Evils and guarding against the wrathful eyes of the Heavens falling upon humankind once again.\"\n\"Tyrael carved three Soulstones from pieces of the Worldstone, crystalline prisons designed to contain the malignant essence of a Prime Evil. Sapphire for Mephisto, amber for Baal, and crimson for Diablo.\"\n\"Under Tyrael's guidance, the Horadrim searched across the vastness of Sanctuary for the Lords of Hell, with the aim to contain them.\"\n\"The Horadrim found Mephisto and, after much struggle, imprisoned him. The sapphire Soulstone was given to the Zakarum for safekeeping.\"\n\"They also battled Baal, but, in the process, the Soulstone intended for him was shattered. The order's leader, Tal Rasha, trapped Baal's essence in the largest shard of the amber Soulstone, but feared that was insufficient. The Horadrim concluded they could fuse the shard to a human body in an effort to better contain Baal's power.\"\n\"Tal Rasha selflessly volunteered his own body to contain the Lord of Destruction's raging essence. Tyrael himself took up the solemn duty of driving the shard into Tal Rasha's heart. The grieving Horadrim sealed away their noble leader within a subterranean tomb, believing they were leaving him to suffer torment beyond imagination as he struggled to hold fast the monstrous Lord of Destruction for all of time.\"\n\"In the wake of this tragedy, Jered Cain took leadership of the bruised and battered mages.\"\n\"Together, the Horadrim spent nearly ten years following Diablo's path of terror through Sanctuary, until finally coming to blows and containing him within the crimson Soulstone. Diablo's Soulstone was carefully hidden deep in a labyrinthian cave system by the Horadrim. To guard the great evil hidden in its depths, a Horadric monastery was built atop the caves.\"\n\"The hope, I believe, was that it would never be disturbed, and that Diablo would be forgotten in the great below, his influence fading with time.\"\n\"But that was not to be.\" \n\"No prison can last forever.\" \n\"So long as a key exists, its door can be opened.\"\n\"The land near that small monastery would eventually be settled when the quiet, prosperous town of Tristram was founded there. None could have known, except, perhaps, Diablo, the grim fate that would befall the unfortunate souls that called Tristram home.\"\n\"Over time, foreign powers influenced the land, and Tristram became politically significant. At the behest of the Zakarum church, and guided by Archbishop Lazarus, a Zakarum lord named Leoric crowned himself King of Khanduras and made Tristram his capital. He converted the old Horadric monastery into his seat of power, unaware of the threat that lurked beneath.\"\n\"Leoric was wise and just, ushering in an era of peace and prosperity for Tristram. But with time, his outlook darkened and he grew irrational, his mind slipping towards madness and paranoia. The king began ordering the execution of any who questioned him, and people started calling him the Black King.\"\n\"He declared war on the neighboring kingdom of Westmarch, in part thanks to Lazarus's counsel. An unjust and unwinnable war. Leoric's eldest son, Aidan, joined the fight, seeking approval from his father.\"\n\"Shortly after Aidan's departure, Leoric's youngest son, Albrecht, went missing.\"\n\"Leoric tortured and executed many of his own people in his frenzy to find his son. His knights, freshly returned from the war and appalled at the state of their kingdom, were forced to slay the Black King to stop the brutality. In an attempt to honor the man he had been, Leoric was given a proper burial in the old catacombs.\"\n\"Aidan, too, returned to find a kingdom in shambles. Rumors of the horrific happenings in Tristram spread, along with the news of the appearance of demonic creatures, and brought adventurers to Tristram.\"\n\"Two such adventurers joined Prince Aidan when he entered the catacombs to find his brother, Albrecht. During this harrowing journey, Aidan was forced to strike down his own father, who had been reanimated as a foul entity called the Skeleton King.\"\n\"Continuing on, Aidan soon found Diablo himself. After a great battle of fire and steel, the Lord of Terror was defeated. But this ending is not a happy one, for Diablo had twisted young Albrecht's body into his own demonic form. In slaying the demon, Aidan had slain his younger brother. Distraught, Aidan pulled the Soulstone from Albrecht and plunged it into his own body.\"\n\"In the weeks that followed, Aidan would seek comfort with a local witch named Adria. Slowly succumbing to Diablo's influence, Aidan eventually traveled east from Tristram and became known as the Dark Wanderer, set on liberating Baal and Mephisto.\"\n\"As the Dark Wanderer traveled east, a new group of adventurers arrived in Tristram. They rescued Deckard Cain from the ruins of Tristram, who implored them to give chase.\"\n\"Soon, the party found themselves taking part in a dangerous pursuit of the Lord of Terror. Following the Dark Wanderer's path towards the Tomb of Tal Rasha, the adventurers would face the Lesser Evils of Andariel and Duriel, who had rallied to Diablo's aid. Instead of Tal Rasha, they discovered Tyrael imprisoned in the tomb.\"\n\"Baal, still using Tal Rasha as a vessel, had escaped imprisonment to join Diablo in his guise as the Dark Wanderer. Together, they had overcome Tyrael and trapped him in the prison he'd made for Baal so long ago.\"\n\"The heroes pressed on to find Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, deep in the jungles of Kurast. Once more, the heroes were too late to stop Diablo, as he shed what little of Aidan remained, reverting to his monstrous, demonic form, before returning to the Burning Hells to rally his demonic legions.\"\n\"Mephisto remained behind, believing he could defeat the brave pursuers. His confidence was misplaced. The Lord of Hatred was defeated and sealed in the sapphire Soulstone.\"\n\"The heroes followed the Lord of Terror into the Burning Hells, thinking only of Sanctuary and not the grim fate that likely awaited them there.\"\n\"At Tyrael's request, the heroes confronted the corrupted angel Izual on the Plains of Despair. In slaying him, the heroes freed Izual's spirit, and he informed them that the Prime Evils knew how to corrupt the Soulstones.\"\n\"With this information, Cain sent the heroes to the Hellforge to destroy the sapphire Soulstone, in the hope that this would prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again.\"\n\"Once there, they had to defeat a demon called Hephasto the Armorer, a towering monstrosity with wide horns, his powerful arms strengthened by thousands and thousands of strikes with his Hellforge Hammer against the Anvil.\"\n\"After successfully destroying the sapphire Soulstone, the heroes traveled deep into the wastes of the Burning Hells to face the Lord of Terror himself.\"\n\"They fought a fierce pitched battle against increasingly dire odds, deep in Diablo's own realm. But the heroes fought and defeated Diablo. They pulled the shard from Diablo's head, trapping his essence inside, and returned to the Hellforge to destroy it as well.\"\n\"With this momentous achievement, only Baal remained to threaten Sanctuary.\"\n\"Unfortunately for us, even one Prime Evil can unleash inconceivable devastation. As the heroes struggled with Diablo in Hell, Baal, Lord of Destruction, set his demonic army on a course to Mount Arreat, annihilating all in his path on the way to his prize, the Worldstone.\"\n\"Survivor accounts describe the Prime Evil atop his litter, surveying the Barbarian city of Sescheron with ravenous malice and an insatiable lust for carnage.\"\n\"His vision for Sanctuary was a wasteland stained with blood. It is both humbling and horrifying to know how close he was to achieving that goal.\"\n\"Thanks to the bravery of the Barbarians in the town of Harrogath at the base of Mount Arreat, Baal's army was temporarily repelled, buying time enough for reinforcements, and the heroes that had slain Diablo and Mephisto, to arrive.\"\n\"They fought their way through Baal's army, up the mountain and, finally, into the very heart of Sanctuary, the Worldstone Keep.\"\n\"Though our heroes ultimately defeated Baal, they could not stop his poisonous malice from infecting the Worldstone.\"\n\"A difficult choice had to be made, and so it was.\"\n\"Tyrael chose to destroy the Worldstone rather than let it fall to corruption. He hurled his great sword, El'druin, at the Worldstone, shattering it. Some of its shards fell to earth, imbued with power. The Worldstone was nearly as large as the mountain that housed it, and its destruction turned the imposing peak of Mount Arreat into nothing more than a vast crater.\"\n\"Local settlements and tribes scattered to the wind, many forced to seek new homes. And it is in this new world, deeply wounded by the treachery of the Prime Evils, that the next chapter in our history unfolded.\"\n\"The tragic tale of Leah, Diablo's assault on Heaven, and Malthael's betrayal, and why so few of us remain.\"\n\"Take care in the darkness.\"\n\"There's more lurking out there than the wind.\"\nEpisode 4: End of Days.\nLorath narrates the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\". It concludes in the time period of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", after &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;'s return.\nTranscript.\n\"Come in. Sit down. You've let all the bloody heat out.\"\n\"This is the coldest night I can recall in these frozen wastes.\"\n\"I am no chef, but I have managed a stew from what little food remains.\"\n\"Fortify yourself, for this is the final story I have to tell you, and you will need your strength to endure.\"\n\"This is the tale of the End of Days.\"\n\"I told you of the brave heroes that defeated Diablo and Baal, and of the destruction of the Worldstone and Mount Arreat by Tyrael, the Archangel of Justice.\"\n\"In the aftermath, his essence dispersed. And though no angel had done so before, Tyrael was able to restore his form in the realm of Pandemonium.\"\n\"After decades away, Tyrael returned to the High Heavens. There, he tried to convince his fellow members of the Angiris Council that they were meant to protect the innocent, and that the fate of humanity was pivotal to the future of the Eternal Conflict.\"\n\"However, they remained committed to their laws, leaving Tyrael no choice but to renounce his angelic nature, shedding his wings to embrace mortality before being cast out of the Heavens. And so he fell willingly to Sanctuary, a shining star that landed in the ruins of Tristram Cathedral.\"\n\"New Tristram had established itself just outside the ruins of its predecessor, a thriving settlement home to Deckard Cain and his young ward, Leah. She was the daughter of Adria, who had once lived in Tristram, and grew into a wise young woman under Cain's mentorship.\"\n\"A group of adventurers from across Sanctuary set out to investigate the fallen star. Instead, they found a man who had lost his memory. In an effort to help this fallen stranger, Cain sent adventurers to recover the man's sword, broken and scattered in the surrounding lands.\"\n\"The quest would cost Deckard his life at the hands of Maghda, the powerful leader of a fanatical coven devoted to Belial. With his last breaths, Cain managed to repair the stranger's sword. In doing so, he repaired Tyrael's memory, as well as the Sword of Justice itself, El'druin.\"\n\"For this deed and for many, many more, I believe history will judge Deckard Cain amongst the greatest Horadrim, representing the best of what the Horadric Order can be. His contributions to the Horadrim, and to humanity, cannot be overstated.\"\n\"The day he left us was a dark day for us all. In that moment of deep loss and grief, Leah was overcome by a dark power within herself. When the power burst free, it was strong enough to drive Maghda away. This was the first sign that her destiny was cruelly marked by forces greater than any knew.\"\n\"After Cain's death, the adventurers, Leah and Tyrael, tracked Maghda to Caldeum, where, unbeknownst to them, Belial was impersonating the ruler of the region.\"\n\"Their pursuit ended in the dry deserts of Kehjistan, where they confronted Maghda and struck her down, avenging Cain's death. The heroes found another ally in Adria, Leah's mother, who wanted to help her daughter contain the growing darkness. She helped them uncover the location of the Black Soulstone, an extraordinary artifact created by the renegade Horadrim Zoltun Kulle, which could trap multiple essences of both angel and demon, then permanently destroy them.\"\n\"Black Soulstone in hand, they confronted Belial and revealed his great deception. Defeating him, they sealed him inside this Soulstone prison. But as we have seen time and time again, evil is never idle.\"\n\"Azmodan, the Lord of Sin, had undertaken an audacious invasion of Sanctuary, seeking the Black Soulstone for himself. All the Great Evils, save he and Diablo, had been trapped in the Soulstone, giving Azmodan an opportunity to become the Prime Evil. His vast demonic army erupted from Arreat Crater, the scar left behind by the Worldstone's destruction.\"\n\"The party hurried to aid the forces of Bastion's Keep, the only defense against Azmodan's forces. Though the fortress had been battered, the adventurers fought through legions of demons and overcame the Lord of Sin at the heart of the crater, sealing him in the Black Soulstone as well.\"\n\"It seemed as though the tide was turning in humanity's favor. But Adria had other plans. She had lied about the Black Soulstone, having used it to mark the souls of all seven Great Evils for containment, while leaving Diablo unbound. The witch then offered Leah, her own daughter, as a vessel for Diablo's return - an act she had planned since her child's conception.\"\n\"When Aidan sought solace with her in Tristram, Adria had already pledged herself to the Lord of Terror's service. Under the guise of her care, she used the prince's torment to her advantage, allowing Diablo to deepen his hold on the prince. When he left as the Dark Wanderer, so too did Adria. Soon after, she bore his child, Leah, whom she left in Caldeum under a friend's care. Children should not be punished for their parents' sins, no matter how grave they may be.\"\n\"From the moment of her birth, Leah's fate was tied inextricably to Diablo, his essence part of her creation. With Adria's betrayal revealed, Diablo seized control of the Black Soulstone, using it to channel the essences of all the Lords of Hell into himself. Brimming with power, he twisted Leah's body into a new, horrific form - the Prime Evil.\"\n\"With his newfound strength, he set his eyes on a prize far greater than our world - the utter destruction of the High Heavens. With his unheralded power, The Lord of Terror breached the Diamond Gates of the High Heavens. He single-handedly routed Imperius, leader of the Angiris Council, with barely a thought.\"\n\"The Prime Evil opened Hell Rifts inside the Silver City, unleashing the minions of the Burning Hells, leaving him to continue towards the Crystal Arch. As demons ravaged the Silver City, the heroes came to Heaven's aid. They fought their way through hordes of demonkind, aiding the Heavens where they could, and soon arrived atop the Silver Spire to battle Diablo himself.\"\n\"Against all odds, the Prime Evil was defeated, his essence trapped in the Black Soulstone. Tyrael returned to the Angiris Council as a mortal, now embodying the Aspect of Wisdom.\" \n\"And, for a moment, it seemed like Sanctuary might see peace.\"\n\"But, as you know well, peace does not last.\"\n\"All was not well with the High Heavens. Decades before Diablo's assault on the High Heavens, Malthael had abandoned the Council, the Heavens, and his position as the Aspect of Wisdom. The ravages of the Eternal Conflict must have taken their toll on Malthael's mind.\"\n\"I often wonder what he saw that convinced him to forsake Wisdom for Death.\"\n\"Malthael had long desired an end to the Eternal Conflict, and finally saw his chance with Diablo's defeat. With the seven Great Evils gone, he turned his attention to humanity. But Malthael was not interested in winning our hearts and minds. His solution was far simpler, far colder. To Malthael, humanity would never be more than demonspawn. And for the Eternal Conflict to reach its conclusion, all demonkind needed to be eradicated.\"\n\"But to achieve his ultimate goal, Malthael had to retrieve the Black Soulstone, which was now in the hands of what remained of the Horadrim. I likely owe my life to El'druin. In that first confrontation with Malthael, in the black tunnels of the Tomb of Rakkis, I faced Death himself.\"\n\"As my brethren fell and died, I was protected behind a magical shield that Tyrael raised using his sword. When we emerged onto the city streets, we were met with horror beyond comprehension.\"\n\"Prize in hand, Malthael and his Reapers laid waste to Westmarch. The grisly slaughter I witnessed there nearly destroyed me. They were harvesting the souls of the people, and with each death, Malthael grew more powerful. Malthael soon took the Black Soulstone to the Pandemonium Fortress, where he began to manipulate its power.\"\n\"Struggling to find where he had gone, the adventurers turned to the only person on Sanctuary who might know Malthael's location - the traitor Adria. The witch, however, did not wish to cooperate, and transformed into a terrifying monster, empowered by blood magic. Delivering final justice against Adria's betrayal, they struck down the abomination and set out for the Pandemonium Fortress to confront Malthael.\"\n\"By the time they arrived, it was too late. Malthael had already sent the Black Soulstone to Sanctuary, and it was fulfilling its dark purpose - tearing the demonic essence out of every single person. Freeing the spirits of their own kin and leaders, the heroes became one with death, and were finally able to fight against Malthael on even ground. A great battle ensued, and in a last-ditch effort to secure victory, Malthael shattered the Black Soulstone to take on the power of the Great Evils still trapped inside.\"\n\"The heroes valiantly rallied in defense of Sanctuary, the power of the spirits within allowing them to defeat Death itself. The aftermath of Malthael's use of the Black Soulstone saw Tyrael gone from Sanctuary, and countless dead.\"\n\"What happened to Diablo remains a mystery that haunts me.\"\n\"I chose solitude and ale over futile efforts to bring Light back into our world. But there are times, such as this, where I feel hope struggling to take root once more. But to hope for salvation while doing nothing to attain it brings only ruin. I have learned this many times over. Judge a person by their actions, not their words.\"\n\"Lilith has returned. You sense the Daughter of Hatred in the growing shadows, as do I. I can no longer fight with steel and blood, but perhaps the knowledge I've shared will act as an armor in your own battle with the coming darkness.\"\n\"Take care, young scholar, wherever your path may lead you.\"\n\"I hope for your sake it leads down a different path than mine.\""}

In Tyrael\u2019s own words, \u201cForevermore we shall stand together, &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and men, in the light of this glorious new dawn.\u201d\nDevelopment.\n\"Book of Tyrael\" followed up from \"Book of Cain\" in as much that it was to cover material that the original sourcebook did not have time or room to cover (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;'s backstory). Additionally, it was designed to tie-in with game content and serve as a bridge between \"Diablo III\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". The book was originally going to be titled \"Book of Leah,\" featuring Leah's notes, and the book's structure and tome reflecting this. Originally, Tyrael would take over in terms of the in-universe writing. As the book was developed, the writers realized that the book was really Tyrael's, so the name was changed along with other adjustments. Leah herself was the focus of additional character development.\nOther examples of cut content include the faction and character lists. However, even these were subject to time and space constraints. Cut info may be implemented in a future tome.\nReferences.\n \u200b"}

In the current day, after the empire's collapse, the Borderlands are all that remains of said empire, and encompass its current borders.\nLore.\nA wasteland that surrounds &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, the Borderlands are among the most savage lands in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Barren yellow sand stretches for miles, and hostile wildlife roams this region. Desert habitation by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s is possible in the Borderlands, but not easy. Mules are of limited use in these wastes as the sands are constantly shifting.\nHistory.\nThe Borderlands were originally devoid of any but the most hardened (some would say crazed) prospectors until the great military city of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Bahadur\"&gt;Lut Bahadur&lt;/a&gt; (literally, \"city of the gate\") was built to keep the &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt; in their cliff dwellings safely away from Caldeum. Lut Bahadur's solitary watch over the desolate wastes came to an end c. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23c.%20885\"&gt;885&lt;/a&gt;, when precious ore was discovered in the region known as the &lt;a href=\"Stinging%20Winds\"&gt;Stinging Winds&lt;/a&gt;. The town of &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt; was quickly established as the center of all mining in the area, with several other smaller settlements springing up in its wake. When the &lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur Oasis&lt;/a&gt; was discovered and a third town was erected there, Caldeum's dominance over the Borderlands was complete. The Borderlands could reliably depend on fresh supplies of food and water from Dahlgur's caravans, protected by the might of Caldeum's &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Guard\"&gt;Dune Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the rule of &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt; however, circumstances changed for the worse. He withdrew the support of Caldeum from the wastes, and those who lived there were left to their own devices. Caravans were left vulnerable, and refugees streamed towards the capital. They brought dark tales with them\u2014rumors of a &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;secret cult&lt;/a&gt; intent on raising a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic army. Furthermore, the area suffered from drought.

No mercy, no escape. Death or glory. Even to start a boss fight, all players in a group must click the \"Yes\" button. However, &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; bosses are spawned in usual locations, and it is possible (nobody said \"easy\") to escape the battle with them.\nBosses are characterized by their massive amounts of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, many unique abilities they do not hesitate to use in combat (some of them capable of one-shot killing a hero, but usually boss skills are predictable and can be avoided), as well as increased damage. Many bosses are also assisted by hordes of &lt;a href=\"minions\"&gt;minions&lt;/a&gt;, and may summon more at will.\nOverall, boss fights are focused on player skill rather than raw damage per second and damage control, so players need to put all their effort into fight (unless, of course, they are \"way\" too overpowered for that boss and &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;).\nAll bosses in Diablo II and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" count as &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, and all bosses in Diablo I and Diablo III are &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, indicated by the color of their names.\n&lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; bosses in \"Diablo Immortal\" and many bosses in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", have an &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20Timer\"&gt;Enrage Timer&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" includes a stagger system for some monsters, including bosses.

Incomplete bounties carry over to the next day, with up to 3 days' worth of bounties being held. Completing 4 bounties in a single day gives a player a bonus. Bounty chests will sometimes grant the player &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20item\"&gt;Legendary item&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBounties could originally be done as part of a group, but were changed to be solo-only affairs. \nBounties are by default provided in sets of 4, all taking place in the same zone. If a player replaces one bounty with another, a situation can develop where the bounties are spread over different zones. \nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Precipice%20of%20Horror\"&gt;Precipice of Horror&lt;/a&gt; update, bounties can be combined into &lt;a href=\"Hellslayer%20Bounties\"&gt;Hellslayer Bounties&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn the update, the prompt to search for a party was removed from the Bounty Board and replaced with a button to manually search for a party.\nDiablo III.\nBounties are a randomized objective system available in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; of \"\". Upon starting an Adventure Mode session, five random bounties for each act are made available, for a total of 25. They are marked on the &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; map by yellow exclamation marks, and always occur in different zones from each other. Joining a new game session resets and re-randomizes the bounties in every act, regardless of which were completed or not in the previous session.\nBounties generally award &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to any normal rewards of an &lt;a href=\"Event%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cache\"&gt;Horadric Cache&lt;/a&gt;s are rewarded for completing all five Bounties of an Act in one game session. They contain a mix of random loot, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, crafting recipes, and &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; and crafting materials specifically limited to Caches for that Act. The \"Bountiful\" seal of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt; doubles the number of Horadric Caches per completed Act once unlocked, a bonus that originally appeared as a perk for &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 15.\nTypes of Bounties.\nThere are six distinct types of Bounties: Kill a &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;, Kill a &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt;, complete an &lt;a href=\"Event%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Event&lt;/a&gt;, Clear a Dungeon, Exploration and Bounty Grounds. Only one Bounty per zone can be offered in a single game session. In each Act, \"exactly\" one boss bounty is always offered (except for Act IV; &lt;a href=\"%23Kill%20a%20Boss\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;), and at least one unique-killing bounty is as well; the rest is a random mix.\nFor non-exploration bounties, the objective location flashes on the in-zone map even from far away. When approached close enough, the target's exact location is highlighted (exact distance depends on the zone size). Each bounty is marked at a specific &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt;, but most can be accessed from another side by taking the waypoint to the next zone and going backwards, which can be helpful to reach some more quickly. This trick never works with bosses, however - the exits from boss lairs do not function \"in reverse\" in Adventure Mode until the boss is defeated.\nKill a Boss.\nThis is a standard fight with one of the &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es (not necessarily end bosses) of each Act. The &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; are not very close to bosses other than &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, so the player needs to get through at least one zone to reach them. In addition to the bosses from &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt;, the Adventure-only &lt;a href=\"Vidian\"&gt;Vidian&lt;/a&gt; can be selected as the bounty boss for &lt;a href=\"Act%20II%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt; sometimes does not have a boss bounty, and instead assigns either &lt;a href=\"Hammermash\"&gt;Hammermash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sledge\"&gt;Sledge&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mallet%20Lord\"&gt;Mallet Lord&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Rift\"&gt;Hell Rift&lt;/a&gt; - as an additional kill bounty.\nWhen a bounty boss is killed, in addition to normal loot, a &lt;a href=\"Diabolic%20Hoard\"&gt;Diabolic Hoard&lt;/a&gt; reward chest appears, which contains loot similar to a &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Chest\"&gt;Radiant Chest&lt;/a&gt; but with an unusually large amount of &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt;. It is not required to clear any other bounties before completing a boss bounty and looting the Hoard. Hammermash and Sledge do not award this chest.\nKill a Unique.\nOne &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique or Super-Unique monster&lt;/a&gt; in the Act is assigned to be killed. Other Uniques and Super-Uniques may still appear normally in the same zone. In addition to the primary target, a number of other enemies in the same zone must also be killed, the amount varying depending on the zone size (25 to 150). The only exceptions without secondary objectives are Uniques that spawn in \"very\" small zones, such as the &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Rift\"&gt;Hell Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvent.\nA specific &lt;a href=\"Event%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Event&lt;/a&gt; must be completed. These include scripted events, &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Chest\"&gt;Cursed Chest&lt;/a&gt;s, and even unmarked events. The bounty reward is still earned even if bonus objectives are not completed.\nClear a Dungeon.\nThe player must kill all enemies (except resurrected and summoned foes) in a specific single-level dungeon or in the bottom-most level of a multi-level dungeon. When 15 or less enemies remain, they are highlighted on the map. Only small dungeons with no more than 100 enemies can be selected for this type of bounty.\nExploration.\nExploration bounties require either rescuing allies, eliminating enemies, or finding objects in multiple locations within the zone. The in-zone map points towards objectives from a medium-to-long distance away, but some exploration may still be required to find them all, since they do not flash on the map from an unlimited distance like other bounties do.\nBounty Grounds.\nBounty Grounds are special zones entered through a red portal found in normal zones, marked like other objectives on the in-zone map. Inside, one of four events must be completed:\nList of Bounties.\nAct IV.\nBosses.\nNote that it is possible for any game session to choose no boss bounty for Act IV, and instead assign Hammermash or Sledge as an additional unique-killing bounty. Also note &lt;a href=\"Iskatu\"&gt;Iskatu&lt;/a&gt; does not appear in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo IV.\nIn \"Diablo IV\", bounties are given out by the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;Tree of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;."}

Many choose to have a well-allocated Valkyrie, either maxed out Strafe or Multiple Shot and the rest of the points \"arranged to taste.\" Some will prefer putting extra points in the &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Penetrate\"&gt;Penetrate&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Pierce\"&gt;Pierce&lt;/a&gt; tree. Others prefer building on the elemental branches to deal with the Physical Immunes.\nEquipment.\nBowazons typically have less to worry about in regards to gear. Most of the time, Bowazons are out of harm's way and are able to substitute a lot of magic find items should a player decide to \"farm\" for gear. On the other hand, there are plenty of options should the player decide that monsters need to die more quickly.\nWeapon.\nMany of the Exceptional Unique bows have attributes which can be useful. &lt;a href=\"Riphook\"&gt;Riphook&lt;/a&gt; may not have the awesome damage of Windforce, but the Open Wounds and Slows Opponent attributes could be of significant assistance with a good tank that allows her to remain in the background while she peppers her opponent with debilitation. &lt;a href=\"Witchwild%20String\"&gt;Witchwild String&lt;/a&gt; could have the same be said for it. An Amplify Damage proc, when applied with Strafe could prove to be most helpful in dispatching Physical Immune or monsters with a lot of life, but is often sneered at because it doesn't do a lot of damage. This list is pared down to the five popular bows, but do not be afraid to look through the list of , &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Crossbows\"&gt;Crossbows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Weapon%20Rune%20Words\"&gt;the rune words for bows&lt;/a&gt; for others.\nBuff combination: A popular choice for those who obtain a , having it and a in the shield slot coupled with a lot of generic +skills items such as can grant significant buff to the party's mana and life, not to mention the +1 to all skills granted from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Command\"&gt;Battle Command&lt;/a&gt; war cry.\nFighting Immune to Physical monsters on Hell difficulty.\nMagic Arrow.\nSince ranged attack is also physical, no , &lt;a href=\"Multiple%20Shot\"&gt;Multiple Shot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Guided%20Arrow\"&gt;Guided Arrow&lt;/a&gt; will work on these creatures. This might prove difficult for some players, but more experienced players will use &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Arrow\"&gt;Magic Arrow&lt;/a&gt; skill, since its pure magic attack and it doesn't spend player's arrows.\nImmolation Arrow.\nIn areas with Physical Immune monsters and a powerful Valkyrie and a decent Pierce, fire, particularly &lt;a href=\"Immolation%20Arrow\"&gt;Immolation Arrow&lt;/a&gt; can be quite a handy skill. However, without significant investment, this skill tree is of minimal assistance in Hell Difficulty. The cooldown between each shot significantly reduces damage per second.\nFreezing Arrow.\nEven with the short chill duration, cold is still quite a popular choice for diversifying attack types. The same as Fire, it is fairly disappointing without spending a significant amount of skill points in it. There is a perk, however, to building on &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Arrow\"&gt;Freezing Arrow&lt;/a&gt;'s synergy, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Arrow\"&gt;Ice Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, for the increase in chill duration. Unlike Immolation Arrow, this attack has no cooldown and can be spammed.\nHireling.\nAlthough many players solo with their characters, Hirelings can certainly increase the survivability of any character if maintained properly. Typically, most choose the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Act 2 Defensive Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; in Nightmare Difficulty (the \"Holy Freeze Merc\") or the Offensive version (the \"Might Merc\"), but the others have plenty of potential if geared properly. The Helmet and Armor are standard choices, the only thing that would vary are the weapons. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Act 3 Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; with cold attacks used to be popular, but are rare now due to many monsters being immune to their attacks. Although &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarian Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are quite rugged, they can be overcome by large mobs. On the other hand, properly equipped, he can definitely play a major factor in increasing the character's survivability. And the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; should not be counted out either, although without particular gear her ability to assist in later stages of the game diminishes by quite a bit. Although the weapons vary, the armor and helmet choices are mostly stock, with some variance in regards to armor.\nWeapon.\nBarbarians (Act 5).\nThere are numerous swords that a Barbarian can use that listing them all would be impractical. Here are four uniques and four rune words particularly beneficial to them:"}

Bows use &lt;a href=\"arrows\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; to fire (one per shot), while crossbows use &lt;a href=\"bolts\"&gt;bolts&lt;/a&gt;. Amazons specializing in ranged combat typically choose bows over crossbows, due to comparatively fast attack speed and low Strength requirements. &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt; hirelings can equip bows in the expansion.\nLike crossbows, bows are compatible with Amazon &lt;a href=\"Bow%20and%20Crossbow%20Skills\"&gt;Bow and Crossbow Skills&lt;/a&gt;, magic and rare bows can have Amazon skill es and Dexterity es, and bow damage scales with the wielder's Dexterity, with each point of Dexterity equivalent to 1% enhanced damage.\nThe expansion also has a category of Amazon bows, which count as bows as well as &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Weapons\"&gt;Amazon Weapons&lt;/a&gt;.

Bows do not require ammunition, but can be paired with &lt;a href=\"quivers\"&gt;quivers&lt;/a&gt;. Bows are second only to &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Crossbows\"&gt;hand crossbows&lt;/a&gt; in firing speed. Melee classes and s may not use bows, but can equip the &lt;a href=\"Scoundrel\"&gt;Scoundrel&lt;/a&gt; with them.\nAs of Patch 2.1, all bows drop with &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; bonus only. Bows can roll bonuses to maximum &lt;a href=\"Discipline\"&gt;Discipline&lt;/a&gt; as of patch 2.2.0.\nBows may not be &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrified&lt;/a&gt; into any other item type."}

By foot, it is a few days' journey from the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nAn ancient city, Bramwell consists of stone buildings two and three stories tall, the stones cut and carried from the nearby mountains. Forest surrounds the city on three of its sides, while the fourth faces out to the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Gulf of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. It is fed by the &lt;a href=\"Sweetwater%20River\"&gt;Sweetwater River&lt;/a&gt;, which allows small ships to navigate farther inland, and provide irrigation to the farms surrounding the city. Campgrounds are located outside the city for merchants to do business, and entry to the city is through an iron gate (usually left open, as per the city's reliance on trade). &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; is, or at least was, the dominant faith.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nCenturies before the return of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Bramwell occupied a position of prominence. Situated in highlands, it had been far enough away from Westmarch that it had its own economy. In its heyday, along with farming, it had a bountiful whaling industry. By &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;1263&lt;/a&gt; however, its heyday was long gone, its whaling fleet having been reduced to ships manned by families who maintained the practice out of tradition. The fever that swept through the town eight years prior didn't help either. The town survived mostly on farming and trade through &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingsport\"&gt;Kingsport&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround the same time of Diablo's awakening in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, it was here that &lt;a href=\"Buyard%20Cholik\"&gt;Buyard Cholik&lt;/a&gt; set up the first church of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Dreams\"&gt;Way of Dreams&lt;/a&gt;, a cult dedicated to the prophet &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Dien-Ap-Sten&lt;/a&gt;. However, his plans were thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Darrick%20Lang\"&gt;Darrick Lang&lt;/a&gt;.\nFortification.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, the town had been refurbished, and its walls increased in height. Due to &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; abductions, the city was in a state of unease when the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; arrived there."}

A few years before the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, he lost his parents when a plague swept through the city.

He leant Haedrig's best hammer to a man who promised to give it back, causing Haedrig to exclaim that he'd never see the hammer again, and tell Brycen to get out of his sight. However, the Nephalem correctly deduced that after losing his father and wife, Haedrig couldn't bear to lose someone else he cared about (an insinuation that Haedrig didn't take kindly towards). In the end though, Haedrig softened and took Brycen on as his apprentice."}

{"id": "50315", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=50315", "title": "Build", "text": "A build is a selection of choices that help define how a character's gameplay works, beyond the core design of their &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;. Most builds in \"Diablo\" games center around which &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; are trained, equipped, and used, although each game has its own variations.\nBuilds can be designed for general use, or customized for specific situations such as solo vs group play, &lt;a href=\"hardcore\"&gt;hardcore&lt;/a&gt; vs regular play, focused on &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;, speed-running, farming, or completion of special modes like &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s. Most specific builds are oriented around the \"endgame\" where characters have moved past the earlier levels and have access to all skills and zones of the game. Early \"Diablo\" gameplay is more generalized, with characters able to shift through various skills and items as they find them - although technically the first skill or attribute point selected is the beginning of a build.\nDiablo.\nThe first game's builds are largely defined by &lt;a href=\"Stat%20Point\"&gt;Stat Point&lt;/a&gt; allocation and &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s used, since there are no &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique Items&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; that heavily alter the gameplay as in later games, and all characters can theoretically learn any skill. Some builds are more item/weapon focused, and others are oriented more toward attacks with spells.\nDiablo II.\nIn the second game, reassigning skill points is extremely limited, so the build begins with the first skill point allocated into the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Tree\"&gt;Skill Tree&lt;/a&gt;. It is wise to have a plan for the endgame build from the start. &lt;a href=\"Synergies\"&gt;Synergies&lt;/a&gt; in the tree suggest related skills that should be part of the same build. &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique Items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt; can significantly improve various builds, although few of them define a playstyle by themselves - skills are more significant. &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Items&lt;/a&gt; are designed for an entire group of items to be used together, although partial sets can also be effective.\nIn the expansion, items with &lt;a href=\"charge\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt;s of utility skills are useful to augment regular class skills, and &lt;a href=\"Charm\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt;s provide mostly incremental improvements beyond the primary items equipped.\n&lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; offers a \"respec\" (re-specialization) as a &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; reward, refunding all skill points previously allocated. This allows a character to change to a completely different build, and is available three times in the life of each character - earned once per &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; level, and usable any time thereafter.\nDiablo III.\nIn the third game, all skills are learned automatically and attributes are primarily improved via &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; bonuses, so build decisions revolve around which items and skills are selected to be used. Only six traditional \"active skills\" are allowed at a time (they must be chosen before combat begins), as well as four &lt;a href=\"Passive%20skill%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;passive skills&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, s now have significant unique powers, which can be exploited via &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; in addition to equipping them directly. These powers can dramatically alter or define a build, particularly the six- or seven-piece \"class sets\". &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; Points increase effectiveness of builds without redefining them; at high levels their bonuses will all be maxed out the same way regardless of build.\nWith multiple &lt;a href=\"game%20mode\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt;s, \"Diablo III\" builds often specialize: they may focus on &lt;a href=\"Bounties\"&gt;Bounties&lt;/a&gt;, speed-farming &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s, or \"pushing\" the level of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;. More specialized builds include speed-running, completing each &lt;a href=\"Set%20Dungeon\"&gt;Set Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Echoing%20Nightmare\"&gt;Echoing Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, or accomplishing certain &lt;a href=\"Conquests\"&gt;Conquests&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Rift\"&gt;Challenge Rift&lt;/a&gt;s put a focus on one character's build at a time by allowing all \"Diablo III\" players to take the role of that character, using their class, skills and items (no changes allowed) to try to complete a rift as fast as possible. A Challenge Rift build may be very finely honed, or be more of a work in progress. A different build is offered to play each week.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Armory\"&gt;Armory&lt;/a&gt; of \"Diablo III\" allows a character to save and quickly switch between up to 10 different builds, although &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; point attribution is not included."}

These nephalem wandered the world and adopted numerous philosophies as they spread across it. Bul-Kathos observed as due to &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling with the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; how subsequent nephalem generations became weaker and weaker, eventually becoming the race of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity.\nThe Vigil.\nSharing a strong bond with &lt;a href=\"Fiacla-G%C3%A9ar\"&gt;Fiacla-G\u00e9ar&lt;/a&gt; (a brother or close confidant, depending on the source), the pair shared the secrets of the Ancients of the mysteries below the peaks of Mt. Arreat, of the venerated task put to their people to protect those mysteries, and of the prophecies regarding the dark times ahead. They both agreed that, in order to fulfill their sacred trust, their people must devote themselves to nothing save that charge. However, they disagreed on exactly how the people could best do this. Bul-Kathos believed that only by bringing the tribes together and training them in strict martial discipline could the tribes faithfully concentrate on their goal for generations to come. Fiacla-G\u00e9ar, on the other hand, believed that only through obtaining a spiritual oneness with the land they had sworn to protect could the people truly appreciate the importance of their role. Both agreed the other's philosophy had merit, and so around the time Bul-Kathos united the tribes, Fiacla-G\u00e9ar gathered together a small group consisting of the tribes' greatest warrior-poets and shamans and mysteriously retreated into the forests surrounding the area known as &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;. Bul-Kathos made a sacred vow to protect both Mt. Arreat and the Worldstone.\nBul-Kathos's name \"was forged in battle,\" and he was given reverence by his people. He was given the honour of sitting upon the &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20Throne\"&gt;Immortal Throne&lt;/a&gt;, an honor only ever bestowed to one other individual.\nAt some point, Bul-Kathos did something to himself that allowed him to linger in spirit form.\nFatherhood.\nAt some point, Bul-Kathos fathered twin children\u2014&lt;a href=\"Hiram\"&gt;Hiram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naarah\"&gt;Naarah&lt;/a&gt;. Naarah followed her father's path and became a great fighter, but the ways of their tribe never came naturally to Hiram. After years on walkabout, Hiram returned to his family, having discovered a new way...and a new power he sought to claim with his father's help.\nThe Sin War.\nIn the last days of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, Uldyssian ul-Diomed awoke Bul-Kathos outside Mount Arreat. Bul-Kathos asked Uldyssian whether he knew the names of Fiacla-G\u00e9ar and &lt;a href=\"Esu\"&gt;Esu&lt;/a&gt;. He became slightly more subdued upon witnessing Uldyssian's ignorance, realizing that a thousand years or more had passed since he'd slumbered. He told Uldyssian that Mount Arreat was not his destination, which made the nephalem all the more determined to go there. The two came to blows, though their fight was broken up by &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, who informed him that he intended to take Uldyssian into the mountain. Bul-Kathos protested, but Rathma informed him that &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; had returned to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. In an instant, the Barbarian's demeanour changed, and he granted them passage.\nBul-Kathos later took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Golden%20Path\"&gt;Battle of the Golden Path&lt;/a&gt;, fighting alongside other Ancients as they aided the Edyrem in the battle against Heaven and Hell.\nThe Hydra.\nCenturies ago, Bul-Kathos defeated the first &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. The great serpent was said to spawn two heads for everyone that was severed. In order to defeat it, Bul-Kathos supposedly pitched the beast into a roaring bonfire, wresting the fang lose in the process. The fang was later fashioned into a &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Sparker\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nBul-Kathos is treated as a deity by the Barbarians. They believed his spirit resided within Mount Arreat as part of a last line of defence for any of those who would threaten the Worldstone. It is said that Bul-Kathos will aid those who have earned it.\nThe term \"Immortal King\" was also given to the Barbarian &lt;a href=\"Worusk\"&gt;Worusk&lt;/a&gt;, for his unification of the tribes mirrored Bul-Kathos's historical deed.\nBronze-plated armor was created by an unidentified tribe to honor Bul-Kathos and his battle with the Hydra.\nIn-game.\nVarious in-game items are named after Bul-Kathos. These include &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos%27%20Wedding%20Band\"&gt;Bul-Kathos' Wedding Band&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos%27%20Children\"&gt;Bul-Kathos' Children&lt;/a&gt; set.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", more items are named after him: &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos%27s%20Oath\"&gt;Bul-Kathos's Oath&lt;/a&gt; set, &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos%27s%20Wedding%20Band\"&gt;Bul-Kathos's Wedding Band&lt;/a&gt; ring, and &lt;a href=\"Boon%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Boon of Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt; passive skill.\nPersonality and Traits.\nBul-Kathos valued martial discipline. He demonstrated a dry sense of humor and had a particular dislike for the nephalem Esu and those like her. He was (and is) renowned for his immense strength, size, bravery, and fortitude. Despite this, there is evidence that Bul-Kathos was burdened by the weight of his crown, and of his fatherhood of his twin children.\nBul-Kathos was physically imposing, though when Uldyssian observed him his physical appearance and size shifted. One moment his skin was brown like the soil, and his hair the colour of green grass. The next he wore a kilt and sandals with a golden band around his head. In truth, Bul-Kathos's original body had withered away. Only his spirit endured, and dirt and grass had clumped around it, giving him the semblance of a body.\nBul-Kathos despised &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, holding her responsible for the slaughter of his parents."}

Thus, the warriors of the Amazon Caste trained for millennia. After the Sightless Eye was stolen, this did not remove the oracles' divination abilities, as due to their handling of the artifact, they had gained the ability to glimpse the future without the artifact, though not as clearly.\nIn the mid-13th century, the oracles' predictions were validated, as not only did the Prime Evils fall and rise, one of the Amazon Caste, a warrior named &lt;a href=\"Cassia\"&gt;Cassia&lt;/a&gt;, allied with a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the Prime Evils.
