Later, his faith in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; was a pillar in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt;, and others looked up to him for strength. He believed the &lt;a href=\"Prophecies%20of%20the%20Final%20Day\"&gt;Prophecies of the Final Day&lt;/a&gt; to be superstitious and that they would never come to fruition. After Rekar heard about &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, he became aware the Prophecies were beginning their fulfillment. Rekar heard about Diablo's defeat beneath the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.

Events took a dark turn for the Order and the people it served as Leoric was corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. His mood darkenening, Leoric sent the Order's knights to other villages to bully the townspeople into submission. &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;Lachdanan&lt;/a&gt;, the captain of the Order's knights, questioned Leoric's motives, and was accused of treason by &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;. To the Order, the notion was ridiculous, and many began harboring suspicions about their king.\nSeeking to contain the eroding situation, Lazarus convinced the king that &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; was preparing for war against Khanduras, and as such, Leoric declared that he would strike first. Ignoring the admonishments of the court, Leoric sent the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20of%20Khanduras\"&gt;Royal Army of Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; to attack Westmarch, where the knights would accompany the soldiers. Additionally, many of his high-priests and officials were sent on diplomatic missions. Lazarus's ploy had worked\u2014the Order was scattered, and many of them would find only &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. At the least, death came to many of the knights of the Order, as the Royal Army was decimated by Westmarch's superior numbers and defensive positions.\nLachdanan led his remaining forces back to Tristram to confront his king. Realizing Leoric was beyond redemption, Lachdanan and the knights were forced to kill him. However, Leoric returned in skeletal form, and cursed the remaining knights to &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Knight\"&gt;eternal damnation&lt;/a&gt;."}

Originally intent on emulating the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, the group was splintered by corruption, but was able to come into its own.\nLore.\nThe First Ones organized themselves in a manner similar to the original Horadrim. They dedicated a person to each of the main &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; groups. The leaders taught others within their ranks in the ways of the &lt;a href=\"Ennead\"&gt;Ennead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ammuit\"&gt;Ammuit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taan\"&gt;Taan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn/around &lt;a href=\"timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery of a cache of hidden texts in an abandoned, secret Horadric meeting place in &lt;a href=\"Gea%20Kul\"&gt;Gea Kul&lt;/a&gt; intrigued a small group of scholars. They took ownership of the texts and in an effort to reproduced, brought the writings to Garreth Rau, a litterateur in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. Rau made a deal with them\u2014they would return together to Gea Kul, and the scholars would swear oaths to uphold the tenets of the Horadrim, to seek out more knowledge and form an official order. Rau was a natural leader, and the group took on a drive of its own, constantly seeking out new texts, even traveling as far as &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; and recovering the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;. Another expedition to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Al%20Cut\"&gt;Tomb of Al Cut&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt; ended in tragedy however, as a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; possessed one of their order. Rau pushed it back, but they had to leave some of their possessions behind in their escape. Rau called the group the \"First Ones,\" and some believed that they would become heroes, leaders of a new Sanctuary based on the Horadric principles they had embraced.\nRau however, changed. He became obsessed with retrieving the artifacts, and started claiming that he was royalty, that he was descended from a &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Horadric mage&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the order began to disappear and then return, changed and completely loyal to Rau. Rau himself started talking of a new future for the order. He talked of how the original Horadrim were wrong about the nobility of Tyrael and his intentions, pointing out how the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; had entrusted the Horadrim to imprison the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, but never did any of that work himself. He asked why, and whether Man was more powerful than angels? That being said, he argued, humanity itself was even worse than the creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. The time had come for a new order to lead Sanctuary, where those who did not embrace it would be eradicated. He insisted to be called \"maser\" and had a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt; built for himself on the edge of the sea near Gea Kul, said tower springing up nearly overnight through &lt;a href=\"black%20magic\"&gt;black magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents came to a head when &lt;a href=\"Lund\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the order's members discovered Rau conducting a blood sacrifice of one of their own in the tower. Those who had not fallen under his thrall realized that Rau was lost, corrupted by the very demons he had once sworn to fight against. The group escaped the tower and went into hiding. Of the few texts they had collected, they pointed to the arrival of a man who would save them from the darkness they faced. This group of Horadrim numbered about 30 in all, divided between those who believed in the &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20the%20End%20of%20Days\"&gt;Prophecy of the End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, and those who didn't.\nLight and Darkness.\nWord of this new group of Horadrim spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. The word was that these Horadrim were preparing to summon &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;something terrible&lt;/a&gt; into the mortal world. Rumors spread to both &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, and the term \"Horadrim\" took on a negative connotation. Word of this reached Cain's ears and, along with his new ward &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, set out to find them. The &lt;a href=\"monk%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mikulov\"&gt;Mikulov&lt;/a&gt; tracked him, as he reckoned that the best way to find these Horadrim was to follow Cain to them. The trio came to work together, and found the group, where its &lt;a href=\"Egil\"&gt;current leader&lt;/a&gt; narrated their history. Cain was the one the texts had prophecized, but he was not sure what to make of the situation before him. Still, he did what he could, correcting their misconceptions about transmutation, illusion, and prophecy.\nRau possessed the body of Egil and absconded with Leah. The events cost Egil his life, and the group came under attack by &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fallen%20one\"&gt;fallen one&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and corrupted townsfolk of Gea Kul. It was the straw that broke the group's back, Cain included, for a time. But he was able to rally the group and infiltrate the tower, defeating Rau, rescuing Leah, and causing the tower to slide into the sea. With the tower's destruction, the darkness that had plagued Gea Kul began to lift.\nCain and Leah thus departed, content to leave the group to its own devices, confident that it could leave others into the light.\n=The Cube.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, the First Ones searched for &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to recreate the artifact without the dangers inherent with Kulle's design."}

They are counted among the servants of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Overlords were once &lt;a href=\"Seraphim\"&gt;Seraphim&lt;/a&gt; who followed the angel &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. Inarius first laid siege to an infernal temple devoted to the worship of Mephisto, but made the foolish mistake of overestimating his prowess. The armies of Inarius laid waste to the temple and killed the dark monks that dwelled within. Mephisto was outraged, and many of Inarius's followers were forced into service to the Lord of Hatred. Many of the followers of Inarius were given as gifts to &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, but the rest were molded to match the bloated image of Inarius, who, after the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, was left crippled and bound in chains. The Seraphim were now Overlords, serving as &lt;a href=\"Hell\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;'s taskmasters.\nThese grotesque demons have considerable brawn hidden beneath their layers of greasy flab. Those who encounter them are advised not to underestimate their intelligence, and crossing &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; with them is ill advised.

He is the most famous example of an Overlord because of his extremely difficult nature at such an early stage of the game and high damage and speed. Unlike the others, he carries a meat cleaver. Overlords also have a secondary melee attack that does high damage. It's best to take them down from a safe distance with spells such as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Wall%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Fire Wall&lt;/a&gt; or with arrows. If you have to engage in close combat, make sure you get the first hit to prevent a stun-locked death.

There she learnt under Master &lt;a href=\"Vitalya\"&gt;Vitalya&lt;/a&gt;, along with another monk named &lt;a href=\"Dravec\"&gt;Dravec&lt;/a&gt;. She also befriended &lt;a href=\"Shura\"&gt;Shura&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the nearby outpost of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Sentinel's Watch&lt;/a&gt; came under attack by &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the bad &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; between the Veradani and the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, Oza was ordered to go to the outpost and speak with its commander. Along the way, she came across &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;, who helped her dispatch some of the marauding goatmen. They entered Sentinel's Watch together. Inside, she was greeted by Captain &lt;a href=\"Vereks\"&gt;Vereks&lt;/a&gt;. She stated that while the Veradani and Sons had a strained history, when one felt pain on the mountain, they all did. Vereks requested that she stay at the Watch, to help guard the fort.\nAfter a time of fighting against a continuous onslaught of khazra, they went into a rage, before their numbers began to tide. The Shard-seeker arrived shortly after, and informed her that the khazra had been summoning reinforcements at the &lt;a href=\"Razed%20Village\"&gt;Razed Village&lt;/a&gt; through a ritual, and that they had destroyed the ritual. They also informed that the khazra were in cohorts with the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cult of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;, and that their objective might be a &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; shard. Oza refused the validity of this news, stating that a shard had been recovered years ago, and is safely stored in the Sanctified Earth Monastery. She still bid them to investigate further, starting from the Moon Clan Encampment.\nThe Shard-seeker returned with news that the khazra were being controlled by Damned Cultist cultists, led by a stranger named Dravec, who was expecting her. Oza then recounted Dravec tale to them; he was an acolyte who trained with her in her youth, but was exiled after killing his master.\nOn the Traitor's Tracks.\nFollowing a hunch, Oza led the Shard-seeker to search the &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Valley\"&gt;Misty Valley&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the valley was shrouded in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mists\"&gt;Black Mists&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Crusade\"&gt;Zakarum Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and had been abandoned since then, making it the perfect place to hide out of sight. At the valley, the mists impeded their vision and &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28monster%29\"&gt;nightmares&lt;/a&gt; were relentless in harassing them. As the Shard-seeker began to lose hope Oza rebuked them for their excess reliance on what they see. Telling them to stand guard over her, she prayed to &lt;a href=\"Zaim\"&gt;Zaim&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the path.\nThe trail led them to a cave guarded by undead. From different clues in the cave, they were able to discern what Dravec was up to since he was exiled from the Veradani.\nIn-game.\nOza is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; companion for the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal%23quests%20Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;story quests&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

They maintain strictly ordered lives, constantly upholding the cause of Virtue and &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. They must never succumb to worldly temptations lest they risk being deceived into following \"false lights\" - &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s masquerading as &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;Heavenly beings&lt;/a&gt;. Paladins may use their skills to increase their prowess with &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, as well as cast blessing auras on themselves and to any who join them. They are particularly skilled against the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, as they know many holy incantations effective against these types of creatures.\nNumerous Paladin orders exist/have existed. The position of \"Paladin\" stems at least as far back as the &lt;a href=\"Protectors%20of%20the%20Word\"&gt;Protectors of the Word&lt;/a&gt;, which were formed just prior to &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;'s crusade against the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt;. Since this time, different sects of Paladins have formed, with separate goals and bases of operation. What these orders share in common (in theory at least) is their devotion to the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt; and spreading the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith. By the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt; however, many Paladin orders had been disbanded. Some formed new orders (such as the &lt;a href=\"Templar%20Order\"&gt;Templars&lt;/a&gt;), while others went rogue or freelance. Others have simply died. While the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; continue to function, they have distanced themselves from the Zakarum, and are more focused on defending &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; from physical rather than spiritual harm.\n\"Dark\" Paladins also exist, who carry the favor of Hell.\nPaladins are required to sanctify their weapons with their own &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. This sacrifice is a symbol of faith, that even the lowliest Paladin has to submit before the Light, in order that he may prove himself worthy of victory.\nIn-game.\nThe Paladin is a playable class in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". He is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; branch.\nBuilds.\nThe Paladin has a variety of builds.

To preserve her honor, Palashia was to strike the targets of all her rivals before they could land a single arrow. When dawn arose on the day of the contest, Palashia stood ready with her &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. At the signal, her rivals nocked their arrows and loosed a volley towards their targets. Palashia gathered her energies, and let fly with her own, single arrow. To the amazement of onlookers, her arrow split into many, cleaving the arrows of her rivals, and moving on to strike every target directly in their centers. This mysterious technique quickly became a martial secret that only the finest archers are able to master."}

The group is bound by secrecy, but is ready to fight for those who seek them out.\nHistory.\nThe members of the Pale Hand were active during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;. They fought against the vilest creatures of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), but they were left only with their inner demons. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, with the imminent return of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, the group was reformed.\nIn-game.\nThe Pale Hand appears in \"\" as part of the game's &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; system. Each mercenary the player hires comes from this company.\nThe mercenaries are unlocked during the expansion's main questline. Each Pale Hand mercenary carries their own past, inclinations, and unique skills. Players are able to enter the Pale Hand's &lt;a href=\"The%20Den\"&gt;hideout&lt;/a&gt;, and complete further quests to bring more Pale Hand members to their side.\n&lt;a href=\"Raheir\"&gt;Raheir&lt;/a&gt; is the first Pale Hand mercenary players unlock\u2014this is achieved through completing the expansion's campaign. The other three (&lt;a href=\"Aldkin\"&gt;Aldkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varyana\"&gt;Varyana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Subo\"&gt;Subo&lt;/a&gt;) are unlocked through separate, unique questlines. The player can customize their mercenary's ability to an extent, with a broad mix of utility and damage-based skills to customize how these allies complement their playstyle. Each Pale Hand member has their own skill tree, which starts with a single perk, each of which is designed to make the player feel different in-game. The skill tree is divided into six skills and twelve upgrades.\nBroadly speaking, each mercenary's skill tree allows the character to be tailored to be combat or support focused. Skill points for the trees are earned through a rapport system\u2014rapport is increased through using the mercenary in the field. The first five levels of rapport give the mercenary abilities/talents, while subsequent levels go towards bartering with &lt;a href=\"Fayira\"&gt;Fayira&lt;/a&gt;. Rapport has ten levels. After the tenth level is maxed out, players can 're-level' at the tenth tier, receiving 100 &lt;a href=\"pale%20mark\"&gt;pale mark&lt;/a&gt;s each time level 10 is recompleted. Each mercenary has a correspondent item category (or categories) that, as they are levelled up, gives the player access to more items through Fayira in their respective category. For instance, levelling up Aldkin grants access to purchasable resources.\nCorrespondent to the mercenaries is a \"Reinforcement\" mechanic. This can be mapped to a character's skills to a specific mercenary and mercenary attack. When the skill is used, the assigned mercenary appears, attacks, then despawns. A player can have one mercenary with them at a time, and can have a second mercenary assigned as a reinforcement.\nPale Hand members who aren't hired by the player may still appear in s at times. The characters can appear even before being unlocked."}

It possesses \"warped reality\" traits. The realm acts as a crossroads for the domains of all beings, and the core of Pandemonium acts as a nexus between the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. It is a seat of great primal energy that keeps forming new land near its core, while around its edges pieces are constantly breaking off in an eternal loop of creation and destruction. Pandemonium has some &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Beast\"&gt;native&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titan%20%28Race%29\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt;, but these beings are not &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, nor do they operate like humans. Pandemonium is a realm beyond human understanding. Pandemonium is a vast, chaotic and harsh realm, and its inhabitants must be resourceful to survive.\nHistory.\nThe Eternal Conflict.\nAt the center of Pandemonium lay the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. It was for this object that the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt; was waged by &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and consequently, most of the conflict was fought within Pandemonium itself. Ownership of Pandemonium alternated between angels and demons many times and due to the realm's \"warped-reality\" traits, Pandemonium has taken on the traits of the denizens of both Heaven and Hell.\nWith the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; through the actions of &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Conflict wore down, and the attentions of Heaven and Hell were drawn to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Yet even now, the scars of conflict still remain\u2014ruined war machines are found throughout the landscape, and the bodies of fallen demons remain in Pandemonium. Some have been there for so long that they have been subject to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrifaction\"&gt;petrifaction&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, fortresses built by angels to ward off demons have long been abandoned, and demons remain in 'time traps' that angels set up for them. Some of Pandemonium's denizens have moved into the abandoned garrisons once maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Warscarred%20Ravager\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warscarred%20Marauder\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; remained behind in the realm, unwilling to return to Hell, per being so addicted to violence.\nReaper of Souls.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; took the Pandemonium Fortress as his own. This forced &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; to travel across Pandemonium to the fortress, before finally entering it and slaying the fallen angel.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; is visited in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", but the realm itself is otherwise unavailable.\nDiablo III.\nThe realm of Pandemonium, as well as the above-mentioned fortress, is visited by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; during the later portion of \"\".\nDevelopment.\n&lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; has long planned on visiting the realm, but it is their approach that \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Series\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" expansions be more self-contained than core installments. As such, the in-game debut of Pandemonium was reserved for an expansion appearance. It was intended that Pandemonium look like no location on Sanctuary. It was decided that Pandemonium had to epitomize the nature of the Eternal Conflict. Some challenges were faced when conceptualizing the realm, as they didn't want it to look too futuristic.\nThe environmental effects of Pandemonium were designed to be a reflection of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;; Logs, chests, and barrels, evaporate once destroyed. it has been suggested that this is to reflect the idea of them barely clinging to the corporeal realm. &lt;a href=\"Neal%20Wojahn\"&gt;Neal Wojahn&lt;/a&gt; has likened the effects to the burning of paper."}

Pandemonium Diablo is one of the three brothers spawning in the Pandemonium Event - \u00dcber Tristram, while the Diablo Clone is a single boss spawning after enough have been sold on a given server.

She masterminded the revival of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; by manifesting herself in the mortal realm and performing a ritual of Dark Summoning. This ritual, long thought to be impossible by the most powerful mortal wizards, allowed Lilith to link with Diablo across realms, strengthening him until he was finally able to once again reincarnate himself in the mortal plane. Rage and a deep yearning for revenge boiled within the eyes of the Lord of Terror, and together he and Lilith resurrected the two remaining &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s as well as &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt;, two of their strongest agents.\nDiablo announced his grand plan - the Three were finally strong enough to spread Pandemonium throughout &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Lilith could have easily conducted an assault on her own, but because she had been left severely weakened by the Dark Summoning ritual, she agreed to aid the Prime Evils and command some of their remaining forces.\nThe Keys.\nAccessing the \u00dcber bosses requires keys, first a minor tier dropped by standard &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt; to access the lesser \u00dcber bosses, then a major tier from those to access the primes in &lt;a href=\"Uber%20Tristram\"&gt;Uber Tristram&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Minor Keys.\nThere are three different minor keys, and a complete set of all three is required to open a single minor portal to fight one of the three lesser \u00dcbers. This means that the player will have to collect, in all, three copies of each type of minor key, which totals to nine keys.\nTo get the minor keys, the player has to kill one of the \"agents\" of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; on the mortal plane, in difficulty. They are:\nThe keys drop in addition to the normal loot, but quite rarely, possibly only one in 10-15 runs. The three drops are independent, so players can focus on farming whichever boss has the key they need if they have already found sufficient keys from the others.\nThe Major Keys.\nTransmuting a complete set of the three Minor Keys in the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; while in &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt;) opens a portal to one of the lesser \u00dcber bosses, similar to the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;Secret Cow Level&lt;/a&gt;. There are three possible portals, which are random. However, the same portal will not open twice in one game, so to guarantee access to one of each, it is highly recommended to obtain all 9 Minor Keys (three of each type), then use them all in a single game.\nThe three minor portals lead to:\nThey will drop, upon death, &lt;a href=\"Baal%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Baal's Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto%27s%20Brain\"&gt;Mephisto's Brain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Diablo%27s%20Horn\"&gt;Diablo's Horn&lt;/a&gt; respectively. These Major Keys can be transmuted to create the final portal to &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Tristram\"&gt;\u00dcber Tristram&lt;/a&gt; where the \u00dcber Prime Evils wait. Once again, the portal can only be used in Harrogath in Hell difficulty.\nUber Tristram.\nOnce you have all the three Major Keys, you can to go back to Harrogath and transmute them in the Horadric Cube. This will create the portal to Uber Tristram.\nUber Tristram has the same base structure as the regular Tristram but has a pack-load of hellish monsters, like the rare and powerful Balrogs. There are also a variety of unique monsters, champions and their minions along with the masters of the pack, the Uber Prime Evils themselves. The main objective when the player reaches Uber Tristram is to find and defeat &lt;a href=\"Uber%20Mephisto\"&gt;Uber Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uber%20Baal\"&gt;Uber Baal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Diablo\"&gt;Pandemonium Diablo&lt;/a&gt; (because &lt;a href=\"Uber%20Diablo\"&gt;Uber Diablo&lt;/a&gt; already exists).\n\u00dcber Mephisto has a &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; Aura, which causes -125% to all of your resists, and summons &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Mage\"&gt;Skeleton Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Archer\"&gt;Archers&lt;/a&gt; everywhere, which can be challenging. Pandemonium Diablo is a \"tank\" for Baal. He has tons of life and summons &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Lord\"&gt;Pit Lord&lt;/a&gt;s which are immune to everything but Physical damage. \u00dcber Baal is pretty much the same as Hell mode Baal. He has a little more life and summons &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Lord\"&gt;Ghoul Lord&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, which are both Physical &lt;a href=\"Immune\"&gt;Immune&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you kill them, the last one to die will give you the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Torch\"&gt;Hellfire Torch&lt;/a&gt;, a Large Charm that gives +3 to any one of a certain class' skills, and random resistances and attributes, and the &lt;a href=\"Standard%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Standard of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;. The Standard of Heroes is a symbol that shows that you have completed this quest successfully.\nThe easiest way to kill all three Ubers, as they are called in game, is a &lt;a href=\"Smiter\"&gt;Smiter&lt;/a&gt; (a paladin who uses smite).\nA fool-proof way to kill the Ubers is to run straight up when you enter the portal. Then go around to the left and go halfway down. Then slowly walk towards the center of Tristram. This causes Diablo and Baal to charge at you. Run away to the left and top again so Mephisto doesn't instant kill you. Then work on Diablo first because his Pit Lords can kill you pretty quickly. Baal comes next. It may take a few tries, but make sure you make your game permanent, so if you die, you can save and exit and come back. After the two easiest are dead, Mephisto is left. He is easily the hardest monster in the entire game. There are a few different ways to kill him.\nDepending on your skill as a player, the fastness of your computer, and the ability of your build. The first way to kill him is to just charge in and attack like crazy. If life tap isn't cast within the first 10-15 seconds, you will die and have to start over again, though by going to the various magic vendors (such as &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; in act 1) you can buy a Wand with charges of Life Tap. Simply by having the wand in your second weapon set allows you to cast Life Tap before going in making all three bosses trivial and eliminating the luck factor involved with other methods. The second way to kill him is to trigger him, then run into a building AWAY from the portal, and let him follow you into it and get stuck. Then either teleport out (if you're wearing Enigma), die, or save and exit. Then after you're back in the game, run straight to the house and attack him. Since he is kept away from his minions his &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; aura is less of a threat. This may take a few tries."}

Over the course of the conflict, the fortress changed hands many times between &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and as a result, took on structural and metaphysical traits from both the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. Other outposts were maintained around the fortress as well. Over the course of the war, angels and demons too numerous to count fell at its gates.\nThe battles over the fortress entered a new phase when &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, and their fellow renegades were able to steal the stone from the fortress, beginning a series of events that would lead to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and its inhabitants, &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;. The angels who occupied the fortress at the time were left in a state of confusion, and began to withdraw. &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, perturbed, ordered his own forces to withdraw from the battlefield. &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, losing patience, stormed the fortress and realized that the Worldstone had gone missing, and that the surviving angels he'd tortured knew nothing of its whereabouts. He concluded (correctly) that the stone had been taken by Lilith.\nRecent History.\nIt appears that even after agreeing to leave Sanctuary be, the powers of Heaven and Hell continued to war over the fortress for a time. The blood of thousands of champions of the Light were spent in these battles, many of such champions being mortal. However, as it no longer contained the Worldstone, the interest of Heaven and Hell in the fortress had severely waned. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;intended return&lt;/a&gt; to Hell, the Pandemonium Fortress was occupied by the forces of Heaven, and was their last bastion before the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Gates of Hell&lt;/a&gt;. However, by this point, it had effectively been abandoned. &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, having passed through the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt;, passed through the fortress before entering Hell. Still, it was from the fortress that a group of heroes, at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and Tyrael himself, were able to venture into Hell and thwart &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s plan.\nOver &lt;a href=\"timeline%231285\"&gt;twenty years&lt;/a&gt; after these events, the fortress was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; forces, killing its former inhabitants. The fortress was reshaped to reflect Malthael's will and massive soul constructs were built that powered the central core. In order to defeat Malthael, &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; had to direct this soul power into themself, in order to enter the same state as Malthael and make him vulnerable to their attacks. Malthael was ultimately defeated.\nGame Location.\nDiablo II.\nThe Pandemonium Fortress is the town hub of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Harrowing\"&gt;fourth act&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". It has a doorway to the &lt;a href=\"Outer%20Steppes\"&gt;Outer Steppes&lt;/a&gt; which leads to the rest of Act IV.\nResidents.\nThese are the NPCs (Non-Playable Characters) associated with the Pandemonium Fortress:\nQuests.\nThere are three quests to be obtained within the Pandemonium Fortress:\nDiablo III.\nThe fortress is revisited in \"\". It serves as the final area of the game. Writings of &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; can be found within.\nAreas.\nThe fortress has been heavily rebuilt by Reapers; two levels are visitable by players (the third level is\u00a0very small, and serves as a final chance to prepare for the battle with Malthael). The Interior is multi-tiered, composed of towers connected by narrow bridges. &lt;a href=\"Portal\"&gt;Death Gates&lt;/a&gt; can bring players over the edge, and Reapers often use the chains that support their structures to ambush heroes.\nInside, mostly &lt;a href=\"Exarch\"&gt;Exarch&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Executioners\"&gt;Executioners&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Assassin\"&gt;Winged Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Anarch\"&gt;Anarch&lt;/a&gt;s are found; a few special events allow fighting &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; as well. The fortress is filled with soul constructs, which serve no purpose for the gameplay, stacks of ammo, petrified angelic remains, packed siege weapons and tons of crates; presumably all of these remain here from the ages past. s and &lt;a href=\"Traps\"&gt;Freezing Gates&lt;/a&gt; are found across the fortress, both of which impact battles fought within the fortress (although the latter is capable of actually making combat easier for the Nephalem).\u00a0\nIn &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, a Level 2 &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; is relocated to the middle instead of the entrance.\nDevelopment.\nIn terms of design, the fortress needed to encompass the feelings of being ancient and infinite without losing players in a way that would distract from gameplay. The designers took care to avoid creating the perception of being displaced or wandering in outer space. Time was taken to make it visually distinct from the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Corvus\"&gt;Ruins of Corvus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The level design of the fortress included elements of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; from Diablo II.\nTrivia.\nThe Island of the Sunless Sea.\nA quest that was cut from the original Diablo, Farnham mentions an \"island where the Angels watch.\". Extracting the wav files from the Diablo I disc's MPQ reveals that Farnham does, indeed, have an unused speech regarding this:\n\"\"Hey you there, c'mere, listen up!... Y'know 'bout the island where the Angels watch? Pick the right rocks, but ya better shield yer eyes -- shield everything! I know, 'cuz I been there, and -- mmmm, ale...\"\nDeckard Cain also has an unused speech file which speaks of the Island, transcribed as follows:\n\"Hmm. An island? Where Angels watched? Although Farnham's memory is often cloudy these days, that does seem familiar... perhaps the ancient Chronicles of the Sin War can help us... Ah! Yes! Here is something: In a time long forgotten, a sea of blue rested on the edge of the fiery netherworld. This was an oasis for those who acted as the watchmen over the gates of Hell. Angels and warriors of Light could use this place to heal themselves and gather their strength. It was also a staging area, where they could train and prepare for the Sin War. Legends speak of a trinity of rocks that hide the path to this... Island on the Sunless Sea.\"\"\nCain's description of the island seems to fit what we know of the Pandemonium Fortress. It is likely that the concept behind the cut \"Island\" quest in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; became what is now known as the Pandemonium Fortress in \"Diablo II\"."}

Each Paragon Level requires 3,500,000 XP.\nEach server has a World Paragon Level that rises by 10 levels each week. Once a player has reached max level (currently 60), if their Paragon Level is below the World Paragon Level, they will gain increased experience. If the player is more than four levels above the World Paragon Level, their experience is penalized. The XP bonus does not apply to characters as they level up.\nIn addition, as Paragon level increases, the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; on items (Strength/Intelligence, Willpower, Fortitude, Vitality) that drop tend to increase, although the damage and Legendary attributes do not. &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt; settings above Normal have a recommended Paragon level range.\nThe Paragon system in \"Immortal\" is divided into multiple trees. Each tree contains 15 skills. The skills come with persistent attributes: +10 Armor, Armor Penetration, Potency, Resistance, +80 Damage and +800 Life. These are applied regardless of whether the skill is active or not.\nEach skill costs 4 Paragon points to unlock. Each tree has 3 root skills that can be unlocked immediately, and each of those branches into two paths of two skills each, which require the previous skill on the path to be unlocked first.\nOnly one tree may be active at a time, and players may switch freely among them. Players can reset their Paragon points at any time. There is no in-game cost to do so. From the active tree, the player can select 5 skills to activate.\nAfter unlocking the Inferno I &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, Legendary Paragon Skills are unlocked. These skills must be unlocked for 80 Paragon Points, and come with a passive bonus of +10 Armor, Armor Penetration, Potency, Resistance, +240 Damage and +2400 Life. Only one Legendary Paragon Skill can be active, and it goes into a separate slot from regular Paragon skills.\nTree Details.\nVanquisher.\nVanquisher skills:\nTreasure Hunter skills:\nMassacre skills:\nGladiator.\nGladiator skills:\nSoldier skills:\nChampion skills:\nSurvivor.\nSurvivor skills:\nMastermind skills:\nApothecary skills:\nBrawler.\nBrawler skills:\nExecutioner skills:\nWarden skills:\nSlinger.\nDuelist skills:\nWeaver skills:\nRanger skills:\nHarbinger.\nSkill group 1:\nSkill group 2:\nSkill group 3:\nSlayer.\nSkill group 1:\nSkill group 2:\nSkill group 3:\nDevelopment.\nThe Paragon system in \"Immortal\" was designed from scratch. It was designed to reflect the intent to support the game for years.\nOriginally there was a seven-day cooldown for resetting Paragon points. The timer began as soon as the reset occurred.\nOriginally there were 15 Paragon Trees, each with 5 skills. Only one tree could be active and that would activate all 5 skills in the tree. The persistent attributes were not tied to skills but were separate nodes in the tree. The skill nodes cost 1 Paragon point, while the persistent attributes cost 1 per level, adding up to 100 points to fully unlock the whole tree. Different trees offered different amounts of bonuses to each attribute. On May 23 2024 in the &lt;a href=\"Unending%20Storm\"&gt;Unending Storm&lt;/a&gt; update, Paragon levels were compressed from a maximum of 1399 to 299. A one-time reward of &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Crest\"&gt;Legendary Crest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Crest\"&gt;Rare Crest&lt;/a&gt;s was given out based on the level players reached.. The trees were merged in the following way:\nThis update also tied the persistent attributes to unlocked skills, standardized the amounts of persistent attributes per skill, and made the cost of each skill 4 Paragon points.\nThe Harbinger tree and the first 3 Legendary Paragon Skills were added with the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Manifest\"&gt;Nightmare Manifest&lt;/a&gt; update.\nThe update added the ability to activate a Paragon tree by clicking on the central node of the tree.\nThe Slayer tree and the second 3 Legendary Paragon Skills were added with the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shattered Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; update.\nDiablo III.\nParagon was added to the game after release, to provide more end-game content for players who had reached the level cap.\nParagon 1.0.\nIn Paragon 1.0, after a player reached level 60, any further experience gained counted towards Paragon levels, of which there were 100, calculated independently and separately for each character. If one took into account every class/gender combination in the game, then a player could reach \"Paragon 1000.\"\nEvery Paragon level rewarded a player with core stats such as &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"vitality\"&gt;vitality&lt;/a&gt; in amounts similar to what they'd gain from a normal level, and 3% &lt;a href=\"magic%20find\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; find. A new frame in the character's portrait was earned every 10 levels to signify their paragon progression. Two extra portraits were available at levels 98 and 99. To support the system, &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Valor\"&gt;Nephalem Valor&lt;/a&gt; provided a 15% experience bonus per stack, applicable toward Paragon levels, making &lt;a href=\"Ruby\"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; gems in helm useful even at level 60.\nParagon 2.0.\nParagon 2.0 is an updated version of the Paragon system released as part of the pre-patch to \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". It made the following changes:\nThe categories (and their stats) are listed below. Primary stat and Vitality have no cap, while all other stats are capped at 50 points each.\nWhile it may seem that most stats have a cap on them that cannot be exceeded, there will always be some incentive, even if only a little, to attaining more Paragon levels. This allows the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; heroes an ever growing advantage that they can make use of to help ease the burden of tackling higher difficulty levels. \nWhen the new system was implemented, previous Paragon experience (not levels) from the 1.0 version was added from all characters to assign new levels.\nUnder the system, if a character dies or is deleted, the amount of Paragon experience that character contributed is not lost\u2014Paragon experience is shared by all characters on the account. Remember that Paragon levels for Hardcore and Softcore, and for Seasonal and Normal characters, are separate.\nParagon points can be reset at any time when not in combat. There is no cooldown or cost for doing so. To allocate points faster (10 points at a time), player can click them while holding the Shift button. As of patch 2.5.0, clicking them with Ctrl button will allocate 100 points at a time.\nParagon experience is only added when the character is at maximum level they can achieve (70). Normal experience earned while leveling does not count toward Paragon totals.\nParagon points are the only customizable attribute that is not stored and automatically changed via &lt;a href=\"Armory\"&gt;Armory&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of patch 2.0.4., there are new paragon Portraits, granted every 100 levels past 100, i.e. 200, 300, 400 etc., up to 800.\nIn a sense, Paragon 2.0 is reminiscent of the character leveling systems of the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; games, where class stat increases were at the player's discretion (in contrast to the system of Diablo III, where stats increase in a standard manner with each increase in level for each class).\nAs of patch 2.3, players can earn some new Paragon portraits for doing achievements in Season 4.\nYou can also earn new Paragon portraits by completing Seasonal objectives, gaining promotional materials or killing &lt;a href=\"Sir%20William\"&gt;Sir William&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whimsyshire\"&gt;Whimsyshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nThe Paragon system was not initially planned for \"Diablo III\". The decision to implement the system stems in part from lowering the &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; cap from 99 in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" to 60 in \"Diablo III\". This was done to make achieving max level more doable, but post-release, it was found that level 60 was much less rewarding. Furthermore, as the team was discussing the Paragon system, they realized it could solve a second problem\u2014due to the effects of the repair costs it was very common to sit down for a session of \"Diablo III\" only to find at the end of the game session the player was further behind than where they started.\nDiablo IV.\nThe Paragon system does not appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Instead, the &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20Board\"&gt;Paragon Board&lt;/a&gt; features."}

Its buildings, made of stone and smoothed over with plaster to give a sense of extravegance, were taller than Seram's, going as high as four stories. Its streets were paved with stone. It lay on a direct route between Tulisam and Kehjan's largest seaports. It was surrounded by farmlands, and many smaller communities existed in proximity to the city (within a day's ride).\nThe Parthans were of &lt;a href=\"Ascenian\"&gt;Ascenian&lt;/a&gt; ethnicity, and had the reputation of being good and fair\u2014&lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt; noted that unlike Seram, its people were more tolerant of the aged, dispossessed, and those born with deformities (again in contrast to Seram). The Parthans elected their leaders. Neither the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; paid the town much attention in the last days of the Sin War, though the town nonetheless had its share of preachers and clerics. A tribunal dispensed justice to criminals. The Parthans cremated the bodies of honored members of their society. It possessed/possesses a &lt;a href=\"Partha%20Guard\"&gt;city guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town center was an open area where merchants and farmers sold their wares, especially food and meat. A wide, round fountain was located in the center of the square, bearing a statue of &lt;a href=\"Protheus\"&gt;Protheus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is said that a power has protected the city for centuries.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nPartha was founded by Protheus and several other individuals.\nPrior to the end of the Sin War, the town suffered from plague.\nThe Sin War.\nUldyssian and his companions traveled through Partha on their way to &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt; during the Sin War. Although it was their intention to keep a low profile, Uldyssian healed a child of a deformity at a whim. It was an event that many Parthans noticed, and they immediately began giving their praises to the newcomer. What was meant to be a short stay became longer, and Uldyssian preached his creed to the town's inhabitants. He began instructing them in the use of similar powers, per the awakening of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; birthright. The days drew on, and soon almost the entire populace had flocked to his words. People from the surrounding farmland and adjacent communities even came to hear him and see his miracles.\nEvents took a turn for the worse, when &lt;a href=\"Ethon\"&gt;Ethon&lt;/a&gt;, the town's leader, was assassinated (along with his &lt;a href=\"Cedric\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;) by &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt; as part of his pursuit against Uldyssian. It was part of an attempt to turn the Parthans against him, but while Uldyssian survived the attack, he and his companions left the city, knowing that their presence had put its people in danger. However, a quarter of the people followed him, becoming the basis of the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Sin War, after the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; erased the memories of those who had followed Uldyssian, it was believed that Partha had suffered from a plague that had accounted for the deaths of half of the city's people, their bodies burnt (accounting for the losses the Edyrem had suffered)."}

However, in addition to the true passage, three false passages spawn in every game. All are accessible from Paths of the Drowned, but only one of them will have access to Corvus. The other three are much shorter and lead to dead-ends, having obelisks to return to the entrance like other dungeons. The false passages are labeled the same as the real one in the game interface, and are initially indistinguishable. However, the false ones do have different s and &lt;a href=\"unique%20monsters\"&gt;unique monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt;, the suggested way to find the correct passage is to determine its identifying symbol using Nephalem Guidestones. Each passage is randomly assigned a different one of four symbols: Fire, Wind, Wave and Leaf. The assigned symbol glows blue in front of each entrance, in several points in the interior, on the Paths of the Drowned map (even before being explored), and surrounding each Nephalem Guidestone. One Guidestone is obvious on the way into the Paths of the Drowned, and a number of others are scattered throughout the zone. Each Guidestone activated eliminates one passage by causing its symbol to stop glowing, as well as granting a free charge of &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Glory\"&gt;Nephalem Glory&lt;/a&gt;. After three are activated, only the one true symbol will remain. This is also tracked in the &lt;a href=\"Quest\"&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt; Journal, and the Nephalem will audibly comment on whether a passage they approach is the correct one.\nThe passages can be explored one by one regardless of whether the correct symbol has been determined. In &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; or when backtracking in the campaign, simply entering the Passage from the Ruins of Corvus side, or using the Passage to Corvus &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt;, naturally guarantees it is not a false passage.\nTrivia.\nThe false Passages are the successor to &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", which also had false instances distinguished by symbols, and could be correctly identified by exploring the previous zone. The &lt;a href=\"Defiled%20Crypt\"&gt;Defiled Crypt&lt;/a&gt;s of \"Diablo III\" also have false instances, although there is no symbol system in that case."}

Also, we are improving the power of the lesser-used melee skills such as \u201cImpale\u201d and \u201cFend.\u201d Lastly, \u201cPlague Javelin\u201d has received improvements with Casting Delay, damage synergy, and duration scaling, to further diversify its usage compared to \u201cPoison Javelin.\u201d\"\nPassive And Magic Skills.\n\"Avoid\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We wanted to add some quality-of-life changes to certain Passive and Magic Skills. We improved the radius for \u201cInner Sight\u201d and \u201cSlow Missiles\u201d, and we gave more reason to invest skill points for \u201cSlow Missiles.\u201d Also, we wanted to alleviate the disadvantage of the animation lockout from using the \u201cDodge\u201d and \u201cAvoid\u201d skills so that players are more willing to spend points on these skills.\"\nBow And Crossbow Skills.\n\"Immolation Arrow\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"Fire bow skills are receiving damage scaling improvements at higher levels so that they consistently fulfill their fire elemental damage type roles for their level tier. Also, mana costs were reduced for the elemental arrow skills to give them more general usage. \u201cStrafe\u201d will no longer have weapon damage reduction and will also provide Attack Rating so that it can have distinctive advantages over the other physical bow skills. Finally, we believe it felt odd that the physical bow skills don't have any synergies like the cold and fire bow skills do. We hope that giving some synergies to the physical bow skills help them remain viable.\"\nAssassin.\nMartial Arts.\n\"Dragon Flight\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"Martial Arts skills are receiving a significant change with having Finishing Moves (including the Attack skill) only consume 1 of each charge at a time instead of all 3 at once. We feel like this will allow Martial Arts to perform smoother during combat by better maintaining current charges instead of having to re-acquire charges too often. In addition to this, we are increasing Attack Rating for Charge-up skills to compliment the smoothness of gaining and spending charges Lastly, we wanted to improve damage payoff for the lesser used Finishing Move skills.\"\nShadow Disciplines.\n\"Shadow Master\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We felt that Shadow Disciplines are generally widely used and effective, but we wanted to add some quality-of-life changes, so we added tooltip clarity, buff duration consistency improvements, and casting delay changes.\"\nTraps.\n\"Blade Shield\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"With Trap skills, there are multiple underused skills that can be more effective or have improved synergy distribution. For Lightning and Fire Traps, we are freeing up synergy reliance on \u201cDeath Sentry\u201d to give more build possibilities elsewhere. Also, Fire traps are receiving damage synergy improvements to make them more effective at higher difficulties. Lastly, the Blade skills are receiving multiple improvements to make them more viable to dedicate builds around these skills.\"\nBarbarian.\nWarcries.\n\"Grim Ward\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We are adding more tooltip descriptions to Warcries for clarification on hidden skill mechanics. \u201cShout\u201d and \u201cBattle Command\u201d durations were updated to be consistent with each other for quality-of-life purposes. For \u201cWar Cry,\u201d we want to make it more effective and rewarding to use at higher difficulties. Lastly, with \u201cGrim Ward\u201d, we are adding a new functionality and synergy to give more reason to use the skill, which also gives more reason to spend skill points on \u201cFind Potion.\u201d\"\nCombat Masteries.\n\"Throwing Mastery\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"Barbarians run out of throwing weapon quantity far too quickly. Adding chances to not consume as well as chance to replenish will allow a throwing barbarian to be viable without having to return to town frequently.\"\nCombat Skills.\n\"Leap Attack\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"Leap Attack has received a lot of changes: increased movement speed, smoother trajectory, improved controls, and increased attack rating and damage. Perhaps the biggest change is that Leap Attack now deals AOE damage to surrounding enemies when landing. This gives the Barbarian a strong multi-target skill as early as level 18. This damage does not scale with your weapon, so it's perfect for leveling up a Barbarian in Normal and Nightmare difficulties. The AOE damage won't make as much of an impact on Hell difficulty, but Leap Attack's primary attack and mobility will remain valuable.\"\n\"Frenzy\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"For \u201cBerserk\u201d, the existing \u201cShout\u201d synergy is changing to \u201cBattle Orders,\u201d because the Defense loss from the skill contradicts the usage of \u201cShout,\u201d and this will better connect with other skill synergy build possibilities. \u201cDouble Throw\u201d will now have a baseline damage increase so that it will not purely rely on synergies for damage. \u201cFrenzy\u201d is receiving a new synergy from the lesser used \u201cIncreased Stamina\u201d skill to give more reasons to invest skill points there and add new build diversity.\"\nDruid.\nElemental Skills.\n\"Hurricane\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"With the Casting Delay changes, Druid Fire skills are generally going to be more widely used. In addition, we are increasing the physical damage scaling for Fire skills to be a reliable alternative damage source. We felt that \u201cArctic Blast\u201d is generally lacking power, so we are increasing the damage scaling, reducing the synergy requirements to free up skill points, and improving the general player controls to allow for smoother freeform targeting. In addition, we wanted to complement the \u201cArctic Blast\u201d changes with improvements to \u201cTwister\u201d to add more build possibilities. Lastly, we are allowing Shapeshift forms to cast each of the elemental buff skills to avoid the current hassle of having to change forms to continuously maintain these active buffs.\"\nShape Shifting Skills.\n\"Fire Claws\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We've debated on the best way to bring shapeshifting Druids forward. Both forms use a new attack speed calculation that allows more weapons to be used effectively and properly incentivizes IAS gear. With the improved Fury, the Werewolf can reach even faster attack speeds than it could previously. As for werebear - we want to deliver on the fantasy of a powerful, unstoppable, killing machine. We've introduced uninterruptible attacks and skills, as well as increased damage and defense. While this will change the way players have played the Werebear in the past, we feel like it is more in line with the intended fantasy. For players who loved their fast werebear builds, we\u2019ve added attack speed bonuses to Maul, but we also hope the new Werewolf changes will offer them the same style of play, as it is now the faster form.\"\nSummoning Skills.\n\"Solar Creeper\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"The restriction of the Druid being allowed only one type of summonable at a time has restricted the viability of this build and has hampered the fantasy of a Druid Summoner from living up to its full potential. We feel that a druid being able to summon all of his allies at once will make for a more interesting and fun playstyle. In general, all summons will no longer have hidden randomized health values so that the tooltip is more accurate and so summons perform more consistently. Ravens are getting significant changes to help them function as a spell-like skill for summoning Druids to use, and this includes damage scaling buffs and new synergies from other summons to fuel their damage. Wolves are getting improvements to give them more of an identity as damage-dealing summons. The spirit summons are receiving a physical damage resist change across each difficulty to make them survive more consistently. \u201dSpirit of Barbs\u201d is receiving changes to Thorns to make it a more reliable source of damage. Lastly, each of the creeper summons are receiving improvements to give more reason to invest skill points and to have them perform better at higher levels.\"\nNecromancer.\nSummoning Skills.\n\"Fire Golem\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We saw a good opportunity to improve lesser-used summons for the Necromancer. Skeletal Mages have received significant damage scaling improvements so that their elemental damage values are more consistent. This means that Cold damage is more effective but still slightly weaker than Fire damage because of its chill utility, and Poison damage is much more reliable with a fixed duration and better damage scaling. \u201cBlood Golem\u201c and \u201cFire Golem\u201d are receiving damage improvements to make them more competitive with the other Golems. For \u201cIron Golem,\u201d we are changing the \u201cThorns\u201d aura to deal more reliable damage to improve its source of effectiveness (See Paladin changes below for more details).\"\nPoison And Bone Skills.\n\"Bone Spirit\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"Bone skills are generally well performing but we saw an opportunity to improve synergy bonuses to better scale in the late game and to make their heavy skill point investment more valuable. Additionally, \u201cBone Armor\u201d is receiving better damage absorb scaling to make it more rewarding to spend points on the skill itself instead of relying too heavily on its synergies.\"\nCurses.\n\"Decrepify\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"For the \u201cWeaken\u201d skill, we added new damage reduction scaling to give more reason to spend additional points on the skill and to give it a more powerful identity.\"\nPaladin.\nDefensive Auras.\n\"Resist Lightning\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We added more information to tooltips to describe hidden functionality for certain Defensive Auras.\"\nOffensive Auras.\n\"Thorns\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We wanted to add more potential to the AoE (Area of Effect) Damage auras since they are a capable way for the Paladin to handle groups of monsters. By increasing damage based on distance to the caster, each AoE damage aura will have increased effectiveness while still maintaining the same cadence of visual VFX on the screen. Also, we saw that \u201cHoly Fire\u201d should scale better at higher skill levels to be consistent with general Fire Damage power compared to the other elements. For \u201cThorns\u201d, we want to improve the gameplay around getting hit to deal damage, so we are making the skill deal flat damage based on attack attempts in addition to returning damage after getting hit. This will allow Thorns to have a more consistent combat performance instead of unpredictable and riskier results.\"\nCombat Skills.\n\"Fist of the Heavens\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We wanted to improve the lesser-used Combat skills to give more viable build options. \u201cHoly Bolt\u201d will now pierce to increase its combat use cases and will have less skill point synergy investment to open more possibilities to spend skill points elsewhere. \u201cFist of the Heavens\u201d is also getting the same \u201cHoly Bolt\u201d pierce changes and will now have less Casting Delay and improved controls to help make it a more effective Level 30 skill to use. By allowing both Holy Bolt and Fist of the Heavens to damage Demons in addition to Undead, we hope to open it up as a viable build to use in more situations.\"\nSorceress.\nCold Skills.\n\"Chilling Armor\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"With the cold armor skills, we want to further diversify them by ensuring that each has distinctive advantages. After these changes, \u201cChilling Armor\u201d will have the greatest Defense bonus and damage potential while still only triggering on ranged attacks. Also, \u201cFrost Nova\u201d is receiving damage scaling improvements to give it more power where it was lacking in the later game.\"\nLightning Skills.\n\"Energy Shield\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We saw an opportunity to add new synergies for lesser used Lightning skills to increase their damage potential and create new skill build possibilities.\"\nFire Skills.\n\"Hydra\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We wanted to improve the lesser used Fire skills and give more reasons to use them. Inferno is receiving player control improvements with free form casting, like Arctic Blast, and better damage scaling. Blaze is an often-ignored skill, so we wanted to free up synergy requirements and provide more utility and power with damage increases and a new Run/Walk Speed buff for extra utility. Lastly, with Hydra, we wanted to improve the gameplay of summoning Hydras to make it easier to use to skill in combat situations. The removal of Casting Delay and the new limitation on max Hydras will match the maximum Hydra count achievable from before the changes, but now players will have a much easier time to summon that amount.\"\nMercenaries.\nHiring a Mercenary in Expansion mode will now always offer mercenaries that match your character's Level, instead of having a randomized Level difference from your character's Level.\nAct 1 - Rogue Archer.\n\"Fire Arrow\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"The Rogue Archer is getting new flavored ranged skills that will scale as she levels up. These new skills should improve her AoE (Area of Effect) damage effectiveness and thus make her a more effective ranged damage dealer.\"\nAct 2 - Desert Mercenary.\n\"Thorns (Combat - Nightmare)\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"The Desert Mercenary is already popular, but we saw an opportunity to add some quality-of-life improvements by allowing players to hire all six different Aura types in Nightmare and Hell difficulty, rather than having to switch between modes.

We improved their core stats so that they are more in line with other mercenaries while also having a distinct advantage with having the most resistance values. For skills, we wanted to embrace their elemental fantasies, so we decided to give new flavorful utility skills, to further incentivize reasons to want to use these mercenary types.\"\nAct 5 - Barbarian Warrior.\n\"Two-handed\".\nDeveloper Comments: \"We want to give the Barbarian Warrior more identity while still maintaining his Barbarian fantasy. So, we decided to give him the \u201cBattle Cry\u201d skill as a new way for him to debuff enemies, which should prove to be a useful utility for players. In addition, we wanted to increase his Life and Defense scaling to ensure that he is the tougher mercenary type. By adding a new dual wielding Barbarian Mercenary, we hope to provide a powerful, fast-hitting merc that challenges the status-quo of common mercenary choice among players.\""}

This is helpful in areas like &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanged attackers have different AI from melee ones: as they do not need to come close to the enemy, they are still dangerous even if stuck.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", AI is also altered for monsters having Fire Chains or Molten affix: they will try to approach and surround players, even if they are ranged attackers.\nDue to most monsters and pets blocking path of each other, with large number of allies, one can barricade the narrow passages, not allowing enemies to come close and forcing them to deal with tanking pets.

Its capital was the largest island of the isles, also called Pelghain\nLore.\nPelghain was a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassocracy\"&gt;thalassocracy&lt;/a&gt; ruled by sister priest-empresses who had the power to command oceans and wind. The empire was ethnically diverse and cosmpoliton, incorporating architecture from places such as &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt; and other locations in Sanctuary's north. At its peak, the empire's strength was based on both its mastery of maritime trade and its centers of learning.\nHistory.\nPelghain was born of seafaring and trade that reached as far as the western coasts of &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt;, exchanging rich dyes extracted from ocean creatures for the lumber and iron that would build their domain. It traded with Xiansai and other northern cultures in its early years. Their trade made them welcome in far lands, but at &lt;a href=\"Arreat\"&gt;Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, they were swiftly rebuffed by the s. As the empire expanded, it became more cosmpoliton, and incorporated elements of the cultures it encountered/conquered. At its peak, the empire was a hub of not just maritime trade, but of learning. Universities were constructed which attracted the best minds from across Sanctuary.\nThe empire collapsed when violence erupted between the empire's sister-priest empresses; &lt;a href=\"Mehrwen\"&gt;Mehrwen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ksathra\"&gt;Ksathra&lt;/a&gt;. As their power winnowed, they argued the best step to take for their people. Ksathra suggested uplifting a few so that they could shepherd their fellows, which Mehrwen said that it would be better to provide a small amount of power to all, that none may claim dominion. It is widely believed that Ksathra struck the first blow in anger. The battle roiled sea and sky, drowned their mainland cities, and left only their island capital standing, beset by permanent deluges and hurricanes, and surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Maarozhi\"&gt;Maarozhi&lt;/a&gt; which attacked from above and below.

Instead they summon huge Lightning orbs that strike the large area with Lightning charges for 5 seconds, dealing increasing ticks of damage to everything within their effective range. These orbs' areas overlap, stacking damage infinitely.\nA single Exarch is nearly harmless, but a bunch of them, especially if assisted by &lt;a href=\"Anarch\"&gt;Anarch&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Executioner%20%28Monster%29\"&gt;Executioners&lt;/a&gt;, can make heroes' advance much more difficult.

They\u2019re typically great at crippling enemies in general. This build\u2019s main strength is using his deadly set of weapons, and utilizing the skills &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Strike\"&gt;Deadly Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt;. Executioners can also be good at dealing with a large group of enemies, if they are wise with their weapon choices. One hand weapons are effective, but you could also look into using the deadlier two-hand weapons as well.\nStat Point Distribution.\nStrength: Enough to equip desired gear\nDexterity: If using a shield, enough to obtain a block chance of 75%.\nVitality: The remainder should go here.\nEnergy: It should not be necessary to add to this stat.\nSkills.\nA Player can choose his style. Executioner can either be dual weapon wielder, or two handed weapon master. Since the difference in build is little different between these two, player can choose both ways, with only the downside is to focus bit more on play.\nPrimary Skills.\nIf player chooses dual weapon style:\n&lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; - This is the primary attack for the Executioner. Since level 20 Frenzy is hard to play with due to the Barbarian's insane speed, this is best when taken to level 10, with no need for more. That way, the Executioner will deal a great amount of damage but can focus on other skills.\n&lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Mastery\"&gt;Weapon Mastery&lt;/a&gt; - Depending on what weapons the player will use, the respective mastery should be maxed to level of 20. (&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Mastery\"&gt;Sword Mastery&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Sword\"&gt;Sword&lt;/a&gt; users, &lt;a href=\"Mace%20Mastery\"&gt;Mace Mastery&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Mace\"&gt;Mace&lt;/a&gt; users .. )\nIf player chooses to play with two-hand weapons:\n&lt;a href=\"Concentrate\"&gt;Concentrate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Leap%20Attack\"&gt;Leap Attack&lt;/a&gt; - Concentrate gives the Executioner a large amount of Defense, Attack Rating and Damage bonus, so it's more than welcomed. Leap Attack can be deadly, but players can find themselves in trouble if there is a large group of monster ahead due to the fact that Leap Attack attacks only one target at the time. This, however, can be combined with &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to create an escape route or to continue the attack.\nIf player chooses to play with a one-handed weapon and a shield:\n&lt;a href=\"Concentrate\"&gt;Concentrate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leap%20Attack\"&gt;Leap Attack&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Berserk\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; - As with the two-handed weapon approach, Concentrate's large bonus to defense is helpful. Because an executioner carrying a shield can still block blows, Berserk will allow for maximum damage at the cost of defense. Leap attack allows the executioner to perform hit and run attacks quickly.\nSecondary Skills.\nSecondary skills can be chosen by players based on their preferences, but these are recommended:\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Skin\"&gt;Iron Skin&lt;/a&gt; - It gives natural defense to Executioner. It is also a prerequisite for Natural Resistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Natural%20Resistance\"&gt;Natural Resistance&lt;/a&gt; - Same as Iron Skin skill. It's passive and it will only help player to survive during &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the diminishing returns, it would not be recommended to have more than six points, and potentially get away with fewer by having gear that boosts this skill\n&lt;a href=\"Increased%20Stamina\"&gt;Increased Stamina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Increased%20Speed\"&gt;Increased Speed&lt;/a&gt; - These two skills are recommended for Executioner or any other Barbarian build, but they are not priority. It will be enough if &lt;a href=\"Increased%20Stamina\"&gt;Increased Stamina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Increased%20Speed\"&gt;Increased Speed&lt;/a&gt; have a single point and allow skill boosts to raise this as their effectiveness drops off after level 4.\n&lt;a href=\"Shout%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt; -Gives Executioner defense boost on higher levels. It should be taken at least once, but higher is recommended.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20Orders\"&gt;Battle Orders&lt;/a&gt; - There is an unwritten rule that barbarians MUST have twenty points invested in this skill for the sole purpose of boosting other characters. Feel free to break this rule by dropping points in this skill when convenient. It is a handy skill which boosts the mana life and stamina of friendly characters but under no circumstances is a build like this meant to be support first and offense second.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20Command\"&gt;Battle Command&lt;/a&gt; - A one point wonder. All that changes is the duration, which is boosted by Shout and Battle Orders, so a single point should be all that's needed.\n&lt;a href=\"Berserk\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; -This skill converts physical damage to pure magical damage, excellent for those monsters immune to physical damage and in PVP with hostile necromancers who use Iron Maiden. Only downsides are that the Barbarian is left with no defense once Berserk is activated and cannot leech mana or life due to the damage being magical, so players must be careful while using this skill. Giving Barbarian strong one hand weapon in one hand and a shield with high block in other might solve the problem, but there is always a chance that player will receive fatal blow while Berserking, not to mention being \"block locked\" into inaction. Berserk should be taken as much as possible by player, up to level 10 or higher. It also gives Frenzy magic attack bonus, so it's recommended.\n&lt;a href=\"War%20Cry%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;War Cry&lt;/a&gt; - One level in War Cry can be useful to stun mobs, allowing the Executioner to fall back, or attack stunned enemies for extra damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20Cry%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Battle Cry&lt;/a&gt;: While this skill can be overridden by a curse, while in effect, an opponent's defense is halved. A single point is all that would be needed.\nOther Skills.\nSynergy skills can also be looked into. Someone who has Frenzy as their main skill should also look into investing spare points into &lt;a href=\"Double%20Swing\"&gt;Double Swing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taunt%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Taunt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Berserk\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt;. Someone who chooses Berserk should consider building on &lt;a href=\"Howl\"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shout%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt;. Someone who chooses Leap Attack should consider building on &lt;a href=\"Leap%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Leap&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment.\nWeapon.\nPlayer must have a weapon that has Chance to &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ignores%20Target%27s%20Defense\"&gt;Ignores Target's Defense&lt;/a&gt;, Chance of &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Strike\"&gt;Deadly Strike&lt;/a&gt;. Finding many unique weapons with these abilities is good choice. Curses on striking, such as &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt; can also be helpful for maximizing damage.\nThe breadth of weapons with these properties is extensive. What follows are simply some suggestions; there are a sufficient number of weapons available that players should be able to find one that suits their play style.\nMany unique axes, including &lt;a href=\"Humongous\"&gt;Humongous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Minotaur\"&gt;The Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Executioner%27s%20Justice\"&gt;Executioner's Justice&lt;/a&gt; all have high chances of crushing blow. Executioner's Justice also has the ability to cast Decrepify, adding to its usefulness.\nA three-socketed &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Reaver\"&gt;Tomb Reaver&lt;/a&gt; could be fitted with three &lt;a href=\"Ber%20Rune\"&gt;Ber Rune&lt;/a&gt;s to give it a 75% chance of Crushing Blow, in addition to its formidable damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Lacerator\"&gt;Lacerator&lt;/a&gt;, while not dealing as much damage as many other weapons, can be a versatile backup for an executioner. It has a good chance of casting Amplify Damage and causing Open Wounds. Because it can be thrown it can also be used to strike at enemies while they close. When combined with &lt;a href=\"Swordback%20Hold\"&gt;Swordback Hold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Guard\"&gt;Lance Guard&lt;/a&gt; it can be quite formidable.\n&lt;a href=\"Ripsaw\"&gt;Ripsaw&lt;/a&gt; has one of the highest chances of causing Open Wounds of any weapon in the game. Its damage is relatively low, but it could be used effectively in the early game, and upgraded later on if desired.\nRuneworded weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Wish%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Last Wish Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;, which boast up to a 70% chance of crushing blow and ignores targets defense (though it is much more expensive due to it being a ladder-only weapon), and the polearm weapons of &lt;a href=\"Obedience%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Obedience Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; and both have 40% crushing blow, but are cheaper than last wish.\nShield.\nIf the player chooses to focus on Berserk any shield with a high chance of blocking should be used. &lt;a href=\"Moser%27s%20Blessed%20Circle\"&gt;Moser's Blessed Circle&lt;/a&gt; is particularly versatile and offers a good chance of blocking. &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Sanctuary Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; also offers a good chance to block along with high resistances.\nIf another skill is used with a shield (e.g. Concentrate or Leap Attack) then &lt;a href=\"Swordback%20Hold\"&gt;Swordback Hold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Guard\"&gt;Lance Guard&lt;/a&gt; are ideal choices, as they both possess executioner abilities.\nArmor.\nArmors with high defense and Execution abilities are needed. &lt;a href=\"Leviathan\"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Corpsemourn\"&gt;Corpsemourn&lt;/a&gt; are good candidates. The &lt;a href=\"Duress%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Duress Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; is ideal as it is relatively easy to make and grants resistances, high defense, and has a good chance of &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoots.\n&lt;a href=\"Gore%20Rider\"&gt;Gore Rider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"War%20Boots\"&gt;War Boots&lt;/a&gt; are best choice for this build. &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Toe\"&gt;Goblin Toe&lt;/a&gt; can be used as well, but are not as good as Gore Rider.\nHelms.\n&lt;a href=\"Giant%20Skull\"&gt;Giant Skull&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Visage\"&gt;Bone Visage&lt;/a&gt; unique helmet is great choice for this build since it gives &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; ability, +35 to Strength, &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;, +320 to Defense and has two sockets. Recommended to put in a +40% ED/15% IAS jewel (2 if possible) for maximizing WW speed and polearm swing speed.\n&lt;a href=\"Arreat%27s%20Face\"&gt;Arreat's Face&lt;/a&gt; offers a good bonus to Barbarian skills, as well as a bonus to resistances. While not improving executioner abilities, the increase to attack rating and damage that results from improving skills can be invaluable.\nGloves.\nA good type of gloves to use are a pair of &lt;a href=\"Steelrend\"&gt;Steelrend&lt;/a&gt; Ogre Gauntlets, these gauntlets boast a 10% chance of crushing blow whereas the next best pair, &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Grip\"&gt;Venom Grip&lt;/a&gt;, has 5% but has poison damage and life steal.\nAmulet.\nThe best amulet for any executioner barbarian to use would be &lt;a href=\"Highlord%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Highlord's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for this is the lightning resistance, the attack speed, and the leveled % chance of Deadly Strike (up to 37% at lvl 99)\nRings.\nTwo rings are used at any time, and the first ring choice that should be picked is &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Frost\"&gt;Raven Frost&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because of the 'cannot be frozen', which is a large help for any Player Vs. situation, and the &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Peace\"&gt;Nature's Peace\u00a0ring&lt;/a&gt; due to prevent monster heal and slain monsters rest in peace. A good back up for either is &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos%27%20Wedding%20Band\"&gt;Bul-Kathos' Wedding Band&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0with life steal and +1 to all skills.\nOther Items.\nAll items that give bonus to life, mana, resists and other Execution abilities are considered."}

In combat, they leap upon their victim to plunge their blades with immense force like the snapping insectoid jaws.\nIn-game.\nExecutioners are, essentially, empowered &lt;a href=\"Punisher\"&gt;Punisher&lt;/a&gt;s. They count as Reapers and are only encountered in the Pandemonium Fortress or &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0(although some unique Executioners can be encountered before that). They are quite large and very tough (roughly five times more &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; than average monsters), with normal movement speed, but lack ranged weaponry.\u00a0Executioners are immune to &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0In addition to normal attack (very slow), their blades can be used in three more ways:\nExecutioners are most dangerous at mid-range. Their stunning leap can inflict severe harm and, most importantly, leaves the player vulnerable to attacks of other enemies for the duration of stunlock. Executioners rarely attack in large numbers (usually just one or two at a time), but are often assisted by hordes of other Reapers. They are extremely dangerous in groups of three or more, as they can keep the player in Stun continuously. Because of that, dealing with &lt;a href=\"Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; groups of Executioners requires clearing the ground first, killing the lesser enemies and, ideally, dealing with them one by one, preferably from afar. Fighting in the Pandemonium Fortress is especially complicated due to its architecture, as narrow bridges leave little place for maneuvering, so use of &lt;a href=\"Traps\"&gt;Freezing Gates&lt;/a&gt; is advised."}

Each time you, or a member of your party (whether it be your &lt;a href=\"hireling\"&gt;hireling&lt;/a&gt;, your minion(s), pets, &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;s or another player) kills a &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;, you gain a certain number of experience points.\nThe higher is your level, the more experience you will need to advance to the next level. In turn, more challenging enemies and quests award more experience, but generally, you will need to spend more time on each level to get the next character level.\nThere are two places where you can view your current amount of experience. One place is at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, the other place is the Experience Bar found on the user interface at the bottom of the screen (see image below).\nWhen your character reaches the amount of experience needed for the next level, he/she will \"level up.\" The moment this happens, you will hear a special sound, and in Diablo III, you will also see a message, accompanies by graphics. In addition, the moment you level up, you gain full &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; (or any other resources).\nWith each level up, heroes in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt; and Diablo II gain 5 stat points that can be allocated to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Character%20Attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;. Diablo II characters also gain\u00a01 skill point that you can use to acquire a new\u00a0\u00a0or upgrade a skill they already have (the gray cross buttons on the user interface will become red.\u00a0\u00a0). In Diablo III, heroes will automatically gain 3 of their primary stat, 2 &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; and 1 in other stats, and unlock one or more of their skills (or runes for existing skills).\n&lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; experience in Diablo III is slightly different (and is of blue color), but otherwise follows the same rules, awarding one Paragon point instead of normal stat bonus.\nStat, Paragon and skill points earned can be allocated by\u00a0opening your &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt;. Paragon points are allocated through the menu accessible via the blue button atop of character stats.\nIn Diablo II, your mercenary/hireling will gain experience as well, though only in the expansion can you see the actual experience of a hireling. They can not, however, increase their experience if they are the same level as you. Furthermore, they only gain experince from monsters you or your minions kill, and of course monsters they kill themselves. A bonus applies if the hireling does the kill.\nFrom version 1.10 and ahead there's a penalty to your experience gain from level 70 and up, where you from level 95 gain less than 10% of the actual experience. This was implented to make it more challenging to reach the maximum level 99.\nIn Diablo III, followers do not need to earn experience: they level up automatically the moment the character that leads them gains a new level. All three followers level up simultaneously.\nInteresting facts and metrics.\nIn Diablo II, when playing single player game with /players 8 command, having +10% XP &lt;a href=\"Annihilus\"&gt;Annihilus&lt;/a&gt; and +5% XP &lt;a href=\"Ondal%27s%20Wisdom\"&gt;Ondal's Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; from lowest possible levels, efficiently using expericence shrines, clearing all the dungeons, visiting all the locations in natural/quest order (including &lt;a href=\"Cow%20Level\"&gt;Cow Level&lt;/a&gt; but not including &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Clone\"&gt;Diablo Clone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt;) and killing absolutely every monster in the game only once will give you approximate of:\nSimilarly, in Diablo III, each new difficulty increases the experience gain multiplicatively to all other modifiers. In addition, one may equip items that award either bonus experience gain rate, or just add more experience per kill:\nEither experience bonus on a follower transfers 1/5 (20%) of this amount or percentage to the character. At level 70 (maximum), all +% bonuses for experience are reduced to 1/10 (10%) of efficiency. The only exceptions are &lt;a href=\"Action%20Combat\"&gt;Action Combat&lt;/a&gt; modifiers and &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Shrine of Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a group, experience gained is averaged evenly among all characters in the party that can gain it.\nreduced XP from NPC kills.\nIn the first battle of Diablo 3 (killing risen to enter town) you get more XP (reaching level 2 is guaranteed) if you kill the enemies, as compared to standing around and letting the guards do the killing. Some XP is still attained, but a reduced amount, so the character may enter town at level 1."}

The resulting detonation not only allows her to damage her intended target, but also anything caught within the explosive blast. The sight of a full battalion of Amazon archers firing a volley of such arrows is eerily beautiful. Many warriors, having witnessed good friends consumed by the flames of these arrows, vow never to fight against Amazon warriors ever again.\"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nExploding Arrow is the second in the line of Fire Arrows for the Amazon, and is essentially an upgraded version of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Arrow\"&gt;Fire Arrow&lt;/a&gt;. Upon contact with an enemy (to-hit not required) or an obstacle, this spell causes an explosion, dealing fire damage to every enemy in the radius. The arrow itself maintains its usual effect (deals damage, leech, and any other miscellaneous effects like &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; and such), as well as possibly &lt;a href=\"Pierce\"&gt;piercing&lt;/a&gt; if the to-hit check passes. Any fire damage effects from equipments, charms, and possibly an &lt;a href=\"Enchant\"&gt;Enchant&lt;/a&gt; buff or &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt; aura from certain equipments are not only added to the arrow itself, but to the explosion as well. If the arrow pierces, it may hit an additional enemy (or an obstacle) and cause a \"second explosion\", and so on.\nAlthough this skill also has an upgrade in &lt;a href=\"Immolation%20Arrow\"&gt;Immolation Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, Exploding Arrow has the benefit of not having any &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; timer, allowing the Amazon to spam it rapidly. Although the base damage is low, with enough supplemental external fire damage the damage per second of this skill can surpass Immolation Arrow, and possibly even &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Arrow\"&gt;Freezing Arrow&lt;/a&gt;. An Amazon with dedication to this skill and the right equipment can still become a very effective character, as long as she has some sort of backup plan against the common enemies immune to fire on higher difficulties.\nSkill Progression.\nDamage Radius: 3 yards\nItems.\nSeveral ranged weapons fire exploding arrows when using normal attack:\nNon-class-specific ones are an excellent choice for ranged &lt;a href=\"Enchantress%20%28Build%29\"&gt;Enchantresses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt; paladins."}

Corpse explosion is an extremely powerful spell at high levels and can easily kill monsters.\n\"This build is generally only effective on multiplayer games, since it relies on other players to make the first kill.\"\nSkills.\nAmplify Damage.\nCorpse Explosion is 50% fire and 50% physical damage. &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; increases physical damage +100%, so it increases the total Corpse Explosion damage 50%. You need more than one point here. The reason for maxing this is that the radius increases, allowing you to cast it on all enemies (even those off-screen), so you can spam corpse explosion on enemies you can't even see.\nCorpse Explosion.\nAfter another player has killed an enemy, cast &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt; on its corpse. This will cause area of effect damage around the corpse, dealing 70-120% of the corpse life in damage. How many points you put here is up to you, but it is best to max it\nSafety Skills.\nThe spare skill points go into two safety skills. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Golem\"&gt;Fire Golem&lt;/a&gt; makes the best tank, because it has the most life in mode and can absorb fire. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Armor\"&gt;Bone Armor&lt;/a&gt; is another safety skill.\nChaos Sanctuary and Corpse Explosion.\nSince Storm Casters have the lowest combined Fire/Physical Resistances, use Corpse Explosion to kill them.\nMercenary.\nBecause this build needs corpses, it's best to avoid cold-based Mercenaries which can shatter monsters' bodies and leave no corpses. A &lt;a href=\"Defiance\"&gt;Defiance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Might\"&gt;Might&lt;/a&gt; aura Act II &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Desert Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; can serve as a tank and corpses-maker for an Explosionmancer."}

Given its diminishing returns per point, however, it is not advisable to max out Fade, nor can it be a complete substitution for equipment with resistances. The hidden bonus to Physical resistance, though, does not suffer from diminishing returns.\nCharacters of other classes can obtain Fade from the &lt;a href=\"Treachery%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Treachery Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Last%20Wish\"&gt;Last Wish&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0rune word.

The \"grunts of the underworld,\" Fallen occupy the lowest rung of the demonic hierarchy. They are looked down upon by other demons, and when it comes to feeding, they get the \"crumbs\" of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; remains. Maybe some bones. The Fallen have absorbed the cruelty inflicted upon them, and reflect it back into the world. This cruelty is reflected among the Fallen in the design of their weapons (a predisposition towards spikes). When unleashed upon the &lt;a href=\"mortal%20realm\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt;, the Fallen display a tendency to swarm like flesh-hungry locusts, and they have been known to tear apart a sleeping village in minutes. Other than feasting on &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; flesh and killing the only act that gives these unspeakable horrors pleasure is breeding; hence the tendency to encounter them in large packs. However, due to their small size, cowardice appears to be one of the chief features of this species. They prefer to attack under the guise of darkness and in large numbers whenever possible. If they are shown great strength, preferably by killing one of their kind, they will retreat and regroup. However, their appetite for destruction will eventually overcome their caution, and they will attempt to strike again.\nFallen rarely travel alone. They are pack creatures, and seek to congregate together. As such, certain Fallen inevitably rise to dominant positions within their respective groups. These creatures have a rough tribal organization and are ruled by the more powerful &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; members of their race. However, they display no obvious tendency towards greater organization beyond their predisposition to swarm. This is fortunate for humanity, for they are so numerous that if they were to band together in large numbers, they might easily overwhelm a small city.\nFallen &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; smells foul.\nFallen have their own language. In it, \"&lt;a href=\"genzaniku\"&gt;genzaniku&lt;/a&gt;\" translates as \"slayer of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s.\"\nFallen flesh can be used to make exceptionally strong barding for horses, though some are too afraid of demonic possession to risk using this material.\nTypes.\nAt least five types of Fallen are known to exist:\n&lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; suspected that there were two other types of Fallen. &lt;a href=\"Junkrat\"&gt;Junkrat&lt;/a&gt;s are counted among the family of the Fallen.\nHistory.\nThe Fallen Ones were once exalted demons of the Burning Hells. They served as &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;'s hands, performing acts that he would not, could not involve himself in. They were the instrument of Azmodan's first failed attempt to usurp power from &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and his brothers, and after that failure, the fallen were subjected to the full wrath of Diablo. They were twisted into small, ridiculous imps, in contrast to their previously powerful forms. Moreover, if they expected Azmodan to reverse their condition, they were sadly mistaken. The infuriated Azmodan held them responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;' continued reign, and so he left the fallen in their new bodies, where their degradation would serve to amuse him for all eternity. Their failure provided him with the information he required to succeed in dethroning Diablo and his brothers - the event now known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;\" - but that fact did nothing to soften his heart toward the Fallen.\nAround the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Fallen became very common throughout the woodlands of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Small encampments of Fallen were observed, but with no obvious overall organization. However, the Carvers and Dark Ones were seen closer to the fringes of civilization, indicating that the Prime Evils' sway may be stronger than previously understood.\nFallen were seen in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Army of Sin&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Siege of Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the return of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Fallen in the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt; were emboldened, straying closer to &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt; than they had previously.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", the Fallen are represented solely by their Imp forms, but are simply referred to as &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20One%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Fallen Ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo II.\nFallen return as enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".

They are related to &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fallen Ones&lt;/a&gt;, and they are found leading large groups of them, casting s and &lt;a href=\"Revive%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;resurrecting their fallen comrades&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nUnlike their lower Fallen warriors, Shamans are not cowardly and do not run away if one of their own are killed and can be easily noticed by their slightly larger size, deeper voice, larger horns and long, flag-adorned staff. It is wise to dispatch the Shaman before attacking their Fallen underlings, otherwise they will simply revive any that are slain. However, the Shaman cannot resurrect Fallen that are not of his breed; so a Carver Shaman cannot revive a Fallen One. They attack by sending fireballs from their staffs and in close-combat, resort to using a knife; their fireballs are slow-moving, however, and easy to dodge. Defensively, they are slightly tougher than Fallen warriors, though they are still fairly easy to kill. There are four other variations of Fallen Shamans, one for each type of Fallen One: Carver Shamans, Devilkin Shamans, Dark Shamans, and Warped Shamans. Unique Shaman can revive normal Shamans, and may even spawn in groups with no Fallen ones.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1.00 version of the game Warped Shamans could spawn in the &lt;a href=\"Durance%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Durance of Hate&lt;/a&gt; Level 3. This was changed in later revisions, and thus only one appears in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Throne of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Colenzo%20the%20Annihilator\"&gt;Colenzo the Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;.There is an unused graphic in the files called \"ShamanHealMissile01\" which means that Fallen Shamans were planned to heal their fallen minions.\nAt some point, Fallen, Carver, Devilkin, Dark One Shamans were called: Enraged, Demented, Deranged, Depraved Shamans."}

Only Aberrant familiars can be Legendary, and this requires them to have a stat over 170 and an Advanced trait.\nConversion.\nConversion is available from the Familiar interface. It requires 3 max-level familiars of the same classification (Normal or Aberrant). It consumes the 3 familiars and creates a new one. When converting normal familiars, there is 20% chance to obtain an aberrant familiar in addition to the conversion result, which may be of a different species.\n&lt;a href=\"Conversion%20Stone\"&gt;Conversion Stone&lt;/a&gt;s can only be used for Aberrant familiars and guarantee that the familiar quality does not decrease.\nExchange Attributes.\nExchange Attributes is available from Nisza. It requires 2 familiars, but they don't have to match in classification. The process costs 3000 platinum. The result is that the two familiars will have their 4 main stats swapped. There is no way to pick and choose which stats to transfer. The quality of the familiars is updated after the exchange.\nTrading.\nAberrant Familiars can be sold on the . A familiar bought from the Market has a 2 day cooldown before it can be sold again. There is a countdown for this but it's hidden at the very bottom of the familiar info tooltip, under the descriptions of the passive skills.\nFamiliar Expedition.\nBonded Familiars can be sent on expeditions at &lt;a href=\"Nisza\"&gt;Nisza&lt;/a&gt;. The following expeditions are avaiable:\nMultiple familiars can be sent on the same expedition, and an expedition already in progress can be sped up by sending additional familiars. The number of familiars divides the completion time accordingly. There is no way to recall an expedition that is already in progress.\nDevelopment.\nWhen visualizing the Familiars, the art team took inspiration from multiple mythological creatures. \nHistory.\nMelding was another process for combining familiars. It required 2 max-level familiars, and could only be used on Normal familiars. It combined the two familiars into one, allowed picking between their skills and increased the stats of the primary familiar if the sacrificed one had a higher stat.\nIn the update, familiars' item pickup speed was increased.\nThe update on added the ability to empower multiple familiars at the same time, added Conversion Stone Fragments as rewards for ending pacts, and melding using Conversion Stones to add rare skills to familiars (the cost increasing with the number of Rare skills that the familiar has: 0/1/2/3/4/5 skills required 1 shard/1/2/3/8/16 stones). From this update onwards, the companion familiar appears on the character select screen.\nThe update added the ability to save familiar selection to the &lt;a href=\"Armory\"&gt;Armory&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe update added a highlight rectangle on the melding screen to show which species is being preserved, added a button to remove a familiar without replacing it, and a display of active traits on the Traits button.\nThe update added expeditions, removed melding, and changed the mechanics of conversion such that instead of normal familiars randomly turning into an aberrant one, the aberrant familiar is randomly obtained as an extra. This update also made new normal familiars untradeable, and added Enhanced Rare skills and Legendary Traits as a possibility on normal familiars."}

Lazarus had thrown in his lot with &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; however, and the whole rescue mission was a trap. Lazarus lured the townsfolk to the lair of &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt; and left them to die at the hands of the ravening demons. Farnham survived, and also saved the life of his friend &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt;, but he suffered his own wounds. &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt; the healer was able to heal Farnham physically, but there was nothing that Pepin could do to restore his mind. The experience had shattered Farnham's spirit, and he turned to liquor for an escape.\nThus, Tristram continued to slide into darkness, as did Farnham himself. He spent much of his time at the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;Tavern of the Rising Sun&lt;/a&gt;, slipping further and further into stupor each night. &lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt; were frustrated by his increasing drunkenness, but Ogden at least could sympathize with Farnham's experiences, and let him stay.\nDuring his bouts of drinking, Farnham made several attempts to return to the depths of the cathedral. Eventually he succeeded, and recovered his daughter, who had been severely wounded. He managed to get her to the surface, screaming for Pepin to help her. At the surface, he was greeted by &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and the newly returned Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing that his daughter could not be saved, and could very well &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;rise again&lt;/a&gt;, Cain led Farnham away as Aidan used his blade to give his daughter peace.\nDespite his condition and traumas, Farnham remained a kind, yet tortured soul, staying sympathetic to the other villagers during the dark times, especially &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt;, whom he said \"is a kid with more problems than even me\". He was, however, very skeptical about &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, calling her \"unnatural\". Farnham was also suspicious about Deckard Cain's origins, saying he \"knows more than he knows\".\nAs Aidan, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Summoner\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt; delved into the depths of the cathedral, Farnham remained in his drunken stupor, occasionally spilling a few information or two (in his own inebriated way) to aid the small band of adventurers. Eventually, Aidan and the other heroes defeated the Lord of Terror, and an uneasy peace returned to Tristram. The remaining townsfolk warily embraced their salvation, but Farnham remained distant and withdrawn, still nursing his grog. However, such salvation did not last, as Aidan had been corrupted by Diablo as a result of inserting his &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; into his head. Soon after he left Tristram, now in the guise of the Dark Wanderer, demons set upon the town. Like all the remaining townsfolk, Farnham was slaughtered and raised as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; thrall.\nBeyond the Grave.\nOver &lt;a href=\"timeline%231285\"&gt;twenty years later&lt;/a&gt;, Farnham was one of the many who rose as the &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Dead\"&gt;Risen Dead&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt; hit the old cathedral. &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; was able to put him down however.\nIn-game.\nDiablo.\nFarnham appears as an NPC in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", located in Tristram's far south. He doesn't initiate any quests, but his ramblings can be useful given the hints they contain.\nDiablo II.\nFarnham is nowhere to be found in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", but there is a skeleton very close to his spot, likely belonging to him.\nDiablo III.\nFarnham returns in \"\" as a unique\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Risen%20Dead\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; named Farnham and titled 'the Drunk'. He spawns towards the end of an onslaught of &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Cellar\"&gt;The Cursed Cellar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Chest\"&gt;Cursed Chest&lt;/a&gt; event and possible &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; that takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Damp%20Cellar\"&gt;Damp Cellar&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, this kind of Cursed Chest simply requires killing as many normal monsters as possible, with no &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt;; Farnham is the only one to appear as an \"event boss\" in this way.\nIn combat, he appears close to the door - unlike the rest of his horde, which appear close to the chest as normal. He has the &lt;a href=\"Orbiter\"&gt;Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt; traits, and pursues the closest player.\nPersonality and Traits.\nPrior to venturing into the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; to search for Prince &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;, Farnham was supposedly a \"hero\" (in his own words), and was a normal, sane man. However, after his party was led into an ambush at &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt;'s room, by the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, with only him and &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Grisworld&lt;/a&gt; surviving, his mind was shattered. Now a broken shell of a man, Farnham was drastically scarred by the experience, both physically and emotionally. He'd spend most of his days at the local &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt; in Tristram, a slave to alcoholism to help cope with his trauma.\nMost of the remaining inhabitants of Tristram showed mixed feelings regarding Farnham. &lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt;, the tavern owner, disapproved the man drowning his sorrows into ale, but out of pity allowed him to stay. According to Farnham himself, Ogden's wife, &lt;a href=\"Garda\"&gt;Garda&lt;/a&gt;, didn't like him very much. Similarly, the barmaid, &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt;, was frustrated by Farnham's never-ending cycle of alcoholism and spouting of nonsense. &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt; wasn't very fond of Farnham either, but was sympathetic by the man's deep emotional trauma, as the boy himself was also attacked by demons in the cathedral.\n&lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt;, the kind healer, also felt bad for Farnham, and stated that while he was able to heal wounds after the ambush in the cathedral, he was unable to mend his mind and spirit. &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt; had nothing but respect for the drunkard, and the two shared a brotherly bond, as Farnham helped him survive the attack in the cathedral; the blacksmith only lamented being unable to save his friend's fighting spirit.\nFarnham was oblivious to most of the townsfolk's sentiments towards him. But despite his drunkardness, he was a very perceptive man. Farnham was one of the few people who noticed how unnatural the witch &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; was, stating that he never saw her drink or eat. He also noticed that &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; knew more than he was letting on.\nWhile interacting with the heroes, Farnham would often relive his traumatic experiences in the cathedral, particularly shook by the blood-stained visage of The Butcher, as well Lazarus' betrayal, both responsible for the death of his friends. However, underneath the drunkard blabbery, there was wisdom in Farnham's words; he would occasionally offer useful advice."}

A Bashiok post has confirmed that they were specially created for the gameplay video, but the dream is to include them in the final game as well.

The fatalities were partially implemented in form of many attacks (including &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s) brutally destroying the victim's corpse.\nFatalities were removed from the game due to the variety of enemies in the game, and the inability to standardize animations.

If feared enemies are &lt;a href=\"immobilized\"&gt;immobilized&lt;/a&gt;, cornered or otherwise cannot flee any farther, they just stand idle, effectively being paralyzed. Fear only prevents use of attacks and active skills; all other effects will work as normal, and some skills can be used while Feared.\nFear has no effect on &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; in both games.\nLesser &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, unless supervised by a &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Overseer\"&gt;Fallen Overseer&lt;/a&gt;, always flee in fear when they see another Fallen killed, in all three games.

Monsters can even have a &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20III%29%23Nightmarish\"&gt;Nightmarish&lt;/a&gt; affix that gives a chance on attack to send the enemy fleeing in terror away from the caster.

Even\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bottomless%20Potion%20of%20Fear\"&gt;one of Legendary Potions&lt;/a&gt; causes enemies to flee upon use.\nCC resistance reduces the duration of Fear. Note that players, while Feared, can still use some skills and even drink &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;.\nBosses are immune to Fear, but all other enemies are affected by it normally.\nDiablo Immortal.\nFear returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" in the Nightmarish , in which the monster releases a roar that causes the player to flee a short distance away. \nThe &lt;a href=\"legendary%20gem\"&gt;legendary gem&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Wreath\"&gt;Nightmare Wreath&lt;/a&gt;\" inflicts Fear on nearby monsters after killing a monster.

Defeating the Horror and opening Tortured Gifts during Helltide provided players with an updated version of 2023's Gileon's Brew elixir. The &lt;a href=\"Midwinter%20Square\"&gt;Midwinter Square&lt;/a&gt; was \"resurrected\" in &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"Gileon\"&gt;Gileon&lt;/a&gt; was absent and the special currency and cosmetic store of last year's Midwinter event did not return. The &lt;a href=\"Midwinter%20Ward\"&gt;Midwinter Ward&lt;/a&gt; could be used once per account to collect gifts.\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"Midwinter%20Blight\"&gt;Midwinter Blight&lt;/a&gt;, the first event featuring the Red-Cloaked Horror."}

The player travels to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; to stop the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; from freeing &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAct II is harder to navigate, partly due to the lack of roads. Unlike the other acts, Act II requires several dungeons (to complete the staff) to be completed before it can be finished, instead of just killing the act boss.\nSummary.\nThe player reaches Lut Gholein in distant &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Warriv\"&gt;Warriv&lt;/a&gt;'s caravan. It soon becomes clear that the evil has spread into the east, shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; passed through.\nThe city is being plagued by an undead monster hulking in the sewers. At night the monster launches raids against the unsuspecting townsfolk of Lut Gholein. The player immediately blends into the city by helping &lt;a href=\"Atma\"&gt;Atma&lt;/a&gt; avenge her husband and son by killing the creature, &lt;a href=\"Radament\"&gt;Radament&lt;/a&gt;, in the city &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Act%20II%29\"&gt;Sewers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player consults the Lord of Lut Gholein, &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt;, who together with the wizard &lt;a href=\"Drognan\"&gt;Drognan&lt;/a&gt; concluded that the Dark Wanderer that passed through Lut Gholein was &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself. It seems Diablo is searching the desert for the &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Tomb of Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, wherein his brother &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; lies imprisoned. The player is tasked with creating an &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Staff%20%28item%29\"&gt;Horadric Staff&lt;/a&gt;, the key to &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Chamber&lt;/a&gt;. The player then sets off to find the parts of the staff.\nThese require a vast search of the desert to find. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Claw%20Viper\"&gt;Claw Vipers&lt;/a&gt; capture the sun, enshrouding Aranoch (full effect unknown) in darkness; the player eventually manages to restore the sun by destroying the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Sun%20Altar\"&gt;Tainted Sun Altar&lt;/a&gt; deep within their temple.\nWith the Horadric Staff restored, the player sets out to find the location of the Tomb of Tal Rasha. Clues to the whereabouts of the mythical Seven Tombs were found within the ethereal &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of great &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Sanctuary, the player encounters the maddened sorceror known only as &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;The Summoner&lt;/a&gt;, whom the hero defeats.\nAfter searching the lost &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Canyon of the Magi&lt;/a&gt; the hero finally reaches the Tomb of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, but it's already too late. Baal has already been freed, the hero runs into &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; boss), one of the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, guarding the tomb and attempting to stop anyone from following his masters.\nAfter the hero manages to defeat Duriel, the Archangel &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; is found imprisoned inside the tomb's inner chamber. Tyrael thanks the player for his freedom and instructs the player to travel East once more, towards the city of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. For it is there the two brothers hope to reunite with their elder brother, the Lord of Hatred, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack in Lut Gholein the player talks to &lt;a href=\"Meshif\"&gt;Meshif&lt;/a&gt;, and together they sail east.\nQuest Necessity and Tips.\nWith the exception of Radament's Lair and the Summoner, all quests must be completed in order to traverse to Act III. Choosing to complete Radament's Lair rewards the player with 1 free Skill Point, and a 10% discount on wares offered by the merchants. Choosing to kill the Summoner instead of making a run towards the book and escaping quickly through the portal will not affect you in any way."}

This set can only drop at\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0difficulty.\nThis set is named after &lt;a href=\"Kunai\"&gt;Kunai&lt;/a&gt;, the Demon Hunter who became one with the shadow.\nWhile technically it can be completed by any class, it is specifically designed for Demon Hunters.\nPieces.\nThe set consists of six pieces, all of which are required to complete the set. None of them are Demon Hunter-restricted.\nSet Bonus:\nThe first bonus, while providing a significant multiplicative damage bonus, also limits the assortment of skills the Demon Hunter can use. Any &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; melee weapon will suffice, coupled with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; or, more commonly, a &lt;a href=\"quiver\"&gt;quiver&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second bonus infinite duration does not apply to the Night Bane rune: it will still last 5 seconds from activation, effectively turning the skill semi-passive (reapplication for 8 &lt;a href=\"Discipline\"&gt;Discipline&lt;/a&gt; will only slow enemies around the Demon Hunter). It also does not activate the Shadow Power as passive skill upon being equipped, therefore Demon Hunter must actually learn this skill and manually turn it on in order to benefit from it.\n&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; type of the last bonus matches that of the skill itself (manually chosen rune). This effect can only hit one enemy per cast; to compensate, &lt;a href=\"Fan%20of%20Knives\"&gt;Fan of Knives&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Greenstone%27s%20Fan\"&gt;Lord Greenstone's Fan&lt;/a&gt; is suggested by developers. Despite this, many builds forgo mass damage entirely and focus on single-target sniping of the &lt;a href=\"Elites\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; enemies.\nSkill runes (most notably Grievous Wounds) only apply to the skill itself, not to the 75,000% weapon damage, since the bonus damage is resolved as a separate hit.\nDevelopment.\nThe set originally consisted for four components.\nThe Shadow's set was more defense-oriented than &lt;a href=\"Embodiment%20of%20the%20Marauder\"&gt;Embodiment of the Marauder&lt;/a&gt;. As of patch 2.0.5., developers planned to rework it to make this set more balanced and popular: in the end, they replaced the &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; reduction per\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; kill with Shadow Power gaining all runes, and added an &lt;a href=\"Awareness\"&gt;Awareness&lt;/a&gt;-like effect to the minor bonus. This made Demon Hunters the only class (at the moment) with three (including the &lt;a href=\"Beckon%20Sail\"&gt;Beckon Sail&lt;/a&gt; cloak) class-specific effects that save the character from dying.\nAt some point on PTR, this set was making Shadow Power last forever, but eventually it was replaced with all runes at once bonus. The bonus was brought back in 2.4.\nNote that this set, although usable by\u00a0\"any\" hero of any class, could not give an extra life to &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; characters who were not Demon Hunters.\nPrior to patch 2.4, the set had the following bonuses:\nSmoke Screen cast by the former bonus was free and fully benefited from runes."}

The hero saved the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, and prevented &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; from manifesting in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. During the fighting, the Shard-seeker met &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, who revealed that he had come to Wortham to search for the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; shard that had landed nearby, and advised them of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Ashwold\"&gt;Ashwold&lt;/a&gt; shard. Their meeting was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Xul\"&gt;Xul&lt;/a&gt;;talking through a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; told Cain that his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Lethes\"&gt;Lethes&lt;/a&gt;, had acquired a shard of the Worldstone, and brought ruin upon Ashwold. Cain told the hero to retrieve the shard and then meet him at &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, where it would be safer to destroy them.\nAshwold.\nArriving at Ashwold, the hero found the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; rising en masse. The hero was able to save Xul from Lethes, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Guard\"&gt;Ashwold Guard&lt;/a&gt;, but could not save &lt;a href=\"Asylla%27s%20handmaiden\"&gt;Asylla's handmaiden&lt;/a&gt; from being murdered by Lethes in her quest to find the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Asylla\"&gt;Queen Asylla&lt;/a&gt;. It was discovered that this was part of Lethes's plan to resurrect King &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, and the hero entered &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Manor\"&gt;Ashwold Manor&lt;/a&gt; to slay Leoric in his own domain. Upon exiting, they found that Lethes had escaped Xul; pursuing her, they fought the rogue Necromancer and defeated her, but Xul explained that Lethes was likely still alive. Xul pursued Lethes, while the hero carried on to Westmarch.\nWestmarch.\nAt Westmarch, the hero met &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt; and later, Cain at his &lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; explained that there was no safe way to destroy the shard as of yet, but directed them to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;, as he'd detected a third shard there. \nThe Dark Wood.\nThe hero arrived at &lt;a href=\"Blackstone%20Village\"&gt;Blackstone Village&lt;/a&gt; in the Dark Wood, which had been destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;. They allied with the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;, which were fighting against the Bloodsworn. &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; informed the hero that the Bloodsworn were being led by an ex-&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Lakrii\"&gt;Lakrii&lt;/a&gt;, and that a Worldstone shard could be the source of the cult's power. After entrusting them with the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Bestiary\"&gt;Horadric Bestiary&lt;/a&gt;, Akara introduced the hero to &lt;a href=\"Hemlir\"&gt;Hemlir&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;, who would conduct a ritual to reveal the means of cleansing the corruption that plagued the Dark Wood.\nThe hero gathered the reagents Hemlir required, but the ritual failed. Hemlir advised them to head to the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Inifuss\"&gt;Tree of Inifuss&lt;/a&gt;; along the way, they came across a confrontation between Lakrii and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cult of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;, confirming that Lakrii's mistress possessed the Dark Wood's Worldstone shard. At the tree, Hemlir conducted the ritual at the cost of his life, but in so doing, he revealed that &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt; possessed the shard lay in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and was fed &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt;. Hemlir died, and &lt;a href=\"Flavie\"&gt;Flavie&lt;/a&gt; informed the hero that the Sisterhood had attacked the Forgotten Tower. The hero knew that as long as the Blood Rose survived, the Countess could not be slain. They headed to slay the Blood Rose.\nThe hero slew the Blood Rose, and at Akara's direction, went to the Forgotten Tower to aid the Rogues in their assault. They slew the Countess, and in so doing, gained the third Worldstone shard. The Sisterhood remained in the Dark Wood to deal with the Bloodsworn, while the hero returned to Westmarch.\nReturn to Westmarch.\nThe hero returned with the Dark Wood shard. With three shards in his possession, Cain attempted to destroy them, but failed. After conducting some research, Cain told the hero about &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;One of Kulle's libraries&lt;/a&gt; lay in the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and it was there, Cain theorized, that they might find a means of destroying the Worldstone shards. Calling in a favor, Cain had &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rehm\"&gt;Captain Rehm&lt;/a&gt; provide his &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bower\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; as transport to Shassar.\nThe Shassar Sea.\nThe hero arrived in Shassar, where they saved &lt;a href=\"Zov\"&gt;Zov&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Scorpion\"&gt;Sand Scorpion&lt;/a&gt; bandits. Zov led them to the &lt;a href=\"Tabri%27s%20Encampment\"&gt;encampment&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Blades\"&gt;Amber Blades&lt;/a&gt;, which was under attack by &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt;. In order to get into &lt;a href=\"Tabri\"&gt;Tabri&lt;/a&gt;'s good graces, the hero slew a lacuni &lt;a href=\"Alvas\"&gt;pack leader&lt;/a&gt;, and returned its hide to the encampment. Tabri told the hero she would consider helping them find the Library of Zoltun Kulle if they provided her the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;Scepter of Fahir&lt;/a&gt;. The hero obtained &lt;a href=\"Fahir%27s%20Command\"&gt;Fahir's Command&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Chamber of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fahir%27s%20Visage\"&gt;Fahir's Visage&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;Tomb of Fahir&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Light%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;Light of Fahir&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Chamber of Truth&lt;/a&gt;. The assembeld scepter was given to Tabri, who through it, claimed dominion over Shassar. Holding up her end of the bargain, she assigned &lt;a href=\"Peth\"&gt;Peth&lt;/a&gt; to guide the hero to Kulle's library.\nPeth guided the hero to the library's entrance and opened it for them. With that, the hero ventured inside.\nThe Library of Zoltun Kulle.\nInside the library, the hero was attacked by &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt;, who refused to believe their protestations that they were no thief. Nevertheless, the Curator did not back down until the hero defeated them. The hero explained that they were trying to find a way to destroy the Worldstone shards. The Curator responded that there might be information in Kulle's private archives on such a topic, but that the library had fallen into disrepair, and that it would have to be restored if they were to access the information. The hero succeeded, and with the library now under the Curator's control, they met with the hero in the &lt;a href=\"Archive%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Archive of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;. There, they showed the hero a &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; that recounted Kulle's defeat of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; centuries ago, during the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;. The hero relived Kulle's memories of the event, where it was revealed that only an &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;'s weapon could damage the Worldstone. That presented a problem, for the Curator only knew of two such weapons, and the first, &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt;, was beyond their reach. The other, however, was named &lt;a href=\"Yl%27nira\"&gt;Yl'nira&lt;/a&gt;, and rested inside the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Namari\"&gt;Temple of Namari&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Bilefen\"&gt;Bilefen&lt;/a&gt;. The Curator used the library's &lt;a href=\"terminus\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; the hero to Bilefen.\nBilefen.\nThe hero arrived at Bilefen, and was directed to &lt;a href=\"Port%20Justinian\"&gt;Port Justinian&lt;/a&gt;. There, they met with &lt;a href=\"Talva%20Silvertongue\"&gt;Talva Silvertongue&lt;/a&gt;, who directed them to the Temple of Namari. There, they met with &lt;a href=\"Jin\"&gt;Jin&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=\"Xian\"&gt;Xian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; who intended to summon &lt;a href=\"Namari\"&gt;Namari&lt;/a&gt; in order to access her ancient texts. In this, she succeeded, and the two &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s met with Namari's spirit. Namari revealed that the \"temple\" was, in fact, a prison, dedicated to imprisoning &lt;a href=\"Sargoth\"&gt;Sargoth&lt;/a&gt;. However, three beacons from the temple had been stolen, and if they were returned, they would have a chance to destroy Sargoth before he escaped. If they did this, she would provide the texts and Yl'nira.\nFollowing Jin's advice, the pair headed back to the port, where they met a &lt;a href=\"Crimsonblade\"&gt;Crimsonblade&lt;/a&gt; pirate, who was willing to provide information on one of the beacons. The hero meanwhile headed back to see Talva, but had to save the port from a &lt;a href=\"Fetish\"&gt;Fetish&lt;/a&gt; attack. Talva told them what he knew of the two beacons. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Cadeus\"&gt;Cadeus&lt;/a&gt;, the hero recovered the first beacon, and slew &lt;a href=\"Ongori\"&gt;Ongori&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the second.\nThe hero met with &lt;a href=\"Jin\"&gt;Jin&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Crimsonblade%20Haven\"&gt;Crimsonblade Haven&lt;/a&gt;. Jin explained that her negotiations had gone poorly, but that she'd learnt that the pirates' leader kept the beacon aboard his ship. They made it to the ship and into the captain's cabin, where they confronted and defeated Captain &lt;a href=\"Rhodri\"&gt;Rhodri&lt;/a&gt;. With his death, the third and final beacon was obtained, and they returned to Namari. Returning the three beacons, Namari led the hero into the temple, while Jin took the nephalem's place at the altar.\nThe hero slew Sargoth, and Namari gave them her tomes and Yl'nira. After exiting, they gave Jin the tomes she'd sought, and the two parted ways. Afterwards, the hero was summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Arena\"&gt;Ancient Arena&lt;/a&gt;. After battling through the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, they were contacted by &lt;a href=\"the%20Unspoken\"&gt;the Unspoken&lt;/a&gt;, who indicated that they might be worthy. The spirit gave them a &lt;a href=\"Timeworn%20Scroll\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt;, and hinted that soon, the hero would understand.\nWestmarch (Again).\n returned with Yl'nira to Cain in Westmarch. Using the dagger the three shards were destroyed. Cain revealed that his last ritual revealed another shard upon &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a mountain located not far from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bower\"&gt;Rehm's ship&lt;/a&gt; wasn't ready to sail. Cain gave a cryptic letter addressed to them that he received while they were away. He advised them to address the letter while he secures them passage.\nThe letter informed to head to &lt;a href=\"Selynne%27s%20Basilica\"&gt;Selynne's Basilica&lt;/a&gt; to learn about an ancient cycle that has protected Sanctuary. There they met the Unspoken,who told them about the &lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Cycle of Strife&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 an ancient war between the &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt;, ancient defenders of Sanctuary, and the &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, a group dedicated to deposing the Immortals should they become corrupt.\nBy the time they returned to Cain, Rehm was ready to sail. He informed them that he would take them to a port near Mount Zavain, from where they can use a caravan to travel up the mountain.\nMount Zavain.\nUpon arriving at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt;, the Shard-seeker came upon &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s; both human and &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; littered about. They also met &lt;a href=\"Oza\"&gt;Oza&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Veradani\"&gt;Veradani&lt;/a&gt; monk) further along the road. She warned them to be careful about the khazra, which had been agitated as of recent. After defeating another band of khazra, Oza led the Shard-seeker to the local outpost of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Sentinel's Watch&lt;/a&gt; (which had been the main target of the recent Khazra's agitation).\nUpon reaching the outpost they inquired about the state of affairs from the &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Vereks\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, who was relieved to receive reinforcements, especially from a monk. As he informed the duo of the current situation, they were interrupted by a &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Ralvar\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;, who came with news that a &lt;a href=\"Razed%20Village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; to the south had been lost to the khazra, who now occupied its ruins, and had captured some of the soldiers sent to repel them. He also informed that more khazra were attacking from the north. offered to go to the village with the soldier and rid it of khazra.\nThe village was already destroyed, and overrun by &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Clan\"&gt;Moon Clan&lt;/a&gt; khazra. The duo were able to save &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Krynn\"&gt;one guard&lt;/a&gt; who was trapped in a well. &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Weir\"&gt;Another guard&lt;/a&gt; was tied to a stake at the villages square, near an active summoning ring. The duo was unable to save him from being sacrificed to summon &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Clan\"&gt;Blood Clan&lt;/a&gt; khazra. When the battle was over, noticed a carving of an eye in the summoning circle. They recognized it as the symbol of the Cult of Damnation, and guessed that they would be the cause of the khazra aggression. After that, they returned to Sentinel's Watch.\n reported their findings to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Vereks\"&gt;Captain Vereks&lt;/a&gt;. Vereks told them to help reinforce Oza,who had been fighting khazra non-stop since they left to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Razed%20Village\"&gt;Razed Village&lt;/a&gt;. was able to provide Oza some relief, and told of their findings; that a cult was behind it, and they sought to deliver a shard of the Worldstone to their Lord.\nOza was surprised by the news as the only shard on Zavain was safeguarded by the &lt;a href=\"Veradani\"&gt;Veradani&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctified%20Earth%20Monastery\"&gt;Sanctified Earth Monastery&lt;/a&gt;; a place she believed the cult would be unable to breach. The duo were then attacked by khazra, and Oza told to head into their den and eliminate the cultists inciting the aggression.\nDestruction's Wake.\n&lt;a href=\"Zatham\"&gt;Zatham&lt;/a&gt; informed the Shard-seeker that they had discovered how to use the &lt;a href=\"Pathstone\"&gt;Pathstone&lt;/a&gt;. They would now sail to &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt;. The Shard-seeker went to see Karshun and Cain, but Cain was leaving to investigate a rumor he had heard of. He said his goodbyes to the Shard-seeker and their fellows. Afterwards, Karshun instructed the Shard-seeker on how to use the Pathstone to make their way through the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Sea\"&gt;Forgotten Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shard-seeker met with Zatham at the Westmarch docks. He informed them that two ships had departed Westmarch in the dead of night, likely belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt;. They sailed aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Bower\"&gt;Black Bower&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSplintered Souls.\nWith Diablo having claimed the soulstone shard, the Shard-seeker (with Tyrael still within their mind) travelled to the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Dreadlands\"&gt;Southern Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;, in hope of finding &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt;.\nRite of Cleansing.\nCaked in &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; from their conquests, the Shard-seeker turned to &lt;a href=\"Nisza\"&gt;Nisza&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, in order to keep their mind and body whole.\nCrucible of Justice.\nHaving retrieved El'druin from the Dreadlands, the Shard-seeker was tormented by their inability to wield it. The Sword of Justice rejected the darkness that had crept into the Shard-seeker's body and mind with the shattering of the Worldstone shards, and their torment began taking a life of its own. They became a host for malevolent specters, and evil poured from their body, feeding on the Shard-seeker's very &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo contain the evil festering within and prepare for their confrontation with Diablo, the Shard-seeker travelled to the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Isles\"&gt;Cold Isles&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse their impurity, and therefore, be worthy to wield El'druin."}

To first-time visitors, the Shepherd asked how to deal with minds polluted by the use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. If their answers moved the Shepherd, they would receive a room, clothing, and a brace of knives. \nThe Shepherd trained their orphans in martial and mental discipline, and spoke at length of the calamitous power offered to mages within the Yshari Sanctum. As the flock grew, the Shepherd had them eavesdrop on travelers and impersonate local criers. They shared stories of dangers within the Sanctum, stoking resentment. \nThe Shepherd's flock slew nine magi who abducted sacrifices in the slums, and collapsed one of the Sanctum's antechambers to prevent a contagion of lunacy from spreading. Following the Apprentices' Uprising, a group of Sanctum magi captured the almshouse and the Shepherd. The flock fled to the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;, but continued to hear the voice of the Shepherd, insisting on revenge. \nThe broken flock could not sleep for the incessance of the Shepherd's voice in their minds. After bitter arguments, they gathered three of their number who remained.

This quest is known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Search%20for%20Cain\"&gt;The Search for Cain&lt;/a&gt;. After rescuing him, he follows and advises the player throughout the game, as well as offering his insight of magical artifacts to identify any properties of the items that the player stumbles upon during his/her adventures.\nIn their travels, the player finds a &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt; filled with riches and defeats &lt;a href=\"The%20Countess\"&gt;The Countess&lt;/a&gt;.

The Smith used the Malus to create weaponry for the minions of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. The Smith was not a particularly subtle fighter, and upon being confronted by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, he attacked them immediately.

It can be accessed through portals rarely left behind by Treasure Goblins, or by transmuting a . The Ancient Vault is an even more lucrative version of the Vault from an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Item\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; ring.\nIn-game.\nThe Vault is shaped like a cave of massive proportions, and countless passages can be seen in the background, with hundreds of Goblins travelling through these passages, in and out of the portals, chain carts carrying treasure above the players' heads. In-game, however, the dungeon is rather small and can be fully cleared in just a few minutes, for players visit but a small portion of the realm.\nOpening the way.\nThere is a very small chance that killing a Treasure Goblin will open a portal through which player(s) may enter the Treasure Realm. The portal can only appear at level 70 in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;. Only players who were present when it appeared are able to enter it.\u00a0Only one Vault portal can be opened at once, shared among all participating players.\nThe portal can also be opened in &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; by transmuting a in &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;, losing it in the process. The level of the ring affects the result: lower levels decrease the rewards received. On the other hand, using an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Item\"&gt;Ancient/Primal&lt;/a&gt; ring opens The Ancient Vault, with the same layout as the normal one, but pitch black ambience and all Vault Sentries replaced with Treasure Goblins.\nGreed's Realm will close 60 seconds after opening the boss loot chest, instantly teleporting players still inside back to town. A new Vault portal can be opened after the previous one closes.\nInside the Realm.\nThe game zone is named The Vault, or The Ancient Vault if an Ancient ring was transmuted. It is filled with piles, pots and chests of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(millions per run) and &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(all of which are of Imperial quality). Numerous Treasure Goblins can be encountered here (hiding in the gold piles), and &lt;a href=\"Hobgoblin\"&gt;Hobgoblin&lt;/a&gt; Sentries and &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Realm%20Peon\"&gt;Peons&lt;/a&gt; try to stop the intruders. The Treasure Goblins hiding in the treasure piles, however, drop less loot than their normal brethren and are much more vulnerable to attack. Normal Treasure Goblins are very rare, but also eventually spawn.\nSome good choices of equipment can be a pairing of a and a ; together, these two pieces of equipment can escalate the player's &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; rating to an unreasonable level. This is also a good time to equip on &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt;, since aside from the large amounts of gold available, the usual choice of has no benefit here, as there are no &lt;a href=\"Shrines\"&gt;Shrines&lt;/a&gt; inside.\nThe Inner Sanctum.\nAt the end of the Vault lies the Inner Sanctum (previously \"Grand Vault of the Realm\"), a small circular zone with a massive gem mounted in the center. Greed herself sits on a throne of gold until disturbed. Treasure Fiends jump off her back when she charges into a wall during the &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; fight; they can be slain for additional loot, but they \"cannot be interrupted\" from escaping into a portal after a short time.\nWhen Greed is killed, Greed's Strongbox falls gruesomely on top of her. Opening it drops extra loot and starts the 60 second zone shutdown timer. &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used in The Inner Sanctum until after the chest is opened.\nDevelopment.\nThe Treasure Realm was designed after the \"Hobbit\" 2014 film, Scrooge McDuck's Money Pit, and a bee hive.\nIt was intended that the realm's in-game appearance convey how vast the area truly is. As such, rock formations hold the player above the realm as a whole in order to convey its true size. New methods were used to craft in-game assets for the realm.\nDuring the Patch 2.1.0 PTR, the zone name was Treasure Realm, and The Inner Sanctum was called the Grand Vault of the Realm."}

Knaak&lt;/a&gt; and published in 2007.\nDescription.\nSince the beginning of time, the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic forces of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic hordes of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; have been locked in the Eternal Conflict for the fate of all Creation. That struggle has now spilled over into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the world of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to win mankind over to their respective causes, the forces of good and evil wage a secret war for mortal &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s. This is the tale of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the conflict that would forever change the destiny of man.\nThe demon-backed &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; has fallen. All that now stands in &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;'s path to freeing humanity is the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; and its charismatic leader the &lt;a href=\"the%20Veiled%20Prophet%20%28person%29\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. But the Prophet is actually the renegade angel Inarius, who sees the world he created as his uncontested domain. Facing a cunning foe that would just as readily see Sanctuary destroyed than let it slip from his grasp, Uldyssian is blind to the others who would possess his world. Both the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; now know of Sanctuary...and their warring hosts of demons and angels will stop at nothing to claim it.\nSummary.\nThe Veiled Prophet continues Uldyssian's journey toward &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt; City where his goal is to seek the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt; as allies against Inarius and his Cathedral of Light. The book lays the ground for upcoming Diablo games and novels.\nUldyssian plans to reach Kehjan City to convince the Mage Clans to ally against the Prophet (Inarius) and his &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; servants. However, things get complicated. Uldyssian renamed his followers as The &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt;, the descendents of the firstborn: the &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Serenthia\"&gt;Serenthia&lt;/a&gt; and Uldyssian's brother, &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt;, helped him control the masses of nearly a thousand Edyrem marching toward Kehjan City, still days ahead. Meldeln had learned from Rathma the ways of the Necromancer and communed with Ghosts who would tell him things as spies at his service. The Edyrem found a few merchant wagons and decided to talk to the influential merchant to seek an audience with the Mage Clans. Only Uldyssian continues the journey to Kehjan City alongside the merchant. Otherwise, Kehjan City would see the approach of a thousand Edyrem as an impending invasion.\nOn their way to the city, a mage and a servant attack the merchant wagons. Everyone is killed, but Uldyssian who fought in vain against a binding spell. Shortly, the mage brought Uldyssian to his sanctum beneath Kehjan City. The mage planned to frame Uldyssian to look like the murderer of the influential merchant so that the Edyrem would be blamed. His monstrous servant kept watch over Uldyssian, while his master left to meet the Mage Clans. The servant was more than what he seemed to be \u2013 it was possessed by &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt;, the loyal servant of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. Uldyssian had thought Malic had died at the Church of the Triune all this time, and painfully found out how he had survived. In his hand, the monster held a crystal \u2013 a fragment of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. He would use it to transfer his soul into a new host. Each host burning away within days or hours. All this time seeking the opportunity to find Uldyssian as his final host.\nMalic had taken possession of a disfigured man to serve and fuel the powers of one of the Mage Clans members, to put in motion a plan to reach Uldyssian. The monster was nearly possessing Uldyssian. The mage was interrogated by the council of the Mage Clans concerning the dead of the merchant and his guards, as their magic probes made them suspect the mage had something to do with the massacre. When suddenly, the building shook after an explosion. The mage arrived to the scene. Uldyssian was gone. His servant dead. Or nearly dead, for it possessed the mage claiming him as a new host.\nUldyssian ran still disoriented through the streets of Kehjan city, and found the Prince Ehmad on his way. The Prince trusted Uldyssian's words and promised an audience with the Mage Clans and nobles. However, Angel Inarius, as the Prophet, had sent many to spread lies across the land, blaming Uldyssian and the Edyrem for the deaths of innocents all the way from &lt;a href=\"Toraja\"&gt;Toraja&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Seram\"&gt;Seram&lt;/a&gt;. Inarius invaded Uldyssian's mind using his power to weaken him. They fought, and Uldyssian broke. To Uldyssian, he had failed to defeat Inarius and felt weak before such an opponent. However, the truth was that Inarius was deeply hurt. Uldyssian was much, much more than any mortal.\nInarius now feared Uldyssian. He would condemn all of Sanctuary just to destroy him. Even accept a pact with the Lord of Terror. More and more events are set in motion to pit and clash the Mage Clans against the Edyrem portraying Uldyssian as a killer of innocent people. And amidst all this conspiracy, lurked the menace of Malic's spirit who could be anyone, within any new host.\n&lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt; and Rathma assist Uldyssian and his brother Mendeln, guiding them. But this is no longer a fight between Inarius and the edyrem. The fate of Sanctuary and of many worlds is in peril. Trag'Oul the cosmic dragon can no longer keep Sanctuary cloaked from the High Heavens. The edyrem march toward the Cathedral of Light, far to the north and are welcomed by the servants of the Prophet empowered by their master. The edyrem are a worthy enemy, but when Inarius himself confronts Uldyssian the whole world of Sanctuary literally trembles as both titans collide as equals.\nJust as the battle is nearly over, a more dangerous threat looms over Sanctuary \u2013 the Heavenly Hosts arrive by the thousands from a vortex in the sky. Edyrem fought Angels bravely, but if that was straining, things get spicy when the Burning Hells open its gate wide open into Sanctuary \u2013 clashing &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;, Edyrem, Nephalem and Angels in utter carnage against each other. Only one may stop the madness. It ends in a breathtaking and unexpected way.\nWhen calm settles upon Sanctuary, the five members that compose the Angiris Council arrive to Sanctuary to rule judgement over Inarius and his creations. &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(Aspect of Valor), &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(Aspect of Hope, female), &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(Aspect of Wisdom), &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(Aspect of Fate), and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(Aspect of Justice). The Council composes their verdict: Malthael abstains, Imperius votes against the humans, while Auriel, Itherael and Tyrael vote for the humans. Suddenly, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; comes forth to settle a pact with the Angiris Council. Tyrael requests an act from the Demon Lord as proof he will fulfill his end of the pact. Mephisto agrees, with the condition that he and his brothers would be given a prize to take with them to the Burning Hells; Inarius. Knowing that Inarius is to be imprisoned forever for going rogue, Imperius quickly complies, moments before wondering about what if the rest of the Angelic Host should stop the corruption from spreading, and whether to have someone stand guard over Sanctuary."}

{"id": "45405", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=45405", "title": "The Wanderer (Diablo IV)", "text": "The Wanderer is the title given to the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; that serves as the protagonist of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nThe Wanderer's life was apparently not an easy one. In their experience, \"survival often forces difficult choices.\" Prior to their mishap in &lt;a href=\"Nevesk\"&gt;Nevesk&lt;/a&gt;, they were apparently already aware of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; and their claims pertaining to their &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Holy Father&lt;/a&gt;.\nDusk on the Mountain.\nNevesk.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, while in the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, the Wanderer travelled by &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, weary from a long journey. They looked for a settlement to rest, but all they came across were ruins. One night, their horse was spooked and ran away, but was eaten by wolves.\nWeary and without a mount, the Wanderer slept in a cave. Unknown to them, a &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; came to the cave while they were asleep, but spared them and left. They later left the cave in order to find better shelter before they froze to death. As they journeyed through the blizzard, they came across dead horses and &lt;a href=\"warg\"&gt;warg&lt;/a&gt;s. Finally they come across the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nevesk\"&gt;Nevesk&lt;/a&gt;. While they first thought the town was abandoned, they heard voices in the dark, and went to investigate.\nFollowing the sound of anguished cries, the Wanderer came to a barn where they met &lt;a href=\"Oswen\"&gt;Oswen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vani\"&gt;Vani&lt;/a&gt; watching over an &lt;a href=\"Iosef\"&gt;insane monk&lt;/a&gt;. Oswen was gruff and suspicious, but Vani welcomed them warmly and took them to an inn. Asking about the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s the insane monk was screaming about, the Wanderer discovered out that the &lt;a href=\"Icehowl%20Ruins\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; to the north were infested with demons. They headed to the ruins.\nAfter a successful extermination, they returned to a hero's welcome. In the party held in their honor their drink was spiked. After falling unconscious, the villagers delivered the Wanderer to Oswen, who took them to a bloody barn, where they were to be sacrificed to &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. To consecrate the Wanderer as a sacrifice, Oswen fed them Lilith's &lt;a href=\"blood%20petal\"&gt;blood petal&lt;/a&gt;s. While he was sharpening the ritual knife, the insane monk snuck in and kills Oswen by bashing his head from behind.\nThe insane monk was revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Iosef\"&gt;Iosef&lt;/a&gt;, a priest from the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. He had also been drugged after returning from the ruins, which made him delirious. When he recovered and tried to escape, he discovered out that the whole town, apart from the inn and the locked chapel, was empty. With his help, the Wanderer was able to get to safety, killing &lt;a href=\"crazed%20villager\"&gt;crazed villager&lt;/a&gt;s on the way out. The Wanderer took no pleasure in killing the villagers, but survival demanded it.\nOnce safe, the Wanderer began to retch blood petals. Trying to find a clue, they checked the local chapel. When the Wanderer touched the bloodied floor, they had a vision that the villagers had been corrupted by a horned woman, who called them her children, and was in turn welcomed like a mother.\nThe Mountain Hermit.\nAfter informing Iosef of their vision, he advised the Wanderer to seek help from a mountain hermit who lived to the northeast of Nevesk. He also advised them to bring the hermit to the chapel in &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;. When the Wanderer reached the hermit's cabin, it was empty. While they were searching around, the hermit arrived with a hunt. Instead of being angry, he invited the Wanderer to dinner.\nThe hermit was revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;. After hearing of the Wanderer's tale, he told them that the horned woman was &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, Daughter of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Hatred&lt;/a&gt;, Mother of Sanctuary. He also told them of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s origin: that it had been created by &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;, and Lilith, a demon, as a safe haven for them and their followers who were tired of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. Lilith's motivations were a mystery however, and the Wanderer resolved to use their connection to her (having ingested her blood at Nevesk) to discover her goals. Lorath told them to rest while they could, for they would soon head for &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe journey to Kyovashad was not an easy one, for they had to deal with marauding &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Father%27s%20Cross\"&gt;Father's Cross&lt;/a&gt;, Lorath told the Wanderer that it was a statue of Inarius; that the claims of the Cathedral pertaining to their \"Holy Father\" were true. Arriving at the Kyovashad &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad%20Gatehouse\"&gt;gatehouse&lt;/a&gt;, they were waylaid by a guard, who demanded they take part in the cleansing ritual required to enter the city. While Lorath was waved through (as he'd refused to take part in the ritual for years), the Wanderer was forced to take part before being granted entrance.\nThe Wanderer met Lorath inside the city, who was preparing to take a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that he was headed for the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to search for the &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;pale man&lt;/a&gt; the Wanderer had seen in their vision. He sent them to retrieve his &lt;a href=\"Lorath%27s%20Polearm\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ozren\"&gt;Ozren&lt;/a&gt;. Much to the Wanderer's displeasure, they had to pay for it. However, Ozren gave them a &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Amulet\"&gt;strange amulet&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the &lt;a href=\"polearms\"&gt;polearm&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that Lorath had sold it to him as well, but suspected that he'd want it back.\nThe Wanderer returned with both the polearm and amulet. After being asked, Lorath explained that the amulet was the mark of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;; an order of scholars and &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s that he was part of. He suggested the Wanderer seek out another Horadrim, &lt;a href=\"Donan\"&gt;Donan&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;, but reminded them not to forget about the Cathedral of Light, as they could prove to be useful allies. He thus departed for the Dry Steppes.\n\"Note: The events in Fractured Peaks, Scosglen, and Dry Steppes can be tackled in any order. The article has present the events in &lt;a href=\"act\"&gt;act&lt;/a&gt; chronology.\"\nA Cold and Iron Faith.\nTo Yelesna.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%20%28Fractured%20Peaks%29\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the Wanderer found Iosef praying to Reverend Mother &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt;. They reported that Lorath had sent them to the Cathedral without him, much to Iosef's dismay. Prava told the Wanderer that they'd received word of a demon sighting in &lt;a href=\"Gale%20Valley\"&gt;Gale Valley&lt;/a&gt; that matched Lilith's description, and asked the Wanderer to investigate in Lorath's stead. \nThe Magpie and the Knight.\nAt Yelesna, the Wanderer asked for Knight Vigo at the &lt;a href=\"Knights%27%20Garrison\"&gt;Knights' Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, but was told that he went to the mining camp to the north, to confirm the claims of a troublesome child about sightings of a demon woman.\nAt the entrance to the mines, they met Vigo standing guard. Before they could question him, they were interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt;, the girl who had been pestering the knights about sightings of Lilith. She had been pestering Vigo to let her into the mines so that she may try to save her mother from Lilith's clutches. The Wanderer was able to convince Vigo to let Neyrelle along with them into the mines by saying that Prava sent them.\nThe trio entered the mines, but due to the ore hoist being inoperative, they had to pass through a &lt;a href=\"Condemned%20Mines\"&gt;condemned section&lt;/a&gt;; one that was collapsing, and filled with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. They managed to fight their way through, but the mines collapsed behind them. With the ore hoist inoperative, and their way back blocked, Vigo lamented they were trapped. Neyrelle, however, spotted a great statue of Lilith. The Wanderer noted that the architecture of the &lt;a href=\"Firstborn\"&gt;buried civilization&lt;/a&gt; they'd found themselves before, and wondered if things had gone from bad to worse. Nevertheless, they continued on, and found the base of the ore hoist. A demon's corpse had jammed the gears. The Wanderer removed it, allowing the platform to descend. Vigo noted that the demon had been slain.\nThe group found a wounded knight, &lt;a href=\"Grendan\"&gt;Grendan&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that Lilith had revealed herself as a demon after she and the escort reached the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Kasama\"&gt;Kasama&lt;/a&gt;, slaughtering them. She had, however, left Neyrelle's mother, &lt;a href=\"Vhenard\"&gt;Vhenard&lt;/a&gt;, alive. Vigo left to alert the Cathedral, while Neyrelle and the Wanderer continued into the city. Inside, the Wanderer found more blood petals, and saw a vision of Lilith and Vhenard, the latter timidly giving her allegiance to the Daughter of Hatred. The Wanderer told Neyrelle that her mother was alive, explaining (however briefly) the nature of their visions. Further in, the Wanderer had a second vision, by which point it was clear that Vhenard's allegiance to Lilith was solidifying, and that they were searching for &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt; in the city. They passed through the &lt;a href=\"Cradle\"&gt;Cradle&lt;/a&gt;, and in-between fighting demons, the visions continued. The Wanderer saw Neyrelle fully give herself to Lilith, and it was clear that they were going to perform a ritual.\nThe pair made it to the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Lake\"&gt;Black Lake&lt;/a&gt;, where they found Vhenard writing runes in her own &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly insane, Vhenard explained that she had carried out a ritual that had allowed Lilith to cross the lake, but that she lacked the \"divine element\" required to cross. Neyrelle asked her to leave, but Vhenard, turning violent, wounded her daughter and began summoning demons. The Wanderer slew the demons, and Vhenard collapsed, dying seconds later. They told Neyrelle they were sorry, and while Neyrelle felt some animus towards the Wanderer for the role they'd played in her mother's death, she knew it wasn't their fault.\nNeyrelle told the Wanderer to go to Prava to receive the divine blessing that would be required to cross the lake. She would head for &lt;a href=\"Mistral%20Woods\"&gt;Mistral Woods&lt;/a&gt; to search for the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Vault\"&gt;Horadric Vault&lt;/a&gt; believed to be there; perhaps something would be found that would help with the ritual. At Neyrelle's request, the Wanderer left her to mourn her mother.\n\"Note: The events of \"Pilgrimage\" and \"Secrets of the Horadrim\" may be played in either order. They are presented here in the default order within Diablo IV.\"\nPilgrimage.\nThe Wanderer returned to &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;, seeing &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt; to give them the blessing required to cross the Black Lake. Entering the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%20%28Fractured%20Peaks%29\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, they found &lt;a href=\"Iosef\"&gt;Iosef&lt;/a&gt;, who told them that Prava had departed for &lt;a href=\"Kor%20Valar\"&gt;Kor Valar&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving at Kor Valar, they reunited with Vigo, who explained that he'd told Prava what had happened at Pine Hill, and she was unimpressed with his failures. They saw her together, where Prava told the Wanderer that if they wanted the blessing they sought, they had to make a pilgrimage to &lt;a href=\"Alabaster%20Monastery\"&gt;Alabaster Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Vigo told the Wanderer to meet him at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Light\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; south of the fortress.\nThe Wanderer met with Vigo, who explained that they had to carry an &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20the%20Faithful\"&gt;idol&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;Fields of Judgment&lt;/a&gt; in order to 'cleanse' them in preparation for their meeting with &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. The Wanderer overcame the trial and met Vigo at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Penitent\"&gt;Shrine of the Penitent&lt;/a&gt;, who directed them to &lt;a href=\"Alabaster%20Monastery\"&gt;Alabaster Monastery&lt;/a&gt; to meet Inarius. Inside, they found the monastery almost completely empty sans &lt;a href=\"Orlin\"&gt;Orlin&lt;/a&gt;, and beyond him, Inarius himself. Kneeling before the angel, the Wanderer requested Inarius's blessing so they could cross the Black Lake. Inarius refused, claiming that humanity was weak, and that Sanctuary had been wasted on the crusades of the unworthy.\nThe Wanderer returned to Kor Valar, where they told Prava that Inarius had refused to bless them. Prava pointed out that the Wanderer was standing before her unscathed, which was more than what could be said for many others who pilgrimaged to Alabaster. Thus, she gave the Wanderer the blessing they sought.\nSecrets of the Horadrim.\nThe Wanderer entered &lt;a href=\"Mistral%20Woods\"&gt;Mistral Woods&lt;/a&gt; in their search for &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Vault\"&gt;Horadric Vault&lt;/a&gt;. In so doing, they entered the &lt;a href=\"Darkened%20Holt\"&gt;Darkened Holt&lt;/a&gt;, where they were confronted by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Wolf\"&gt;Bloodied Wolf&lt;/a&gt;. The wolf explained they were trapped in a Horadric illusion, and led them through a portal into a &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;dreamscape&lt;/a&gt; that resembled &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, albeit consumed by Hell. The wolf explained that it was they who'd saved the Wanderer after they'd lost their horse, and that it wished to help them stop Lilith. However, it warned them against following the Horadrim, for the path they walked always ended in fire and death, as the vision demonstrated. A day would come when the Horadrim stumbled, and the wolf warned them not to be there when they did. \nThe wolf directed them to another portal that would return them to the Darkened Holt. Passing through it, the Wanderer found themselves in the same Horadric illusion, but was able to find Neyrelle.\nThe Making of Monsters.\nThe Wanderer arrived in &lt;a href=\"Ked%20Bardu\"&gt;Ked Bardu&lt;/a&gt;, where they found Lorath\u2014drunk, asleep, and having earned the ire of the townsfolk. The Wanderer woke him up, and Lorath explained that he'd discovered that the pale man the Wanderer had seen in their vision in &lt;a href=\"Nevesk\"&gt;Nevesk&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;Elias&lt;/a&gt;, his former apprentice. They had to find him, then kill him. But before they did that, he sent the Wanderer to talk with &lt;a href=\"Teckrin\"&gt;Teckrin&lt;/a&gt;, who had been handling his messages.\nTeckrin explained that she still didn't have any word from &lt;a href=\"Orbei%20Monastery\"&gt;Orbei Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, but she'd heard rumor that a pale man had passed through the &lt;a href=\"Abahru%20Canyons\"&gt;Abahru Canyons&lt;/a&gt;. The Wanderer brought this news to Lorath, who was torn between pursing Elias, or investigating Orbei. He chose the former, and gave the Wanderer the choice of following him, or investigating Orbei themselves.\nThe Malignant.\n&lt;a href=\"Cormond\"&gt;Cormond&lt;/a&gt;, a former priest of the Cathedral of Light, wrote to the Wanderer, requesting aid in stopping the &lt;a href=\"Malignant\"&gt;Malignant&lt;/a&gt;. However, while the letter never reached them, circumstance had the two cross paths, as while in &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;, the Wanderer heard a &lt;a href=\"Vyrtan\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; raving about \"corruption.\" How he had seen someone turn into a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; on the road to &lt;a href=\"Menestad\"&gt;Menestad&lt;/a&gt;. The Wanderer set off, and encountered Cormond being chased by a strange creature. Cormond fled into a &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Clearing\"&gt;nearby clearing&lt;/a&gt;, and the Wanderer entered in pursuit, slaying the creature. Cormond, greatful for being rescued, explained that the creature was a &lt;a href=\"Malignant\"&gt;Malignant&lt;/a&gt;; a former human who'd been consumed by Lilith's corruption. Cormond taught the Wanderer how to use a &lt;a href=\"Cage%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Cage of Binding&lt;/a&gt;, which could contain the corruption. This was treating the symptoms rather than an actual cure however, and Cormond asked the Wanderer to meet him at &lt;a href=\"Orbei%20Monastery\"&gt;Orbei Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, where he would continue his research.\nThe Wanderer met Cormond at the monastery, who explained that he'd found designs for &lt;a href=\"Cages%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Cages of Binding&lt;/a&gt; in the monastery. Given enough time, he might be able to find a cure for the Malignant, but time would need to be bought by the Wanderer, as the Malignant had spread to the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. The Wanderer was asked to venture into the &lt;a href=\"Malignant%20Tunnels\"&gt;Malignant Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; to clear out the Malignant, which they did, eliminating the Malignant in the Steppes, at least temporarily. As Cormond was still searching for a cure, the Wanderer resolved to continue fighting the Malignant and build strength for whatever came next.\nThe Wanderer returned to Cormond's wagon, and after surviving a Malignant ambush, found a note left by Cormond to meet him at Orbei. The Wanderer met him there, and Cormond explained that he'd found a hall of records under Orbei's old archive. He was sure that it would contain information on Cages of Binding. They travelled through the monastery's crypts and entered the Hall of Records, where the Wanderer found writing that mentioned the discovery of Cages of Binding at &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, a giant Malignant burst into the hall, calling Cormond by name, prompting him to flee. The Wanderer defeated the creature, but when they tried to capture its heart, the cage exploded and the heart flew away.\nThe Wanderer returned to the surface; the creature clearly knew Cormond, and it was clear that the priest knew more than he'd divulged. Cormond explained that the creature was called &lt;a href=\"Varshan\"&gt;Varshan&lt;/a&gt;. That he was a fellow priest who had been driven mad by Lilith. Cormond had tried to use a Cage of Binding on him to remove the corruption, but this caused the corruption to burst out of Varshan, consuming his body and &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, and in so doing, turning him into the first Malignant. It was from Varshan that the Malignant had spread. Cormond told the Wanderer that he was headed for Hawezar to find a better cage to cure Varshan, and hoped the Wanderer would meet him there.\nThe Wanderer obliged, meeting Cormond outside &lt;a href=\"Zarbinzet\"&gt;Zarbinzet&lt;/a&gt;. He directed them to search old Zakarum structures in the region. The Wanderer returned with a collection of Zakarum writings, which Cormond analyzed. After fighting the &lt;a href=\"Malignant\"&gt;Malignant&lt;/a&gt;, the Wanderer returned to Cormond, who informed them that he'd learnt that the Cages had been created in a Zakarum outpost, now sealed.\nThe pair travelled to &lt;a href=\"Karamat%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Karamat's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, and after conducting a ritual, gained access to the outpost. There, they discovered a place of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Reading through old writings, the Wanderer learnt that the outpost had been operated by the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Inquisition\"&gt;Zakarum Inquisition&lt;/a&gt;. They had used the Cages of Banding on Malignant (or Malignant-like creatures), and while the Wanderer was able to find a superior Cage of Binding, it was clear that Varshan would be killed in the process. Cormond was aghast, in light of the knowledge that none of the Malignant could be saved, that their deaths were on his hands. Accepting the reality of the situation, he told the Wanderer to return to his village. Where it started, it would also end.\nThe pair returned to &lt;a href=\"Velkhova\"&gt;Velkhova&lt;/a&gt;; the village where Cormond and Varshan had been when Lilith arrived. The town was in ruins and infested by Malignant, which the Wanderer disposed of before the pair made their way into the &lt;a href=\"Velkhova%20Church%20Undercroft\"&gt;church undercroft&lt;/a&gt;. The pair performed a ritual, which summoned Varshan. As in Orbei, the Wanderer defeated him, and used the advanced Cage of Binding to destroy Varshan's heart, killing him, and in so doing, marking the end of the Malignant. A morose Cormond told the Wanderer to meet him by his wagon on the surface.\nBack on the surface, Cormond explained that with Varshan destroyed, the Malignant would start to diminish. The Wanderer asked why Cormond hadn't told them the truth about Varshan when they first met, to which Cormond responded \"how could I confess to someone like you?\" He explained that the Wanderer did not comprehend how they were perceived, how they were regarded with fear and awe alike.\nSeason of Blood.\nDue to recent events, a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; cult led by Lord &lt;a href=\"Zir\"&gt;Zir&lt;/a&gt; emerged to torment the surface world. At first, their actions were were small in scale, but as their ambition grew, their caution decreased, and the Wanderer received word of suspicious vampiric activity. Magistrate &lt;a href=\"Oren\"&gt;Oren&lt;/a&gt; requested their presence in investigating his &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, which had experienced a slew of murders at the hands of these creatures.\nThe Wanderer arrived in &lt;a href=\"Ked%20Bardu\"&gt;Ked Bardu&lt;/a&gt;, where rumors of missing merchants swirled around town. They talked with Oren, who directed them to &lt;a href=\"Vasily%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Vasily's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, where the last merchant caravan had gone missing. Arriving in the area, they found an &lt;a href=\"Wayside%20Cave\"&gt;underground cave&lt;/a&gt; which vampires had been using as a lair, draining the blood of humans in order to claim their &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; birthright. While investigating a coffin within the cave, the Wanderer was bitten by a vampire and ambushed, while also hearing a &lt;a href=\"Zir\"&gt;mysterious voice&lt;/a&gt; from afar.\nThe Wanderer defeated their ambushers. They had been infected with vamprisim, but did not fall under the voice's control. Feeling different, the Wanderer returned to Ked Bardu to confront Oren. Upon entering his office, the Wanderer discovered that the magistrate wasn't there, but also discovered a secret alcove left open, albeit with a group of &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s that had ambushed a vampire hunter named &lt;a href=\"Erys\"&gt;Erys&lt;/a&gt;. The pair worked together and defeated their ambushers.\nSearching for clues, the Wanderer found a note written by Oren, revealing that he'd been summoned by his master to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Hallows\"&gt;Tomb of Hallows&lt;/a&gt;. They showed it to Erys, who noticed their bite mark, but noted that given the depth of the wound, the Wanderer should have already turned. Without time to investigate further, the pair headed for the tomb. Entering, they found Oren in the midst of his own execution, struck down by vampires. They slew his executioners in turn, but with Oren dead, they'd lost their one link between them and the cult's leader. Erys returned to Ked Bardu to follow up with some contacts, while the Wanderer was left alone to scour the tomb for clues.\nAs the Wanderer descended into the tomb, the voice that they'd heard in Vasily's Reach resurfaced, mocking them, beckoning them in. Arriving in the tomb's depths, the Wanderer was faced with a bloody apparition of the vampire lord\u2014Zir, the leader of the cult. Zir declared that the Wanderer would join his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Seekers\"&gt;Blood Seekers&lt;/a&gt;, but the Wanderer refused. Zir was taken aback, at first unable to understand why the Wanderer had not yet turned into a vampire, but realized the truth, that Lilith's blood was preventing the Wanderer's transformation. He warned the Wanderer that \"the more you thirst, the more you will understand.\"\nThe Wanderer defeated the tomb's remaining vampires and returned to Ked Bardu. They reunited with Erys and recounted what had happened in the tomb. With the revelation that Zir was an Ancient, Erys suggested they head to an Ancient burial site in &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;. If they could find the remains of a vampire from the time of the Ancients, there was a ritual she could attempt.\nThe Wanderer and Erys travelled to &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;, where they entered the &lt;a href=\"Fetid%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Fetid Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; and recovered the skull of an Ancient vampire. Erys returned to Ked Bardu, while the Wanderer was charged with obtaining enough &lt;a href=\"potent%20blood\"&gt;potent blood&lt;/a&gt; for the ritual. Having retrieved enough blood, the Wanderer returned to Ked Bardu. Erys could tell that the Wanderer's power was growing, but they were still apparently immune to the effects of the vampire bite they'd suffered in Vasily's Reach.\nThe skull was soaked in potent blood and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Skull\"&gt;revived&lt;/a&gt;\u2014alive, but not necessarily lucid. Erys deduced that it had once been an underling of Zir, but things had ended badly (including, but not limited to being separated from its body). The skull wanted revenge on Zir, and to this end, it would help the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s before it. It opened a portal to the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;City of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; which Erys and the Wanderer passed through. However, upon their arrival, they found their way blocked by a sealed door. They survived a vampire ambush and returned through the portal.\nErys explained that she'd seen the barrier from the city before, and that she'd have to prepare a ritual to bypass it. The skull advised the Wanderer that if they were to prevail against the undying, they had to become undying themselves. Or, more specifically, to slay Zir's Blood Seekers. Erys advised against it, but giving in, gave the Wanderer the information she had on Zir's Blood Seekers, reasoning that at the least, &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; would benefit from their absence.\nThe Wanderer slew a number of Zir's Blood Seekers before returning to Ked Bardu. Re-entering the office, they didn't find Erys, but instead found a number of Blood Seekers waiting in ambush. They slew the Blood Seekers, and finding no signs of Erys, used their own blood to revive the skull they'd retrieved earlier. The skull told them that Erys had left for the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%20%28Fractured%20Peaks%29\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in Kyovashad, having apparently learnt something. The skull also noted that the Wanderer reeked of the vampiric curse. That the Wanderer was becoming like Zir, and Erys was aware of it.\nThe Wanderer arrived in Kyovashad and found Erys amidst a crowd that had gathered in front of the Cathedral. Erys, shocked to see them, led the Wanderer away so they could talk privately. She explained that the Cathedral was refusing to engage Zir's army, and admitted that she feared the Wanderer. They'd become so powerful, she doubted she could stop them if they lost control. The Wanderer assured her that they were still in control, but despite wanting to believe in them, Erys could not believe that. She ordered the Wanderer to kill as many members of Zir's army as possible, reasoning that if Zir succeeded, they were all damned anyway. She further explained that given the scale of the Blood Harvest, she suspected that Zir's army was making a \"big push.\" That Zir's ascension was nigh.\nThe Wanderer successfully routed Zir's forces and returned to Erys in Ked Bardu. Erys declared that they were ready to face Zir, and explained that she'd found a way to open the gate that had barred their access earlier. She ordered the Wanderer to meet her at the city. She explained that while the Wanderer had stopped the Blood Harvest, Zir would rally his legions and collect the remaining blood he needed to ascend. They had to kill Zir before that happened. Also, the skull that had aided them before had disappeared, which meant they needed to travel to the city themselves rather than use a portal.\nThe Wanderer met Erys at the city. Erys broke the seal, and the Wanderer entered the city proper, fighting through Zir's remaining forces, as Zir himself taunted them through the link they shared. Eventually, the Wanderer confronted Zir himself, who after descending into a pool of blood, emerged in new, horrific form. Nevertheless, the Wanderer was able to slay Zir in the ensuing battle.\nThe Wanderer returned to Ked Bardu, where they met Erys. Erys admitted to her former fears about them, and told the Wanderer that whatever was in their blood, it might cure them of their vampirism in time. However, while Zir had been defeated, his &lt;a href=\"thrall\"&gt;thrall&lt;/a&gt;s were still out there; the strongest of which would try to claim his throne, and the killings would continue. Erys announced that she was setting out to hunt them down, but joked that she'd leave a few for the Wanderer. As for the skull, Erys wasn't worried\u2014wherever it had got to, it couldn't have got far.\nThe Construct.\nA guard told the Wanderer of trouble brewing in &lt;a href=\"Gea%20Kul\"&gt;Gea Kul&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving in the town, the Wanderer found that a crowd had gathered in the city square, overlooking bound men. The Wanderer turned to &lt;a href=\"Otseg\"&gt;Otseg&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that the men were possessed by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. That they'd listened to an old man's stories of s and treasure, but had returned to Gea Kul, unable to speak. As they talk, one of the men broke free, leaving his arm behind and fleeing north. The Wanderer inspected the scene, and found a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt; that the man had dropped. They showed it to Otseg, who told them to return it to the vault north of the town.\nThe Wanderer found the vault and descended into it. There, they found an &lt;a href=\"Inert%20Construct\"&gt;inert construct&lt;/a&gt;. Due to its folding metal properties, they were able to strap it to their waist without issue. Less benign were the still-active &lt;a href=\"construct\"&gt;construct&lt;/a&gt;s, which the Wanderer fought their way through.\nLoot Reborn.\nBecause of their ferocity during the Blood Harvest, the Wanderer caught the attention of increasingly dangerous foes. \nVessel of Hatred.\nWhile the Wanderer had heeded Neyrelle's warning to not follow when she departed with the soulstone, given recent events, the Wanderer realized that Neyrelle could not handle her self-appointed task alone. Thus, they began searching for her. They entered &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;, where they worked with Elder &lt;a href=\"Eru\"&gt;Eru&lt;/a&gt; to find her. The Wanderer heard of many sightings of Neyrelle within the jungles.\nHatred Rising.\nHaving been decimated by Mephisto's corruption, the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Remnants\"&gt;Zakarum Remnants&lt;/a&gt; sought the Wanderer's aid.\nGame Effect.\nThe Wanderer is the protagonist of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", operating in a similar manner to &lt;a href=\"The%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;predecessors&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". They are referred to as \"(the) Wanderer,\" by other characters, with their name, class, etc. at the player's discretion. Artwork for \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Malignant\"&gt;Season of the Malignant&lt;/a&gt;\" depicts the Wanderer as a male , but the article is still written to leave the class and gender ambiguous.\nThe Wanderer's storyline is contiguous between s and expansions. In the storyline of \"Diablo IV\", all season and expansion storylines are canonically completed by the Wanderer.\nDevelopment.\nThe Wanderer's backstory and personality is intentionally left vague in the game, as the developers wanted players to be able to imagine it for themselves.\nPersonality and Traits.\nUnlike many, the Wanderer sought answers to the apparently inexplicable."}

The goal is to slay them both, in either order. Killing either warlord will cause the flow of their minions to stop, making fighting the other one harder (as his minions will no longer be distracted by the opposing army). Due to unlimited spawn of enemies, this is a great event to farm the challenges or achievements that require numerous kills.\nInterestingly, warlords will both see the Nephalem as a creature of the opposite race, and be sure that the other warlord has sent them:"}

Hundreds of tentacles of various sizes and lengths sprout from the oval mass. Any area on the Thonos' body that was not covered by tentacles was covered by eyes the size of a human's head, but otherwise very similar to the eyes of a human. The mouth was situated underneath the creature: it was a beak-like projection with rows of sharp teeth and a thick tongue.\nBackground.\nThe demon was first encountered when it attacked the undead hunter &lt;a href=\"Achilios\"&gt;Achilios&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Hashir\"&gt;Hashir&lt;/a&gt;.

Blessed with holy power, the archer makes quick work of the vile creature. \nThough the Thonos was described as a subterranean creature, in its final moments the demon tried to flee over land.

Damage type of this hit is not &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;; if used against players, it takes the average of &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt; to mitigate (&lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; also works against it). However, with patches, it was allowed to benefit from &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; elemental skill damage bonuses, unless another type is specifically stated.\nWhile Thorns only trigger when the character is attacked, skills like &lt;a href=\"Aberrant%20Animator\"&gt;Aberrant Animator&lt;/a&gt; can bestow these on &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nThorns damage is increased by your primary attribute, 1% per point, as any other damage. However, it cannot score &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s, and does not benefit from Critical Hit Chance or Damage in any way.\nThere are Thorns-centered builds, particularly for &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s, along with skill runes and passive skills and items that enhance the Thorns damage or grant it special properties. Thorns can trigger special effects where possible, but have a 0 &lt;a href=\"proc%20coefficient\"&gt;proc coefficient&lt;/a&gt;. Many items, gems (&lt;a href=\"Topaz\"&gt;Topaz&lt;/a&gt; in weapons and &lt;a href=\"Boyarsky%27s%20Chip\"&gt;Boyarsky's Chip&lt;/a&gt;) and even &lt;a href=\"Thorns%20of%20the%20Invoker\"&gt;one set&lt;/a&gt; enhance Thorns. However, do note that most percentage enhancements of Thorns from items or skills are additive (i.e., not multiplicative) and stack directly. &lt;a href=\"Vo%27Toyias%20Spiker\"&gt;Vo'Toyias Spiker&lt;/a&gt; and some other temporary effects are noted exceptions, being multiplicative to all other enhancements.\nAt level 70, most items can roll up to 2800 Thorns damage, while helms, chests, amulets, pauldrons, and belts can roll up to 7696. This results in a theoretical total of 58080 on all slots except main and off hands (73492 with weapons and shields). However, with &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Legendary\"&gt;Ancient Legendary&lt;/a&gt; items, these values increase further, equating to 75504 / 95540, for with out and with weapons and shields, respectively. A &lt;a href=\"Topaz\"&gt;Topaz&lt;/a&gt; gem in the weapon &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt; can also add up to 38000 damage to Thorns (when using a &lt;a href=\"Topaz\"&gt;Flawless Royal Topaz&lt;/a&gt;). +999 / 6000 Thorns damage can be gained from &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Demon's Hide&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Skin\"&gt;Demon's Skin&lt;/a&gt; sets, respectively.\nOverall, for all classes but Crusaders with &lt;a href=\"Thorns%20of%20the%20Invoker\"&gt;Thorns of the Invoker&lt;/a&gt; set, Thorns is not a major source of damage. However, a good assortment of protection can make the total damage inflicted with Thorns quite considerable, easily allowing a player with sufficient primary stat and/or thorns to make monsters lose more &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; per hit than the damage they successfully inflict upon the hero. It is most effective against weak numerous attackers, especially if those are way below the character in Life and damage; on lower difficulties, one may kill most foes without as much as pressing a button. Collecting the variety of Thorns-centered gear can turn this mechanic from defensive to offensive, so a well-armed Crusader may, if desired, make it a lethal weapon.\nIn PvP, while it will rarely actually kill an adequately geared foe, it will add some form of extra punishment. Considering that players generally have less &lt;a href=\"Toughness\"&gt;Toughness&lt;/a&gt; than monsters, it may prove even more effective in PvP than against the minions of Hell."}

Lore-wise, this armor got into Crusader Order when &lt;a href=\"Olenna\"&gt;Olenna&lt;/a&gt; bested an invoker in battle and made her an apprentice, purifying a set of such armor in process.\nThis set is sometimes called the set, as it focuses on Thorns attribute. As of patch 2.3.0, &lt;a href=\"Smart%20Loot\"&gt;Smart Loot&lt;/a&gt; only drops it for Crusaders, even though technically it can be used by any class.\nPieces.\nThe set consists of six pieces, all of which can be adapted for any class, and all six are required to complete it.\nSet Bonuses:\nThe first bonus causes a splash of Thorns around the Crusader, not around the target (which coincidentally lines up with the &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20the%20Trapped\"&gt;Bane of the Trapped&lt;/a&gt; area of effect). The Thorns damage buff stacks up to 10 times (not refreshing earlier stacks). Blocking an attack also grants a stack, so a high blocking percentage is beneficial and maximizing block chance is advised.\nMultiple casts of Bombardment only refresh the second bonus; it does not stack. The Bombardment procs from &lt;a href=\"Belt%20of%20the%20Trove\"&gt;Belt of the Trove&lt;/a&gt; do trigger the damage reduction, so equipping the belt effectively grants permanent damage reduction in combat.\nFor the purpose of the last bonus only (67,500% damage hit), unlike most other instances of Thorns, the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; of the additional damage type becomes &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; and can be increased by any effect that boosts Physical damage (such as +X% Physical skill damage).\nAll Invoker items are guaranteed to roll Thorns damage as a secondary attribute. &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Iron\"&gt;Heart of Iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sanguinary%20Vambraces\"&gt;Sanguinary Vambraces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vo%27Toyias%20Spiker\"&gt;Vo'Toyias Spiker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hack\"&gt;Hack&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Boyarsky%27s%20Chip\"&gt;Boyarsky's Chip&lt;/a&gt;, work well with this set.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally, this set was intended to be (and, as of 2.4, finally is) the Crusader class set.\nIn August 2015, Wyatt Cheng confirmed that the developers were planning to rework this set, using non-trivial findings and bonuses, possibly related to Crusader class skills. He stated that something related to Thorns would be part of the Invoker's set for sure, and Thorns will not benefit from &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;s. Other ring/amulet stats could synergize well with thorns, and the set can directly reference Crusader skills, such as , &lt;a href=\"Justice\"&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Shield\"&gt;Blessed Shield&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laws%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Laws of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laws%20of%20Hope\"&gt;Laws of Hope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bombardment\"&gt;Bombardment&lt;/a&gt;, to make this set &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt; capable."}

When his health drops below about 50%, he kicks into a turbo mode. At that point his tattoos begin to glow red and he moves much more quickly.

How do they get on screen and die? He's going to be on screen in a cool way, so we went to the Thousand Pounder here. He's all 'bout hell. He's summoned from it literally piece by piece. When he gets on screen we figured he should be mad and big. Express anger. Part of his gameplay is that he gets really mad when he's almost dead. Throws a huge temper tantrum and this changes how he plays and how the player has to play against him. When he's enraged we changed how he looked; made his tattoos glow, gave him new attack animations and special effects. When he dies, the animation is somewhat a reverse of how he came on screen. We did this to show off the whole idea that he's from hell.\""}

Like vampires, thralls can apparently infect humans with vampirism, dooming them to become thralls in turn. \nThralls apparently have some level of intelligence, along with emotions such as fear and humor (e.g. able to laugh at their prey)."}

She is good at crowd control and one-on-one combat, but since her damage is dependent on items, she will be pretty weak in early stages of the game, but will become stronger as the player finds specific items on higher difficulties.\nThunderfury Amazon is not all dependent on items due to her natural fast attack and high Dexterity, but inexperienced players might find it difficult to play with. Strategy, specific tactics and always knowing what is around you is important to Thunderfury Amazon player.\nStat Point Distribution.\nStrength: Enough to wear specific equipment. Primary stat for Thunderfury is Dexterity.\nDexterity: This is primary stat for Thunderfury. More Dexterity she has, more defense and chance to block she will have.\nVitality: High Vitality is good thing to have on Thunderfury, but items that give + to Vitality should cover this.\nEnergy: Leave this alone. Equipment will give you what you need.\nBuild focuses on first level Amazon skill &lt;a href=\"Jab\"&gt;Jab&lt;/a&gt;. Even if it is one of the primary Thunderfury's attack, this skill should not require maximum level. Experienced players will only go up to level 10 Jab, since Amazon &lt;a href=\"Passive%20and%20Magic%20Skills\"&gt;Passive and Magic Skills&lt;/a&gt; skills are far more important. Image shown to the right is Thunderfury with Jab maximized, but if player thinks his passive skills should be higher it won't hurt this build. In fact, it's recommended that player have level 10 Jab and at least 5 levels of , &lt;a href=\"Avoid\"&gt;Avoid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Evade\"&gt;Evade&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe real primary attack of Thunderfury Amazon is &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Fury\"&gt;Lightning Fury&lt;/a&gt;, which should be maxed to level 20 during the game. This is a difficult build and players should carefully select their skills depending on how their game goes, but they need to completely avoid &lt;a href=\"Bow%20and%20Crossbow%20Skills\"&gt;Bow and Crossbow Skills&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkills.\nPrimary Javelin and Spear Skills.\n&lt;a href=\"Jab\"&gt;Jab&lt;/a&gt; - up to level 10 or 20, depending on how player wants to be more attack or passive oriented.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Fury\"&gt;Lightning Fury&lt;/a&gt; - up to level 20. This is Thunderfury's killer.\nSecondary Javelin and Spear Skills.\nThe following skills receive synergy bonus from Lighting Fury:\n&lt;a href=\"Power%20Strike\"&gt;Power Strike&lt;/a&gt; +10% Lightning Damage Per Level\n&lt;a href=\"Charged%20Strike\"&gt;Charged Strike&lt;/a&gt; +10% Lightning Damage Per Level\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Strike\"&gt;Lightning Strike&lt;/a&gt; +8% Lightning Damage Per Level\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; +3% Lightning Damage Per Level\nPrimary Passive and Magic Skills.\n&lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt; up to level 20. It gives Thunderfury critical strike which works with Lightning Fury and Jab.\n&lt;a href=\"Penetrate\"&gt;Penetrate&lt;/a&gt; - if player has problem with attack rating, this skill should be taken. If not, no need for more than one point.\nThe following skills should be taken at least up to five times.\n - ability to dodge attacks while standing or attacking\n&lt;a href=\"Avoid\"&gt;Avoid&lt;/a&gt; - ability to dodge ranged attacks while standing or attacking. This skill is recommended up to ten times.\n&lt;a href=\"Evade\"&gt;Evade&lt;/a&gt; - ability to dodge attack while running\nAll other passive skills should be taken at least once. Many players use to take &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; up to 20 levels, but there is no need. This skill should be improved upon items. Valkyrie once summoned has enough defense and life to stay alive for hard battles. Having low mana cost, it's spammable. Valkyrie also receives bonus synergy from other passive skills such as , &lt;a href=\"Avoid\"&gt;Avoid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Evade\"&gt;Evade&lt;/a&gt;. Valkyrie has low damage and very slow attack speed, so taking this skill up to level 20 to send Valkyrie in battle is useless. She will also change colors of her armor depending on which attack she has (red for fire, blue for cold, green for poison...)\nItems for Thunderfury.\nBest and must have items for Thunderfury Amazon are &lt;a href=\"Titan%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;Titan's Revenge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderstroke\"&gt;Thunderstroke&lt;/a&gt; since they both boost Amazon skills and give necessary boost to Amazon's attack. Titan's Revenge is considered a favorite among the Thunderfury player since it has &lt;a href=\"Replenish%20Quantity\"&gt;Replenish Quantity&lt;/a&gt; ability, saving a lot of players money. Other items to consider are &lt;a href=\"Nightwing%27s%20Veil\"&gt;Nightwing's Veil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20Wing\"&gt;Valkyrie Wing&lt;/a&gt;."}

Together, they had a daughter named &lt;a href=\"Ellin\"&gt;Ellin&lt;/a&gt;. Before &lt;a href=\"timeline%231265\"&gt;Arreat was sundered&lt;/a&gt;, he (presumably) lived at &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; with his family. When &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, he volunteered to serve the vanguard in the defending army. Unfortunately, while they fought Baal's army at the highlands, Baal razed &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;, with his family being part of the casualties.\nHe carried their &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s south to an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Graveyard\"&gt;old burial site&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; to be buried. At their graves, he placed some &lt;a href=\"Lyonsleaf\"&gt;Lyonsleaf&lt;/a&gt; which bloomed even in winter. Since then, he was plagued with survivor's guilt and almost lost his will to leave .\nAt a point in late &lt;a href=\"timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to pay his respects to his family. On his way he was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Horror\"&gt;Frost Horror&lt;/a&gt;s. He defeated them, but was injured in the process. Shortly after, he met an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who he pleaded with to escort him the rest of the way. As he paid his respects, he discovered that the Lyonsleaf he planted had been removed. He asked his companion the bring him some Lyonsleaf while he has some privacy to pay his respects.\nBefore the adventure returned, Timur-Koll was attacked by a group of Frost Horrors, led by an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Horror\"&gt;Elder Horror&lt;/a&gt;. His companion arrived in time to aid him. Once the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were defeated, they advised him to seek refuge in &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Hearth\"&gt;Bitter Hearth&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nTimur-Koll is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

Root) is a form of &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;, often viewed as the extreme variant of the &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nThe general concept is completely stopping the target, forcing them to remain in one place, unable to move, but unlike &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, it does not affect the target's ability to attack. Most of the time, Immobilize is used either by ranged attackers to prevent the enemy from coming into close combat, or by melee attackers to prevent enemy from escaping.\nDiablo.\nIn the original &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, Immobilize did not exist.\nDiablo II.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, the only real Immobilize effect is the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison\"&gt;Bone Prison&lt;/a&gt; spell, even though it is simply trapping the target, not actually preventing it from moving. &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s Evil Force is not an Immobilize effect: it is only used to block &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDiablo Immortal.\nImmobilize returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" as a status effect. Monsters that can use &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison\"&gt;Bone Prison&lt;/a&gt;, or have the jailer &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;trait&lt;/a&gt; can inflict immobilize. &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Monk's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Imprisoned%20Fists\"&gt;Imprisoned Fists&lt;/a&gt; also causes this effect.\nDiablo III.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, Immobilize is fully functional and is a separate effect from Slow. Many skills and items give a chance to Immobilize on hit, and &lt;a href=\"elite%20monsters\"&gt;elite monsters&lt;/a&gt; may have a &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20III%29%23Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt; affix that allows them to Immobilize all enemies in range for a few seconds.\nNote that turning around does not count as movement and is therefore not prevented by Immobilize. Immobilized target can still attack and use spells normally, provided the target is in range. CC resistance reduces the duration of this effect for both players and monsters. With &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Climbers\"&gt;Ice Climbers&lt;/a&gt;, players become completely immune to Immobilize.\nImmobilize is a less common effect than Slow, and lasts for a shorter time. It is most dangerous when combined with area of effect damaging skills, as it forces the target to remain in the area.\nAny Immobilize effect can be cleared by most skills that allow rapid relocation, such as . Moreover, skills that force the character to move (such as , \u00a0or &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Rush\"&gt;Tempest Rush&lt;/a&gt;), will make the character immune to it while channeled (but will not clear existing Immobilize effects, and cannot be cast while Immobilized).\nAll &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt; are immune to Immobilize, regardless of its potency.\nImmobilize and Slow are not mutually suppressing, and are not interchangeable: that is, for the purpose of whether or not the target is Slowed, Immobilize effects do not count, and vice versa. However, the target\u00a0\"may\u00a0\"be both slowed\u00a0\"and\u00a0\"immobilized at the same time."}

Fireball damage and speed grow with Spell Level, and damage with Character Level.\nSpell functionality is exact same as those of Nova and s, and Fireballs do deal area damage on impact instead of piercing. However, their damage is reduced compared to normal Fireball, instead dealing same damage as Nova. \nDamage Calculation:\nRec stands for \"recursive\", and Itt stands for \"iterated\" function.\nLore.\n\"Harnessing the forces of Mana and converting their energy into the form of Fire has been a skill long practiced by even the most inexperienced of magic-users. Absolute control and manipulation of the magical Fire is another matter entirely, and only the most learned of the great mages have attained such ability. Of the many spells that channel flame into the form of a weapon, the most effective, perhaps, is Immolation. Radiating outward from the caster, multitudes of Fireballs tear through the air, forming a circular swath of destruction as they explode on impact and burn any creatures in their paths.\""}

Upon contact with an enemy, it explodes and leave behind a small conflagration which damages any monster that stands in or walks through it. Like &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Arrow\"&gt;Exploding Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, external fire damage from equipment are added to the explosion. However, this skill has a cooldown timer of 0.6 seconds, so it's impossible to spam this skill like one can with Exploding Arrow. Despite this limitation, Immolation Arrow's high damage significantly wears down monsters who are not immune to fire, especially when there are minions or other characters who can prevent foes from moving.\nImmolation benefits greatly from &lt;a href=\"Pierce\"&gt;Pierce&lt;/a&gt;: every subsequent enemy it hits causes the arrow to explode and create an additional area of fire.\u00a0\nSkill Progression.\nDamage Radius: ~3 yards\nFire Duration: 3 seconds"}

{"id": "9576", "revid": "188941", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9576", "title": "Immortal King Barbarian", "text": "The Immortal King Barbarian is a &lt;a href=\"barbarian%20builds\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20King\"&gt;Immortal King&lt;/a&gt; (IK for short) is a well known set, as it is the only set aside from the &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Natalya%27s%20Odium\"&gt;Natalya's Odium&lt;/a&gt; set that is black. IK is a well rounded set, and with the right build, it can be some very good gear to use. Getting this difficult set to function properly is taxing, most people complain about it taking up too many slots and the fact that it requires a very big amount of &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to use.\nAlthough once you overcome the Strength issues, it is very easy and one of the best sets available in the game. Unfortunately, due the requirements and amount of slots the set takes up, &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; is the only skill that can be used to maximum efficiency. The slots in the helmet and maul help increase the potential of the set, and only a few are able to truly master it.\nOne of the biggest bonuses in the set are the &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;. The set alone gives 118% to Fire, 121% to Lightning, 90% to Cold and 100% to Poison Resists, decreasing the necessity to stack resistance items for later difficulties. In addition, the Maul employs the use of all 5 elements, including physical, practically ensuring there will be no &lt;a href=\"immune\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; monsters who can stand against the set's owner.\nStats.\nStat placement is very crucial, one mistake and it could affect your entire build through later level progressions. With &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; added from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Torch\"&gt;Hellfire Torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Annihilus\"&gt;Annihilus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20King%27s%20Forge\"&gt;Immortal King's Forge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20King%27s%20Detail\"&gt;Immortal King's Detail&lt;/a&gt;, your Strength bonus can boost up to a maximum of 85, just from these items combined. &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; is not necessary, with &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Frost\"&gt;Raven Frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metalgrid\"&gt;Metalgrid&lt;/a&gt;, since the &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20King\"&gt;Immortal King&lt;/a&gt; uses a maul, it is not needed for blocking.\nWhen placing stats, you should be very careful about this: do not undercut your Strength or overdo it, giving yourself a good 10-20 point over placement is a good thing, so that you ensure your character will not be at the mercy of your &lt;a href=\"charms\"&gt;charms&lt;/a&gt;. You can also give another 10 or so points for good measure, damage-wise. But the remaining should continue to go into &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; to increase your &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt; should not be touched, so that leaves pure &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; to spend your remaining points on. Given the bonuses from the complete set, it takes care of itself and the one wearing it. &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; should not be much of a problem, since the set comes with a very nice bonus of 10% &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; steal, which is extremely useful when using &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt;. Although the maul has some fairly low damage in comparison to the other weapons available, it more than makes up for it in defense and additional bonuses from the other items.\nSkills.\nCombat.\nUnfortunately the Immortal King's set does not allow for much movement in skill placement, this setup allows you to maintain maximum efficiency without losing your power. The skills for Concentrate can be placed elsewhere, but since the set does not allow you to use a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and keep the bonuses, it is best to use it because it increase your defense and allows for an uninterrupted attack. Skill placement is fairly self-explanatory, however.\nAlthough for those who would rather do something different, the alternative Iron Skin can be increased at the cost of Concentrate. But as far as extra skills go, Immortal King is very tight and doesn't allow for much free movement in these areas. Making it an extremely difficult set to use, as the creativity for unique builds is nearly impossible without losing the effectiveness of the set.\nBerserk was once a necessary must, especially in battling &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Berserk is the only melee skill that completely negates the effects of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;, although it also destroys your defense at the same time, which made the set's big flaw apparent. However, with the release of Patch 1.13, Oblivion Knights do not cast Iron Maiden and this worry is now gone.\nAdditionally, with the release of Patch 1.13, it is now possible to reset your attributes and skills. This is very useful in creating a perfect Immortal King Barbarian.\nItems.\nCharacter Items.\nOnce again, the gear does not leave much room for creativity or any other gear other than the small but very necessary slots. It is highly recommended to use Raven Frost and Metalgrid, as they both increase your attack rating, and the Cannot Be Frozen mod works perfectly with the set. Metalgrid is also very useful for those concerned about their defense being a little low. The user can choose to use either Carrion Wind or Bul-Kathos' Wedding Band, both come with life steal and very decent mods.\nAs for the helm and maul, it is best to get these perfect. The helm should have either and in it, or 2 runes. Two perfect &lt;a href=\"topaz\"&gt;topaz&lt;/a&gt;es is also an option to enhance the helmet's built-in magic find. The maul should have either two s or two 40/15 jewels for maximum effectiveness - this enables the last &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; breakpoint to be reached. It is also highly recommended to the armor, for additional defense, or you can simply put a rune in it, for additional damage reduction, since the belt gives you 20% damage reduction after equipping 5 parts of the set.\nMercenary Items.\nThe &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; mercenary works perfectly with the Immortal King barbarian, you can go with Pride or Infinity, although it is recommended you use Infinity, since the maul makes excellent use of all 5 of the elemental damage types. The main issue with this would be range, if you outrun the mercenary, the Infinity would be useless to you, using &lt;a href=\"Might\"&gt;Might&lt;/a&gt; aura mercenaries is recommended with this setup.\nIf you decide to go with Pride, it is best if you use either a &lt;a href=\"Defiance\"&gt;Defiance&lt;/a&gt; mercenary or Might for added damage. You can also use a &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Aim\"&gt;Blessed Aim&lt;/a&gt; mercenary if you're having difficulty hitting things, although it shouldn't be a problem.\nStrategy.\nThe trick, and most frustrating thing about the set; is building your char around the set, which is considered its biggest disadvantage. Although your skills are shortened, you're not without power. Short burst &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt;'s in large crowds deal more damage over a shorter period of time, than longer ones, which helps against large crowds of Physical Immunes.\nWith a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; teamed up with you, you can use &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fanaticism\"&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt; to your advantage, drastically increasing the performance of the Immortal King machine. The set is fairly cheap and easy to come by, but making a very effective Immortal King Barbarian can be difficult, but not impossible. For the cases of being outnumbered, using &lt;a href=\"Leap%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Leap&lt;/a&gt; is a good idea to spread the monsters out some, followed by a short Whirlwind to take a portion of them down.\nA big advantage to using the set is &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt;, getting a perfect maul grants you 40% chance. While not very much compared to other weapons, mixed with Whirlwind it can be pretty devastating, considering the attack speed the maul comes with. Other such ideas can come out of the hammer as well, such as 2 &lt;a href=\"Ber\"&gt;Ber&lt;/a&gt; runes in the maul give it 80% Crushing Blow, making it one of the most powerful (Hone Sundan is still more deadly with its higher crushing blow, more sockets and self-repair) crushing blow weapon in the game. Since there are a lot of &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20King%27s%20Stone%20Crusher\"&gt;Immortal King's Stone Crusher&lt;/a&gt;'s around, you can try out different things with so many, and keep them in your stash for various occasions."}

However, their tremendous strength leaves them at risk of corruption or burning out spectacularly. Most Immortals serve as elite &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, but they owe a deeper allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Daedessa\"&gt;Daedessa&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; who founded the order. The Immortals believe that Sanctuary's future\u2014not just one kingdom or one age\u2014rests on their armored shoulders.\nThe Immortals keep their spoils inside a &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Immortals\"&gt;vault&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a plethora of tools that aid them in their eternal watch over Sanctuary.\nA single Immortal who bears the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Crown\"&gt;Eternal Crown&lt;/a&gt; leads the Immortals. The leader is accompanied by four lieutenants with crowns of their own. If an Immortal falls, their name and those of their four lieutenants are engraved on the &lt;a href=\"Wall%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Wall of Honor&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe uniforms of the Immortals are designed for both battle and rest, though it is rare for Immortals to ever find the latter.\nScribes are apprenticed to the Immortals, but are paid poorly.\nAs the Immortals are based in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, it is part of their duties to protect the city, but only if the situation warrants it.\nThough distasteful, the Immortals at times employ foul &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s to ensure victory in the &lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Cycle of Strife&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daedessa\"&gt;Daedessa&lt;/a&gt; bid her son, &lt;a href=\"Kion\"&gt;Kion&lt;/a&gt;, form a group whose sole purpose would be the protection of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. Kion obliged, and created the Immortals. Daedessa wrought the armor of the greatest of their number.\nIn secret however, Daedessa bid her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Akeba\"&gt;Akeba&lt;/a&gt;, to form a group that would constantly test the Immortals. Akeba called this group the &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, and they constantly tested the Immortals. It was agreed that should the Shadows ever overthrow the current reign, they would take possession of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Crown\"&gt;Eternal Crown&lt;/a&gt; and become the new Immortals.\nFor a time, the Immortals successfully kept the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of Hell at bay. However, events went awry for the Immortals when they battled against a force of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in a forest, led by &lt;a href=\"Rakanoth\"&gt;Rakanoth&lt;/a&gt;. The outcome of this battle is unclear, but it appears that it did not go in the Immortals' favor. Whatever the case, it was after this that the Shadows moved against the Immortals. The Shadows emerged triumphant, with Akeba becoming the next Immortal. She began the &lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Cycle of Strife&lt;/a&gt;, which ensured that the Shadows would always test the Immortals, beginning a state of affairs that lasted well into &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, by which point the strife between the factions was escalating. c. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, both groups fought for control of the &lt;a href=\"Accursed%20Towers\"&gt;Accursed Towers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; unleashed his forces on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, his growing influence warped sections of the mortal realm into a nightmarish hellscape. Witnessing their home being slowly overtaken by dark forces, the usually warring Immortals and Shadows put out a contract on their shared enemy. Come one, come all!\nGameplay.\nPlayers can function as Immortals in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\"; this is an entirely opt-in feature. \nTo join the Immortals, a player must be at &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 43, have finished the &lt;a href=\"Bilefen\"&gt;Bilefen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line, and found the &lt;a href=\"Timeworn%20Scroll\"&gt;Timeworn Scroll&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Arena\"&gt;Ancient Arena&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond this, however, the player must progress through the Shadows.\nThere can only be up to 300 Immortals on a server. Shadows, of which there are an unlimited number, are constantly trying to displace the current group of Immortals. Once the Shadows reach a certain point in their progression, the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Exile\"&gt;Rite of Exile&lt;/a&gt; event is triggered. Beyond this, a player will be transformed into an Immortal boss in the &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20of%20the%20Immortal\"&gt;Challenge of the Immortal&lt;/a&gt; event, where they will gain a massive power buff and unique abilities.\nIf a Shadows Dark Clan beats the other Dark Clans and overthrows the Immortals, then that winning Dark Clan will become the Immortal Clan. Players in an Immortal Clan will stay together as a unit and can invite up to two other Dark Clans to become Immortal Allied Clans. When the Immortals\u2019 reign ends, as all reigns must, the Immortal Clan will return to being a normal Clan as the Cycle begins anew.\nA single Immortal leader bears the Eternal Crown, and four lieutenants have crowns of their own. Each crown grants an extraordinary power once it has reached a certain level of progression thanks to the reign's Dominance. A mixture of offensive and defensive buffs will emanate from these Legendary items, amplifying the wearer\u2019s might as well as that of other Immortals in close proximity. \nImmortals need to complete &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20Weekly%20Goals\"&gt;weekly goals&lt;/a&gt; to gain &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20Dominance\"&gt;Sigils of Dominance&lt;/a&gt;, which can be contributed to the Eternal Crown to progress towards the next Age of the reign. Rewards are given out for each Age reached.\nImmortals have exclusive access to the &lt;a href=\"Kion%27s%20Ordeal\"&gt;Kion's Ordeal&lt;/a&gt; event, and can take part in the &lt;a href=\"Raid%20the%20Vault\"&gt;Raid the Vault&lt;/a&gt; event from the defense side. The Immortals also have access to the &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Expedition\"&gt;Corvus Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a player is a member of the Shadows, they will encounter Immortals as enemies in &lt;a href=\"contracts\"&gt;contracts&lt;/a&gt;. Immortal &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s include the &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20Champion\"&gt;Immortal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20Warrior\"&gt;Immortal Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20Marksman\"&gt;Immortal Marksman&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally as Immortals completed tasks (I.e., Daily Goals) they would accumulate &lt;a href=\"Essentia\"&gt;Essentia&lt;/a&gt;, a resource to spend which enables attempts on raids like Kion\u2019s Ordeal. Essentia was removed as a resource and the daily goals were changed to weekly in the September 21 2023 update."}

All attacks that use the specified damage type or apply the effect listed are resolved as normal, with normal chances to hit, but even if they reach the target, they may not affect the target in any way. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;Absorption&lt;/a&gt;, Immunity to damage also makes the target immune to all secondary effects of the attack prevented, and very often, to Crowd Control effects in general.\nDiablo II.\nSome higher level monsters will have the bonus of Immune to X, with X being a type of damage. These creatures have total immunity to that damage, meaning they will take no damage if hit with that type of attack. The types of immunities found on these monsters are as follows:\nBut there is a way to cause damage to these monsters: Cold, Fire and Lightning immunity can be partially bypassed with the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt; curse and with the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; aura (all resist lowering skills work with 1/5 effectiveness when breaking an immunity).\nLightning Immune is the easiest to break, commonly it has normally about 100-110% resistance (175% at &lt;a href=\"Bremm%20Sparkfist\"&gt;Bremm Sparkfist&lt;/a&gt;). With the conviction aura from &lt;a href=\"Infinity%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Infinity Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; it can be pierced.\nFire Immune is a bit harder. With 100-130% resistance (195% at &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Endugu\"&gt;Witch Doctor Endugu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colenzo%20the%20Annihilator\"&gt;Colenzo the Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;) Infinity`s aura may not cope, but a paladin with higher &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; capable break their.\nCold Immune can be insurmountable. It is 100-210% resistance (285% at &lt;a href=\"Frozenstein\"&gt;Frozenstein&lt;/a&gt;) is nearly unbreakable with the lowered 1/5 effectiveness of skills. &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Mastery\"&gt;Cold Mastery&lt;/a&gt; level 20 will reduce cold immunity by only 23%, &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; level 25 - by 30%.\nPoison Immune have 100-125% resistance (1000% at &lt;a href=\"Catapult\"&gt;Catapult&lt;/a&gt;). It can be broken only with using &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagic Immune is the worst of all and cannot be reduced from 100%.\nPhysical Immune always have 100% resistance and can be removed by using the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; curse. This is a good reason for a melee/physical ranged character wanting an item that offers a chance to cast Amplify Damage on hit, as without it, they're forced to either switch to a skill of a different element, or leave the foe alone altogether. &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt; also has the same ability, but it is less effective due to its physical damage penalty being lower (only 50%, although it also provides crowd control). &lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Ward\"&gt;Grim Ward&lt;/a&gt; can also be used, and when fully synergized, reduces the resistance by 120%. For &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; monsters, Physical Immunity may also be dealt away with using the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; aura. &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt; will work against physical immune monsters once they have taken damage of any kind.\nMost enemy's immunities are above 100%, monster resistances can be viewed here: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/monsters/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\n\"Diablo III\" monsters very rarely have the complete immunities seen in the previous game, but the Shielding &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;monster trait&lt;/a&gt; and properties of some &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III%20Bestiary\"&gt;monster types&lt;/a&gt; allow certain monsters to become temporarily immune to all damage and/or to specific &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; effects. &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt; are generally immune to Crowd Control.\nPlayers can become completely immune to damage with a &lt;a href=\"Pylon\"&gt;Shield Pylon&lt;/a&gt;, or using certain &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"Serenity\"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt;. These immunities include Crowd Control effects, and may clear all existing ones.\nImmunity to a non-Physical type of &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage\"&gt;elemental damage&lt;/a&gt; can be achieved by wearing protective &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; amulets: (Poison), (Fire), (Lightning), (Arcane/Holy) and (Cold). These actually cause &lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;Absorption&lt;/a&gt; of the element, healing from it instead of losing Life. However, they do not protect from Crowd Control connected with the attack.\nThe Rank 25 bonus of an or the Omen seal of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt; grant permanent immunity to all forms of Crowd Control at once. Many other skills and effects can make players temporarily immune to one or more forms of Crowd Control. Such skills may or may not break existing applications of Crowd Control, however.\nPlayers are also completely immune to all forms of harmful effects and damage while on the loading screen."}

In truth, they were secretly the servants of &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Imperial Guard was mostly composed of &lt;a href=\"Deceiver\"&gt;Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, though at least &lt;a href=\"Kamyr\"&gt;one human&lt;/a&gt; is known to have been part of their ranks. The Guard was primarily equipped with &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"polearms\"&gt;polearms&lt;/a&gt;. They were seen as a symbol of the hatred and corruption that had befallen Caldeum.\nHistory.\nThe Imperial Guard were formed a few months before the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, refugees were fleeing from the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, in a bid to escape the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; and their summoned &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; were sent out in the desert to fight them, while the Imperial Guard was created to \u201cprotect\u201d the citizens from the refugees. Eventually, the Imperial Guard supplanted the Iron Wolves' former role. The tenets of the Iron Wolves were studied by Belial's servants in an effort to understand their martial methods.\nBy the coming of the Fallen Star, the situation had deteriorated even further. They refused to grant the refugees passage into Caldeum. A contingent of Guardsmen were dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, obstensibly under the premise of keeping the locals in line. They took the Iron Wolves there captive until they were freed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. After The Nephalem defeated the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt;, Belial ordered Guardsmen be dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur Oasis&lt;/a&gt; to take the villagers there as slaves, and to kill any who resisted. \nWhile this was going on, the Imperial Guard was successful at tracking down and kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20of%20Caldeum\"&gt;Sewers of Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, bringing her to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Nephalem rescued her after a brief fight. By this stage, the Imperial Guard had also captured &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, but she was also rescued.\nAfter this, the Imperial Guard's hold on the city began to weaken; some of those they had taken prisoner were able to escape.\nIn-game.\nThe player encounters Imperial Guard multiple times during of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", most notably in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Caldeum\"&gt;City of Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; zones.

He has led the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; to numerous victories over the forces of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, but his pride and rashness has often caused recklessness that would ultimately cost him.\nBiography.\nThe Great Conflict.\nAs with all angels, Imperius was born from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;. He was among the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s, and among the five who best represented the five virtues of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; (in his case, valor). Alongside &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;, Imperius formed the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; to lead angelkind.\nOver the aeons of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, Imperius trod where other angels dared not. When the war turned in Heaven's favor he was always the first to spearhead the most daring assaults into the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. When Hell's &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Legion\"&gt;legions&lt;/a&gt; lay siege to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, it was Imperius who rallied his fellow angels to action, always the first to storm out of the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt; and charge headlong into the scattering armies of Hell. It is written that in one of Imperius's invasions of Hell, &lt;a href=\"Solarion\"&gt;Solarion&lt;/a&gt; (his &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;, forged by Imperius in the heart of a dying star) felled so many demons that rivers of blood flowed throughout the seven realms of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;. By Imperius's own account, he and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; saved each other's life on the battlefield countless times.\nWrath.\nOn one &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Battlefield\"&gt;such battlefield&lt;/a&gt;, Imperius and all four other Angiris Council members took the fight to their demonic foes. Imperius bested a gigantic one-eyed demon by himself, and the demons retreated to their fortress. Imperius sent the Heavenly Host after them. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; urged caution, but Imperius ignored him and entered the fortress himself. Arriving in the structure's depths, he found his fellow angels dead, and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Terror, waiting for him. The two came to blows, fighting each other to a standstill. Diablo commented on Imperius's rage while in battle, wondering aloud if his angelic enemy feared of what the other angels would think of him, if they saw what he truly was; in doing so, Diablo questioned whether \"valor\" was little more than a manifestation of \"rage\". Imperius responded that he feared nothing and continued fighting, and if anything, the taunt merely served only to enrage him further. It was at this point that the other Angiris Council members arrived, imprisoning the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; and Tyrael suggested capturing and imprisoning the defeated Prime Evil, for if slain, Diablo would return in time. An enraged Imperius however, declared that demonkind could only be dealt with through blood, and slew the Lord of Terror. It was an act that Auriel declared \"sacrilege\" and Diablo mocked the angels with his last breaths. Nonetheless, Imperius's actions would later be immortalized in the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther Battles.\nImperius was present at the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Iskatu\"&gt;Iskatu&lt;/a&gt;, a demon in service to Diablo, led an assault on the fortress. Iskatu wore the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Loop\"&gt;Pandemonium Loop&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; given to him by Diablo that sowed fear amongst the angels defending the fortress. Imperius was unaffected by the loop however, and hacked off Iskatu's arm. Iskatu fled the field of battle, and the ring was lost.\nImperius slew the demon prince &lt;a href=\"Ikonoth\"&gt;Ikonoth&lt;/a&gt;, but not before the demon had slaughtered hundreds of angels.\nThe Sin War.\nThe Great Conflict came to a sudden halt with the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. It was eventually discovered that it had been stolen by renegade angels and demons led by the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, and that they had used it to create an entire world\u2014&lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The renegades had even coupled with each other to create a new race\u2014&lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, and their descendants, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. Upon the discovery of this world and its people, the forces of the High Heavens (intent on eradicating the \"abominations\" they beheld), Burning Hells, and &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; met in battle, that was only ended through the sacrifice of the nephalem &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThus, the Angiris Council met to reconsider the fate of Sanctuary and its people. Imperius reaffirmed his belief that the \"demonspawn\" be eradicated, while Auriel and &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt; voted that humanity be spared. &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; cast no vote, so all eyes turned to Tyrael. Imperius expected that he would vote for humanity's annihilation, and in the event of a tie, the Angiris Council would carry out its original intent on scouring humanity from existence. Tyrael, much to Imperius's surprise (and resentment), sided with humanity. Imperius, though irritated by how events had gone, nonetheless agreed to honor the council's judgement. And in return for Inarius, he made a pact with the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; that Sanctuary and its inhabitants be free to choose their own path.\nInterbellum.\nThe millennia following the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt; were not kind to Imperius. With the pact made between Heaven and Hell, the Great Conflict was brought to a grinding halt, thus robbing Imperius of further opportunities to prove his valor in combat. The rift that Tyrael's actions had caused between them refused to close, and since that time, it is said that Imperius became a highly legalistic and unbending tyrant. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; speculated that it was not his intent, but nonetheless, Imperius's actions caused disharmony to creep into the Angiris Council. With the departure of Malthael after the destruction of the Worldstone, Imperius became the council's de facto leader.\nTwenty years after that event, events between Imperius and Tyrael came to a head, as he demanded that Tyrael account for his interference in the mortal world. The two traded blows, first verbal, then physical, until Tyrael had Imperius at the tip of his own spear. Refusing to bow to Imperius's mandates, the archangel ripped off his own wings and became mortal, in an act that Imperius declared to be sacrilege. Subsequently, Tyrael fell upon Sanctuary, cast out from Heaven.\nValor and Terror.\nNot long after Tyrael's departure, Imperius found himself looking out from Heaven, to see Diablo before him, possessing the body of &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;a mortal&lt;/a&gt;. Not fooled by the disguise, Imperius unleashed Solarion upon the Lord of Terror, revealing Diablo's true form. A form that was nothing like what Imperius had seen in the past, but something else entirely. A singular Prime Evil, with the essences of all seven &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; in the one body. Outmatched, it was not long before Solarion had been split in two, and Imperius himself impaled. Despite his wound, Imperius managed to teleport away. What he couldn't do, was prevent Diablo from destroying the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt;, giving entry to both himself and the forces of Hell also.\nDespite his wound, Imperius nonetheless attempted to rally the angels to defend their home. As things turned out, Tyrael and his mortal allies had followed Diablo and met Imperius in the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt;. Imperius blamed Tyrael and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; for Diablo's invasion, and ignored Tyrael's insistence that, wounded as he was, he could not face Diablo again. He departed to do battle.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Colonnade\"&gt;Crystal Colonnade&lt;/a&gt;, Imperius encountered the Nephalem again. After destroying several demons, he warned them to leave (again). Itherael and Auriel dissuaded him somewhat, but Imperius nevertheless threatened to kill the Nephalem should he see them again. And at the base of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;, Imperius and a group of fellow angels threatened to do just that, along with Imperius vowing to deal with Tyrael as well. However, the angels were too late to carry out his threat; by this stage, Diablo had begun to corrupt the Crystal Arch, and the corruption of the source of angelic power caused Imperius and his fellow angels to fall, incapacitated and drained of strength. Tyrael was no longer bound to the Arch, however, and due to this, remained unaffected and was able to allow the Nephalem to continue onward to the peak of the Arch. There, in the terrible fight that ensued, they were able to defeat Diablo and save all of Creation from Diablo's wrath.\nStorm of Light.\nDissonance.\nImperius recovered from Diablo's invasion, but remained bitter. Having seen Heaven burn around him and his loyal followers perish, he was deeply impacted by Diablo's actions. Due to his pride, he could not accept that mortals had saved Heaven from destruction. He allowed his shame and anger to feed off one another. Additionally, he refused to acknowledge Tyrael as the Aspect of Wisdom (a position he had taken after Diablo's fall), and mocked him for his inability to live up to Malthael's legacy. He meanwhile ordered &lt;a href=\"Balzael\"&gt;Balzael&lt;/a&gt; to create a group of angelic destroyers called &lt;a href=\"Sicarai\"&gt;Sicarai&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure that Diablo's assault would never be repeated. Although Diablo's defeat had left demonkind largely leaderless, Imperius still viewed them as dangerous. Balzael pushed Imperius to imprison Tyrael in &lt;a href=\"the%20Fist\"&gt;the Fist&lt;/a&gt; and judge him for his crimes, but Imperius refused.\nIn the midst of this dissonance the Council discovered the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, which Diablo had used to become the Prime Evil, and now contained the essences of all seven lords of Hell. The Council debated over the stone's fate\u2014Imperius wanted to shatter the stone upon the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt; then launch a final sweeping invasion of the Burning Hells. Auriel wanted to seal the relic in a chamber of light and sound, while &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt; was paralyzed by indecision, and Tyrael remained silent. The dissonance between the angels blossomed, Imperius included. Eventually Tyrael spoke\u2014the Black Soulstone had to be hidden in Sanctuary.\nIt was a suggestion that Imperius and the other Council members reacted to negatively. Passions flamed, and in a repeat of their actions not long ago, Imperius and Tyrael nearly came to blows. Tyrael refused to come to blows, but nonetheless exited the chamber. Outside, he met &lt;a href=\"Balzael\"&gt;Balzael&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Luminarei\"&gt;Luminarei&lt;/a&gt;, and this time, was not as successful in refusing to rise to the bait. Imperius intervened, ordering Balzael to let Tyrael go. It was not in good grace however, as Imperius mocked Tyrael as to his refusal to look into &lt;a href=\"Chalad%27ar\"&gt;Chalad'ar&lt;/a&gt;. Mocked him as to whether he would join humanity if the Council voted in favor of eradicating Sanctuary. Tyrael murmured in the affirmative, and departed.\nBalzael visited Imperius in his chambers awhile later, confirming that Tyrael had gathered a band on humans in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Imperius ordered Balzael to retrieve Tyrael, giving him leave to kill his human companions if necessary. Balzael questioned Imperius's decision to take Tyrael alive, but Imperius stood firm\u2014he wanted Tyrael tried in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;Ring of Judgment&lt;/a&gt; and be made an example of, making the case against Sanctuary that much stronger when his mortal weakness was on display. Balzael still questioned his orders until Imperius lost patience. Finally, the angel departed to do his master's will.\nThe Parting of the Ways.\nTyrael returned to the Heavens, but not at the hands of Balzael, but instead with a group of &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; intent on stealing the Black Soulstone. In the midst of the chaos, Imperius found Balzael and Tyrael dueling in the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council%20Chamber\"&gt;Angiris Council Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, with Balzael intent on killing rather than incapacitating his quarry. To save Tyrael's life, Imperius impaled his servant with Solarion before flinging his body aside. Imperius declared that Tyrael would answer for his crimes, but not in a manner such as this. Tyrael accused Imperius of sending Sircarai to hunt him down, to which Imperius responded that he would have never condoned such an act, that he had ordered Balzael to retrieve him alive. The pair were interrupted by Auriel and Itherael; Auriel announced that she had let the Horadrim depart with the Black Soulstone, stating that already she could see the effects of its corruption fading. She called an emergency vote to decide whether Tyrael should be put on trial, or whether he should be allowed to remain a member of the Angiris Council and act as an ambassador between Heaven and Sanctuary. She voted for the latter, while Imperius voted for the former. Itherael sided with Auriel.\nImperius called them fools, holding Tyrael responsible for the lives that would be lost when the Black Soulstone paved the way for the return of the Prime Evil and Hell's resurgence. Tyrael was not swayed, and declared he would depart, remaining with humanity. Imperius declared that if Tyrael departed under these circumstances, they would forever be enemies. Tyrael tossed Chalad'ar to Imperius and left, the last remnants of their brotherhood sundered.\nReaper of Souls.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Pandemonium Gate in Heaven, seeking to prevent &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; from following &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of the fight, Imperius appeared, shocked that Malthael would dare attack his former brethren. That Malthael attacked his own kind shook Imperius far more than the genocidal Reapers on Sanctuary prior to this. When confronted by the Nephalem, Imperius did not care whether Malthael wanted to destroy humanity, but knew he had to be stopped since, according to the Archangel of Valor, Malthael had grown sick and must be put down for his own sake. Imperius, however, did not have the heart to make such a move and knew that the task would have to fall upon the Nephalem. Imperius led the Nephalem across the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20War\"&gt;Path of War&lt;/a&gt; to an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Siege%20Camp\"&gt;Abandoned Siege Camp&lt;/a&gt; where from a cliff, the pair saw a battering ram that led to the front gates of the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, which was the only way to breach. Imperius instructed the Nephalem to gather three Siege Runes that would activate the battering ram from the &lt;a href=\"Battlefields%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Battlefields of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Before departing, Imperius warned the Nephalem that even if Malthael was stopped, he would not thank them for it.\nImperius later appeared alongside Tyrael, observing Malthael's body disintegrate into ashes after the battle before observing the Nephalem, who had since become \"one with death.\"\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nImperius makes cameos in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", though does not appear in the game proper.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Valor\"&gt;Burning Valor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cosmetic%20set\"&gt;cosmetic set&lt;/a&gt; is based on Imperius. Additionally, in the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Pilgrimage\"&gt;Dread Pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; event, one of the stain-glass windows shows an angel thrusting its spear through the skull of Ashava. While it is not confirmed to be Imperius, the pose and artwork is reminiscent of Imperius's stain-glass appearances in \"\" and the intro cinematic of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo III.\nImperius first appears in &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". He has a boss instance of sorts, but no actual combat occurs: when the Nephalem and Imperius are about to start fighting, both he and his angels are rendered powerless as Diablo corrupts the Crystal Arch, therefore severing the entire &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt;'s life link.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wings%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Wings of Valor&lt;/a&gt; aesthetic item are modeled after Imperius's wings.\nIn , talking with him starts \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Battlefields%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Battlefields of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, where Imperius accompanies the Nephalem to &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;, instructing them how to activate &lt;a href=\"the%20Ram\"&gt;the Ram&lt;/a&gt;. He also helps to clear the siege outposts of demons. After letting the Nephalem know that even of they kill Malthael, he will not thank them for it, Imperius vanishes, only appearing again in the final cinematic. Still, he sends his angels to assist the Nephalem in battle for the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Battlefield\"&gt;Forgotten Battlefield&lt;/a&gt;.\nA couple of the &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader's&lt;/a&gt; skills appear to be a nod to Imperius. The &lt;a href=\"Falling%20Sword\"&gt;Falling Sword&lt;/a&gt; resembles his iconic rapid descent, and the &lt;a href=\"Laws%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Laws of Valor&lt;/a&gt; are likely named after him.\nAn Imperius portrait can be earned in &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 25.\nDiablo IV.\nImperius is referenced in &lt;a href=\"Hellhammer\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; flavor text in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHeroes of the Storm.\nImperius is a playable character in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\u00a0\nIn-game, he retains some abilities seen in \"Diablo III\":\nIn \"Heroes of the Storm\", he is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverwatch.\nAn Imperius skin for &lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Reinhardt\"&gt;Reinhardt&lt;/a&gt; is available in \"&lt;a href=\"Overwatch\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nImperius's tactical brilliance encompasses all facets of warfare, from maneuvering armies on the battlefield to leading covert strikes against Hell's outposts. The mere sight of Imperius is enough to embolden angels with valor and strength. Very few angels can remain standing tall after earning Imperius's ire.\nImperius has demonstrated the ability to resist the powers of fear where other angels have failed. However, his valor has come with the flaws of pride and arrogance, and when enraged, he may become reckless beyond reason. He has had many arguments with Tyrael that could only be put to rest through Auriel's intervention. When not in battle, Imperius often strategizes and trains other warrior angels in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, his personal domain in the High Heavens. He possesses a strong hatred of humanity because of their free will \u2014 Diablo's assault on Heaven has only added to that hatred, both because it was only made possible by a &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; and because the mortals succeeded in defeating Diablo where he himself has failed. &lt;a href=\"Myriam%20Jahzia\"&gt;Myriam Jahzia&lt;/a&gt; also foresaw that his hatred for the Nephalem would grow even stronger after Malthael was defeated by their hand. In Imperius's eyes, there is only right and wrong, good and evil. There are no shades of gray.\nAbilities.\nImperius's abilities include &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ation, the ability to render other angels silent with a mere gesture, and telekinesis. Solarion, his spear, can be called to his side at a moment's notice. With it, he can unleash powerful flames capable of burning away the disguise of a demon. He can also release flames from his hands without using Solarion.\nImperius can also unleash great energy upon his descent, obliterating swarms of demons while leaving allies untouched."}

For example, if a character had 50% \"&lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;sheet&lt;/a&gt;\" CDR, then a 30 second cooldown skill will first be reduced to 20 seconds by an active In-Geom with a maximum roll, then the normal CDR would result in 10 seconds total cooldown time.

Later, the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20of%20Life\"&gt;Fire of Life&lt;/a&gt; ran rampant across Ancients' Cradle, causing social breakdown for both the Inari and Lilin.\nWith the onset of the affliction, even some of the Inari were &lt;a href=\"the%20Afflicted\"&gt;afflicted&lt;/a&gt;. They blamed the Lilin as the cause of their woes. Some of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctifier\"&gt;Sanctifier&lt;/a&gt;s believed that if they killed all the afflicted Lilin, they would be cured."}
{"id": "2687", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2687", "title": "Inarius", "text": "Inarius was a rogue &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;. Formerly an &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, his actions would lead to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Eternal Conflict.\nAs with all angels, Inarius was born from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;. He was among the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s, and while not among the five that formed the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;, he nevertheless served as an advisor to the body.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, Inarius was a commander of the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt;, and under the command of &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. He was highly regarded by his kin for his successes on the battlefield. He faced the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evil\"&gt;Lesser Evil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; in battle on at least one occasion.\nAfter eons of war and witnessing countless acts of brutality, Inarius came to the conclusion that the conflict was unjust, that it could never be won, and that his part in it had to come to an end. He was convinced that if he were at the head of the Angiris Council, he could do things differently. He tried to make Tyrael see his point of view, but the archangel would not be swayed. Inarius reflected that he could not be unique, that there had to be angels and demons who also sought escape from the never-ending war fate had thrust upon them. He resolved to find these individuals and lead them to a new beginning in their own hands. He would stop at nothing to end the war between Heaven and Hell.\nInarius's role as advisor to the Angiris Council had given him skills in diplomacy, and he was able to gather angels to his cause, escaping the notice of the Council. There were far more angels willing to abandon the Eternal Conflict than he'd dreamed of.\nDuring a battle, Inarius led his kin on a charge from an outpost of the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. He was struck down, wounded, and marooned. When he came to, he awoke in chains. He ranted on about his desires to be free of the Great Conflict, and in turn, his captor freed him. She gave him her name, &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, and told the angel that they would meet again. Inarius was instantly captivated by her; the first angel to ever look into the heart of a demon.\nLilith had suffered from her father's hatred and like Inarius, had long awaited an opportunity to rebel against their kindred. Inarius and Lilith joined forces and even came to fall in love; each pledged themself to the other and vowed to escape the Eternal Conflict. Prior to this, no angel or demon in the Eternal Conflict had ever lain down arms against the other, let alone worked together for a common goal. \nEventually, like-minded followers gathered in support.\nThe Creation of Sanctuary.\nEither through strength of arms or misdirection, Inarius and his renegades managed to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, located deep within the Pandemonium Fortress. Altering its frequency or dimensional alignment, they used its power to conceal it from the angels and demons still fighting in the Eternal Conflict. Subsequently, the Worldstone was shifted into a pocket dimension. There, Inarius and his followers shaped a world around it. A world of refuge they would call &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The forces of &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; became aware of the Worldstone's disappearance, but had no idea where it was or who had taken it. This act temporarily halted the Great Conflict.\nOne of Inarius's first acts in the world he would create was to imbue the island of &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20of%20Life\"&gt;Fire of Life&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Lilith. The Worldstone was later moved, where Inarius shaped &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; as a kind of protective shell around the artifact. From there, the rest of the world would be formed. A world he named \"Sanctuary.\" He knew at this point that he would never again be welcome in Heaven.\nAs the angels and demons worked the Worldstone to form their new world, Inarius secretly fooled all the other renegades and tied the Worldstone's power to himself. This enhanced his powers unimaginably and made him the strongest being on Sanctuary and the de facto ruler. Lilith and Inarius ruled their realm with a council of angels and demons, residing inside the structure that would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Nephalem.\nInarius and Lilith had done the impossible, by banding angels and demons together and creating a world in which they could co-exist. Yet as he saw Lilith sleeping by his side, fear began to grip Inarius, and he believed he would pay for his \"sins.\" While Sanctuary was at peace for now, he knew his kin would come for him eventually.\nLilith and Inarius gave birth to a son they would name &lt;a href=\"Linarian\"&gt;Linarian&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt;. Each placed their hand on the altar and spoke a vow, their &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; and light mixing to form a clay figure. Lilith eagerly reached out for her progeny, but recoiled as her son's hand brushed against her tentacled barbs. Her blood mingled with the clay, and an umbilical nurtured the amalgam, severing as her lifestream passed from herself to the amalgam. Inarius, initially horrified at the creature they had created, was unable to back out of the ritual, and played his part in moulding the clay alongside Lilith, basing it around their own image. Thus, Linarian was born.\nLilith and Inarius were the first angel and demon to produce offspring, but they would not be the last, and soon, an entire race had taken form - the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. Inarius became watchful as the first generation of nephalem grew. Eons later, &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; speculated that at the time, Inarius could not have foreseen the consequences of this union.\nThe Gospel of Death.\nInarius and the council were present in the Temple of the Firstborn when &lt;a href=\"Kalmor\"&gt;Kalmor&lt;/a&gt; arrived, having been summoned to account for the &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bersarik\"&gt;Bersarik&lt;/a&gt;. Bersarik, aggrieved at the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Corvik\"&gt;Corvik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helgrotha\"&gt;Helgrotha&lt;/a&gt;, had come to meet his makers, intending violence, and Kalmor had been forced to slay him. Inarius remained silent and simply watched, as the council declared that they did not hold Kalmor responsible for Bersarik's death, and explained that while the nephalem would not succumb to age, or be touched by plague, they were still able to be slain. Presenting them the &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Severian\"&gt;Severian&lt;/a&gt;, the council ordered it destroyed, and filed out.\nThe Purge.\nDissension rippled through the angels and demons of Sanctuary. Not only did the nephalem had power that surpassed that of their parents, but they were bound to neither lineage, able to chart their own path. Furthermore, the union of angels and demons would be deemed the ultimate blasphemy by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; and Angiris Council. The defectors were convinced that they would be destroyed if Sanctuary came to be discovered. Some argued for the destruction of the nephalem, others believed they could be spared. Inarius was indeed concerned about the nephalem's latent power, and did consider taking the route of genocide, but troubled by the dissension, Inarius called for a period of reflection, to consider the matter in solitude.\nLilith, driven into a mad frenzy by the threat of her children's extinction, began slaughtering her fellow renegades, both angel and demon alike, leaving Inarius to discover the carnage she had wrought. Bringing his former lover to heel, Inarius found himself unable to kill her\u2014he had promised that he would never strike her down or let another do it, and the promise still held true. and instead banished her into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Left alone with no-one but himself and a race of \"abominations,\" Inarius sought to reduce the power of the nephalem at any cost. To this end, he attuned the Worldstone to cause the powers of the\u00a0nephalem to diminish over time, for he could not bring himself to harm them. However, for the first generation of nephalem, he made it clear that any use of their powers would be punished, and insisted that Sanctuary, \"his\" world, would remain as he had envisaged it. His perfect world. Some nephalem protested, but any who challenged Inarius were crushed. Those who survived fled, their powers weakening.\nAftermath.\nAfter the Purge Inarius disappeared, though writings of the past suggested that he still walked among Men in a form resembling that of his children. He watched as successive nephalem generations diminished and became humans, watching as human civilization spread over Sanctuary. It is heavily suggested by some accounts that he came to favor mortals, for unlike the nephalem, he did not see humans as a threat. He remained infatuated with Lilith, and it took him several human lifetimes to thrust her to the back of his thoughts, and twice as many to bury them. Sometimes, he managed to pretend that she'd never existed.\nThe Sin War.\nDue to the summoning of demons from the Burning Hells into the world, humanity had made the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; aware of Sanctuary's existence. As part of a scheme to bring humanity to their side in the Great Conflict, the Three founded the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a new religion that would convert humans to their cause. When Inarius became aware of the Triune, he recognized the Prime Evils' deception immediately. He became fearful, not only for his own safety, but also that of his adopted children should Heaven become aware of their existence as well. To counter the Triune, he took on the mantle of \"the Prophet\" and formed his own gospel, disseminating it from his &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. With this act, the secret war for mankind's soul had begun, a struggle that would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. As the Prophet, Inarius gained fame from his youthful physical perfection, and was able to spread the Cathedral's influence through his angelic powers of pursuasion. As the Prophet, he often gave sermons.\nInarius designed the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%20%28Kehjan%29\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; that would serve as his religion's headquarters. He designed it to mimic the architecture of Heaven; a piece of paradise he had lost. However, the times where he was able to truly relive the sensation of being in Heaven were few and far between. He was often seen in the late hours, for as an angel, he did not require sleep. However, this also stemmed due to his restlessness, as in order to maintain his charade, he could not appear in angelic form to his followers, nor take wing above &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;. The closest he could get to the experience of flight was to climb to the cathedral's tallest towers.\nInarius chose two humans to act as the Cathedral's senior priests; &lt;a href=\"Oris\"&gt;Oris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gamuel\"&gt;Gamuel&lt;/a&gt;. He specifically chose Gamuel for, in the remotest manner possible, he was the one human that reminded Inarius of himself.\nBirthright.\nEvents began to spiral out of control with the return of Lilith, the demoness seeking an army of followers. The end result was the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;. Inarius swore that as Sanctuary was \"his,\" he would not let Lilith or Hell take it from him. And if that required the destruction of the world, so be it. He observed Uldyssian's actions from a distance.\nScales of the Serpent.\nThe Edyrem systematically began a campaign to scour both the Triune and Cathedral of Light off the face of Sanctuary. In a sense, this worked to Inarius's advantage, as the Triune was the first to feel the Edyrem's wrath and was destroyed. Lilith had revealed her true colors by this point however, and was left in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Triune\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter delivering one of his sermons, Inarius was informed of the situation by &lt;a href=\"Oris\"&gt;Oris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gamuel\"&gt;Gamuel&lt;/a&gt;. Gamuel feared that the Edyrem would make war against the Cathedral in addition to the Triune, and Inarius told him that he should assume that would come to pass. However, Inarius told him that the Cathedral would not move against Uldyssian, but rather, move \"with\" him. He did not elaborate further, and retired to his quarters.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt; came to investigate the temple, Inarius covertly masked Lilith from detection, only revealing himself once their son had departed. Subsequently, he compressed his former lover into a sphere. Even as she defiantly promised that Uldyssian would be his undoing, he banished her into the Void for a second time. This time though, he took steps to ensure she would never return.\nThe Veiled Prophet.\nUldyssian had destroyed the Triune, but the Cathedral of Light was next. After Uldyssian's Edyrem clashed with and destroyed Inarius's &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s, Inarius finally descended from his tower and confronted Uldyssian and his army. Inarius first used his overwhelming presence as an angel in an attempt to convert the Edyrem to his side. Uldyssian quickly used his bond to the edyrem to flush them with confidence and outsmarted Inarius. Both Uldyssian and Inarius used magic leading up to and during the battle but when facing each other one on one, they simply relied on infusing their bodies with magic and brawling. Even though Inarius was bonded to the Worldstone and therefore exponentially more powerful than a normal angel, Uldyssian could hold his own. This caused Inarius to lose confidence and slowly he gave way to Uldyssian's attacks. As they fought, there was a tear in the sky as the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; finally entered Sanctuary. In his madness, Inarius was only concerned with destroying Uldyssian no matter what cost and therefore ignored the armies of angels. Uldyssian was distracted by the armies and Inarius seized the opportunity. Inarius grabbed the human ready to strike the final blow but just as he was about to, Uldyssian's entire body infused with energy. Inarius sensed Uldyssian was doing something drastic and he was right. Uldyssian changed the very essence of the Worldstone, destroying the bond it shared with Inarius. Without his bond to the Worldstone, Inarius was drastically weaker and Uldyssian easily defeated him, capturing him in a prison. Afterwards, Uldyssian sent both angels and demons from Sanctuary and the Angiris Council convened to decide the fate of the nephalem as well as Inarius. The Council agreed to an armistice between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells to allow time for the nephalem to mature and decide for themselves which side they would aid in their own free will. In this deal, Inarius was also taken into Mephisto's custody, presumably to be tortured for all eternity. He regarded this as a betrayal by his fellow angels.\nInfinitude.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; took Inarius to the Burning Hells. He bound Inarius with tremendous chains and slowly tore the wings from the back of the angel. Great barbed hooks were then used to stretch out his once glowing skin and his features were distorted by vile powers. Now, Inarius is said to be trapped in Hell within a chamber of mirrors, his eyelids torn from his face as he is forced to gaze upon his misshapen form for all eternity. Inarius was denied even the freedom of death.\nDespite his ignominious end, Inarius's saga was recorded in the \"&lt;a href=\"Books%20of%20Kalan\"&gt;Books of Kalan&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Cain\"&gt;Book of Cain&lt;/a&gt;\".\nReign of Enmity.\nInarius's Return.\nInarius returned to Sanctuary at some point after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s attempted genocide of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. According to Inarius, he escaped from Hell, though &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; noted that Inarius may have embelished this achievement to his followers. The day Inarius returned to Sanctuary would come to be celebrated as the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Advent\"&gt;Divine Advent&lt;/a&gt;. \nInarius found a broken world in his wake, fragmented by Malthael's actions. He sought a way back to Heaven, and his first step in achieving this goal was to reignite the religion he had abandoned millennia before: the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Great statues were erected to Inarius inside the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%20%28Fractured%20Peaks%29\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, his followers consumed by adoration of him. Shrines outside the structure were also erected to Inarius, all over the Fractured Peaks.\nAt some point, Inarius saved a mortal woman named &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt;, curing her of the seizures that had plagued her since infancy. She went on become his right hand after he taught her the tenets of the Cathedral of Light. While Inarius was the supreme leader of the church, Prava handled its day-to-day operations, and acted as a bridge between Inarius and the rest of his followers. He resided at &lt;a href=\"Kor%20Valar\"&gt;Kor Valar&lt;/a&gt;. \nRathma's Prophecy.\n&lt;a href=\"Rathma%27s%20Prophecy\"&gt;Rathma's Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; became known to Inarius, and he descended into the depths of the earth to meet his son at the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Necropolis of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;. Inarius tried to collect a key to Hell from Rathma, but he refused, stating that he saw in a vision that the key was taken from his corpse under the watchful eyes of the &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;serpent&lt;/a&gt;. In a fit of anger, Inarius killed Rathma, stabbing his son in the chest with his own staff, but could not find the key.\nInarius returned to the surface, and at least to a few within the Cathedral, claimed that he'd divined the prophecy's meaning/existence. He placed the prophecy within the Cathedral's gospel, and made it seem like he was a hero destined to save Sanctuary. One particular line in the prophecy (\"a spear of light, piercing Hatred's heart\") was seized upon by Inarius, who presented it as proof that he was destined to kill Lilith. He claimed (or hoped) that by killing the Daughter of Hatred, he would be able to ascend into Heaven. The Cathedral's gospel ran with this claim, stating that through such an act, the faithful would ascend to Heaven alongside Inarius. In truth, Inarius saw his followers as little more than cannon fodder in his plans.\nInarius took up residence in &lt;a href=\"Alabaster%20Monastery\"&gt;Alabaster Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, where supposedly, he remained in meditation. To see Inarius, outsiders had to undertake a pilgrimage across the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;Fields of Judgment&lt;/a&gt; in order to 'cleanse' them to meet the angel. The pilgrimage was a dangerous undertaking in of itself, and of those who were granted an audience with Inarius, not everyone returned, and those that did did not always return unscathed.\nHatred's Heart.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, news of chaos sowed by Lilith begun to spread. A &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;wanderer&lt;/a&gt; approached Inarius in Alabester Cathedral, seeking to receive his blessings so that they might cross the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Lake\"&gt;Black Lake&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Necropolis of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt; in their pursuit of Lilith. Inarius refused stating that humans were weak, and that Sanctuary has been wasted on the crusades of the unworthy. He then dismissed them. Lilith was later able to get the key to Hell from Rathma's corpse, which was hidden in his staff, meaning Inarius had killed his son not just needlessly but also for nothing. Still, with no key to Hell, Inarius remained in his domicile of the Alabaster Monastery, opting to instead observe events and shadow Lilith's movements.\nSometime later, Lilith would make her move in opening the way to Hell, using the gate found beneath Caldeum, using her followers within the city to grant her access. Gathering his army of the Knight's Penitent, Inarius stormed Caldeum, allowing his knights to purge the city of anyone not of the Cathedral of Light. Near the Palace, Inarius rallied his knights with a speech regarding the prophecy where he will \"pierce Hatred's heart\" and ascend to the High Heavens, promising that his followers will to the same. However, he would be confronted with the last vestiges of the Horadrim, Lorath, Donen, Neyelle and The Wanderer. Bemused that the Horadrim is getting involved with the \"conflicts of their betters\", Inarius would seize the soulstone Donen had in his possession which the group planned to use to imprison Lilith. With little choice, the group followed Inarius's army to the Gates of Hell, where the archangel entrusted the soulstone piece to Prava.\nIn Hell, Inarius stood at the head of a force of &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Knight\"&gt;Pale Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. They were attacked by a force of demons, but as Inarius hovered above his forces, bathing them in light, the knights held firm, easily killing any demon who came near. During the battle, Inarius spotted Lilith among the demons. He flew across the battlefield, landing in the midst of the demons, causing them to recoil. He hurled his spear directly at Lilith. However, the spear was blocked by a hulking demon, leading Inarius to leap into the fray and brutally kill the lesser demons as he retrieved his spear to pursue Lilith. Within the darkened hall of the Spire of Torment, Lilith taunted Inarius on what he actually hoped to seek after forsaking Sanctuary, leading Inarius to angrily call Sanctuary an \"abomination,\" lashing out at the pillars around him before his spear was broken by Lilith's wings. The Mother of Sanctuary asked if their son Rathma included that to which the Father merely stated that by killing their firstborn, he had \"made it right\" for his brethren and regain his rightful place.\nLilith, however, turned the tables on Inarius by asking if the High Heavens rejoiced after he had killed Rathma but the rogue angel couldn't answer, for both knew that the angels remained silent to him. Infuriated and desperate, Inarius charged Lilith with his broken spear, impaling her in the abdomen with its shaft. During this, his army of the Pale Knights led by Prava gained ground in battling the demons, advancing upon the Spire. However, with the deed done, Inarius believed himself redeemed yet remained shaken before being grasped by Lilith, who stated to him that for all his efforts for redemption, the angels would never welcome him back, for he made a choice. One with Lilith, which they would never forgive. Left hysterical and maddingly pleading to the statues around him, asking what must he do to gain redemption and return home, Inarius was left vulnerable in his despair, as Lilith took his spear and pierced his heart, just as he had done with their son, stating that the High Heavens didn't want him and do not listen to him anymore. In agony, Inarius called out for salvation but Lilith denied him this by stating he belonged in Hell as she savagely ripped his wings off, leading him to be obliterated.\nInarius's cries of terror and pain echoed through the chasm in Hell as his light cracks through the Spire before going out, confirming his death. With his demise, the demons resurged as the Pale Knights faltered at the loss of their patron, leading them to be overwhelmed despite Prava's desperate attempts to remind them of their faith before ultimately being swarmed by the demons herself, leaving the army to be slaughtered. All that was left of Inarius, the Father of Sanctuary, was his glowing melted remains becoming part of the Spire like the other tormented souls, with Lilith leaving her former partner behind to continue her plans.\nLegacy.\nAfter Inarius's death, &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt; took over as head of the Cathedral of Light; wounded, but arguably had become more dangerous than ever. &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; speculated that the Cathedral would continue to worship Inarius. Prava would ultimately double down on her fanaticism, declaring The Wanderer and the Horadrim as heretics, even blaming them for Inarius's death, disregarding the fact that they had nothing to do with his death or that they defeated Lilith themselves. In the end, the Cathedral would operate as no different than the other warring bands that plagued and terrorized the innocent, even closing their gates to the people as other threats, such as the Malignant and the Blood Harvest, emerged, leaving the Wanderer to step in and handle the crises.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nInarius is heavily referenced in the \"&lt;a href=\"Destruction%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Destruction's Wake&lt;/a&gt;\" update of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", which takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Prophet%27s%20Progeny\"&gt;Prophet's Progeny&lt;/a&gt; cosmetic set is also based on him.\nDiablo III.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Testament%20of%20Inarius\"&gt;Inarius's logs&lt;/a&gt; can be found in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". One of the sets is named &lt;a href=\"Grace%20of%20Inarius\"&gt;Grace of Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Inarius%20Wings\"&gt;Inarius Wings&lt;/a&gt; are available in the game for those who purchase \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo IV.\nInarius appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". He first appeared in the game's announcement cinematic, bound in chains. He later appeared in the game's release cinematic. The feud between he and Lilith is one of the game's key plot points.\nInarius is referenced in the flavor text of &lt;a href=\"Miner%27s%20Litany\"&gt;Miner's Litany&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Other Games.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nInarius is referenced in flavor lore in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". Here, he was slain by Azmodan.\nCall of Duty.\nInarius is available as an operator in \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty%3A_Modern_Warfare_II\"&gt;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nOnce, Inarius was a paragon of rightousness. While a stoic individual, his sanity slowly degraded to the point that by the end of the Sin War, he was a broken angel. By the Reign of Enmity, Inarius had apparently recovered psychologically (at least in appearance), with mortals worshipping him, demons fearing him, and Inarius unfazed by both. He still resented the angels for \"betraying\" him at the conclusion of the Sin War, and remained in various states of bitterness (an emotion he told himself that he was above in his bitterest moments).\nInarius was a narcissist; while in his personal quarters in the Cathedral of Light, he would sometimes take angelic form, in order to admire himself. He considered Sanctuary to be \"his,\" given the role he'd played in creating it.\nHe had a callous view on humanity and the nephalem, for while he might have held some fondness for the former, considering them his \"adopted children,\" he viewed it as it being by his will that they were allowed to exist at all, and hence, had no moral compunction against removing them if necessary. Even his servants inside the Cathedral, he regarded as being no different from any other function of the structure's design. He was not attracted to humans; certainly not men, and he had little interest in women. In all of Creation, only Lilith had ever stirred genuine passion from him.\nInarius's millennia of torture in Hell changed him, and not for the better. Whatever hope or affection he might have had for humanity or Sanctuary had apparently evaporated, claiming the former to be weak, and the latter to be rotting from the inside. While it could be inferred that Inarius had some lingering affection for Rathma, considering his years-long seclusion in the Alabaster Monestary after murdering his son, Inarius's capacity for self-justification remained intact, later claiming that he'd set things right through Rathma's murder, that Sanctuary was an abomination, that he was destined to strike down Lilith, and thus, return to the Heavens. Whether Inarius truly believed these things or had self-rationalized his beliefs, as Lilith pointed out, only silence was Heaven's answer to his actions. In the end, Inarius was unable to accept that he was beyond redemption in the eyes of his brethren, that all of his efforts were for naught and would never return home, which left him open for Lilith to strike the deathly blow.\nAppearance.\nIn his angelic form, Inarius has golden wings, which cast light bright enough to illuminate even the darkness of Hell. In his prime, before the Sin War, Inarius was an angel of great splendor. He was proud of his beauty and boasted loudly of his purity and worth.\nAs \"the Prophet,\" Inarius appeared as a golden-haired man, said hair flowing past his shoulders. He appeared lithe and fit, though not overly muscular. With luminous silver-blue eyes and ivory skin, he barely looked old enough to be called a man. His voice sounded like music, and he had a presence so impressive that humans wished to drop down on their knees in worship, and even Rathma, a &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, experienced a similar desire (though was able to resist it). As the Prophet, Inarius had no beard, and as such, all male members of the Cathedral (in its first incarnation) were obliged to be clean-shaven, in order to emulate their leader.\nAbilities.\nInarius possessed great power, which had been likened to that of a &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;. Because of how he had tied himself to the Worldstone, his strength was great enough to give even the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; pause, and he could cast individuals into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; if he so desired. He could manipulate the course of events to his own ends, and be even more subtle than Lilith while doing so. He had the ability to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;. \nInarius has the ability to cast out a pulse of light that gives demons force. His presence is strong enough to crack the ground when he hovers, and crater it when he lands. During the Eternal Conflict, Inarius dual-wielded &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt;. He could make his wings sharp enough to slice through demons, and is capable of telekinesis. During the Reign of Enmity, he carried a &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;, which he could hurl with great force and accuracy.\nInarius was also a skilled diplomat, and was able to gather numerous angels to his side even before meeting Lilith.\nTrivia.\nOriginal Lore.\nIn the original \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" manual, Inarius was only introduced as a means of explaining the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Overlord\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt; demon. In this account, it is said that Inarius's thoughts became so clouded that he believed himself to be above both angel and demon, and left the High Heavens to form his own dominion. He constructed a great cathedral of mirrored glass and crystal, and followers flocked to him, drawn by his numinous charm and wealth. Once Inarius had gathered a sizable army, he decided to prove his power. Inarius first laid siege to an infernal temple devoted to the worship of Mephisto, but made the foolish mistake of overestimating his prowess. The armies of Inarius laid waste to the temple and killed the dark monks that dwelled within. The Three Evils had considered the vain warrior a mere nuisance and amusement until this time, but this was an insult that they could not bear.\nMephisto himself is said to have appeared at the cathedral of Inarius. He laid waste to the church and the surrounding countryside. The Lord of Hatred took the proud archangel and his followers captive. Inarius was tortured while his followers became the Overlords.\nWhile this account bears resemblance to the events of the Sin War, there are still irreconcilable differences. This may be a retcon, or in-universe errant history, as per few mortals remembering the exact details of the Sin War. "}

It has made reference to \"our wars\" (in regards to &lt;a href=\"Valostre\"&gt;Valostre&lt;/a&gt;), but whether it itself fought in them is unclear. Whatever the case, the wars of old ended, but the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; endured in spirit form. The Incarnate remained on Bilefen as a trap for &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. If it was activated and deemed the adventurer worthy, it would take them into its realm and subject them to the bloodsport of its kin/creators.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the Incarnate was awakened by &lt;a href=\"Ross\"&gt;Ross&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;. As the Shard-seeker had delivered the \"weapons of the dead\" to the Incarnate, it only gave them its attention, and bid the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; follow them, while ignoring Ross's questions. The Incarnate transported itself and the Shard-seeker into a strange realm; a mirror of Bilefen and/or Valostre of old. The ancient &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; spirits desired a new opponent, and the Incarnate directed the nephalem spirits against the Shard-seeker, who defeated them. The Shard-seeker found the bloodsport pointless, but the Incarnate had no such qualms, and battled against the Shard-seeker itself. The Shard-seeker defeated the Incarnate, and was promptly returned to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;material world&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nThe Incarnate of Valostre is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".
