{"id": "3752", "revid": "44771288", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3752", "title": "Diablo II Walkthrough", "text": "This walkthrough will guide you through \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" (Act I-IV) and the \"\" (Act V) expansion. This walkthrough will also assume that you are playing the single player version of Diablo II. If you are playing on Battle.net, by LAN or with a mod, this walkthrough will not be useless to you, but there may be things such as muling, and getting help from other players (as well as things such as speed grinding with Tristram runs) which may modify your playstyle a bit. It also provides general information. For advice specific to particular classes for particular monsters such as &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;, check the individual articles as many of them have tactics geared toward individual character classes.\nGetting Started.\nAfter selecting a class from the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt;, you find yourself in the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt;. These initial starting points in each Act are referred to as \"towns\" or \"sanctuaries.\" While within the borders of these areas, players and monsters can inflict no damage. In these towns there are characters with whom players can interact with to obtain quests and buy/sell/repair/gamble or hire mercenaries, depending on their purpose within the town walls. Each character has information of varying importance, and when playing the game for the first time, they often give useful tips for succeeding in quests.\nIn the Rogue Encampment, &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gheed\"&gt;Gheed&lt;/a&gt; will sell basic armor and weapons. Charsi also performs the additional service of repairing weapons and armor. &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; will sell staves, wands and sceptres in addition to scrolls, tomes, potions and other magical items. Akara will also heal the character and their minions as well as activating the first quest. As in the original Diablo, the player starts with just a weapon and possibly a shield, depending on the character class, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Scroll of Identify&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Scroll of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;. All starting items sells exactly for 1 &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; Piece, so if you come into any weapon or shield more useful than your starting one, you can just drop the starting item in the ground instead of going into town to sell it.\nCompass Directions.\nSome parts of this walkthrough will use compass directions, so to avoid confusion, north will be toward the upper right hand corner of the screen.\nSome Advice for First Time Players.\nIn order to defeat the foes of the game, a player will need to make best use of all the items found or purchased. Rather than inundate the reader, the list below is a few tips for helping the player through Normal difficulty.\nAttribute Distribution.\nAttributes are a set of values that determine a variety of statistics. For instance, the value of strength determines the (naked) amount of melee damage a player does and how heavy the armor and weapons they can equip. Every time a character levels they receive five attribute points that can be spent on either &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitially, Strength and Dexterity are only increased to meet the requirements of better and better gear, and the remaining points are sunk into Vitality. Later on, there is variation on this scheme, but for the first five to ten levels, splitting the points between Strength and Vitality is a smart idea. For some characters like the Bow Amazon, increasing dexterity when necessary is a good idea. Later, there may be variation on this theme, but for the beginning, it is a safe investment. Energy is considered a dump stat, even for spellcasters, because it only increases Maximum Mana and nothing else. Maximum Mana also increases with level and certain equipment, mana regeneration and leech are also common item atributes and mana potions aren't expensive and are commonly dropped by monsters, contributing to the stat becoming less and less eficient latter on, so it's only good to invest in it if your build depends on Maximum Mana, like a Melee &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; with maxed &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Shield\"&gt;Energy Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkill Distribution.\nSkill points are used to access new spells or abilities called &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt;s. Every time characters level up, they receive one skill point. Some skills require a certain minimum level before a player can access that skill; for instance, a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; can not learn &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt; until level 6. In addition, some skills require one or more prerequisite skills; for instance, a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; cannot learn &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Rage\"&gt;Feral Rage&lt;/a&gt; until level 12 and after acquiring the &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; skill. Some skills add bonuses to other skills called &lt;a href=\"Synergies\"&gt;Synergies&lt;/a&gt; which boost other skills.\nSkills increase in power as more points are invested into them and while it is better to specialize, every character has their \"one point wonders\" where the skills are useful with a single or low point investment, especially at lower levels. With this in mind, take a look through the builds and the character information sections for information on what suits a particular playstyle and take into consideration what will make the character effective. For example, the Necromancer has &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Resist\"&gt;Summon Resist&lt;/a&gt;, which grants a large initial resistance bonus to his minions. Extra points invested in this give very diminished bonuses, so many players (providing they are playing a minions-based build) will invest a single point in it, relying on item bonuses to boost it. Another is &lt;a href=\"Leap%20Attack\"&gt;Leap Attack&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow a Barbarian to jump over most obstacles practically a screen width away for the cost of a single skill point.\nAct I.\nIn the town, &lt;a href=\"Warriv\"&gt;Warriv&lt;/a&gt; will be the first person to approach the character. &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt; will not be far away, but she won't let you hire anyone until you've finished the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%27%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Sisters' Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt; quest, or are higher than level 8. You can talk to &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gheed\"&gt;Gheed&lt;/a&gt;, but you will be broke, so you'll be unable to buy anything from them. Lastly, talking to &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; will task you with the first quest.\nHead out into the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Moor\"&gt;Blood Moor&lt;/a&gt; and follow the road to your first quest. A player can choose to kill all the monsters in the area for the experience points or skip them and progress with the quest.\u00a0 Whatever you choose to do, the road will eventually split and not too far away from that fork in the road, you will discover a cave called &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Evil%20%28area%29\"&gt;The Den of Evil&lt;/a&gt;. If the cave happens to be a little too distant, you will eventually encounter a rogue named &lt;a href=\"Flavie\"&gt;Flavie&lt;/a&gt;. Since you have wandered this far, it is a good idea to carefully wander into the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Plains\"&gt;Cold Plains&lt;/a&gt; and activate the &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; here. This will save travelling all the way back once the quest is completed.\nMagic armor and weapons are a bit of a gamble to bring back and sell at this part of the game as they can sell for less than the cost of an identify scroll, (specially the case with ethereal or class-specific items, and even worse when the item in question can't have innate skill bonuses like the Assassin Katars), so until 5000 gold or so has been earned (which won't take that long) pick up the Identify scrolls to better evaluate whether something is worth selling in town. Extra mana and healing potions are good, but it is unwise to fill your inventory with them. Rings, amulets, jewels and chipped gems also sell for decent amounts of gold should you decide not to keep them. Wands, staves, sceptres and orbs are also worth a significant amount if they have skill bonuses.\nThe player may also opt to hang on to the second best armor, helmet and the best bow in their stash so gold does not need to be spent immediately on the Hireling's equipment.\u00a0 A player can also buy a Long Bow from Gheed unless a better one is found before then.\nBefore you enter the cave, you can allocate any points you have to your stats and skills. If you are unsure, take a look at the builds section to get a general idea of what skills would be good choices. There are also some \"one point skills\" on every character worth taking, and the respecialization option will be helpful if you make a serious mistake in skill allocation. Keep in mind, however, that respecs are not infinite, so do take some care before choosing to reset your character's points.\nQuest 1: The Den of Evil.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act I without this quest done.\nThis quest is quite straightforward: Kill all the monsters in the cave.\u00a0 It is also optional, but the reward is a good one.\nEncounters\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;Fallen Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wendigo\"&gt;Gargantuan Beasts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zombies\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt;. Fallen Shamans will rarely waste time in resurrecting slain Fallen, so make them a priority. If they have too many minions, you can choose to kill a few monsters to disperse the crowds of Fallen should they be interfering with you trying to remove the Shamans. There are times the Shamans will resurrect Fallen off screen, and slow your completion of the quest.\nThere is a superunique Zombie called &lt;a href=\"Corpsefire\"&gt;Corpsefire&lt;/a&gt;. He can be quite a bit of trouble to a beginning player. The best way to fight him is alone, so either draw him off specifically or draw off the nearby monsters so attention won't have to be diverted from him.\nOther Advice.\nContinue to clear out the cave, perhaps needing to backtrack as the Fallen Shamans might have resurrected a Fallen out of the player's view. Once every monster in the area is defeated, a short piece of music is played, and beams of light will be seen as through the caves. You can return to town either by town portal, walking back or by continuing on to activate the waypoint in the Cold Plains. At any rate, speak with Akara, and she will award a bonus skill point as well as make available an option to reset the stat and skill points of the character, which can be redeemed at any time, but is only awarded once per difficulty level outside of creating a &lt;a href=\"Token%20of%20Absolution\"&gt;Token of Absolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nA good investment at this point would be a Tome of Town Portal, as the walk to the burial grounds can be quite long. As well, obtain a belt of some sort if you have not already, as it will double the number of potions available.\nQuest 2: Sisters' Burial Grounds.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act I without this quest done.\nOnce the Den of Evil is complete, Kashya will have the next quest available to you. A being known as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Blood Raven&lt;/a&gt; is raising up an army of Zombies in the &lt;a href=\"Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, and Kashya wants you to stop her. The Burial Grounds are found next to the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Plains\"&gt;Cold Plains&lt;/a&gt;, and are reachable by following the road next to the waypoint. The road has three destinations: a dungeon called the &lt;a href=\"Caves\"&gt;Caves&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Field\"&gt;Stony Field&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt; themselves, so there may be significant running around before you find them. The next area, the Stony Field, has the waypoint created in a random place upon generation, so it is often a better idea to backtrack for now than to venture forward into the next area to find it.\nEncounters\nThere will be the same monsters that you had in the last quest as well as a form of Corrupt Rogues called &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hunter\"&gt;Dark Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Spearwoman\"&gt;Dark Spearwomen&lt;/a&gt;. This area also has a superunique Fallen Shaman named &lt;a href=\"Bishibosh\"&gt;Bishibosh&lt;/a&gt; who has the ability to resurrect nearby Fallen Shamans if they are slain, so if you encounter him, either make him a priority or avoid him altogether. If you find the mobs of Fallen to be too much, you can try killing a few of them to disperse them temporarily while you eliminate Bishibosh.\nOnce you reach the Burial Grounds, it would be preferable to skirt around the cemetery walls and defeat the Hungry Dead and Skeletons, as Blood Raven will frequently run all over the place, causing the player to deal with them anyway. Blood Raven is a superunique Corrupt Rogue Archer, and can make it tough for beginning characters. She prefers to stay at range and will often raise Hungry Dead to distract the player.\u00a0 However, if you keep focused on her, you should eventually be able to defeat her.\nQuest 3: The Search for Cain.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act I without this quest done, though there are benefits later in the game to completing it.\nOnce you return to town, Akara will grant the next quest. She will tell you that it is necessary to find &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; in order to better face the evil that has befallen the monastery. He can be found in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, which is too far to reach by foot, so you are tasked with activating the portal in the &lt;a href=\"Cairn%20Stones\"&gt;Cairn Stones&lt;/a&gt;, found in the &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Field\"&gt;Stony Field&lt;/a&gt;. You will need to touch them in a certain order, which is written on the bark of the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Inifuss\"&gt;Tree of Inifuss&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, although it is not mandatory to complete this quest, Deckard Cain will identify all items in your inventory at no charge.\nThe Stony Field.\nIt is not a difficult task, but there will be a lot of walking involved. Firstly, look at your character's skill/stat points and allocate as you need. Outfitting your rogue with a few items is also helpful. Return to the Cold Plains and follow the road to the Stony Field. Continue to follow the road to the entrance of the Underground Passage, engaging enemies as necessary, but before you enter the cave, take some time to explore the area and find the waypoint, as you will have to return to the area to finish the quest. While you are following the road, you will likely discover the circle of stones that will activate the portal and their guardian, &lt;a href=\"Rakanishu\"&gt;Rakanishu&lt;/a&gt;, who will be detailed in the encounters section.\nEncounters\nThe Stony Field will have &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Clan\"&gt;Moon Clan&lt;/a&gt; Goatmen, &lt;a href=\"Hungry%20Dead\"&gt;Hungry Dead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;Fallen Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Archer\"&gt;Dark Archer&lt;/a&gt;s. There will also be a new enemy called a &lt;a href=\"Carver\"&gt;Carver&lt;/a&gt;, who is slightly tougher than their cousins the Fallen, and fortunately in this area, they won't have Shamans to raise them once they are slain. There is also the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Lightning Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; Carver Rakanishu, memorable as the charged bolts he often emits when struck can do lethal damage at low levels. While it doesn't hurt to bulk up somewhat on lightning resistance, using potions when necessary and fleeing to town are also effective if you should be in danger of soaking too many of them. There are also &lt;a href=\"Foul%20Crow\"&gt;Foul Crow&lt;/a&gt;s and their spawners, the &lt;a href=\"Foul%20Crow%20Nest\"&gt;Foul Crow Nest&lt;/a&gt;s. They can be quite tough to destroy in the beginning, but it is usually wise to at least attempt as they will spawn several Foul Crows before self-destructing..\nThe Underground Passage.\nOnce you're ready, return to the cave and head inside. The monsters in the passage are not terrible in themselves. Continue to search around for the exit. There is a second level to this area, but you will have to face Carver Shamans, and the loot from the golden chest at this point will likely not be worth the bother of tangling with the monsters in this area. Once you've found the exit, place a Town Portal here before going out to ensure that if you die that you won't have to walk all the way from the waypoint in the Stony Field.\nEncounters\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Archer\"&gt;Skeleton Archer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Hunter\"&gt;Vile Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s are quite fragile, as are the &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Carver\"&gt;Carver&lt;/a&gt;s. There are also the Misshapen, who can do significant damage, but they are also quite fragile. The area, however, can be dangerous because monsters will often spawn in groups of five or six. The Fallen are often prone to fits of cowardice, so if you plan to engage Fallen, consider removing the Shamans as soon as possible.\nThe Dark Wood.\nThere are two goals in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;. One is to find the Tree of Inifuss and obtain the scroll. The second is to find the waypoint for this area to cut down on walking through the last two areas. Once you have the scroll, speak with Akara, who will decode the order, then return to the Stony Field to open the portal by touching the stones until they all glow and the red portal opens after a big lightning show.\nEncounters\nThe area is a bit thick with enemies, with Skeleton Archers, Vile Hunters, Carvers and Carver Shamans being common. The tree itself is guarded by a unique &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Treehead%20Woodfist\"&gt;Treehead Woodfist&lt;/a&gt;. He spawns with the attributes Extra Strong and Extra Fast, which makes him a difficult foe alone, let alone with three other minions he spawns with. Although he can drop nice loot, killing him is not a necessity and can be dealt with by activating the waypoint first, opening a Town Portal near the tree and leading the mob to the waypoint. Once in town, use the Town Portal to return to the tree.\nTristram.\nOnce inside Tristram, all that is necessary is to find Cain's Gibbet, which can be found on the automap to be on the right hand side of the center of the village. Just click on it, wait for Cain to stand up, and walk through the portal. There is no necessity to clear the area, but many players under level 15 will find that Tristram is a good place to gain experience points.\nEncounters\nThere will be mobs of Carvers and their Shamans, &lt;a href=\"Returned\"&gt;Returned&lt;/a&gt; and/or Skeleton Archers as well as the possibility of &lt;a href=\"Night%20Clan\"&gt;Night Clan&lt;/a&gt; goatmen. There will always be a group in the middle of town which are always Champion level monsters. &lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Edge%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt;, the old blacksmith from the first game will be here as an enemy, who always spawns with the &lt;a href=\"Cursed\"&gt;Cursed&lt;/a&gt; ability, which can cause all victims within a certain radius to be under the effects of an &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; curse.\nQuest 4: The Countess.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act I without this quest done.\nBlack Marsh.\nTo complete Act 1, continue on from the Dark Wood into the Black Marsh. There is a waypoint here as well as an opportunity to gain plenty of treasure. During your search in the Stony Field for the waypoint, you may have discovered a pedestal for a book which would activate the fourth quest on your list. It can also be activated simply by finding the dungeon known as The Forgotten Tower in this area. Like all the other quests in this act, it is not necessary to complete them, but the loot that can be found at the bottom of this tower can be of a lot of assistance. She is often farmed for this purpose as she reliably drops runes. While many consider gold to be worthless, a beginning player can make use of the large amount of gold that can be found at the bottom of the tower. Keep in mind that these runes have level requirements which means they can make something temporarily unusable until you have a high enough level to use it.\nEncounters\nThe marsh has carvers and carver shamans, &lt;a href=\"Night%20Clan\"&gt;Night Clan goatmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Returned\"&gt;Returned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Hawk\"&gt;Blood Hawk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Hawk%20Nest\"&gt;Blood Hawk Nest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Archer\"&gt;Vile Archer&lt;/a&gt;s. The tower has a new Fallen called a &lt;a href=\"Devilkin\"&gt;Devilkin&lt;/a&gt; which, luckily, has no corresponding shaman in this area. There are also Night Clan goatmen, Vile Archers and Ghosts, which can drain mana from your character if they score a hit on you.\nThe boss, known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Countess\"&gt;The Countess&lt;/a&gt;, has a reputation for dropping runes, which many players collect and fabricate armor and weapons with. She can be found in a chamber with a number of minions. If you are in melee with her, be sure to keep your health globe full as her fire enchanted property can cause significant damage to any character at close range.\nTamoe Highland and The Outer Cloister.\nContinue following the road from the Black Marsh into the Tamoe Highland. You can continue to follow it until you finally reach the Monastery. There is a waypoint in the middle of the Outer Cloister of the Monastery. There are three branches in this area, but only one of them has a door leading to the next area.\nEncounters\nIn the Tamoe Highland, there are Devilkin as well as Carvers and their respective Shamans to be found in this area. There are &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Stalker\"&gt;Dark Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Returned%20Archer\"&gt;Returned Archer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Returned%20Mage\"&gt;Returned Mage&lt;/a&gt; which throw &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Bolt%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;fire bolts&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Night%20Clan\"&gt;Night Clan&lt;/a&gt; goatmen. In the Cloister itself, there are &lt;a href=\"Devilkin\"&gt;Devilkin&lt;/a&gt; and their respective Shamans to be faced, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rogue\"&gt;Black Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Yeti\"&gt;Yeti&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuest 5: Tools of the Trade.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act I without this quest done.\nBarracks.\nThe barracks is quite a litmus test as your first encounters are a cluster of Devilkin and their respective Shamans. Because of the number of objects in the first room, the Devilkin Shamans can be effectively hidden, resurrecting their comrades with impunity while the player has to navigate around barrels and boxes to kill the shamans. Like the Underground Passage, monsters can be spawned in large numbers so don't hesitate to make a retreat to a less occupied room if you find the area to be too difficult to engage everyone at once.\nEncounters\nDevilkin and their Shamans pose a significant nuisance. There are also &lt;a href=\"Death%20Clan\"&gt;Death Clan goatmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rogue\"&gt;Black Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Archer\"&gt;Bone Archer&lt;/a&gt;s and also &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Mage\"&gt;Bone Mage&lt;/a&gt;s who hurl firebolts at you. There is also The Smith, who guards the Horadric Malus with a small horde of allies. He can be a difficult opponent because he hits quite hard, but by retreating into a clear area and/or escaping to town when in severe danger, he can be defeated much more easily than &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt; from whom he was inspired. Failing that, you can open a town portal close to the room where the Malus is, and draw the Smith to the Outer Cloister, use the waypoint and from town, return to the area to face the cluster of monsters that are left.\nGiving the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Malus\"&gt;Horadric Malus&lt;/a&gt; to Charsi is rewarded by imbuing one plain non-magical item into a random &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt;. The reward for this quest can be saved until later, even after you've completed the difficulty level. Many players use items as these can be generated with a very wide range of useful modifiers.\nThe Jail.\nThe jail is a continuation of the Barracks in terms of scenery and tactics. There are also iron bars which will impede everything but Teleport or the Barbarian's Leap and Leap Attack skills. This can be a boon if your opponents are melee based, but those enemies who have ranged attacks may find this to be more of a problem than assistance. \nEncounters\nThe first level of the Jail has the same monsters as the previous one with the addition of mana-draining s. At low levels and later difficulties, they will be quite dangerous to engage without some way to regain mana, but upon being able to leave Act 1, they will be little more than a nuisance.\nJail Level 2 has the potential to add &lt;a href=\"Dark%20One\"&gt;Dark One&lt;/a&gt;s, as well a super-unique monster and his allies which are always found on this level, &lt;a href=\"Pitspawn%20Fouldog\"&gt;Pitspawn Fouldog&lt;/a&gt;. Pitspawn and his allies have a cold attack, which will slow you down greatly if you happen to be a melee-based character. He is also Cursed, which makes his attacks particularly dangerous with mobs nearby. Upon death, Pitspawn will also release a Frost Nova, which is particularly dangerous due the long duration of freezing, especially on later difficulty levels. This can be helped by a &lt;a href=\"Thawing%20Potion\"&gt;Thawing Potion&lt;/a&gt;, some by items with the &lt;a href=\"Thawing\"&gt;Thawing&lt;/a&gt; attribute or ignored by wearing an item with the &lt;a href=\"Cannot%20Be%20Frozen\"&gt;Cannot Be Frozen&lt;/a&gt; attribute. Stacking Cold Resistance wil help to reduce the damage, but will do nothing to the duration of chilling. Note that the Thawing Potions increases cold resistance temporarily.\nJail Level 3 adds Bone Mages with lightning attacks as well as the rest of the abovementioned monsters.\nQuest 6: Sisters to the Slaughter.\nInner Cloister and Cathedral.\nOnce you emerge from the Jail, there is a waypoint in the center of this area. This area and the Cathedral are pretty straightforward and the maps never change. From here, work your way down to the next waypoint, found on Catacombs level 2.\nEncounters\nThere can be a few monsters in the Inner Cloister such as Tainted, Black Rogues, Dark Ones and Bone Mages. The Cathedral adds a new monster, the Dark One Shamans. As always, concentrating on eliminating them first will make things much easier as their resurrection range is pretty far. There is also a superunique monster named &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Ash\"&gt;Bone Ash&lt;/a&gt; who may be tricky because he's cold enchanted, but as long as you are either using a ranged weapon or have your life globe near full, you have little to worry about if you've saved him for last. If you're having trouble dealing with him, remember that &lt;a href=\"Antidote%20Potion\"&gt;Antidote Potion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Thawing%20Potion\"&gt;Thawing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s increases poison and cold resistance temporarily and can be given to your hireling.\nCatacombs.\nThe right-hand wing of the Cathedral will have a staircase to the labyrinthine Catacombs. There are not a lot of tips to be offered, there are times the exit to Level 2 will be right next to the stairs. There are other times it finally shows up as you're finished discovering the entire map.\nOn Level 2, there is a waypoint to be found on the level. It's always a good idea to tag this one as there can be a lot of walking saved in future sessions. Level 3 is pretty unremarkable save for the possibility of better quality loot. In level 4 you will find your goal, Andariel, and there will be information in the proceeding section regarding her.\nEncounters\nSeveral new monsters make appearances. Spiders called Arachs, Vampires known as The Banished, Tainted who are called Afflicted as well as those named Tainted, Zombies called Ghouls, and Rat Men, who aren't seen again until Act III. In fact, the only thing that seems to be held over from the other areas are the Dark Ones and their respective Shamans.\nOnce you manage to reach Catacombs Level 4, take the time to open a town portal near the stairs and clear out the first two rooms. Concentrating on the Shamans will save you a lot of work as the density of their appearance will make it quite likely to have 1-2 slain Dark Ones resurrected per second. The third chamber usually has a good sized mob of monsters waiting for you on the other side. Simply retreat into the previous chambers if the pack should be too much to handle. Eliminate the remaining Dark Ones, but take some care to avoid activating Andariel. You can use a ranged weapon to kill that annoying shaman that is up the path that leads to Andariel's throne, and walk around that path in a half circle to avoid activating the boss encounter so you won't have your attentions split between Andariel and raised Dark Ones.\nAndariel\nAndariel has a significant weakness. Her minus 50% &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;fire resist&lt;/a&gt;, that means that fire damage hurts her 100% more than someone with 0% fire resist. Using skills and items that do &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; is a good idea. Lure her towards the door, so you don't attract the attention of the monsters that are hiding in the area behind her. It is quite common to lure her into the room with the blood pool, and run circles around the pool while you occasionally stop to hit her with an attack. Andariel has formidable poison attacks, but luckily, this damage takes time, and quite often, you can flee to town before you can be killed by a follow-up attack. Your poor hireling, however, will likely succumb quite quickly.\nThe purple &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation%20Potion\"&gt;Rejuvenation Potion&lt;/a&gt;s fill your mana and life orbs instantly, while healing potions regenerate your life orb quickly over time. In most cases, the healing potions are used to keep the life globe from being drained too quickly and the rejuvenation potion can be saved for those emergencies to avoid dying while fleeing to town to heal and restock. If you take an Antidote Potions as soon as you're poisoned, she will likely follow up quickly with another poison attack, but the temporary resistance bonus may be useful. Usually, the Antidote potions are used to help keep your hireling alive if she happens to be in a decent position to avoid the poison cloud.\nOnce she's dead, gather and sell your loot, talk to Warriv and proceed to Act 2.\nAct II.\nYou will arrive in the bright and arid town of Lut Gholein. Like Act 1, as long as you are within the town borders, you will be safe from monster attacks and hostile party members (save for a single bug involving an Amazon and a Necromancer.) There are vendors and NPCs which provide some atmosphere as well as clues to your quests. Cain is also found here, and on the off chance you decided not to rescue him, he\u2019ll charge to identify items for you.\nIf you have the installed, you can take your rogue &lt;a href=\"Hireling\"&gt;Hireling&lt;/a&gt; with you to &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act 2&lt;/a&gt;. At this stage in the game, however, many players choose to hire a new mercenary from Griez. While the rogue can be a viable hireling, they often require specialized equipment that is rarely available to a character this early in the game. The &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Desert Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; tends to be the more popular choice. In spite of being a melee-oriented minion, he does more damage, is more durable and can also activate his own paladin aura based on his type. While many choose the Combat Hireling which has a Prayer aura, the Defensive Hireling may also be of use with his Defiance aura. If you prefer using the rogue, however, you can always hire one again if you should choose to do so.\nBe sure to check the vendors once in a while as they may be selling gear which may be better than what they are equipped with. Just as with the rogue, keeping him well maintained and giving him healing potions when he's wounded badly enough will make them very helpful. \nOnce you\u2019re ready to continue your pursuit of Diablo, the first quest would be a good start as the reward is another skill point. You are tasked to kill Radament the Fallen who can be found at the bottom of the town\u2019s sewer system. On the other hand, the Horadric Cube may be of more interest as there are formulae such as combining gems, potions and low runes which may be of more help at the moment. The choice will be yours. The quests will be followed in order, however.\nWhat to look out for.\nAt this point, all characters should continue to build on resistances. The boss fights have attacks that are still very potent, but having these resistances maxed out will take some of the pain out of facing them. Keep on the lookout for helmets, jewellry, boots, belts and gloves that will have bonuses to fire and lightning. With poison attacks, you generally have time to flee to town if poison is overcoming the effects of your healing potions. Cold resistance is helpful, but cold damage is generally pretty minor. The problem with cold damage is the side effect of being greatly reduced in speed.\nMelee characters can look out for ways to add &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cannot%20Be%20Frozen\"&gt;Cannot be Frozen&lt;/a&gt; attributes to their equipment. If they are not fortunate to have found unique items, there are runewords which can be easily manufactured such as and . Don't be worried about finding anything by the end of Act 2, these items are by no means necessary to complete the game, but characters having these attributes will find they help a lot, especially in boss fights. Other possible useful items that use low runes would be , and .\nCharacters like the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shockbringer\"&gt;Trapsin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Druid\"&gt;Elemental Druid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; can look out for items that grant bonuses to their primary skills.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Bowazon\"&gt;Bowazon&lt;/a&gt; should be on the lookout for a bow with a good balance between speed and damage, putting a single point in &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Missiles\"&gt;Slow Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Penetrate\"&gt;Penetrate&lt;/a&gt; as they become available is a good idea.\nAttribute distribution.\nThe mantra is \"Vit to the max, Strength only to carry gear and Dexterity enough to get 75% block.\" At this stage in the game, however, saving 10-20 points for a suddenly great item is not going to wreck the character. The choice is yours, however, and many people choose to max out on their vitality after gaining a Strength score of 45, saving the items in their stash until they have gained enough levels to sufficiently equip an item. Bowazons usually split their scores between dexterity and vitality, however, because damage and accuracy are important to the build. Adding to energy is, however, regarded by many as something to avoid, even for mana-intensive builds, instead ensuring there are enough potions on their belt to continue usage of their skills.\nRadament's Lair.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act II without this quest done.\nThere are two entrances to the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Act%20II%29\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt;. One is near &lt;a href=\"Greiz\"&gt;Greiz&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is near the docks. The sewers have 3 levels, the stairs to level 2 are usually closest to the docks entrance, and there is a waypoint on Level 2, which is convenient, but usually only a priority for multiplayer or completists.\nUpon entering the sewers, follow the right hand wall. The stairs should be somewhere to the right side, if you have to take a left turn and start going in that direction for more than one screen, then the stairs have likely been placed to the other side of the exit, so turn back and follow the left hand path instead. On rare occasions, the stairs will be at a completely different location, and you will have to explore most of the area. Level 2 is much less predictable, the stairs and waypoint could be near each other or not, but always found on the outer side of the dungeon.\n&lt;a href=\"Radament\"&gt;Radament the Fallen&lt;/a&gt; will be located in level 3, always on the outer side so do not burden yourself with searching out the middle of the map hoping to find him. You can tell when you are near, due to the presence of Horrors, who will be colored black as opposed to red. Some of these can also be spawned as mages.\nEncounters\nThe monsters found in the sewers are not dangerous in themselves. Like the Underground Passage, what makes them difficult is the fact that they are frequently spawned in clusters of five or six. The fire arrows skill used by the burning dead can be significantly more dangerous than at later parts of the game where you have had an opportunity to bulk up on your resistances, and like Fire Bolt, a player will take damage from it unless it misses your character completely. You can choose to find a few fire resistance items that will help make it a little less painful, but for the most part; you may spend significant time making runs to Andariel to find items which will help you in this regard.\nIf you are not prepared to do so, you can choose to withdraw a bit when you spot mixed melee/range enemy types, causing the melee foes to follow you out of range as the archers only occasionally move from their spawn location. This will make the melee-oriented monsters easier to defeat as you will not be taking damage from fire arrows. Once your melee opponents are eliminated, ranged characters can simply keep giving their hireling potions to compensate for the damage while pelting the skeletons with their best ranged attacks. Melee-oriented characters can try zigzagging in half-circles in an attempt to avoid being hit by their fire arrows, also feeding healing potions to their hireling as necessary.\nAlthough Radament is a formidable opponent, what makes him more dangerous is the sheer number of minions and the fact he can quickly raise them to fight again. The simplest tactic is to draw off as many minions as you can to a safer area where they are out of range of his resurrection ability. If your character has access to a skill that destroys corpses, such as find item (find potion will not work on skeletons), corpse explosion, raise skeleton or carrion vine, this is also a viable tactic, but its usefulness is generally limited to higher difficulty levels.\nOnce you have his forces pared down to something manageable, buy you can buy several &lt;a href=\"antidote\"&gt;antidote potions&lt;/a&gt; in town and drink them immediately, checking your character screen for your poison resistance. When it is high enough for your liking, the top value being 75%, proceed to do the same with your hireling to minimize the damage potential of his poison cloud attack. Radament is quite tough, so it can take a while. Remember most of all that discretion is the better part of valor, so if he gets a few lucky hits in on you and might kill you or kills your hireling early in the battle, don\u2019t hesitate to retreat to town and prepare again.\nRadament drops a book that grants +1 skill point, best used immediately as the skill point doesn't go away and the book takes up 4 inventory boxes. The scroll in the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Chest\"&gt;Golden Chest&lt;/a&gt; starts the The Horadric Staff quest, but you can ignore it and just start the quest anyway.\nQuest 2, Part 1: The Horadric Cube.\nThis part of the quest is not exceptionally difficult, but the amount of searching involved give many players reason to grouch about it being the worst Act in the game. It is a common complaint by people who play online as they exploit a bug in Act III which allows them to escape having to wander through the jungles to complete Khalim\u2019s Will. This aside, you will simply have to wander through the next two areas to find a dungeon called the Halls of the Dead, which is found somewhere in the Dry Hills.\nThe Rocky Waste.\nThis is the first of the of five wilderness areas of Act II. It has a single dungeon, often overlooked because the experience levels and drops in this area aren\u2019t rich enough to encourage people to spend more time here.\nEncounters\nYou will encounter many new foes here. &lt;a href=\"Sabre_Cat\"&gt;Saber Cats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"slinger\"&gt;Spear Cats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scavenger\"&gt;Undead Scavenger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cave%20Leaper\"&gt;Cave Leaper&lt;/a&gt;s are pretty much \"stock\" foes and won't pose a problem unless encountered in large groups. The last two are a bit special, and have certain abilities which are unique. The Scavenger can fly short distances, and while in the air, cannot be damaged by any weapon. The Leaper will be annoying because while they don't do a lot of damage they frequently jump all over the place and get knocked back whenever hit.\nThe Dry Hills.\nThis area is much the same as the first. You will search for a dungeon here to retrieve the Horadric Cube which you will, in all likelihood, find very useful. First, however, you may wish to find the waypoint first as it will save you from having to walk out of the dungeon once you\u2019ve completed the first part of this quest. The dungeon also has a waypoint on level two, but as mentioned before, there is potential to save a lot of walking by getting the one in the Rocky Waste first. It may also be split into two elevations with a single staircase located somewhere in the borders between the two.\nEncounters\nThe Dry Hills is the first place you will encounter the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Demon\"&gt;Scarab Demon&lt;/a&gt;s. They are all &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Lightning Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; like Rakinishu and will frequently emit s when struck. They tend to do a lot of damage which is why looking for items to buff up your character's resistances was mentioned at the beginning of the walkthrough. if you have forgotten to allocate points for a while, you should spend some on Vitality once you've entered this area.\nThere are some new foes in the dungeon. There are &lt;a href=\"Sarcophagus\"&gt;Sarcophagi&lt;/a&gt; which spawn a form of mummy called a &lt;a href=\"Decayed\"&gt;Decayed&lt;/a&gt;. Although it has a lot of durability, they aren't too difficult to overcome, and standing directly in front of the door can often prevent them from spawning.\nThe dungeon will be your first encounter with Greater Mummies, called &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Ones\"&gt;Hollow Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Like Radament, they have a skill to resurrect slain skeletons and lesser mummies as well; they can breathe a poison cloud. They also have a missile attack called an Unholy Bolt, which is similar to Holy Bolt, but will cause damage to anything it considers an enemy. If the enemies are not generated in large numbers, simply charge in; slay the Greater Mummies and then deal with the minions. If the number of minions is too great, simply withdraw to a safer part of the dungeon out of range of their resurrection skill and return to deal with the Greater Mummies without distraction.\nOn Level 3, there is a superunique saber cat called &lt;a href=\"Bloodwitch%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Bloodwitch the Wild&lt;/a&gt; and her minion pack guarding the Horadric Cube along with a few other monsters. Since her and her minions are melee oriented and quite fast, you may choose to fight them at the doorway or run a bit down the hall so you can keep from being overwhelmed. Defeat the rest of the foes and open the chest in the chamber to retrieve the loot and the Cube. Your character can only have one in their inventory, so you will not have to waste your time returning here with the intention of getting another.\nQuest 2, Part 2: The Horadric Staff.\nThe Far Oasis.\nThis is another wilderness area and like the previous, it may have two elevations. There is a single dungeon in the area, as well as a waypoint. It is generally a good idea to find the waypoint first, even if the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Maggot%20Lair\"&gt;Maggot Lair&lt;/a&gt; is found before it as it will shorten the amount of walking you will have to do after obtaining the Staff of Kings from the bottom of the Maggot Lair. If you do happen to find the Maggot Lair first, leave a town portal near the entrace to the Lair and continue on to find the waypoint.\nThe Maggot Lair is unlike any other area in Diablo II; it is extremely cramped, in most hallways there is only room for one character to maneuver. Close combat characters have a strategic advantage as they cannot be outflanked, but ranged characters may find it annoying to find monsters right behind corners. The AI of most of these creatures also doesn't lead them to follow you beyond corners and the hireling only recognizes what is directly in front of them. In multi-player, characters should mind to keep some distance between them and the player in front of them, so that that player has a chance to retreat if things get difficult for him.\nFollowing the right hand path in Level 1 of the Maggot Lair leads to the way down fastest. In level 2, the map has a bias toward the left hand path. The boss fight for level 3 is found most frequently by remaining in the middle of the map and going as far north as possible.\nEncounters\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20Beetle\"&gt;Death Beetle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Swarm\"&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Maggot\"&gt;Sand Maggot&lt;/a&gt;s make up the bulk of the monsters found here. While the Beetles are difficult, the other two monsters will be found to be little trouble. The Swarm's &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; drain isn't effective at this difficulty level. The Sand Maggots do little damage and their poison attack is similarly weak. They can, however, lay &lt;a href=\"Devourer%20Egg\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; which can spawn a number of &lt;a href=\"Devourer%20Young\"&gt;young&lt;/a&gt;, which are hardly more than an annoyance. It is often best to eliminate the eggs first so your attacks will not have to be divided. There is a superunique in this area called &lt;a href=\"Beetleburst\"&gt;Beetleburst&lt;/a&gt;, who is made deadlier by the fact he has a minion pack that is tougher than the regular beetles in this area.\nThe Maggot Lair has the same monsters, and it is little more than an annoyance to have to deal with most of them. The boss, &lt;a href=\"Coldworm%20the%20Burrower\"&gt;Coldworm the Burrower&lt;/a&gt;, however is a case to herself as she is always Cold Enchanted, and with the hefty amount of life she has, it will be in your best interest to either engage her at range or ensure your health globe is close to full before laying the killing strike. While she can spawn fully grown Sand Maggots (who can in turn lay eggs to spawn young), this difficulty level makes them a negligible threat.\nQuest 3: The Tainted Sun.\nThese quests work hand in hand, so they will both be handled in this section.\nOnce you have returned to town to restock and sell unwanted loot, you can utilize the waypoint to return to the Far Oasis. Continue searching the bordering of the area for a passage to the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20City\"&gt;Lost City&lt;/a&gt;. After 3-5 seconds, every area in Act 2 will be reduced to minimal light. You can talk to Drognan about this, and he will suggest that the spell can be undone by travelling to the &lt;a href=\"Claw%20Viper%20Temple\"&gt;Claw Viper Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs before, finding the waypoint may not be necessary, but it will likely save significant walking. Afterward, simply find the narrow passage in the border of the area to find the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Snakes\"&gt;Valley of Snakes&lt;/a&gt; and enter the tomb within. Your goal is an altar on the second level of the Claw Viper Temple. Clicking on it will cause the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20the%20Viper\"&gt;Amulet of the Viper&lt;/a&gt; to drop, thus completing the third quest and your adventure into the wilderness surrounding Lut Gholein for the time being. Daylight will once again function normally.\nReturn to town, empty your cube, place the Viper Amulet and the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Staff of Kings&lt;/a&gt; within, and transmute them into a &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Staff%20%28item%29\"&gt;Horadric Staff&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with both Drognan and Cain, and the palace will be opened to you.\nThe Lost City.\nThis area is remarkable for an increase in what appears to be ruins of old houses. The dungeon found here, the Ancient Tunnels is known to be a good place to run in Hell Difficulty, but for the time being, it will earn you more to continue on to the completion of your quests.\nEncounters\nYou will encounter another variety of Sand Raider called a &lt;a href=\"Marauder\"&gt;Marauder&lt;/a&gt;, and have the power to &lt;a href=\"Enchant\"&gt;Enchant&lt;/a&gt; themselves to augment their physical damage with fire. Players can also often encounter &lt;a href=\"Night%20Tiger\"&gt;Night Tiger&lt;/a&gt;s and the poison grenade flinging &lt;a href=\"Night%20Slinger\"&gt;Night Slinger&lt;/a&gt;s. They make weak opponents, they can be quite distracting as poison damage can tend look cumulative. There are also zombies who inflict poison damage called &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Bearer\"&gt;Plague Bearer&lt;/a&gt;s. Finally, there are more annoying Leapers named &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Creeper\"&gt;Tomb Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, and while they don't have a lot of life, they can be immune to damage until they touch down.\nThe Claw Viper Temple.\nOnce inside, it is a maze very similar in appearance to the Stony Tomb where you retrieved the Horadric Cube. While the stairs can be most often found in the upper left of the map, there is still a good possibility that it can be found anywhere in the area. Upon entering Level 2 of the temple, your objective will be the altar in the middle, but pay attention to Fangskin, as he and his minions can gang up on you and possibly make it impossible for you to clear the area due to the sheer number of &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nEncounters\nThe usual enemies will be Lesser Mummies called &lt;a href=\"Embalmed\"&gt;Embalmed&lt;/a&gt;, skeletons called &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Warrior\"&gt;Bone Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and Greater Mummies named &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20%28Mummy%29\"&gt;Guardians&lt;/a&gt;. As mentioned with other Greater Mummies, they will waste little time in resurrecting their fallen minions. You will also encounter two varieties of Claw Viper, the &lt;a href=\"Salamander\"&gt;Salamander&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Claw%20Viper\"&gt;Claw Viper&lt;/a&gt;. Their charge skill can be often augmented with a cold attack which makes them quite deadly in groups larger than two. The damage can often be quite heavy which is why it is recommended to withdraw to a safer place than charge into a group of these creatures. The only fortunate thing is that Claw Vipers don't have a lot of life.\nLevel 2 is very small, and it has a nasty &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Lightning Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; super unique, called &lt;a href=\"Fangskin\"&gt;Fangskin&lt;/a&gt;. He and his minions are usually in the lower right corner of the room, and often it is best to clear out the left hand side of the map so your character can have some place to run if you attract the attention of the entire group rather than one or two. As with Corpsefire, attracting the attention of the minions or Fangskin himself will make it easier to defeat them, but don't forget that he can release strong Charged Bolts. While it is not necessary to defeat him, it would be very difficult to simply run up to the altar and kick it over to grab the amulet.\nInto the The Palace.\nHarem and Palace Cellar.\nThe Palace and Cellars are always the same. The first level, the &lt;a href=\"Harem\"&gt;Harem&lt;/a&gt;, is small and clear of monsters, stairs can be found to either side. The next level has encounters, but is not terribly difficult and if the player chooses to, they can run past these foes to the stairs. The stairs up occupy opposite corners of the map, as the stair down occupy the remaining two corners.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Palace%20Cellar\"&gt;The Palace Cellar&lt;/a&gt;, the stairs down occupy opposing corners, as do the stairs up. The quickest route will be to follow the outside walls of the area, and retreat/charge into battle as necessary, depending on your foes. The first level has a waypoint nbear the middle, and it will be your decision as to whether or not to activate it. The Sorceress' skill can activate it and the Barbarian can through the bars. The second level is the same as the first, where the stairs down can be found in opposing corners and can't be missed if the player follows the outside walls of the area. On level 3 the exit is found in the middle of the area and can be considered a difficult area because you'll have to fight a lot of monsters to get to the portal.\nEncounters\nThis area will commonly have &lt;a href=\"Baboon%20Demons\"&gt;Baboon Demons&lt;/a&gt; called Dune Beasts, &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Raider\"&gt;Sand Raider&lt;/a&gt;s called Invaders, &lt;a href=\"Blunderbore\"&gt;Blunderbore&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Archer\"&gt;Skeleton Archer&lt;/a&gt;s that will fire Magic Arrows. There will also be Skeletal Mages found in the Cellar areas. Blunderbores may not have obscene amounts of life, but their stun ability can cause a lot of trouble when encountered in groups. The skeleton archers are also not a difficult opponent when encountered in groups less than three, but mobs of them can quickly quill their opponents to death. As the player fights their way to the portal, the skeleton's elements of attack will change from floor to floor. Near the portal on level 3, there is a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Enchanted\"&gt;Fire Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; superunique Sand Raider called &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Eye\"&gt;Fire Eye&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, his explosion capability isn't severe, but don't let your health globe be too low when you land the killing blow should you be close enough to take damage from it.\nThe Arcane Sanctuary.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; has 4 wings leading from the middle. One of them has the Summoner with the pedestal that will activate the portal to the next area. While many people will note that it is always the last one explored, it is entirely due to Murphy's law. Each wing has a distinct twist to it. Probably the best strategy is to pick the one you find the most enjoyable first, and the least enjoyable one last. If it is the correct one, less enjoyable ones are skipped. The upside is that each false ending has a pad with a lot of gold plus 3-5 chests full of loot.\nEncounters\nThe Arcane Sanctuary is home to Vampires called &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Lord\"&gt;Ghoul Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, Goatmen from the &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Clan\"&gt;Hell Clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spectre\"&gt;Spectre&lt;/a&gt;s. The Goatmen are quite standard for difficulty, the Specters will drain Mana, but will only be a threat in large groups, and the Vampires will tend to hang back and use missile attacks and their &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Wall%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;Fire Wall&lt;/a&gt; skill. There can also be Lightning Spires which will fire Lightning Bolts at long range and use Nova when an opponent is within melee range. While durable, they are easier to overcome than the Fire Towers located elsewhere in this Act.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;The Summoner&lt;/a&gt; has plenty of tough offensive skills. He has access to &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Spike\"&gt;Glacial Spike&lt;/a&gt;, , and can cast &lt;a href=\"Weaken\"&gt;Weaken&lt;/a&gt;. Also, you need to take very narrow stairs to reach him, which may provide a bottleneck if has melee oriented minions. The best way to approach him is to first lure some of the normal critters away, then kill the summoner as fast as possible. He has low HP, so eliminating him should be easy once you can get attacks on him. There are tips in the article about him.\nAct 2 Ending.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Canyon of the Magi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Tombs of Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; are often run repeatedly from levels 15-20. The false tombs, all have a Golden Chest guarded by a boss pack.\u00a0 The real tomb is much larger than the false ones, but one of the false ones is also rather large compared to the others, that one houses the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kaa%20the%20Soulless\"&gt;Ancient Kaa the Soulless&lt;/a&gt;, a nasty &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Lightning Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mummy\"&gt;Greater Mummy&lt;/a&gt;.\nEncounters\nThe tombs usually only have 3-4 different types of monsters inside, but they have plenty of variety:\u00a0 &lt;a href=\"Mummy\"&gt;Preserved Dead&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"Sarcophagus\"&gt;Sarcophagi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mummy\"&gt;Unravellers&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0 &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Apparitions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Ghoul Lords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Demon\"&gt;Steel Scarabs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blunderbore\"&gt;Gorebellies&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore entering &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Chamber&lt;/a&gt; prepare for a big fight with an act boss.\u00a0 Because Duriel does a lot of damage, being able to quickly use healing/rejuvenation potions is a must when engaging him even if it is just to give your hireling a bit more time.\u00a0 Make sure you have some town portals for trips to town, and be prepared to lose your hireling. Keep in mind you can give your Hireling potions from your belt with a hotkey (Shift+ Potion Number) as there may not be time to pick a potion and drop it on their portrait before Duriel disposes of them.\nThe article on &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; will have information based on what character you've chosen.\u00a0 Once he's defeated, Talk to Tyrael and go back to town.\u00a0 Talk to &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Meshif\"&gt;Meshif&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to open the way to Act III. Although if this is your first playthrough, you probably want to listen what all the NPCs have to say about your success anyway.\nAct III.\nWhen you first enter the &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Docks\"&gt;Kurast Docks&lt;/a&gt;, you will be greeted by &lt;a href=\"Hratli\"&gt;Hratli&lt;/a&gt;, if you leave town, Hratli will be near his forge in the upper right corner of town. Unfortunately, you can no longer buy non-magical weapons and armor in act 3, so you'll have to find them if you need them or periodically return to Act 2, but keep in mind there is a limit to the quality of socketed armor and weapons.\nIn town, there is Hratli, who sells keys, armor and weapons.\u00a0 Ormus, who like Drognan will sell potions, tomes and scrolls in addition to staves, sceptres, wands and a small selection of armor.\u00a0 Alkor will vend stamina, thawing and antidote potions.\u00a0 Asheara will not only buy and sell weapons and armor, but she will also hire out mercenaries called the Iron Wolves.\u00a0 Early on in the game, and through most of Nightmare, they are quite viable, but often fall out of favor due to the prominence of monsters with immunities.\nAttribute distribution.\nWhile saving twenty points or so is not a bad idea, having a strength score of at least 60 is a good idea due to the fact plated belts offer the largest potion capacity.\u00a0 While keeping 20 points for emergencies is not a bad idea in and of itself, do not be afraid to spend points in Vitality.\u00a0 While Dexterity can boost the chance to block, only a bowazon should have their dexterity higher than their vitality.\u00a0 Spending in energy is generally frowned upon due to the fact mana potions are easy to find, however, putting occasional points in Energy shouldn't wreck a build.\nWhat items to look for.\nWhat was stated in Act 2 about items applies in Act 3.\u00a0 Boosting resistances for all characters is important, mostly because it is an easy way to take a lot of pain out of many attacks.\u00a0 Lightning tends to be the most important due to its often high damage.\u00a0 Fire also tends to be quite lethal at this time.\u00a0 Cold resistance is good, but what makes cold damage dangerous is the chilling effect.\u00a0 Poison resistance is often ignored because if it happens to be bad enough, there is usually time to retreat to town to cure it.\nEach playstyle will have particular attributes to look out for.\u00a0 Melee, for example will find bonuses to attack speed, faster hit recovery and life/mana leech to be helpful attributes, as well as some source of cold damage to take advantage of the slowdown caused by cold damage (although Cannot Be Frozen and Crushing Blow are also desirable, you will likely not discover items with these attributes before Act 5). Close-range casters such as elemental druids and hammerdins should definitely look for Faster Hit Recovery, mana bonuses and Faster Cast Rate items.\u00a0 Casters and summoners can keep an eye out for items that will boost their skills.\u00a0 Amazons can also invest in Increased Attack Speed, mana/life leech and having some source of cold damage, whether that is a charm, gem or weapon attribute.\nMake a habit of picking up every &lt;a href=\"Ring\"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amulet\"&gt;Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Charm\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; you find.\u00a0 Not only do they sell well, the blue rings and amulets ones can be transmuted in the cube for a random ring/amulet, sometimes providing an item worth using.\u00a0 Smaller &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Potions\"&gt;Mana Potions&lt;/a&gt; are cheaper and at this point, perform just fine.\u00a0\nWhile some frown upon hirelings, a well maintained one can mean the difference between easy and difficult.\u00a0 They can distract difficult opponents which gives you time to inflict a lot of damage before your opponent realizes the trouble they are in.\u00a0 Rogues will provide a lot of benefit with Increased Attack Speed, Life Leech and cold damage, even if they use a frost arrow attack often.\u00a0 The Desert Mercenary will benefit from not only strong armor and a good spear/polearm, but also Faster Hit Recovery, Increased Attack Speed and Life Leech as well as resistances.\u00a0 Iron Wolves will benefit most from items that have Faster Cast Rate and generic +skills, but most choose to stick with the Desert Mercenary, especially in later difficulty levels if only because minions and hirelings are immune to Corpse Doll explosions.\nQuest 1: The Golden Bird.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act III without this quest done.\nAfter leaving town, Diablo in the \"wanderer form\" will taunt you by vanishing and leaving a pack of Flesh Beasts behind.\u00a0 In the course of your travels a Unique or Champion monster will drop a &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Figurine\"&gt;Jade Figurine&lt;/a&gt;. It can be brought to &lt;a href=\"Meshif\"&gt;Meshif&lt;/a&gt;, then bring the &lt;a href=\"The%20Golden%20Bird%20%28item%29\"&gt;Golden Bird&lt;/a&gt; he gives you to &lt;a href=\"Alkor\"&gt;Alkor&lt;/a&gt;. Click on Alkor again so he gives you an &lt;a href=\"Potions%23Elixirs\"&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Life\"&gt;Potion of Life&lt;/a&gt;, which will provide 20 extra &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 While it most often happens early in game, it can also happen much later on.\nQuest 2 &amp; 3: Blade of the Old Religion and Khalim's Will.\nQuest 2: Blade of the Old Religion.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act III without this quest done.\nAfter completion of the Golden Bird, many simply continue on in the jungle as the quest does not need activation to be completed, and is often done so unless the player is playing online and exploiting a bug where they can get through Act III by simply killing the Council in Travincal and having someone activate a Town Portal inside the Durance (usually the final waypoint.)\nYou are tasked officially by Hratli to seek out a magical dagger which will prevent the jungle and its denizens from overrunning the docks.\u00a0 It is found nearby the entrance to the Flayer Dungeon in the Flayer Jungle.\u00a0 It is an altar that when clicked will spawn a group with a unique or champion monster.\u00a0 When slain, they will drop the Gidbinn.\u00a0 Pick it up and speak with Ormus back in town.\u00a0 After speaking with Asheara, he will give you a randomly generated rare ring.\nQuest 3: Khalim's Will.\nKhalim's Will, Part 1: Khalim's Eye.\nThe jungle areas are a bit annoying to navigate, not only are the areas generated randomly, they also hook up to each other in random ways. Sometimes the &lt;a href=\"Flayer%20Jungle\"&gt;Flayer Jungle&lt;/a&gt; is connected to the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Forest\"&gt;Spider Forest&lt;/a&gt; and other times you must go through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Marsh\"&gt;Great Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Marsh\"&gt;Great Marsh&lt;/a&gt; is a side area that can be skipped.\u00a0 Try to at least find the waypoint of the area you are in before stopping.\u00a0 The first two goals is to find the two dungeons with the quest items hidden in the jungle.\u00a0 One is the a webbed cave called the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Cavern\"&gt;Spider Cavern&lt;/a&gt; found in the Spider Forest and the other is the dungeon in the &lt;a href=\"Flayer%20Jungle\"&gt;Flayer Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Spider Cavern is almost always found first, and is located in one of the side paths in the Spider Forest.\u00a0 There is an identical looking cavern in this area called the Arachnid Lair which is usually found next to the waypoint, but can be ignored if you so choose. Inside the Spider Cavern cavern you will find the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sszark%20the%20Burning\"&gt;Sszark the Burning&lt;/a&gt;, who will also drop the &lt;a href=\"The%20Golden%20Bird%20%28item%29\"&gt;Golden Bird&lt;/a&gt; in some cases. There is a sparkling chest nearby in the southern corner containing &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Khalim's Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Pick it up, and save it for later.\nEncounters\nYou will encounter &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Stalkers\"&gt;Cloud Stalkers&lt;/a&gt;, blue Blood Hawks, who are fortunately to be found without their spawners.\u00a0 While their charge attack and their regular habit of fleeing when severely damaged can be annoying, they're hardly difficult, even when encountered in groups.\u00a0 There will be &lt;a href=\"Fetish\"&gt;Fetish&lt;/a&gt;es, bigger brothers of the Rat Men you may have encountered in Act I and their respective &lt;a href=\"Fetish%20Shaman\"&gt;Shamans&lt;/a&gt; to be found here as well.\u00a0 While the Fetishes are pretty weak by themselves, in hordes of ten or more, they can be a significant problem.\u00a0 There will also be &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Mosquito\"&gt;Giant Mosquito&lt;/a&gt;es called Suckers, a new foe who will drain stamina, which for now will be little more than an annoyance.\u00a0 Lastly, there could be &lt;a href=\"Thorned%20Hulk\"&gt;Thorned Hulk&lt;/a&gt;s which can be formidable in that they can use their own version of Frenzy and can stun you due to the damage they can do.\nThe Shamans can be quite dangerous if a bit fragile.\u00a0 They are not as active as the Fallen Shamans for resurrecting their slain comrades, but their does a lot of damage, and if you are surrounded by a horde of fetishes, you will have to soak the attack.\u00a0 It can be dodged somewhat by walking in half circles around him when he casts it, so do not hesitate to retreat a bit so their minions cannot surround you and leave you no place to run.\nSzzark the Burning is always spawned with the ability to curse his opponents, and given the large number of minions he has, be a little careful when engaging the pack.\nKhalim's Will, Part 2: Khalim's Brain.\nIt will save the player significant grief to find the waypoint to the Flayer Jungle if the &lt;a href=\"Flayer%20Dungeon\"&gt;Flayer Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; is found first, cast a portal by the dungeon and return to town once the waypoint is found to get back there quickly.\u00a0 Otherwise the player will have to walk back out of all three levels of the Flayer Dungeon.\u00a0 The dungeons are all biased towards the left hand path. Level 3 only has 3 layout variants and one is chosen at random per map generated. The area itself is not generated; each variant is always the same.\nEncounters\nThe Jungle is home to both Flayers and Soul Killers as well as their respective Shamans.\u00a0 You may also occasionally encounter Tentacle Beasts who inhabit the water and can often lob venomous missiles free from inpunity by melee characters.\u00a0 There are also Frog Demons called Slime Princes who can also lob poison at range.\u00a0 The upside is that they are quite easy to kill.\nIn addition to the monsters encountered in this jungle area, the dungeon is home to an undead version of the Fetish which will explode on impact.\u00a0 In normal difficulty, it represents a minor threat, but in later difficulties, the damage from one or two of these is enough to kill even a slightly damaged character.\u00a0 This damage is physical, so it can be blocked.\u00a0 Minions also take no damage from this explosion, and many a solid adventurer makes use of the Desert Mercenary (a barbarian hireling or any of the \"minion skills\" would also suffice) to kill this kind of enemy.\u00a0 It would also be wise to engage them at range if minions are shunned by the player.\u00a0 The &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Endugu\"&gt;Witch Doctor Endugu&lt;/a&gt; guarding the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Chest\"&gt;Golden Chest&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Brain\"&gt;Khalim's Brain&lt;/a&gt; can be tricky. It is best to first lure the melee Flayers out of the room and kill them outside to avoid being surrounded.\nAt the end of the jungle areas, you will find the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stormtree\"&gt;Stormtree&lt;/a&gt;, but he shouldn't be too big a problem, especially if you use a nearby bridge to prevent being flanked and knocked around by his minions.\u00a0 Given the amount of wandering involved in the jungle, tagging the waypoint in Lower Kurast would be advised before quitting your session.\nKurast.\nQuest 4: The Tome of Lam Esen.\nWhile the location of the waypoints are random, the 3 Kurast areas are still easy to navigate, and the exits should be easy to find, always at the upper side, either upper left or upper right.\u00a0 From the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Kurast\"&gt;Lower Kurast&lt;/a&gt; waypoint, make your way toward the right hand part of the screen into to the &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Bazaar\"&gt;Kurast Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, activating the waypoint here, then move on to &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Kurast\"&gt;Upper Kurast&lt;/a&gt; and find its waypoint, then finally to &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt; using its waypoint to move back to Kurast Bazaar.\u00a0 Search around in the Bazaar until you find the Ruined Temple, although it is possible that you'll find the &lt;a href=\"Disused%20Fane\"&gt;Disused Fane&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn't have the quest item, simply keep looking, and the dungeon will surely reveal itself.\u00a0\nIn the Ruined Temple, the large chamber in the middle of this small dungeon has a book stand, clicking on it will drop the tome you seek.\u00a0 Bringing &lt;a href=\"Lam%20Esen%27s%20Tome%20%28item%29\"&gt;Lam Esen's Tome&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Alkor\"&gt;Alkor&lt;/a&gt; completes the quest and grants you 5 extra attribute points.\nEncounters\nIn the general area of Kurast, there will be varieties of &lt;a href=\"Baboon%20Demons\"&gt;Baboon Demons&lt;/a&gt;, s and &lt;a href=\"Faithful\"&gt;Faithful&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 These foes are all moderately intelligent and will tend to flee if they take a lot of damage.\u00a0 There will also be varieties of &lt;a href=\"Thorned%20Hulk\"&gt;Thorned Hulk&lt;/a&gt;s as well as &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Priest\"&gt;Zakarum Priest&lt;/a&gt;s who can cast Blizzard and heal your foes.\u00a0 You can decide to retreat out of range then engage them when they're alone, or attack them directly.\u00a0 There may also be varieties of &lt;a href=\"Vulture%20Demon\"&gt;Vulture Demon&lt;/a&gt;s and/or &lt;a href=\"Leaper\"&gt;Leaper&lt;/a&gt;s which, while not difficult, can be annoying because of their ability to take to the air and escape damage.\nTravincal has &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s that cast &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Cantor\"&gt;Zakarum Priests&lt;/a&gt; that cast &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention the healing ability.\u00a0 Do exercise some caution here as the spells can cause a lot of damage on your way to activating the waypoint in Travincal.\nFor the Ruined Temple, it is best to first clear the side chambers, and the entrance hall before wandering into the chamber with Battlemaid Sarina, who guards the tome. Once you are sure no creature will be attacking you from behind, carefully enter the big room, and wait for the creatures to come to you. Fighting them in the bottleneck formed by the doorway is strategically the best place, so don't hesitate to retreat to the opposite side of a doorway to avoid being outflanked by a group of extra fast opponents.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Extra%20Fast\"&gt;Extra Fast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Battlemaid%20Sarina\"&gt;Battlemaid Sarina&lt;/a&gt; and her gang shouldn't be to much trouble, as long as you don't also have to deal with &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt; casting &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s.\u00a0 The red colored Brutes called Wailing Beasts can be a bit of trouble if there is a large group of them spawned near the doorways.\u00a0 The Spider Magui have a strong poison attack, but at this stage it will just be somewhat of a nuisance as you can just retreat to town and talk to Ormus if the poisoning is too severe.\nKhalim's Will, Part 3: Khalim's Heart.\nWalk outside and find the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Act%20III%29\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt;. There is a chance there are &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Doll\"&gt;Dolls&lt;/a&gt; in this area, although keeping minions and/or a full inventory of potions on your belt will help should that menace be apparent. While you \"can\" run past most mobs here in search for the stairs to level 2, some choose to clear the area just in case they need to backtrack.\nLevel 1 is a huge area and while the entrance to Level 2 is usually along the outer edge, it can also be in the middle on a rare occasion. There is a lever in this area which turns into the stairs, granting you access to Level 2.\u00a0 Level 2 is very small, The &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Chest\"&gt;Golden Chest&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Khalim's Heart&lt;/a&gt; is along the left hand side, just proceed with caution. Click on the chest, grab the heart and retreat back to town after looting the chamber.\nEncounters\nThe sewers can be home to skeletons, mummies, greater mummies, &lt;a href=\"Fiend\"&gt;Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s, one of which is always the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Icehawk%20Riftwing\"&gt;Icehawk Riftwing&lt;/a&gt; and his pack who guard the lever.\u00a0 There can also be undead &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Fetish\"&gt;Bone Fetish&lt;/a&gt;es who can cause significant damage due to their ability to explode on dying, and can be quite lethal if two or three of them are killed in rapid succession.\u00a0 Keep in mind that having a well-maintained Desert Mercenary is often a good choice because hirelings and minions are immune to their damage, and can also be blocked as the damage is entirely physical.\u00a0 Also, having corpse-destroying skills like &lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;Redemption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Vine\"&gt;Carrion Vine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Find%20Item\"&gt;Find Item&lt;/a&gt; will ruin the corpse and prevent its resurrection should a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mummy\"&gt;Horadric Ancient&lt;/a&gt; be in the vicinity.\nThe Council.\nQuest 5:&lt;a href=\"The%20Blackened%20Temple%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Blackened Temple&lt;/a&gt;\nIt is best to first clear a part of &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt; before engaging the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 At this stage of the game, you may need room to withdraw and not face the entire Council at once.\u00a0 Your target is in the grand building on the side opposite to the entrance of the area.\nWhile one could choose to clear the entire area, the place that will serve best is in the middle of Travincal.\u00a0 Once this area is clear of encounters, advance toward the temple.\u00a0 s should appear if the player has attracted the attention of &lt;a href=\"Council%20Members\"&gt;Council Members&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps a few of them might decide to engage you.\u00a0 Withdraw to an area that you've cleared should too many of them charge you at once.\u00a0 Once you've defeated them, take &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Flail\"&gt;Khalim's Flail&lt;/a&gt;, place the organs in the cube and transmute it into &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Will%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Khalim's Will&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 Equip it and take a swing or two at the &lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Orb\"&gt;Compelling Orb&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 Once it is smashed, a staircase will be revealed and open the way to Mephisto's lair.\nEncounters\nThe random monsters you will encounter are s, who have an annoying habit of fleeing from you once they take a lot of damage, &lt;a href=\"Heirophant\"&gt;Heirophant&lt;/a&gt;s, who should be eliminated quickly due to their ability to heal your foes and their and skills.\u00a0 There are also vampires here named &lt;a href=\"Night%20Lord%20%28Vampire%29\"&gt;Night Lords&lt;/a&gt; who can cast &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 Upon destruction of the Compelling Orb, the Zealots will flee from you upon sight.\nYou will find placed monsters near the temple itself.\u00a0 There are four &lt;a href=\"Water%20Watcher\"&gt;Water Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s in the pools near the entrance of the temple, as well as &lt;a href=\"Council%20Members\"&gt;Council Members&lt;/a&gt;, three of whom are unique.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"%20Toorc%20Icefist\"&gt; Toorc Icefist&lt;/a&gt; is cold enchanted and will detonate a upon death.\u00a0 You may want to carry a thawing potion or two just to help get rid of the prolonged effect of being chilled.\u00a0 &lt;a href=\"Geleb%20Flamefinger\"&gt;Geleb Flamefinger&lt;/a&gt; is fire enchanted and had a reputation of being lethal when his body exploded upon death, although this has been nerfed since, and &lt;a href=\"Ismail%20Vilehand\"&gt;Ismail Vilehand&lt;/a&gt; who can inflict an &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; curse which makes him dangerous if you're fighting a number of foes.\nMany will return here due to the fact it is an easy area to reach once the Travincal waypoint is obtained and the three super unique monsters have a better than average chance to drop decent loot and an unusual amount of gold which can be used for gambling or resurrecting your hireling.\nQuest 6: The Guardian.\nIt is generally quicker to follow the left-hand wall for the first two levels.\u00a0 It will also save a lot of walking to discover the waypoint on level 2.\u00a0 Level 3 is always the same, and is generally easier and quite profitable to defeat all foes here.\u00a0 First clear the entrance room following the left-handed wall, to make sure that if creatures are spawned here, they won't be adding to your grief while you engage the rest.\nEncounters.\nThe Durance itself can be home to Vampires called &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Lord%20%28Vampire%29\"&gt;Blood Lords&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom can cast Meteor.\u00a0 The former can spawn in the first two levels while the latter is found in level 3.\u00a0 Blunderbores called &lt;a href=\"Mauler\"&gt;Mauler&lt;/a&gt;s can also be found in the first two levels and while they possess a stun attack, they are also somewhat slow and can easily be put into hit recovery, just don't allow yourself to face too many at one time.\u00a0 There are also mummies called &lt;a href=\"Cadaver\"&gt;Cadaver&lt;/a&gt;s which spawn a Poison Nova upon dying, but generally speaking is merely an annoyance than a legitimate threat.\u00a0 Lastly, &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Doll\"&gt;Stygian Doll&lt;/a&gt;s can be one of the monsters that you can face, and although they are problematic due to the hefty amount of damage they can do upon death, having a high block or a minion/hireling to distract them and land the killing strike while the player helps whittle down their health bar and stay out of range of the explosion a lot easier to manage.\nOn level three, Vampires, Stygian Dolls, &lt;a href=\"Council%20Member\"&gt;Council Member&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; are the only monsters that spawn in this area.\u00a0 The first, &lt;a href=\"Bremm%20Sparkfist\"&gt;Bremm Sparkfist&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in this area is either on the small stroke right in front of the door in the middle or on the stroke to the right side of the pool of blood, depending on where he is, either lure him out and defeat him in the entrance room, or first clear some creatures to the left of the doorway a bit, then engage him.\u00a0 The other 2 Council Members, &lt;a href=\"Maffer%20Dragonhand\"&gt;Maffer Dragonhand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wyand%20Voidbringer\"&gt;Wyand Voidbringer&lt;/a&gt; are respectively in the right and left part of the level. Check the individual information and decide which would be easier to defeat, or you can kill both for the loot and the experience points.\nOnce you are done with all that, you can approach &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of the back room. Either get up close quickly, and he won't use his skull orb as often, don't forget to retreat to town as necessary should you run out of potions.\u00a0 More often than not, he becomes fixated on a minion such as a hireling or a Golem and will allow you to attack with little opportunity for retribution.\u00a0 He can, however, change his mind, so keep your health and that of your minion at least half full.\nAnother tactic is the moat trick. Lure him towards the moat and quickly move around to the other side; if done correctly, he will be effectively stuck on the other side of the river. You can move to just out of range (find some mark where he won\u00b4t attack you), and attack him with the right ranged attack, from off screen, as long as you have a lock on him.\u00a0\nBe sure to check the article for additional information, and don't forget to go through the portal before quitting your session, otherwise you'll have to repeat this section again.\nAct IV.\nYou begin the game's fourth and shortest Act in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, along with the following four NPCs:\nAttribute Distribution.\nWhile saving twenty points or so is not a bad idea, having a strength score of at least 60 is a good idea due to the fact plated belts offer the largest potion capacity, while melee-oriented and close range casters may wish to go higher depending on what armor they are able to find.\u00a0 While keeping 20 points for emergencies is not a bad idea in and of itself, do not be afraid to spend points in Vitality should you find that your enemies take large chunks out of your health globe.\u00a0 While Dexterity can boost the chance to block, only a bowazon should have their dexterity higher than their vitality.\u00a0 Spending in energy is generally frowned upon due to the fact mana potions are easy to find, however, putting occasional points in Energy shouldn't wreck a build.\nWhat items to look for.\nWhat was stated in Act 2 and Act 3 about items applies in Act 4.\u00a0 Boosting resistances for all characters is important, mostly because it is an easy way to take a lot of pain out of many attacks, and the massive damage Diablo's elemental attacks could very easily end in tragedy, especially in hardcore.\u00a0 While lightning is still painful should Burning Souls spawn in the Plains of Despair, fire is no less a danger.\u00a0\nAgain, each playstyle will have additional attributes to look out for.\u00a0 Melee, for example will find bonuses to attack speed, faster hit recovery and life/mana leech to be helpful attributes, as well as some source of cold damage to take advantage of the slowdown caused by cold damage.\u00a0 Cannot Be Frozen and Crushing Blow are also desirable, it is often difficult to discover those items or their components before Act 5. One could do repeated runs to the Countess and other bosses to find Amn, Tir, Shael and Eth runes, especially if someone is playing solo on hardcore.\u00a0 Amn and Tir will make Strength in a 2-socket melee weapon, while Shael and Eth in a 2 socket shield will grant Rhyme.\nClose-range casters such as elemental druids and hammerdins should definitely look for Faster Hit Recovery, mana bonuses and Faster Cast Rate items.\nCasters and summoners can keep an eye out for items that will boost their skills.\u00a0\nAmazons of either bow or javelin can also find value in Increased Attack Speed, mana/life leech and having some source of cold damage, whether that is a charm, gem or weapon attribute.\nWhile some frown upon hirelings, a well maintained one will mean the difference between life and death.\u00a0 They can distract difficult opponents which gives you time to inflict damage before they bring their attention on you.\u00a0 Rogues will provide a lot of benefit with Increased Attack Speed, Life Leech and cold damage, even if they use a frost arrow attack often.\u00a0 The Desert Mercenary will benefit from not only strong armor and a good spear/polearm, but also Faster Hit Recovery, Increased Attack Speed and Life Leech as well as resistances.\u00a0 Iron Wolves will benefit most from items that have Faster Cast Rate and generic +skills.\nQuest 1: The Fallen Angel.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act IV without this quest done.\nThe Outer Steppes.\nStarting in this area, it\u00b4s best to stay close to the edge to limit the amount of monsters you'll encounter.\u00a0 If you are strong enough, this is a good area to grind for experience points from level 20-29, just don't be afraid to withdraw if you should wind up swarmed by too many monsters.\u00a0 If you should really wind up in over your head and have a huge mob of enemies at the entrance from the Pandemonium Fortress and no way to reach your corpse to retrieve your gear, you can simply quit and try your luck again.\nEncounters\nMana-draining Finger Mages called &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Mage\"&gt;Doom Mages&lt;/a&gt; which have missiles that will chase you for a significant distance before sputtering out, but do so little damage that they could be ignored; these enemies are quite fragile as well.\u00a0 There are also s who will consume corpses and launch globs of entrails that can cause serious damage.\u00a0 There is also a form of &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Lurker\"&gt;Leaper&lt;/a&gt; here as well as the first level of Oblivion Knights, &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Knight\"&gt;Doom Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, who do not have a missile attack like their brethren, but can cause some serious damage to the poorly equipped; Megademons named &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Lord\"&gt;Venom Lord&lt;/a&gt;s which have a high level Inferno as well as being capable of serious melee attacks as well as having a lot of hit points.\u00a0 Lastly, there is also the possibility of encountering a Vile Mother called a &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Spawner\"&gt;Flesh Spawner&lt;/a&gt; who can not only dish out damage, they can also take significant damage and spawn &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Beast\"&gt;minions&lt;/a&gt; which can overwhelm players and distract some builds like the &lt;a href=\"Zealot%20%28Build%29\"&gt;Zealot&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Plains of Despair.\nWhen you find stairs to the &lt;a href=\"Plains%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Plains of Despair&lt;/a&gt;, the player can choose to look for Izual, or continue on to next area &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;City of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; and activate that waypoint.\u00a0 You will know that you are close to him, when the Quest log will start to shine.\u00a0 General information on &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; will be listed in the Encounters section just below, and be sure to visit the article on him to read additional information for defeating him.\u00a0 Again, stick to the sides, have good elemental resistances and don't be afraid to withdraw when necessary, this area might be a little long to complete, but it is not impossible if you don't try to rush to the next exit or to discover Izual.\u00a0 Visit Tyrael after you speak with Izual's freed spirit, and he will bestow you 2 free skill points.\nEncounters\nHigh lightning and fire resistance come recommended in this place as there are monsters which tend to use heavy damage fire and lightning-based effects.\u00a0 Wisps called Burning Souls and any the foes from the last area have a possibility of spawning here.\nLike any boss, get Izual alone by killing the monsters around him first, or manage to retreat to a safe area to focus on him. His damage is low, but has a huge amount of hit points. It won't hurt to take along some thawing potions as he can emit frost novas, which have a very potent chill effect, as it is doubtful you are fortunate enough to have found or constructed some item that will grant immunity to freezing.\nQuest 2: Hell's Forge.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act IV without this quest done.\nThe City of the Damned.\nThe &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;City of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; will typically have the stairs somewhere in the middle of plains. Next to the stairs there will be a waypoint, so don\u00b4t forget to get it.\u00a0 As with the previous areas, it is not recommended to rush around looking for the exit, but to use the terrain to your advantage as it will make it easier to withdraw should you encounter a large mob of foes.\nEncounters\nThe Demons you encountered in Act 1 will be found here, appropriately called the &lt;a href=\"Damned\"&gt;Damned&lt;/a&gt;, with a lightning attack that matches their bite.\u00a0 There are also upgraded versions of &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Hag\"&gt;Vile Mothers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Spitter\"&gt;Regurgitators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strangler\"&gt;Finger Mages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knights&lt;/a&gt;, and .\u00a0 Of note is the Abyss Knight will tend to hang back and use a ranged elemental attack which is indicated by the glow on their hand; orange for a fire attack, green for a poison bolt, etc.\nThe River of Flame, Part 1: To the Waypoint and Back..\nIn the River of Flame, the path to the Chaos Sanctuary will be found almost always to the north.\u00a0 Continue progressing in a northerly direction until the waypoint is discovered.\u00a0 Most often, Hellforge will be discovered when you backtrack toward the east.\u00a0 It is not unheard of, however to find its location to the west of the waypoint.\u00a0\nThe forge is inhabited by the superunique boss Hephasto who needs to be defeated to obtain the hammer that will shatter Mephisto's Soulstone.\u00a0 After killing him, click on the forge, and if you have Mephisto\u00b4s soulstone in your either inventory or stash, it will be placed on the forge. Then equip the hammer from smith and smash the stone. After doing so, various gems and a rune will drop from of the forge.\nEncounters\nIn this area, players can encounter more monsters from the previous area: &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Knights\"&gt;Abyss Knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stranglers\"&gt;Stranglers&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0s, and more powerful versions of Vile Mothers called s and Regurgitators named &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Fiend\"&gt;Maw Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A few monster types from Act 2 appear here as well.\u00a0 Blunderbores called &lt;a href=\"Urdar\"&gt;Urdar&lt;/a&gt; with powerful attacks as well as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Maggot\"&gt;Blood Maggot&lt;/a&gt;s which will chip away at the health of the player and their allies with poison attacks and minions from the eggs that they will spawn.\n&lt;a href=\"Hephasto\"&gt;Hephasto&lt;/a&gt; has a number of enchantments, one of which being a random offensive aura.\u00a0 It is recommended to engage him alone rather than deal with minions who might be supported by whatever aura is manifested by him.\u00a0 Upon death, he will drop some random items and the &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Forge%20Hammer\"&gt;Hell Forge Hammer&lt;/a&gt; if the &lt;a href=\"Hell%27s%20Forge%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Hell Forge quest&lt;/a&gt; is not completed.\nQuest 3: Terror's End.\nRiver of Flame, Part 2.\nNow head to the River of Flame waypoint and go past Hadriel to the moat passage. This is a random maze, but is not incredibly wide.\u00a0 Usage of Teleport or other mobility skills like Leap Attack can make this simpler, but there are notable monsters, so take that into consideration while you ply your way across the passage.\nEncounters\nThe same monsters the player encountered in the previous area can also be found in this part as well.\u00a0 The \"fighter-mage\" version of the Abyss Knight, Urdar and Grotesques tend to be the most difficult monsters, but if a player is willing to withdraw when it looks like they will be overwhelmed, this section should not be overly difficult.\nThe Chaos Sanctuary.\nBuilt like a cathedral, the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Chaos Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; is shaped like a Latin cross, with side passages near the far end.\u00a0 The most secure route is to clear all the monsters on both sides of the obstacles as you make your way to the middle of the area with the large pentagram in the floor.\u00a0 The finger mages have a habit of hovering inside the obstacle which can be quite annoying if you are depending on minions for support.\u00a0 There are 5 seals to be broken to trigger the final encounter: Two on the left, two on the right, and one can be found behind the star. Continue to clear the area, withdrawing to a safer area should the numbers of monsters prove intimidating, and open them as you discover them. Off to the left, one of the seals will release a group of &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Mage\"&gt;storm casters&lt;/a&gt;, their leader being the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Vizier%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Grand Vizier of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. The lone seal to the north will release &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Knight\"&gt;Abyss Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, lead by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20de%20Seis\"&gt;Lord de Seis&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, one of the seals to the right of the area will spawn s who are lead by the &lt;a href=\"Infector%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Infector of Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 After killing them all (which can be tough for some characters), The screen shakes and brightens a bit and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; will say: \"Not even death can save you from me!\"\u00a0 He will appear suddenly in the middle of the pentagram with one short objective for the character:\u00a0 Kill Diablo.\u00a0 Depending on the player's luck, skill and determination, Diablo will be defeated and the character will be able to move on to the next &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;difficulty level&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 If the expansion is installed, the player can take a portal that Tyrael opens to move on to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Act 5&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the third &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;.\nEncounters\nThe player will encounter &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Caster\"&gt;Storm Caster&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Lord\"&gt;Venom Lord&lt;/a&gt;s in the Chaos Sanctuary.\u00a0 They will also find Oblivion Knights in the form of &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Knight\"&gt;Doom Knight&lt;/a&gt;s often supported by a caster aptly named the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knight&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 The latter monster has the following skills: Necromancer &lt;a href=\"Curses\"&gt;curses&lt;/a&gt; (one of which was &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;, but was removed in a recent patch), a missile attack in the form of an element related to the color of the aura around its hands or a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spirit\"&gt;Bone Spirit&lt;/a&gt; that will track its victim for a long time and do fairly significant magic damage.\nAs mentioned above, one seal on each side will generate a group led by a super unique monster, the other seal on\u00a0 each side will not do anything more than light up.\u00a0 Of the three groups, &lt;a href=\"Infector%20of%20Souls\"&gt;The Infector of Souls&lt;/a&gt; is often the harder one if you have one seal that is reached by twice turning a corner, as it is quite difficult to evade being mobbed by a group of extra fast Inferno-casting demons capable of also inflicting significant physical damage.\u00a0 In this case, if you do not have the advantage of mobility to escape, retreat to town and take a walk from the waypoint.\u00a0 &lt;a href=\"Lord%20de%20Seis\"&gt;Lord de Seis&lt;/a&gt; can be a contender for toughest as he usually spawns with a &lt;a href=\"Fanaticism\"&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt; aura and often runs away should the player attempt to engage him close.\u00a0 The perk to facing the Oblivion Knights is that even with the benefit of a Fanaticism aura they are often quite a bit slower than Infector's group and so you can evade them to take them in smaller numbers at a time and out of range of his aura.\u00a0 If you save the group you dislike for the last and break all the seals before killing its leader, defeating that miniboss will cause all monsters in the area to suddenly die and the game will spawn Diablo in the middle of the large pentagram.\u00a0 Don't forget, however, that you can prepare yourself if you were running low on potions, etc. before facing him.\nDiablo, for practically any player with gear found by playing just that character will likely find it the toughest fight in the game.\u00a0 The first time, that is.\u00a0 While there is plenty of advice based on your play style, it boils down mostly to \"attack and be ready to evade based on what attack he's attempting to use.\u00a0 Retreat to town whenever you are in danger.\"\u00a0 Once you've gone on and gained ten levels, Diablo won't be quite as difficult to overcome as he was the first time.\u00a0 The article on Diablo also has additional tips based on what character you are playing.\nAct V.\nTaking the portal from Act IV will transport you to the foot of Mount Arreat in the village of Harrogath.\nThe NPCs that will assist you are:\nQuest 1: Siege on Harrogath.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act V without this quest done.\nAlthough Larzuk can activate this quest, it can be completed without ever speaking with him.\u00a0 He tasks you to prove your mettle by killing the monster in charge of the siege on Harrogath. It\u00b4s quite a long walk, but during normal difficulty it should not prove to be overly difficult, if tedious.\u00a0 Perhaps the simplest way to navigate is to stay close to one side of the area, navigating up steps and blockades, engaging enemies as the player sees fit.\u00a0 You will encounter a narrowed pass half way through the area, and finally a long staircase to the next area, the Frigid Highlands.\nThis quest is completed by killing &lt;a href=\"Shenk%20the%20Overseer\"&gt;Shenk the Overseer&lt;/a&gt; located on the farthest side of this area, creating a shower of elemental attacks to rain down and all monsters within range of these attacks will likely die.\u00a0 You can continue up the stairs where there will be a waypoint that will provide quick transit to town.\u00a0\nReturn to Larzuk for your reward - he will add sockets to an unsocketed weapon, helmet, body armor or shield of your choice. Like the Malus quest, do not feel obligated to use the reward if there is nothing particularly good in your possession at the moment and simply return to redeem the quest when you do (for example, putting a socket in Cleglaw's Claw would be a bad decision, as its usefulness is pretty much tapped out by now).\u00a0 This quest can add a socket to rare, set and unique items.\u00a0 It can also be used to put a random number of sockets in superior white or superior stock ethereal items, something that cannot be done with the Horadric Cube.\nEncounters\nThe monsters in Act V are certainly unique in their abilities and add variety as well as atmosphere.\u00a0 Firstly, the player has allies, for however long by randomly encountering barbarian warriors who, in spite being hoplessly outnumbered will fight valiantly.\u00a0\u00a0 They can benefit from party-friendly skills such as &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Orders\"&gt;Battle Orders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prayer\"&gt;Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike your hireling, cannot benefit from healing potions.\u00a0 Without assistance, their lifespan is often very short.\nThe player can encounter several monster types with unique abilities.\u00a0\u00a0 Although the &lt;a href=\"Enslaved\"&gt;Enslaved&lt;/a&gt; are pretty run-of-the-mill melee oriented monsters, a player can also encounter quick &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Imp\"&gt;Demon Imp&lt;/a&gt;s which teleport and throw fireballs, and are also thankfully low on hit points.\u00a0 There are also &lt;a href=\"Death%20Mauler\"&gt;Death Mauler&lt;/a&gt;s, who can also utilize a melee attack, but earn a reputation for their ranged attack which is firing tentacles in the ground to erupt and damage a distant target.\u00a0 As long as their target is moving, this does not prove to be a problem, as they will erupt at a destination based on where their target was when the attack was initiated.\u00a0 If someone is caught in one place, however, could prove to be fatal if Maulers are encountered in groups.\u00a0\nThere is also the chance to encounter &lt;a href=\"Lasher\"&gt;Lasher&lt;/a&gt;s, apparently commanding the legions of Enslaved.\u00a0 They are fairly durable, but are not directly dangerous.\u00a0 They can grant the Enslaved with a damage buff, or mutate them into a &lt;a href=\"Suicide%20Minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt; that can explode for a significant amount of damage, and also has a chill effect that will last for a second or two.\u00a0 They also have other skills such as Attract and an ability to heal Enslaved, although these are used much less often.\u00a0 Lastly, there are demonic catapults which will rain down random elemental attacks.\u00a0 They are extremely durable, but at melee range, they are quite helpless and can be easily dispatched upon closing in on their location.\u00a0 The suicide minions can be quite dangrous, but take a half second to explode, so remaining mobile can cause them to ineffectively detonate.\u00a0 Party minions and hirelings also take no damage from the effect.\nThere are two super uniques the player can encounter in this area.\u00a0 The first is &lt;a href=\"Dac%20Farren\"&gt;Dac Farren&lt;/a&gt;, a Cold-Enchanted Demon Imp halfway through the area and\u00a0 &lt;a href=\"Shenk%20the%20Overseer\"&gt;Shenk the Overseer&lt;/a&gt;, a Lasher.\u00a0 Shenk, will be surrounded by a large crowd of Enslaved minions, and he will waste no time making mobile explosives out of them.\nQuest 2: Rescue on Mount Arreat.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act V without this quest done.\nYou may have noticed, that after entering the Frigid Highlands, the Quest Log started to shine. Talk to Qual-Kehk for more information. You are asked to free 15 soldiers in Frigid Highlands. Simply roam through Highlands and look for fortresses in which are wooden prisons with 5 barbarians inside. Simply destroy the cage door, and barbarians will take town portal to get away. Find 3 of these cages and return to Qual-Kehk for a reward. He will give you three runes - &lt;a href=\"Tal\"&gt;Tal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ral\"&gt;Ral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ort\"&gt;Ort&lt;/a&gt;. If you decide to place them into a 3-socket shield in order of: Ral-Ort-Tal, you will create an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%27s%20Pledge%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Ancient's Pledge Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; which can provide good resistance bonuses, but a player can certainly choose not to use the runes immediately and save them for something else. Additionally, you are able to hire barbarians in Harrogath from now on.\nEncounters\nYou can encounter two types of Demon Imps and a Monster called a Crush Beast that allows them to use more damaging fire attacks by letting them sit in the basket mounted on their backs.\u00a0\u00a0 They can annoy the player with their war stomp that causes the screen to shake as well as a significant melee attack.\u00a0 As in the previous area, there are also fortified towers that also let the Demon Imps utilize more powerful fire-based skills and provide significant damage absorption before collapsing.\u00a0 As well, Death Maulers and Enslaved can also be found in this area.\nThis area hosts three super-unique monsters:\u00a0 Eldritch the Rectifier who can always be encountered a short distance from the waypoint in this area as well as Sharptooth Slayer, an Overlord with a number of Enslaved minions always found near one of the prisons.\u00a0 The third is a Death Mauler called Eyeback the Unleashed, always found at the end of the area, just before the Plateau.\nQuest 3: Prison of Ice.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act V without this quest done.\nThis quest will activate on completion of the previous one, but can be accomplished without ever talking to Malah.\u00a0 She says that the alchemist Anya has been missing and wants you to find her.\u00a0 Although she has no clues to her location, the quest log tells the player to search the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20River\"&gt;Frozen River&lt;/a&gt; underneath the &lt;a href=\"Crystalline%20Passage\"&gt;Crystalline Passage&lt;/a&gt; to find her.\u00a0 Continue to the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Plateau\"&gt;Arreat Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, and although it is not necessary, tagging the waypoint in this area can dramatically shorten your travel time should you wind up dying in one of the areas further on.\u00a0\nAt the farthest end of the Plateau, the player will encounter the entrance to the Crystalline Passage, a subterranean area which needs to be passed through to complete the next quests.\u00a0 There is also a waypoint here which would be worth finding as it can sometimes be a long walk from the Plateau, or worse, from the Frigid Highlands.\u00a0 The entrance to the dungeon that makes the Frozen River is always guarded by a pack of champion monsters, and like the stairs in the Catacombs of Act 1, are never to be found against a wall.\u00a0 There will also be an exit somewhere in this area to the next subterranean area named the &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Trail\"&gt;Glacial Trail&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Frozen River itself is a random, winding maze which looks like the Crystalline Passage.\u00a0 Anya will be found at the end of this maze, and will ask you to help her.\u00a0 Return to town and speak with Malah, ensuring that you have an open box in your inventory for the special thawing potion which will remove Nihilathak's curse.\u00a0 Return and click on Anya, she will activate her own town portal and escape to Harrogath.\u00a0 When you return to town, Malah will have the reward of a permanent +10% bonus to your resistances.\u00a0 It takes the form of a 2 x 2 scroll and is activated like the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Skill\"&gt;Book of Skill&lt;/a&gt; that Radament drops.\u00a0 Speak also with Anya, she will reward you with a rare class-specific item for your character.\nEncounters\nThe Arreat Plateau in normal difficulty has very few types of monsters.\u00a0 The player will face &lt;a href=\"Lasher\"&gt;Lasher&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Baal%27s%20Minion\"&gt;Slayers&lt;/a&gt;, slightly more potent versions of the ones found in The Frigid Highlands.\u00a0 There may also be &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Imp\"&gt;Demon Imp&lt;/a&gt;s if their spawners exist here as well as a superuniqe &lt;a href=\"Crush%20Beast\"&gt;Crush Beast&lt;/a&gt; named Thresh Socket to be found at the end of the area.\nIn the Crystalline Passage, there will be found a few brand new monsters.\u00a0 There will be &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Horror\"&gt;Frozen Horror&lt;/a&gt;s who have an &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Blast\"&gt;Arctic Blast&lt;/a&gt; attack as well as a melee attack and always shatter when killed as well as a possibility of encountering a Wendigo-like creature called an &lt;a href=\"Abominable\"&gt;Abominable&lt;/a&gt; who can do massive damage as well as inflict cold damage and knockback.\u00a0 There are Succubi named &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Harlot\"&gt;Stygian Harlot&lt;/a&gt;s often cast a curse that halves the victim's defense or a curse that causes the victim to damage themselves when their maximum mana is greater than their maximum life.\u00a0 There can also be encountered a Minotaur-like monster named a &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Lord\"&gt;Moon Lord&lt;/a&gt; who can not only do significant damage, but can also activate a skill to make themselves much more dangerous.\nLastly, the Frozen River is home to many monsters, but mostly varieties of the ones found in the Crystalline Passage.\u00a0 Aside from monsters very similar to the previous areas, it will be possible to encounter a self-resurrecting zombie called a &lt;a href=\"Rot%20Walker\"&gt;Rot Walker&lt;/a&gt; who can charge and knock the player around.\u00a0 Avoid attracting the attention of a group and it won't be terribly difficult.\u00a0 If they resurrect themselves, however, they can be killed again for loot and experience unless their corpse is ruined.\nThere is one superunique and his pack guarding Anya's prison.\u00a0 &lt;a href=\"Frozenstein\"&gt;Frozenstein&lt;/a&gt; is always spawned with the mods &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Enchanted\"&gt;Cold Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt;, so keep that in mind when you reach the end of the cavern.\nQuest 4: Betrayal of Harrogath.\nThis quest is optional. You can complete Act V without this quest done.\nThis can be one of the most dangerous quests in Diablo II where one-hit fatalties can happen surprisingly often. The red portal Anya opens will bring youto &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak%27s%20Temple\"&gt;Nihlathak's Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 It is recommended to simply run into the temple entrance before the corpses of Prowling Dead awaken and potentially make you victim to multiple charge attacks.\u00a0 Take the entrance to the first halls.\u00a0 Find the stairs, but be a little careful as there can be large groups of Prowling Dead who may be able to stunlock a player if they decide to charge in rapid succession.\u00a0\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Halls of Pain&lt;/a&gt; there is next entrance, but a waypoint as well. Consider taking this waypoint more than any other waypoint in game, because once taking this waypoint and completing this quest, the red portal will no longer be open for you, and killing Pindleskin for loot (because he's a level 85 monster in Hell difficulty and can technically drop any item in the game) will be a much more difficult option. When playing online, however, &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; can drop the Key of Destruction, an item for &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Tristram\"&gt;\u00dcber Tristram&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 It will depend on character and priorities, if the chance to find keys is more important, then it would be recommended to take the waypoint and save some time when \"farming\" keys.\nWhen you finally find the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Vaught\"&gt;Halls of Vaught&lt;/a&gt;, The area looks like big cross, where the entrance is in the middle. On the one end of the four beams of cross, there is Nihlathak with his army of hell spawns. To save the player some time (especially on Hell difficulty), there is a clue to his location that can be determined by the placement of a particular wall tile that looks like a pair of red eyes.\u00a0 Whenever the tile appears in one of the areas marked with the green panel, he can be found down that particular section.\nUpon his defeat, he will die in quite a spectacular fashion and a portal will open to the surface.\u00a0 Anya will reward you with the ability to personalize an armor or weapon of your choice and close the red portal.\u00a0 When playing on Battle.net, keep in mind that personalized items will not trade for as much as an item without a character's nametag.\nEncounters\nThe temple entrance has two types of Reanimated Dead, the &lt;a href=\"Prowling%20Dead\"&gt;Prowling Dead&lt;/a&gt; scattered all around the grounds, and the single group of &lt;a href=\"Defiled%20Warrior\"&gt;Defiled Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s lead by &lt;a href=\"Pindleskin\"&gt;Pindleskin&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 The &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Halls of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; can have &lt;a href=\"Night%20Lord%20%28Act%20V%29\"&gt;Night Lords&lt;/a&gt; as well as Prowling Dead.\u00a0 Though the Prowling Dead are not dangerous by themselves, they are often encountered in groups of four to six and have a habit of chaining charge attacks.\u00a0 Continue on to find the Halls of Pain, home to &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Corpse\"&gt;Unholy Corpse&lt;/a&gt;s, but also have &lt;a href=\"Death%20Brawler\"&gt;Death Brawler&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Putrid%20Defiler\"&gt;Putrid Defiler&lt;/a&gt;s.\u00a0 Find the stairs and discover the Halls of Vaught, where &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; is waiting for you.\nHe has a variety of skills, namely Summon Minion, and &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Blast\"&gt;Arctic Blast&lt;/a&gt;, but in Nightmare and Hell, he is most famous for his &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt; ability which can take out even a strong character in two shots.\u00a0 In Normal difficulty, ranged attacks, avoiding slain monsters or some means of consuming corpses can help mitigate this problem, especially if you try to remain close to him and keep your attacks focused.\u00a0 In later difficulties, the area becomes too cluttered with organic landmines and makes it terribly risky, so the player can attempt to remain focused on Nihlathak and keep an eye on your minions/hirelings to make sure that they are also focused on Nihilathak (such as the sorceress using teleport and ensuring that their hireling is not trying to kill a minion).\u00a0 Another suggestion, especially with area-of-effect skills is to have an item with the \"Slain Monsters Rest in Peace\" attribute such as Nature's Peace to ensure that anything slain by the player isn't going to be turned into a one hit fatality.\u00a0 Your minions don't count as part of that, so keep an eye on them to make sure that they don't kill anything before Nihlathak is slain.\u00a0 Having corpse-consuming skills will work, but they are not foolproof so use extra care to make sure that there are none near you.\nQuest 5: Rite of Passage.\nTake a breath, restock your potions and ready yourself.\u00a0 Return to the &lt;a href=\"Crystalline%20Passage\"&gt;Crystalline Passage&lt;/a&gt; and proceed to the exit that will take you to the &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Trail\"&gt;Glacial Trail&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 There is a dungeon that might be worth exploring, but that is optional.\u00a0 Like the Passage, there is a waypoint here which should be activated to cut down on travel time should the character die en route to the next area.\u00a0 Continue on (or return) to the exit and begin the trek through the Frozen Tundra.\u00a0 Laid out like the Bloody Foothills and Frigid Highlands, there will periodically be sections with mazelike walls and destructible barriers.\u00a0 Outside of the waypoint, there is a stock dungeon here like the other overland areas marked by a red portal, but there is nothing out-of-the-ordinary to be found here.\u00a0 Once the player reaches the end of the area, you will be returned to another subterranean area, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients%27%20Way\"&gt;Ancient's Way&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 There is a waypoint which should be activated if the Ancients should prove too much for the character, but its dungeon, the &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Cellar\"&gt;Icy Cellar&lt;/a&gt; is completely optional.\nOnce the waypoint is activated and the exit is discovered, return to town and prepare.\u00a0 When you are ready, return and activate a town portal outside the exit should the Ancients be lucky and suddenly kill the character.\u00a0 The &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Summit\"&gt;Summit&lt;/a&gt; is a small area with three statues and an altar in the middle.\u00a0 Click on the altar, their monologue will start, and upon reaching the end of their speech, the statues will turn into opponents and perhaps the toughest battle in the game will begin.\u00a0 General strategies will be mentioned in the encounters section below, but more class specific information will be given in the articles on the &lt;a href=\"Ancients\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt; should the player be seeking it.\u00a0\nWhen the dust settles and the player defeats the Ancients, they are awarded a very significant experience bonus, enough that a level 23 character can lose a part of it due to the cap on how much can be gained in a single encounter.\u00a0 If someone has walked through the game, this should not be an issue, but people who are rushed through will often wait until they have gained level 24 before attempting this quest.\u00a0 Those in a bigger hurry still need to be at least level 20 to successfully complete this quest.\u00a0 Once this quest is complete, the portcullis on the other side of the area will be unlocked and the players can begin their final quest of the game.\nEncounters\nIn the Glacial Trail, the player can encounter &lt;a href=\"Abominable\"&gt;Abominable&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Slasher\"&gt;Death Slasher&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Terror\"&gt;Frozen Terror&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Reanimated%20Horde\"&gt;Reanimated Horde&lt;/a&gt;s.\u00a0 Follow previous advice regarding these monsters.\u00a0 Generally speaking, avoid having large groups of these monsters attack you at once and the trouble should be minimal.\u00a0 There is a unique Reanimated Horde and his minions somewhere named &lt;a href=\"Bonesaw%20Breaker\"&gt;Bonesaw Breaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Frozen Tundra, the only monsters to be encountered are &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Imp\"&gt;Demon Imp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Crush%20Beast\"&gt;Crush Beast&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Catapult\"&gt;Catapult&lt;/a&gt;s so while it may be annoying, the encounters shouldn't be too difficult.\u00a0 The Ancient's Way is home to more Death Slashers, Frozen Terrors called Frozen Horrors, &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Lord\"&gt;Moon Lord&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn terms of general strategy when fighting the Ancients, it is a good idea to attempt to separate one of your foes from the other two.\u00a0 There is an exception: summoner necromancers, who should have sufficient minions to keep them from being too much at a time, as long as curses are properly applied.\u00a0 Although mileage will vary, &lt;a href=\"Madawc\"&gt;Madawc&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Korlic\"&gt;Korlic&lt;/a&gt; are usually the first ones to break away.\u00a0 As long as there is some source of cold damage and/or some sort of stun effect as smite or knockback, repeated hits will render them mostly harmless.\u00a0 &lt;a href=\"Talic%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Talic's&lt;/a&gt; Whirlwind skill may not be as dangerous as it is in Nightmare or Hell difficulty, but the skill has multiple hits, so if you are engaging Talic in melee, take a few seconds to stop attacking when he breaks out that skill and let as many hits as possible be rendered as misses.\u00a0 If the player has a melee hireling, having as many healing/rejuvenation potions in your inventory and giving them to him as necessary can help take the edge off the difficulty of this encounter.\u00a0 As well, keeping that hireling maintained with the best items that you can make all the difference when you face the Ancients.\nQuest 6: Eve of Destruction.\nWith the Ancients defeated, the player can take a moment to restock their character and allocate stat/skill points as necessary before venturing too far into the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20Keep\"&gt;Worldstone Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 Inside, it will be the same situation as it was in the Ancient's Way:\u00a0 Keep large groups from overwhelming you, utilizing crowd control measures or withdrawing to a safer area should you wind up in that situation.\u00a0 Explore the area, keeping a lookout on the map for reddish markings of the staircase platform.\u00a0 It will be similar with Level 2, only there is a waypoint to be found, and it would be recommended to find it before moving on to Level 3.\u00a0 Avoid standing in one place for too long in this area, as Baal will activate traps of lightning and poison, punctuated by his trademark laughter, and while the traps will cause significant damage to stationary characters, this is much more for atmospheric tension than it is an attempt to kill the characters.\u00a0 The only thing of note for Level 3 will be the stairs to the Throne of Destruction.\nWhile the final leg of this journey can be most easily handled by staying in the middle corridors, as the Blood Lords will attempt to engage you in melee, and the Stygian furies will ignore you if you move out of sight unless they decide to close with the player.\u00a0 It can, however, be cleared as there will be good experience to be gained from characters with level 35-45 and being able to withdraw to these areas may be desirable should the minions in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Throne of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; be too much to defeat.\u00a0 The chamber can be quite a difficult place for a solo character walking the game, so a player may decide to draw foes into the lower part of the chamber or even further so foes may be engaged without the &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt; curse that Baal will regularly cast to further hinder melee/minion based character builds.\nOnce the chamber is cleared of monsters, the final stage begins.\u00a0 Baal will unleash five waves of opponents representative of the previous four Acts and a final unique monster type for Act 5, all detailed in the next section.\u00a0 If the player encounters too much trouble, they can engage the monsters in these waves further back toward the entrance.\u00a0 It would be recommended to defeat them not only for the experience, but should &lt;a href=\"Lister%20The%20Tormentor\"&gt;Lister&lt;/a&gt; and his pack prove to be too much for the player, they can circumvent that encounter by opening a town portal near Baal and enticing the pack to follow the player back to the entrance of the area and retreat to town, taking the town portal to the chamber and opening the way for the final encounter: &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nIn general terms, persistence and retreating to town when necessary will always prove to be the main key to a player's success, although there are some tips in the article on Baal as well as in the section below.\u00a0 Once he is defeated, Tyrael will appear over his corpse and open a portal which will provide a proper exit from Act 5.\u00a0 You can take all the time you want to loot the chamber and listen to the long monologue he has for the finish of the expansion as well as the final cutscene.\u00a0 While a game will still be active for some time if you are playing online, in single player, this will close the game, so be sure you are finished looting before taking the red portal if you're playing in single player.\nEncounters\nThe first level of the Worldstone Keep is home to &lt;a href=\"Defiled%20Warrior\"&gt;Defiled Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Witch\"&gt;Vile Witch&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"Fetid%20Defiler\"&gt;Fetid Defiler&lt;/a&gt;s.\u00a0 The Vile Witches can be dangerous in groups as they can cast an Amplify Damage curse as well as cast high volumes of missile attacks.\u00a0 Groups of Defiled Warriors can be dangerous should they decide to spam their charge skill.\u00a0 The last monster isn't much of a threat as it has low damage, often avoids combat and even the &lt;a href=\"Agony%20Worm\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; it activates in other monsters is hardly considered a threat. Staying mobile and withdrawing to a safer area if their onslaught is overwhelming should prove to be an effective method of dealing with them.\u00a0 Champion and unique versions of Blood Lords can be encountered in this area as well.\nThe second level is home to &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Hell%20Spawn\"&gt;Greater Hell Spawn&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Suicide%20Minion\"&gt;Suicide Minion&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, with the occasional pack of &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Lord\"&gt;Hell Lord&lt;/a&gt;s.\u00a0 Level 3 will host &lt;a href=\"Death%20Lord\"&gt;Death Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Sprite\"&gt;Demon Sprite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Rancid%20Defiler\"&gt;Rancid Defiler&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Fury\"&gt;Stygian Furies&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 The same tactics will apply here, however.\u00a0 Proceed with caution so large groups won't be alerted to your presence, stay mobile and withdraw to a safer area if you should feel overwhelmed.\nThe Throne of Destruction will have very little variety in Normal difficulty, your foes will be Stygian Furies and Death Lords.\u00a0 Quickly assess the easiest side to clear and quickly engage the foes, should there be any to be found.\u00a0 Having several Stygian Furies launching missile attacks can be surprisingly dangerous, especially with their Amplify Damage curse, so again, stay mobile and be prepared to withdraw to a safer area if necessary.\u00a0 Once the corners are clear, proceed northward with caution.\u00a0 Engage foes as necessary and don't hesitate to open town portals every so often to shorten your journey.\u00a0 The good news is that Baal's element traps are not active here, so you can take all the time you want to prepare.\u00a0 And while it is quicker to stick to the two middle corridors, it may be desirable to clear the side passages if the player may need to retreat down this way to deal with the final waves of monsters.\nOnce the player has entered the room where Baal squats in front of the portal to the Worldstone Chamber, the entire room must be cleared of opponents before the final encounter begins.\u00a0 Once cleared, he will laugh mockingly and unleash five waves of minions.\u00a0 Keep in mind, especially for the third, fourth and fifth waves, that if the anteroom is absent a boss monster, he will launch the next wave.\u00a0 In this way, a player can skip an encounter if they so choose.\nThe first wave will feature a variety of Fallen Ones called Warped Ones and their leader &lt;a href=\"Colenzo%20the%20Annihilator\"&gt;Colenzo the Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 Deal with them the way you always have, focusing on Colenzo so he won't raise his slain fellows, just take a bit of care should you have low hit points as his Fire Enchanted property may cause a lethal amount of damage.\u00a0 The second wave will have cold-casting skeleton mages and a group of &lt;a href=\"Unraveller\"&gt;Unraveller&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"Achmel%20the%20Cursed\"&gt;Achmel the Cursed&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 Drawing the skeletons into the lower half of the room should be sufficient to prevent their resurrection, and keep an eye on your red (or green) globe as the Unholy Bolt coupled with poison damage can cause a swift death.\u00a0 Another thing to note is that it is very difficult to draw Colenzo and also the Unravellers away from Baal's sight, so you will have to endure a significant amount of time being decrepified.\u00a0\nThe third wave will consist of &lt;a href=\"Council%20Members\"&gt;Council Members&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Bartuc%20the%20Bloody\"&gt;Bartuc the Bloody&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 It is recommended to retreat to town after the encounter with Achmel and remove the poisoning as well as hanging back outside of Baal's sight so the Decrepify curse won't be a hindrance to you or your minions will help.\u00a0 If necessary, trying to draw them off one or two at a time will make them easier to defeat if you should find them overly difficult as a group.\u00a0 The fourth wave will consist of a group of Extra Fast &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Lord\"&gt;Venom Lord&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"Ventar%20the%20Unholy\"&gt;Ventar the Unholy&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 The same thing will apply here.\u00a0 Hang back outside Baal's sight and draw them off in smaller groups can make all the difference.\u00a0 The final wave will consist of &lt;a href=\"Lister%20the%20Tormentor\"&gt;Lister the Tormentor&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Minions%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Minions of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 They can be exceptionally difficult as they have the property to induce a significant stun effect, and in groups, has lead to the death of many characters unfortunate enough to be hit by one (and then by several) of these foes.\u00a0 As mentioned before, retreating down into the lower part of the Throneroom area and managing to lose them is a successful tactic should players not wish to defeat them in combat.\nWhen the Minons of Destruction are defeated or lost in the lower passages, Baal will laugh mockingly and enter the portal to the Worldstone Chamber.\u00a0 With the portal now accessible, the player can engage Baal in the final battle of the game.\u00a0 Be sure to visit the &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on him if you need tips and strategies in dealing with him.\nI've finished the game! What now?\nTo increase the replay value of the game, two more levels await the intrepid adventurer not done with the treasures available in the normal difficulty level.\u00a0 While these difficulty levels offer a tough challlenge to the unprepared, they also offer a chance at much greater rewards.\nNightmare Difficulty.\nEncompassing levels 36-66, this level has the opportunity to drop many useful items to round out a character. Monsters are much more durable, but offer better experience points and the chance of more valuable drops.\u00a0 Additionally, players must work with a 40% penalty to their resistances.\u00a0 Dying offers the penalty of losing 5% of the experience earned for that level.\u00a0 Managing to retreive your corpse(s) will recover 75% of the experience lost.\u00a0 There are many other things which are apparent in Nightmare difficulty, but these tend to be of the most concern.\u00a0 The &lt;a href=\"http%3A//classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/basics/difficulty.shtml\"&gt;Arreat Summit&lt;/a&gt; has a complete listing of things that are different in Nightmare.\nHell Difficulty.\nStretching from levels 67 to 85, this difficulty comprises the greatest challenges the game has to offer.\u00a0 Monsters are exceptionally tough and an unprepared player will quickly notice if they have been lucky enough to build their characters properly.\u00a0 The rewards, however, may definitely outshine the dangers as higher experience points, prized items and high runes are most likely to be dropped by monsters in this difficulty.\u00a0 The penalty to resistances is increased an additional 60% and nearly every monster has at least one immunity.\u00a0 As formidable as the difficulty level can be, it is possible for a player to succeed without \"godly\" gear if they understand what is necessary to work around the challenges offered by this level of play.\u00a0 A complete listing of differences for Hell difficulty can also be found on the Arreat Summit.\nGeneral Tips for Survival in Nightmare and Hell Difficulty.\nThere are four distinct playstyles in Diablo II:\u00a0 Melee, ranged, area-of-effect and minions.\u00a0 All others are merely hybrid of one of the abovementioned styles.\u00a0 What is listed below are some general advice to keep in mind, and although \"godly\" gear can make things much easier, it is by no means necessary to quest to and defeat Baal in Hell Difficulty.\nMelee.\nCommonly paladins, barbarians, shapeshifter druids, javazons and martial arts assassins will find that getting about 50% crushing blow, some amount of open wounds, and bulking up on resistances will level the playing field, especially in Hell.\u00a0 Adopting an extra element or two of attack such as cold, poison or lightning will also help.\u00a0 Barbarian builds, for example, will often suggest taking one point in Berserk as the damage is completely magic damage, and effective against physically immune monsters.\u00a0 Life leech, faster hit recovery and increased attack speed will also help characters who melee as their prime mode of attack.\u00a0\nRanged.\nAlthough many would consider a Lightning Sorceress and the Bonemancer to be totally different from a Bowazon, all three still \"play\" the same way:\u00a0 inflicting damage on an opponent while trying to remain distant, often using Hirelings or other minions to maintain distance from their foes.\u00a0 On the other hand, there are significant differences, build-wise.\u00a0 The Sorceress and Bonemancer will benefit most from having gear to boost their skills as well as items with faster cast rate, while the Bowazon should definitely be on the lookout for items that will increase her attack speed as well as her damage.\u00a0 Having some crushing blow/open wounds/significant elemental damage gear on their hirelings will also go a long way to taking significant pain out of Hell difficulty.\nArea-of-Effect.\nThe wind druid, poison nova necromancer and hammerdin would be a part of this category.\u00a0 As being close to an opponent is necessary for maximum effectiveness, faster hit recovery, faster cast rate, skill bonuses and high resistances would maximize the effectiveness of this playstyle.\nMinion Builds.\nWhile many disdain the druid's summoning tree, it can certainly help to have strong minions to add to distraction, while the Necromancer's summoning tree can be a powerful tool when coupled up with Corpse Explosion and properly allocated curses.\u00a0 In the case of the Bowazon (as javazons require too many synergies to have her as more than a disposable ally), a well-allocated Valkyrie is a very rugged, if slow minion and can well outlast most monsters.\u00a0 In these cases, what these builds would benefit most from would be items to boost their relevant skills.\nAll builds.\nAbove all, a player should know the signs when a monster outmatches the character and avoid the particular monsters if they should be beyond one's ability to overcome them, or to recognize the shortcomings of the build and look for ways to work around it.\u00a0 Buffing out a hireling, adding elemental damage, investing in an extra skill or looking for easier-to-obtain substitutes for the suggestions found in build guides can mean the difference between success and failure.\nWeigh damage potential.\u00a0 While crushing blow is excellent for the initial chunks of a monster's life bar and open wounds is great for continued damage to even physical immune monsters, these alone will make a quest in Hell difficulty a very long one.\u00a0 Examine the character's skills closely, and many guides for the same build will include one-point skills that can make a significant difference without breaking that particular build.\u00a0 Build on resistances as elemental attacks, especially in Hell, are quite potent and can be unexpectedly fatal."}

Her grip on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; cuts deep into the hearts of men and women alike, cultivating the worst in its denizens and leaving the world a dark, hopeless place. The main plot is similar to \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" in that it is a \"following-in-the-footsteps-of\" story; specifically, the game's player character(s) is/are pursuing Lilith across Sanctuary. A core theme of the game is \"hatred\"; the motif of hate consuming the world, and the hearts of the player character(s).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; play a key role in the game's story, as well as the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. The feud between him and Lilith is one of the game's key plot points.\nThe base game's storyline will be expanded in two areas post-launch. The first one will be via expansions, which continue the overall storyline of the game. The second one is through the game's &lt;a href=\"Season%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;seasons&lt;/a&gt;, however, seasons are self-contained storylines, unrelated to the core storyline. The game's expansions and seasons form chapters of the overall plot, and are divided as follows:\nGameplay.\n\"Diablo IV\" can be played solo or in a group of up to 4 players per party. The game utilizes a shared world system where groups may encounter one another, engaging in both PvE (PvM) and PvP activities; dungeons are instanced, however, and can only be done with multiple players through the party system. The state of the world is unique to each player, depending on their progress through the campaign as well as other variables (such as &lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;strongholds&lt;/a&gt;).\nPlayers can create clans while in the game and customize a clan banner; clans do not offer any advantages to loot or power progression. The game does not have an &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. Trading is enabled between players, but with certain limitations (such as the inability to trade crafting materials and /). All loot is personal, and &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; dropped by monsters and &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;treasure chests&lt;/a&gt; will not be visible to other players; the exception to this is when the player drops an item on the ground manually.\nAccount-wide progression is present, where all characters that the player creates share the same &lt;a href=\"stash\"&gt;stash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Craftable_items%23Crafting_Materials\"&gt;crafting materials&lt;/a&gt; and special currencies. A renown system, which is divided per region in the world &lt;a href=\"Automap\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;, is also account-wide, allowing players to reap all the benefits of gaining renown rewards in the different zones. For &lt;a href=\"Season%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;Seasons&lt;/a&gt;, most of the account-wide progression is separate, meaning that certain progress on the eternal server will not carry over to the seasonal server.\nThe game is multiplatform, with crossplay being available; the player can, however, opt to disable the feature in the game's option menu and only get matched with players from the same platform. Cross-progression is also available, allowing for players to transfer their progress between all available platforms through their Battle.Net-accounts. The console versions feature couch co-op for up to two players, however, each player must have their own Battle.Net-account. Though players in couch co-op can still form parties with other players online.\nThe massive world map has verticality, allowing the player to climb up and down on cliffs, giving it more depth and a larger sense of exploration. The game has a day-night cycle and dynamic weather effects as well. Wild critters can be found in Sanctuary to make the world feel more alive. The map has various icons depicting specific points of interest, such as &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;waypoints&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Quests\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; objectives; these can be filtered and toggled. Players can also pin any part of the map, which will show an optimal path based on the player's position.\nAs the player progresses through the zones, they can unlock &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;waypoints&lt;/a&gt; to make traversal faster. Each zone has a \"hub\" &lt;a href=\"Towns\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, which gives players access to all features, ranging from the blacksmith and item vendors to other specialized &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Occultist\"&gt;Occultist&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player reaches Act IV, they can unlock the &lt;a href=\"Mounts\"&gt;horseride&lt;/a&gt; function, in which the horse can then be customized with cosmetics; all horses have the same &lt;a href=\"movement%20speed\"&gt;movement speed&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe campaign is expected to take 45\u201350 hours to complete on the first playthrough. In addition to this, the game will have &lt;a href=\"Season%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;seasons&lt;/a&gt;, similar to those in \"Diablo III\". Once the player finishes the campaign with one of their characters, they have the option to skip the campaign entirely when making new characters, or when using existing characters.\nCombat and Systems.\n\"Diablo IV\" retains the core aspect of the series and the ARPG genre, with a gameplay revolving around empowering the player character through a combination of abilities and equipment dropped by monsters. The game brings back &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;skill trees&lt;/a&gt;, in a similar fashion to \"Diablo II\", to allow for different types of gameplay styles and tailor a variety of builds. Each &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; has its own distinct identity, abilities, and skill tree.\nMuch like in \"Diablo III\", characters can generate their \"&lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;\" resource with Basic Abilities, which are fuel to more potent attacks, called Core Abilities. There are also Ultimate Abilities, which are even more powerful &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s, capable of either dealing massive &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; or granting empowering effects, at the cost of longer cooldowns. At the end of the skill tree, all classes have access to a key passive skill which further enhances their power.\nInspired by \"Diablo III\", the &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20Board\"&gt;Paragon Board&lt;/a&gt; features a vast talent tree to continue empowering the player character(s). Once the character reaches the max &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 60, they start gaining paragon points to spend on the board, which can then be rotated to further add customization. Each board has its own special nodes which can be activated, as well as &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"Glyphs\"&gt;Glyphs&lt;/a&gt;, which drop from monsters, to grant powerful effects; these Glyphs can later be upgraded by completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Pit%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;The Pit&lt;/a&gt;, which functions similarly to \"Diablo III\"'s &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rifts&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Potions\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; system combines aspects from \"Diablo II\" and \"Diablo III\"; potions no longer have a cooldown when used, and replenish &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; instantly as well as over time. While &lt;a href=\"belts\"&gt;belts&lt;/a&gt; do not make a return, the player instead has multiple potions to be used. Potions can be upgraded to increase at the &lt;a href=\"Alchemist\"&gt;Alchemist&lt;/a&gt; to increase the healing potency and maximum capacity. Potions do not take up &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; space and are also automatically picked up when walked over; however, if the player is full on life, they cannot pick them up, nor use a potion. Also, &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Well\"&gt;Healing Well&lt;/a&gt;s now fully restore the player's health, resource, and potion quantity as well (in addition to the &lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt;s in towns doing the same thing). The Life Orb mechanic from \"Diablo III\" does not make a return, though the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; has a system reminiscent of it called Blood Orb, where certain abilities will cause said orbs to drop and instantly &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; the character when walked over.\nSimilar to \"Diablo III\", items can be salvaged into raw crafting materials which are then used to upgrade gear. A new &lt;a href=\"harvesting\"&gt;harvesting&lt;/a&gt; mechanic is also introduced, which allows players to interact with certain plants and mineral veins to gather herbs and ores, respectively, which are then used to upgrade their potions through the &lt;a href=\"Alchemist\"&gt;Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, players are also able to concoct elixirs, and craft &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt; to be &lt;a href=\"Socket%23Verb\"&gt;socketed&lt;/a&gt; into equipment.\nThe game also adds an function, which in the case of the PC version, is assigned to the space bar. It allows players to &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt; enemy attacks, making them completely invincible for the duration of time, and also allowing characters to move freely through their enemies.\nClasses.\nThe game launched with five classes, they include the:\n&lt;a href=\"Skill_Trees%23Diablo_IV\"&gt;Skill Trees&lt;/a&gt; have also been revamped, now resembling an actual tree where &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Points\"&gt;Skill Points&lt;/a&gt; are spent in the 'Branches' and Passive Points are spent in the 'Roots'. Blizzard estimates that roughly 30-40% of the Skill Tree will be filled in on an average end game character. Additional skill points can be obtained by progressing through the renown system.\n&lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;Classes&lt;/a&gt; have specific &lt;a href=\"Quests%23Diablo_IV_quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; to complete in order to unlock their own unique \"specializations.\"\nIn \"\", a new class has been added, the &lt;a href=\"Spiritborn\"&gt;Spiritborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nDungeons and Monsters.\n&lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;Randomized&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keyed%20Dungeon\"&gt;Keyed Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0are featured in the game. &lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cellar\"&gt;cellar&lt;/a&gt;s are now also featured.\nStrongholds take place in the actual world map rather than in a dungeon, where the player takes on specific tasks while fighting enemies to permanently \"purge\" the area from the monsters; some strongholds, once conquered, will unlock new waypoints and towns populated by NPCs.\nKeyed Dungeons feature &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Dungeon\"&gt;Nightmare Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pit\"&gt;The Pit&lt;/a&gt;. Both are reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rifts\"&gt;Nephalem Rifts&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;.\" Nightmare Dungeons have affix modifiers that empower both the players and monsters, a feature slightly reminiscent of the Mythic+ Dungeons from \"World of Warcraft\". The Pit functions simiarly to \"Diablo III\"'s Greater Rifts, where players must slay hordes of monster to fill the progress bar within the timeframe in order to fight the boss, and upgrade their Glyphs similarly to Legendary Gems in \"Diablo III\".\n&lt;a href=\"Monster\"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt; designs are based on \"families\" of disparate, yet thematically-linked creatures which work well together to present interesting strategic challenges. Each region has its own distinct monster families and theming. &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;Elite monsters&lt;/a&gt; may appear, having between one to four &lt;a href=\"Monster_Skill%23Diablo_IV\"&gt;affixes&lt;/a&gt;, which grants them new abilities and traits. There are also monsters with &lt;a href=\"aura\"&gt;aura&lt;/a&gt;s, called &lt;a href=\"Champion_monsters%23Diablo_IV\"&gt;Champions&lt;/a&gt;, that will augment certain attributes (such as &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt;) of all nearby monsters until defeated. All monsters can drop any kind of loot, but certain monster families have a higher chance to drop a specific type of item (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;-types have a higher chance of dropping &lt;a href=\"axes\"&gt;axes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"maces\"&gt;maces&lt;/a&gt;).\nSome monster families have support-oriented units in their ranks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Fallen_Shaman_%28Diablo_IV%29\"&gt;Fallen Shamans&lt;/a&gt;, who are capable of resurrecting other Fallen units. &lt;a href=\"Khazra\"&gt;Khazra&lt;/a&gt; Shamans can empower other Khazra units into a berserker rage. &lt;a href=\"Banshee\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;s can charge Vengeful Spirits and give them access to powerful &lt;a href=\"Lightning_%28Diablo_IV%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; blasts. Other types of units, outside of the Summoner affix for Elites, are able to summon other types of creatures, such as certain &lt;a href=\"Triune%20Cultist\"&gt;Triune Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s being capable of channel &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balrog\"&gt;Balrog&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEach monster family also has an associated type of crafting material which drops exclusively from them. For example, all human-type enemies have a chance to drop Pale Tongues, while demon-types can drop Demon Hearts. Those crafting materials are used in a variety of items, ranging from equipment to elixirs. Players can also find the so called \"extremely rare monsters\", which have a fixed spawn location and will always drop the same piece of loot: a related specifically to them.\nMonsters can engage with the player in various ways: they can appear directly as obstacles, but may also create ambushes. There is a random chance when opening chests that monsters will appear to attack and surround the player; sometimes creatures may emerge from the treasure chests themselves. Certain monsters, most notably skeleton units, can erect bone prisons to catch an unsuspecting player traversing the map; others may block roads using bone walls, forcing the player to destroy them in order to progress.\nBoss fights take place during the story, as well as in certain dungeons as the final objective. &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt; have specific thresholds, marked in the lifebar, which will cause them to drop potions, but will also make them progressively more difficult. Bosses are completely &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; effects, but a stagger system has been introduced specifically for boss fights. By using abilities that have crowd control effects on bosses, players can raise a stagger gauge; once filled, the boss becomes temporarily stunned and vulnerable, taking more damage for the period of time.\nThere are also &lt;a href=\"World%20Boss\"&gt;World Boss&lt;/a&gt;es, which are encountered in specific open-world\u2014arena-type locations. They have a spawn timer, which will be highlighted in the map. Once a world boss fight starts, players who were not present cannot join midway. Defeating World Bosses will always award at least one Legendary item (with a chance for even Uniques when playing on higher difficulties) in addition to a weekly item cache which contains materials and more items.\nOnce the player reaches level 60, various end-game systems and activities open up, such as the aforementioned World Bosses, &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;Tree of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helltide\"&gt;Helltides&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Dungeon\"&gt;Nightmare Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;. The player can also unlock the Torment &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; settings by completing the The Pit at higher levels; much like in previous \"Diablo\" titles, the higher difficulties make monsters much stronger, but also grant the player better loot and high experience bonuses. The player can change the difficulty level in the character select screen menu, or at the &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; statue located in the town of &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment &amp; Upgrade System.\n\"Diablo IV\" has four item rarity types: Common, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, , and . All types, save for Unique, roll randomized stats, and both Legendary and Unique have an aspect that buffs a skill or specific trait, either a generic effect that can be used by all classes, or a class-specific effect. In addition, there are three types of item quality: Normal, Ancestral and Mythic (the last two only drop in Torment Difficulties), which differ in stats, with Mythic boasting the highest stat bonuses.\nItems can be upgraded at the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith\"&gt;Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Tempering\"&gt;Tempering&lt;/a&gt; system, which allows players to add up to two affixes in their gear. The player can also add sockets or remove gems and runes at the Jeweler, as well upgrade gems.\nNew to \"Diablo IV\" is the &lt;a href=\"Codex%20of%20Power\"&gt;Codex of Power&lt;/a&gt; system, where the player unlocks legendary aspects by completing dungeons, which can be in turn imprinted on gear at the Occultist. Aspects from the Codex will always be at the lowest possible effect. In addition, the player can also extract aspects from dropped legendary items by salvaging the item at the Blacksmith, which will upgrade the respective aspects in the Codex. At the &lt;a href=\"Occultist\"&gt;Occultist&lt;/a&gt; players imprint legendary aspects on other gear; if the player attempts to imprint a legendary aspect on another legendary, the chosen aspect will replace the existing one.\nNPCs and Side Quests.\nVarious &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0are featured in the game, both friendly and unfriendly ones. For simple interactions with NPCs, the game brings the camera in closer to the characters. This is designed to maintain an isometric feel, but a library of animations is used to deliver the gist of the conversation. For more complex interactions, the game takes a similar camera approach but the character\u2019s movements and animations are more deliberately hand-crafted. The second storytelling method used is real-time cutscenes, where the camera is used to treat the storytelling as being akin to a movie. These cutscenes are reserved for the most important story moments. The player character's armor is carried over to these scenes. Despite the game's open-world structure, the game's story has a definite beginning, middle, and end.\nPlayers can find various &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV%20Side%20Quests\"&gt;side quests&lt;/a&gt; scattered around the world. Most of them are picked up on towns, but some can be found while venturing on dangerous areas. They can be either be given directly by NPCs or started by picking item-quests dropped from specific portions of the map. Some side quests are chains that will feature the same NPC, while others have pre-requisites and can only be started once another sidequest has been completed, or depending on the player's progress in the main campaign. All side quests will award renown depending on the region.\nAt major town hubs, players can encounter the following NPCs providing specific services:\nIn addition, on hub towns the player can also access the wardrobe and stash. At &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt; specifically, the player can interact with the statue of Inarius to change the difficulty; this can also be done at the character select screen.\nOther Systems.\nIn-game cinematics are featured, as well as pre-rendered ones (in contrast to previous games, where all cinematics were pre-rendered). The in-game cinematics include the player's character, and adjusts the character's appearance in accordance with their gear.\nPlayers are able to earn &lt;a href=\"titles\"&gt;titles&lt;/a&gt; by completing specific challenges, such as using certain abilities, completing quest chains or killing a specific number of enemy types; there are also titles that are class-specific and even titles earned through playing a &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; character. The &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; system from \"Diablo III\" returns, and new cosmetics can be unlocked by salvaging gear; &lt;a href=\"dyes\"&gt;dyes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"wardrobe\"&gt;wardrobe&lt;/a&gt; are also present. The game has a shop for cosmetic-only microtransactions.\nWhile exploring the world, players can find Altars of Lilith, which will grant permanently minor bonuses to a specific stat for all characters in the player's account; this applies for both Eternal and Seasonal characters. There are also pilgrim statues with faded plaques, which will hint the player to do a specific emote; doing so will grant the player a temporary buff, such as becoming unstoppable for some minutes, or causing a rain of gold on their next kill.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gamble\"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt; system from previous titles returns, more closely resembling the \"Diablo III\" version: players can spend a currency called Murmuring Obol, which is obtained by completing world events and other activities, to buy specific pieces of equipment, which includes Legendary and Unique items. As the player progresses with the renown system, they can carry more Obols. \nThe player can customize an emote wheel for quick communication with other players, as well to set shortcuts for Elixirs or other consumables. In addition, the player can pet dogs in towns by using the \"Hello\" emote in front of them. \nA new feature in \"Diablo IV\" is the addition of a \"lost item\" system. If the player fails to loot a legendary / unique item by whatever reason (ignoring, leaving the instance, or logging out), the item will be automatically sent to the stash, in an exclusive temporary tab that can hold up to 10 items; if the player exceeds this number, any items not looted will be lost. To notify the player that they have lost items, the stash icon in the mini-map will flash showing an exclamation point next to it. \nWhen playing with a controller, target lock system is available, which can be changed manually in the options. By pressing the right analog stick, the player will target the nearest enemy and all attacks will be automatically aimed towards it; by pressing it again the player cancels the target lock. After a monster is killed, the game automatically targets another monster. In the case of ranged area attacks, controllers will try to lock meteor on top of large groups as best as possible. The player can also manually change their lock-on target by moving the right analog stick. There are currently no plans for WASD-based movement for PC.\nSimilarly to previous titles, players can create &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; characters, which provides a perma-death system.\nWorld Design.\n\"Diablo IV\" utilizes an open world structure with five unique regions. These are &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; (specifically its northern desert region), &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, and the swamplands of &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these areas are around 10 to 20 times larger than even the largest areas in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Each of the regions are connected, and players can traverse the areas without interruption. The geography of the regions shifts in accordance with this. For instance, if a player heads south from the Fractured Peaks to Hawezar, they will see a series of waterfalls, as snowmelt feeds the swamps.\nThe open-world is fixed, and not randomized. While the game has shared-world elements, it is not an MMO. Towns may become social hubs for a player once key story elements have been completed. Roads link various areas\u2014sticking to the roads allows players to bypass monsters, while heading off the path will take them towards higher monster densities. Each zone has associated &lt;a href=\"renown\"&gt;renown&lt;/a&gt; that the player can earn. \nPvP &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;zones&lt;/a&gt;, called Fields of Hatred, allows players to \"mark\" themselves and battle against each other. These areas have a very distinct red tint on the map, to notify players. By defeating monsters in those zones, players can earn Shards of Hatred, a special currency that disappears if the player leaves the Fields of Hatred. However, they can take those shards to an Altar of Extraction, which starts an event, where the player must survive agains waves of monsters (and other players) to convert their Shards of Hatred into Red Dust, which is a permament currency added to the player's acocunt, which in turn can be used to buy exclusive cosmetic gear, horse gear, equipment gambling and other items. Marked for Blood can only be removed in Altars of Cleansing located in the PvP zones. If a player is killed while inside a Field of Hatred, whether by a monster or another player, they will drop all their current collected Shards of Hatred, which can be picked by other players; Red Dust will not drop on death. \nWhile \"Diablo IV\" has MMO-inspired features, it is not divided into server regions. The game's regions are all their own separate instances with varying numbers of players in each, meaning that players will gracefully transition from one densely populated area to a more sparsely populated one without realizing it. For instance, &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s have high population caps, and players will generally see each other there. Overworld zones have lower caps, so player encounters will be less frequent. The cap soars for &lt;a href=\"World%20Boss\"&gt;World Boss&lt;/a&gt;es, in order to allow players to team up to defeat them. Players are more inclined to encounters those closest to their latency range. However, one can invite international friends (e.g. between the US and EU) to party-up. If one kills a &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; when in the proximity of another player, the player gets 5% bonus &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. If near a member of their party, a 10% bonus applies.\nMonetization.\n\"Diablo IV\" is pay-to-play. It has a &lt;a href=\"Cosmetics%20Shop\"&gt;Cosmetics Shop&lt;/a&gt; where transmog sets and horse armor can be purchased with Platinum, a currency bought with real money. The game features both a free and premium &lt;a href=\"Season%20Pass\"&gt;Season Pass&lt;/a&gt;, that award cosmetics. None of the monetization systems will provide pay-for-power options.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was worked on by a separate team from the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" one, and it was simultaneously developed for both consoles and PC. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Blizzard was able to test \"Diablo IV\" on consoles earlier and for longer, which opened up a lot more opportunities to develop the game for older platforms in order to reach as many players as possible. The game was originally planned for a 2022 release, but was postponed. According to employees commenting under conditions of anonymity, the game's release date was postponed numerous times.\n\"Diablo IV\" pulls from the previous games of the series, combining the aspects of \"Diablo I\"'s darker tone and atmosphere, as well as the looming sense of dread, the class lineup and loot chase of \"Diablo II\", and the combat fundamentals of \"Diablo III\" all into one. In this context, \"Diablo IV\"'s main addition to the formula is its open world.\nThe base game is expected to receive expansions, and to be supported for years after release. The expansions will be released annually. Players will not be required to purchase the expansions to continue playing \"Diablo IV\", but will still have to purchase them to gain access to relevant content (e.g. new classes).\nUsers of the open beta have reported issues with playing on a &lt;a href=\"Nvidia\"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"GeForce%2030%20series\"&gt;RTX 3080 Ti&lt;/a&gt; graphics card with has resulted in the game running poorly with frequent overheating and crashing. Some users have reported that the game has caused their graphics card to stop working. Both Blizzard and Nvidia reported in March 2023 that they were working to resolve the issue.\nOn January 15, 2024, &lt;a href=\"Microsoft%20Gaming\"&gt;Microsoft Gaming&lt;/a&gt; announced that \"Diablo IV\" will be added to &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20Game%20Pass\"&gt;Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; on March 28, 2024.\nOriginal Version.\nThe roots of \"Diablo IV\" lie in late 2013 or early 2014, where \"\" was cancelled, with the instruction that &lt;a href=\"Team%203\"&gt;Team 3&lt;/a&gt; move onto Diablo IV and Diablo Immortal, regardless of what form the game might take. Team 3 was split up, with some of its members transferring to different projects within Blizzard. Those who remained were assigned to provide patch support for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" while simultaneously developing \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Development of the game began in 2014. The initial project was referred to internally as &lt;a href=\"Project%20Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;. However, Hades was cancelled in 2016, and Team 3 began work on Project Fenris.\nProject Fenris.\nWork on Project Fenris began in 2016 after the cancellation of Hades. Sources indicate that Fenris remains the current version of Diablo IV, (a moniker originally held by Hades to some extent). The project's design director was &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Barriga\"&gt;Luis Barriga&lt;/a&gt;. Reportedly, Fenris is aiming to harken to \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" in its art direction, with many on Team 3 feeling that \"Diablo III\" had drifted away from previous titles in its art style and spell effects. One of Fenris's design pillars is \"embrace the darkness.\" Practically, this has resulted in getting rid of anything that was considered cartoony in \"Diablo III\". There has been debate as to whether the game will use the same over the shoulder camera as Hades, or whether it will use a traditional isometric style. As of November 2018, the game is reportedly using the isometric style.\nAnother pillar of the game is to make it more social, to incorporate so-called \"light MMO elements\" into the game. The designers have considered something equivalent to the instanced dungeons of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", or the strikes of \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.destinypedia.com/Destiny\"&gt;Destiny&lt;/a&gt;\". Another idea is whether the game should use a kind of shared world model, with multiple players on the map at the same time.\n2016-2017.\nBy June, 2016, Blizzard had opened a position for a game director. The position openings were either filled or removed by September, 2016.\nFor &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the event's \"goodie bag\" was sent out ahead of the event to a number of individuals. Not long afterwards, a number of sites reported on an apparent printing error with the dice. Where they should read 1-1-1, they were instead been printed as 1-1-4. It has been suggested that this is a code for the date of the event (the 4th day of the 11th month). Likewise, the insignia on the dice bag was not the Diablo III logo, but rather a four-sided compass with four smaller points, with a \"D\" located inside a square (a four-sided shape). Media speculated that this was a hint at a supposed \"Diablo IV\" game. No such game was revealed at the event.\nIn January 2017, &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Love\"&gt;Julian Love&lt;/a&gt; stated that in regards to another main series installment, \"I think everyone wants that.\" In February 2017, &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt; stated that \"there's no doubt in my mind\" that there would be a Diablo IV. At BlizzCon 2017, &lt;a href=\"Brandy%20Camel\"&gt;Brandy Camel&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that Blizzard was \"exploring what's next\" for the franchise, but that they had nothing to show (to the public) yet. Diablo content creators were asked for feedback on what they speculated would be in the works.\n2018.\nReportedly, 2018 was decided as the year where the game would be revealed. In January, it was planned to have a playable demo released in the year. By May, the game had progressed slower than anticipated, but the decision to reveal the game this year still remained.\nIn September, Goldman Sachs sent a message to investors advising them of several launch announcements at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt;, including Diablo IV and a Diablo or \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" mobile title. In October 2018, a \"Reign of Terror\" title was leaked via &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt; merchandise. Afterwards, addressing the issue, Blizzard stated \"these are names and copy used for some of the new products available at BlizzCon this year, and not direct references to content at the show.\" In the same month, Blizzard stated that it wouldn't announce all of its Diablo projects at the event.\nAt &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wyatt%20Cheng\"&gt;Wyatt Cheng&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that in addition to \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", other Diablo games were in development. In an interview with Kotaku, &lt;a href=\"Allen%20Adham\"&gt;Allen Adham&lt;/a&gt; stated that Blizzard had expected some backlash to the game, but \"not to this degree\" and \"that being said, we knew our audience here desperately wants to see and hear about one thing in particular.\" Nathan Grayson noted that Blizzard had made a blog post that had effectively told fans not to expect Diablo IV, but postulated that some might have taken this as an attempt at reverse psychology. Adham confirmed in the same interview that the blog post had indeed been intended to dissuade fan expectation for Diablo IV. At a BlizzCon 2018 press conference, Adham stated that multiple Diablo games were being worked on, indicating that at least some of them would be playable on PC. In a separate interview, he indicated that the same held true for console games.\nA few days after the event, a separate Kotaku article by Schrier claimed that Blizzard had originally intended to reveal Diablo IV at the event, but had pulled the video beforehand. The article was updated after a response from Blizzard, stating that they had made no such plans. However, the Schrier stated that the video had indeed been confirmed to exist, but that the point of contention was as to whether it had originally been meant to be shown, and two separate sources within Blizzard had confirmed its existence. The sources further claimed that the game had been in development since at least 2014, but had changed drastically over the last four years and had gone through two different directors. In a follow-up podcast, he reiterated that he had been in contact with those who had developed, seen, and/or playtested the game. Later in the month, he posted a followup article after talking to 11 (former) Blizzard employees under conditions of anonymity. Reportedly, the game is intended for PC and console release, but as of November 2018, Team 3 has not decided whether the game will have a simultaneous release, or whether one platform will follow the other. It was noted that many of the design decisions of the game are still up in the air, and it was estimated that Fenris would get a 2020 or later release. On the subject as to the supposedly planned reveal of the game, one employee commented that Team 3 was \"paranoid\" about revealing the game too soon. Reportedly, \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Astarcraft%3AStarCraft%3A_Ghost\"&gt;StarCraft: Ghost&lt;/a&gt;\" still hang over Blizzard. \"Ghost\" was announced and never released. \"Titan\" was never announced, but its existence had been leaked, and it had been a huge sink of time and money, even if \"Overwatch\" had resulted from it. In a statement from Blizzard, they confirmed that they would not share details with unannounced projects until they were ready, and this included games in the Diablo series as well.\nIn an interview at BlizzCon, Adham stated that future Diablo PC games would be rated M.\nIn December 2018, Blizzard stated \"we have many plans for Diablo across multiple projects which we'll be revealing over the course of the coming year. We are eager to share more about all of our projects, but some will have to wait as we prefer to show you, rather than tell you, about them.\"\n2019.\nIn January 2019, Blizzard registered the Diablo4.com domain name.\nIn February, games journalist Marcus Sellars reported that Activision Blizzard had four Diablo games in development\u2014Diablo IV, a prequel, and two spin-offs. In the same month, Activision confirmed that \"several Diablo projects\" were in the works. In June 2019, it was reported that staff had been transferred from canceled Blizzard projects to work on the game. In the same month, it was reported that the game had been showcased to Blizzard employees, and that the game would not be released before 2020. In September 2019, a News Corp publication that Blizzard had a Diablo sequel set to be released \"in the coming years.\" In October 2019, a German advertisement for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Art%20of%20Diablo\"&gt;The Art of Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" listed Diablo IV as being among the games the artbook covered. When asked for comment on the supposed leak, a Blizzard spokesperson stated \"we don\u2019t comment on rumors or speculation, but next week we will have exciting news to share so please stay tuned!\"\nIn the same month, Twitch streamer Metro who had previously accurately leaked Blizzard reveals stated that Diablo IV would be revealed at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202019\"&gt;BlizzCon 2019&lt;/a&gt; along with a remaster of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". The former claim was correct, while the latter, at least initially, was not.\n2021.\n&lt;a href=\"Luis%20Barriga\"&gt;Luis Barriga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20McCree\"&gt;Jesse McCree&lt;/a&gt; were fired in 2021. According to some employees, there was not a lot of vision for the game under their leadership. When asked for comment, neither responded. After McCree was fired, some of the changes he had made were reverted.\n2022.\nIn 2022, the press was given a build of \"Diablo IV\" called \"Renegade.\" It allowed them to play through the story up to &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 25, and only in &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. \n2023.\nThe game went gold on April 17, 2023.\nBetas.\nThe game had a closed beta. It was confidential, meaning players invited were unable to publicly talk about or share their gameplay experience. \nPublic testing phases were held in early 2023. An open beta was held from March 24-27, with players who pre-ordered the game also able to play from March 17-20. In these beta weekends, players were able to play through the game's , , and up to &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 25. The beta was held on all platforms. Players could choose the Barbarian, Rogue, and Sorcerer in the first week-end of the beta, Druid and Necromancer were added to the playable characters list during the second week-end of the beta, and could have up to ten characters per account. Progress in betas won't carry onto the launch version. However, players who partake in the betas are able to obtain rewards that carry over to launch. These include two &lt;a href=\"titles\"&gt;titles&lt;/a&gt; and a unique . \n&lt;a href=\"World%20Boss\"&gt;World Boss&lt;/a&gt;es operated in the betas.\nA final beta called a \"server slam\" will run from May 12, 12 p.m.\u2013May 14, 12 p.m. PDT, across all platforms. The Prologue and Act I will be playable, and all classes will be playable. During the \"server slam\" beta, players may level up to level 20 only, progress of the previous beta won\u2019t carry on to this \"server slam\" beta, nor will the progress of this new beta be carried to the final release. The titles and cosmetics of earlier betas will again be available for those how haven\u2019t yet unlocked them, and a new reward will be offered to those would slay the World Boss Ashava at level 20.\nIt was stated that a Closed End Game Beta would be playable on PC and Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 consoles\u2014cross-play and cross-progress for all platforms would also be supported. The beta would focused on the game's end-game content, in order to avoid story spoilers. However, this didn't come to pass.\nDev Updates.\nA series of quarterly updates, mainly in blog form, were published on the development process of Diablo IV. These updates were based on internal discussions as well as parsing feedback from the Diablo community\nArt.\nThe game's icons initially had a painterly style, in order to keep in with the game's overall art direction. Much of the game's artwork takes inspiration from Renaissance paintings. The game's art style is primarily inspired by \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", as reportedly, the team considers it \"the true \"Diablo\".\"\nBy early 2020, the icons were being redesigned to give them a more realistic look. Every monster returning from previous games has been reimagined in a \"darker, more gritty\" art style. The redesigns were done from the ground up. Initially, the approach was to give the game a hand-crafted style, while leaning into realism. The cinematics of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" were used as inspiration for how \"Diablo IV\" should look in-game. The process involved the developers to completely rebuild our rendering engine and authoring tools. In comparison to the real world, \"Diablo IV\" was designed to evoke the feeling of the medieval period. As of March 2022, the game's art approach was based on \"believability, not realism.\"\nReal-world locations were visited to provide inspiration for the game. For the more fantastical elements, anime has been cited as an inspiration. The art of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junji_Ito\"&gt;Junji Ito&lt;/a&gt; is one such example.\nAt least some weapons and armor differ in appearance depending on which region they're obtained in. For instance, in &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; are based on scimitars, whereas in &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;, they're based on broadswords.\nGameplay.\nThe game is designed to incorporate shared-world elements, while not feeling like an MMO. This was a decision of design, and not one driven by limitation. The developers found that \"the game stopped feeling like Diablo\" and the world felt less dangerous when they saw other players too often or in too high numbers. Inspiration was taken from the &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; of \"Diablo III\" in regards to the game's more open design.\nMonster density in the open world was scaled down during development, as it made it difficult to traverse the world while on a mount.\nA battle royale mode for the game was discarded early on.\nStory.\nThe plot of \"Diablo IV\" was designed to be accessible for both newcomers and series veterans. More work was put into the game's story than previous titles. The game's plot was designed to be more grounded than \"Diablo III\". Inspiration was taken from characters such as &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt; when it came to designing the NPCs. Kings and \"high fantasy themes\" were avoided. According to &lt;a href=\"Rod%20Fergusson\"&gt;Rod Fergusson&lt;/a&gt;, the story and narrative of \"Diablo IV\" is designed to feel different from \"Diablo II\", \"Diablo Immortal\", and \"Diablo III\", as all three games have currently active playerbases.\nThe game's characters were designed to be \"in a very dark place\" (in terms of circumstance/personality), but \"still trying their best to live.\" The game's story was written as a tragedy, focused on characters rather than the apocalyptic circumstances they find themselves in.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Sebastian%20St%C4%99pie%C5%84\"&gt;Sebastian St\u0119pie\u0144&lt;/a&gt;, a number of revisions were made to the game's script. According to interviews with Blizzard employees under condition of anonymity, St\u0119pie\u0144 delayed the story development for months. In 2019, many Blizzard employees were disgusted by a version of the game\u2019s script that repeatedly mentioned the rape of a love interest and referred to this female character as the raped woman as her primary description. Employees pleaded with leadership to revise his version of the story, saying rape had no place in a Blizzard game. Many expressed discomfort with the idea of adding rape to the game in what they considered to be an effort to make \"Diablo IV\" feel grittier and tonally darker than the previous game, rather than engaging with the subject in a sensitive way. The \"rape version,\" as multiple employees called the script, was ultimately overhauled in the same year, and the female character was cut from the story.\nA number of employees also complained about the representation of women in the game.\nDevelopment Team.\nThe following people from the development team participated in interviews at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; 2019 (alphabetical by last name):\nSpecial Editions.\n\"Diablo IV\" has a number of editions. They include the following (note that bonuses stack):\nSystem Requirements.\nAt least for the beta, settings to run \"Diablo IV\" are at 1080p native resolution / 720p render resolution, low graphics settings, 30 fps. \"Diablo IV\" will attempt to run on hardware below minimum specifications, including HDDs, dual-core CPUs, and Integrated GPUs. However, the game experience may be significantly diminished.\nMinimum Requirements for PC\nRecommended Medium Specifications for PC\nRecommended High Specifications for PC\nRecommended Ultra 4K Specifications for PC\nNote: The 50 GB available space is required for the low textures version, but around another 40 GB is required for highest quality textures (optional). By default, the installation is set to install the highest quality textures, but this can be changed during installation process (by unchecking the checkbox). However, 85 GB free disk space is required to get to that setting screen.\nReception.\n\"Diablo IV\" earnt $666 million in its first five days, and was the fastest selling game in Blizzard's history. \nThe game was review bombed on Metacritic after its &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Malignant\"&gt;first season&lt;/a&gt; was released, due to changes made to the game. Criticisms of the game included its endgame and lack of dungeon variety. As of September 2024, \"Diablo IV\" has grossed over $1 billion, with microtransactions accounting for $150 million of its total revenue.\nPlayerbase.\nAs of August, 2023, \"Diablo IV\" has 12 million registered players. As of October 2024, the game has 4 million active players.\nWith the release of the &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20Loot%20Reborn\"&gt;fourth season&lt;/a&gt;, the game had a resurgence in popularity, with over 29,000 concurrent Steam players. It reached its peak number in June 2024, with a concurrent 38,981 players. "}

None of them need to be completed, except for the \"Archbishop Lazarus\" and \"Diablo\" quests, which are the keys to finishing the game. Quests add background lore details and most give valuable rewards (even if only when just reselling).\nSome quests appear only in Single Player mode and those that appear in Multiplayer mode are simplified versions of the Single Player ones. Quests that appear in Single Player alternate between different games to make for better replayability. They are sorted into groups from which only some selected quests are given in a newly started game.\nIt is easy to immediately tell which Group 1 and 2 Quests you have upon starting a new game. If the fountain water next to Deckard Cain is murky, you will get the Poisoned Water Supply Quest; however if the fountain water is clear, you will get the Skeleton King Quest.\nSimilarly, if &lt;a href=\"Kael%20Rills\"&gt;The Wounded Townsman&lt;/a&gt; is missing from the entrance to the Cathedral, that means that you miss out on The Butcher Quest and get the other two quests instead: Ogden's Sign and Gharbad the Weak. If the wounded townsman is there, then you will get the Butcher quest and either one of the Ogden's Sign or Gharbad the Weak Quests (you will need to\u00a0further explore the cathedral to find out which one you will get).\nBecause certain quest rewards are better suited for certain classes, you may restart the game until you get the quests that you wish for.\nThe quests with an * (asterisk) are available in Multiplayer, though they are much simpler than their Single Player counterparts, as they do not have \"special levels\", the Skeleton King appearing on level 3 roaming freely and Archbishop Lazarus on level 15, standing behind the altar with the sacrificed child in a specially designed large room.\nQuests from the expansion pack, \"&lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;\", are located &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Quests\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "9178", "revid": "50803748", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9178", "title": "Diablo I Walkthrough", "text": "Tristram.\nThe player begins in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, here the player finds several NPCs amongst whom is &lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden the Tavern Owner&lt;/a&gt; who introduces the player to the main storyline with the following dialogue:\n\"Thank goodness you've returned! Much has changed since you lived here, my friend. All was peaceful until the dark riders came and destroyed our village. Many were cut down where they stood, and those who took up arms were slain or dragged away to become slaves - or worse. The church at the edge of town has been desecrated and is being used for dark rituals. The screams that echo in the night are inhuman, but some of our townsfolk may yet survive. Follow the path that lies between my tavern and the blacksmith shop to find the church and save who you can.\"\nAfter this the player will make his or her way towards the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; where he will find the &lt;a href=\"Kael%20Rills\"&gt;Wounded Townsman&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(if the &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Butcher Quest&lt;/a&gt; is available). Speaking with this NPC initiates the first quest, in which the players has to slay The Butcher. The wounded townsman has the following dialogue:\n\"\"Please, listen to me. &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;The Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, he led us down here to find the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Albrecht\"&gt;lost prince&lt;/a&gt;. The bastard led us into a trap! Now everyone is dead... Killed by a demon he called the Butcher. Avenge us! Find this Butcher and slay him so that our souls may finally rest...\"\"\nThe Cathedral/Dungeon.\nThe Cathedral-style Dungeon covers the first 4 levels of the Tristram Cathedral. This style features grey stone walls, mostly decorated with arches and the floor is made up of brown stones. Throughout these levels a lot of sarcophagi can be found, containing either treasure or hidden monsters. These levels contain numerous &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%29\"&gt;shrines&lt;/a&gt; and libraries where players can learn new &lt;a href=\"Spellbook\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Catacombs.\nThe Catacombs have a somewhat similar style to the Cathedral, though it seems more ancient and the atmosphere is already a lot darker.\u00a0There are still shrines and libraries, although fewer. Goat Shrines also appear, producing random, cryptic effects when used.\u00a0The Catacombs span from Level 5 to Level 8:\nThe Caves.\nThe design of the Caves is clearly not man-made unlike that of the Cathedral and Catacombs. It features open areas cut\u00a0through rock which streams of lava flows. The player is usually exposed to enemy fire from many sides. Some monsters are capable of opening doors. There are usually no shrines (although on rare occations Goat Shrines and Cauldrons might spawn). The Caves feature levels 9 to 12:\nThe Hell.\nThese levels' architecture made out of flesh, blood and bones and of pure Hell feature larger open areas and hordes of the game's toughest monsters. Cauldrons can be encountered here - they produce a random cryptic shrine effect when used (not recommended to touch though). This region is inhabited by the toughest of all monsters, though it also offers the best odds for finding good\u00a0 and\u00a0 items."}

{"id": "37441", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=37441", "title": "Diablo Immortal", "text": "Diablo Immortal is a mobile MMOARPG (massively multiplayer online, action\u2013role-playing game) for mobile devices and PC.\nPlot.\n\"Diablo Immortal\" tells stories set between the events of \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". The game starts in the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, though as of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shattered Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; update, the timeframe has extended to approx. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231274\"&gt;1274&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the game's plot points have their origins in the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. The catalyst of the plot is the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Although destroyed, its fragments carried &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption with them, wreaking havoc across &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The game's main antagonist is &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt;, Herald of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, who seeks to gather the Worldstone fragments to reignite the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. Simultaneously, &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;a fledging coven&lt;/a&gt; has emerged, its cultists roaming the land and spreading corruption wherever they trod.\nThe game's plot is planned to include what happened to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity after &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the Worldstone, how Tyrael was able to reform in Heaven, the activities of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, why &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; abandoned &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, how the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s were founded, what the golden age of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; was like and the schemes of &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;. The player's character is a hero who allies themselves with the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, aiming to prevent the enemies of Sanctuary from reclaiming and controlling the Worldstone.\nWhen asked if vignette-type stories will feature, the developers responded that \"twenty years [the gap between Diablo II &amp; III] is a long time.\" Similarly, the game may explore key events in the series's lore (&lt;a href=\"Destruction%27s%20End\"&gt;Destruction's End&lt;/a&gt; is one such example). However, the game will not extend to the timeframe of \"Diablo III\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGameplay.\n\"Immortal\" can be played on both PC and mobile. Cross-play and cross-progression between platforms features. The HUD is for the PC version, but the interfaces are identical. To engage in cross-play between formats (e.g. between PC and mobile), a player must sync their &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; account with the device.\n\"Immortal\" is designed to be played in a variety of ways in terms of time, ranging from short sessions to 5-6 hours at a time. The campaign is expected to take 10 hours to complete, but can last longer if the player has to level up for respective zones. It does not have a traditional &lt;a href=\"act\"&gt;act&lt;/a&gt; structure, as it is intended that the game be updated over time, per its nature as an MMO.\nThe game requires an Internet connection to play. Beyond English and a few voiceovers, the game only features foreign subtitles. Non-English voiceovers are planned for post-launch.\nThe game is divided into two types of areas\u2014outdoor areas, where any player can drop in and out of through \"&lt;a href=\"Dynamic%20Event\"&gt;dynamic events\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, which are instanced, four-player experiences. Each dungeon has a specific number of &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; and a selection of &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es, while monsters will respawn over time in outdoor areas. At launch, the game will have eight zones and seven dungeons. Additional zones and dungeons will be added to the game post-launch.\n&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rift\"&gt;Elder Rift&lt;/a&gt;s also feature, as do &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Rift%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Challenge Rift&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEnemies in the game don't scale to the player. Dozens of players can operate in the same zone at any given time. Dungeons are a mix of handcrafted and randomized design. Players can play the game solo, but the dungeons are designed for team-play.\n&lt;a href=\"Lair\"&gt;Lair&lt;/a&gt;s also feature.\n&lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; serves as the game hub, where players can interact with each other and purchase items from vendors before heading back into the world. A loot system features, but at least in the demo, loot does not affect class appearance (in the final version, loot \"will\" change class appearance). Loot cannot be traded between players. &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; return from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". though each function independently rather than act as part of a set. &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode is unlikely to feature due to the issue of possible disconnects. However, the developers are looking at implementing a similar model.\nPlayers can form &lt;a href=\"Warband\"&gt;Warband&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Clan\"&gt;Clan&lt;/a&gt;s. The game has a &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; system, as well as the new &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Horadrim\"&gt;Legacy of the Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; systems.\nPvP features, where each zone has a PvP event in a given area. This is in addition to the &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe game's level cap is expected to be 60 at release. The &lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Cycle of Strife&lt;/a&gt; serves as the game's intended endgame content. &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Dawn of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; is a regular two week event.\nThe game has a wide variety of monsters, even more than \"Diablo III\". Defeating monsters opens pages in the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Bestiary\"&gt;Horadric Bestiary&lt;/a&gt;. \nPlayers can choose to be one of three factions\u2014&lt;a href=\"Adventurers\"&gt;Adventurers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt;. Adventurers are the default faction (technically not a faction at all), while the Shadows are opt-in. Players can become an Immortal through completing certain game objectives.\nThe game will have a number of servers at launch, but as of April 2022, the number has not been finalized. Players are allowed 5 character slots per server. It is unclear if the servers will be region-locked, but they will correspond to regions in a sense (e.g. NA East, NA West).\nClasses.\nClasses in the game include the , , , , , and . New classes were released post-launch; the &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; have been mentioned as possibilities. The class was released in 2023. An additional class; the &lt;a href=\"Tempest\"&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt; has also been released.\nA new class will be released in 2025.\nSkills.\nThere is no &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; or resource system, only skill cooldowns. Characters are controlled using a virtual thumbstick on the left side of the screen while the ability cluster is located on the right. The class skills were designed around the mobile interface, to move a character and target a skill simultaneously. The skills are divided into categories, and a a skill can fall under more than one category. Modifying a skill with a &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Item\"&gt;Legendary Item&lt;/a&gt; can change the category it falls under.\nEach class has a choice of 13 skills and 2 Primary Attacks, of which only 5 skills and a Primary Attack may be equipped at a time. These include Ultimate abilities; each class gains a charge for their Ultimate by using basic attacks. Once this charge has been built up, players can choose to augment their basic attack for a short time.\nEach skill has a rank system. Ranks are automatically gained as the player's character advances in level.\nControls.\nThe PC version uses the traditional mouse and keyboard setup from past games. Additionally, WASD character movement is available for PC players. The PC controls can be rebound.\nThe mobile version uses touchscreen controls. The hero is controlled via a virtual analog stick in the bottom-left corner of the screen, while the player's abilities are laid out along the bottom-right corner. The mobile features limited controller support. An intended goal is for the game to be fully compatible with controllers. As of the closed beta, the game does not include controller support for UI menus such as inventory, skills, Codex, Paragon, or vendors. These aspects still require use of the touchscreen. \nAs of release, the following controllers are supported for the following devices:\nMonetization.\n\"Diablo Immortal\" is free-to-play, with optional in-app purchases. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Crest\"&gt;Crest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Reforge%20Stone\"&gt;Reforge Stone&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Immortal\" also has a battle pass progression system that allows players to earn rewards by completing seasonal quests and other in-game activities. The battle pass has both free and paid tracks. All players can claim rewards such as Reforge Stones and Crests through the free track, while players with the paid track will have access to exclusive cosmetics and even more rewards. An empowered battle pass can be purchased for $4.99 a month. This paid version gives the user extra goodies with each rank up that are not available in the free tier. Some of the unlocks are reserved for the Empowered tier, including special chat emotes and extra quests that will award battle points.\nThe game features a Market system which connects anonymous buyers and sellers, with no ability to cash-out. There are limits to what can and cannot be put on the Market. While it will be a possible source of certain materials, supplementary items, and Legendary Gems, it is not a place to acquire gear. It\u2019s also a way for all players, including those who choose to never make an in-game purchase, to exchange items they find for additional in-game currency, beyond what they\u2019re able to earn through play.\nThe game has three types of currencies\u2014&lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"platinum\"&gt;platinum&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Orb\"&gt;Eternal Orb&lt;/a&gt;s. Gold functions as it did in prior games. Platinum can be earned through daily gameplay activities or purchased with real money. Players can also obtain platinum by selling items via the Market. Platinum is used for activities such as exchanging goods on the Market or crafting charms. Eternal Orbs are acquired with real money only, and can be used for purchasing Platinum, as well as other items such as the Battle Pass, Specialized Reforged Stones, Crests, and cosmetics.\nDevelopment.\nThe first hint of \"Diablo Immortal\" arguably goes as far back as 2014, where the idea of the fragments of the Worldstone being explored was raised at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202014\"&gt;BlizzCon 2014&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Valerie%20Watrous\"&gt;Valerie Watrous&lt;/a&gt; commented that it would be an interesting idea to explore. Reportedly, the idea of a Diablo mobile game was something Blizzard had discussed \"for a long time\" (as of 2018). Reportedly, the decision to make Diablo Immortal occurred in 2016 or '17. The game came together after discussions from both Blizzard and NetEase, and is a joint venture. NetEase was chosen due to their prior experience with ARPGs, and their presence in the Chinese mobile market. Reportedly, the main reason for the game's existence was to cash in on the Chinese market, where the Diablo series has been extremely popular. According to some sources, the original idea was to release the game in China first, see how it went, and then release it in the West. The source further claimed that in China, the quality bar was lower than the West and that the equivalent of an alpha game could be considered a full release there. However, Blizzard made the decision to give the game extra polish and carry out a simultaneous worldwide release.\nThe decision to set \"Immortal\" between \"Diablo II\" and \"III\" was influenced by \"\". As a remake of \"Diablo II\", it was thought that \"Immortal\" could be \"a nice throughline,\" picking up from where \"II\" ended (the destruction of the Worldstone) and working from there. It was also felt that it could be a way to expand on what happened between \"II\" and \"III\"\u2014&lt;a href=\"Wyat%20Chang\"&gt;Wyat Chang&lt;/a&gt; has used Tyrael as an example, namely the gap between his appearance in \"II\" (destroying the Worldstone) and descending as a comet in \"III\".\nBy late 2015, Blizzard was hiring for positions for a new Diablo project. By June 2016, Blizzard had opened a position for a game director. The position openings were either filled or removed by September 2016. In January 2017, &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Love\"&gt;Julian Love&lt;/a&gt; stated that in regards to another main series installment, \"I think everyone wants that.\" In February 2017, &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt; stated that \"there's no doubt in my mind\" that there would be a Diablo IV. At BlizzCon 2017, &lt;a href=\"Brandy%20Camel\"&gt;Brandy Camel&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that Blizzard was \"exploring what's next\" for the franchise, but that they had nothing to show (to the public) yet. Diablo content creators were asked for feedback on what they speculated would be in the works. In December 2017, Goldman Sachs stated that a Diablo game was predicted to release in 2019. In August 2018, Camel confirmed that multiple Diablo projects were in development. In September of the same year, the existence of a new Diablo game was inadvertently revealed with a leaked description for \"\". Again in September, Goldman Sachs sent a message to investors advising them of several launch announcements at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt;, including the Diablo IV\u00a0project and a Diablo or \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" mobile title. In October 2018, a \"Reign of Terror\" title was leaked via &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt; merchandise. Afterwards, addressing the issue, Blizzard stated: \"these are names and copy used for some of the new products available at BlizzCon this year, and not direct references to content at the show.\" In the same month, Blizzard stated that it wouldn't announce all of its Diablo projects at the event. The game was revealed at BlizzCon 2018.\u00a0\nIt is not being developed by &lt;a href=\"Team%203\"&gt;Team 3&lt;/a&gt;. Development is split between a Blizzard development team and a NetEase development team. The Blizzard team working on the game is fairly large in size. New content will be added to the game over time. As of &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt;, there are no plans to port the game to PC, and its pricing model has yet to be determined. However, in a subsequent interview, it was stated that the developers were being \"non-explicit\" in regards to ports. It was mentioned that \"future games\" in the same vein would probably have cross-platform play, with \"Hearthstone\" being cited as an example.\nWhile the game looks similar to \"Diablo III\", it uses different technology.\nInspiration was taken from the prior games in regards to Immortal's systems. When choosing the game's classes, the classes of Diablo II &amp; III were looked at. Six were chosen from Diablo III as it was felt that they represented the franchise \"very well.\" One of the first considerations was the game's control scheme. The game is designed to be played for all ages, while PC Diablo games will remain M-rated. As of late 2018, the game originally had a &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; system, but BlizzCon 2018 had been replaced with a cooldown system. During development, the team alternated between the Diablo III paradigm (where each class had its own unique resource) and the Diablo II paradigm (where every class used mana). As of BlizzCon 2018, the itemization was also being looked into, including the possibility of socketed items. Both Diablo II and Diablo III were looked at for inspiration as to how to approach itemization. Similarly, as of this point in time, the game's business model has yet to be decided.\nIn March 2019, NetEase CFO Yang Zhaoxuan announced that the game was \"pretty much ready,\" but implied that the game's release date would be decided by Activision Blizzard. In the same month, it was reported that the game was available for pre-loading in Taiwan.\nThe game is expected to receive monthly and/or weekly updates. These will include balance changes, new zones, dungeons, bosses, loot, additional stories, and new classes.\nThe game entered technical alpha in December, 2020. A closed beta began for Australian and Canadian players on October 28, 2021. The beta was rolled out to Japanese, South Korean, and Chinese players at a later date.\nThe game was originally intended for a 2021 release, but was pushed back to the first half of 2022. Pre-orders for iOS opened on March 28, 2022.\nIn April, 2022, it was announced that the game would simultaniously release for PC, and that it would release in June. The decision to develop the game for PC was one that the team went back and forth on for a large part of the development process. On one hand, they felt that they couldn't do the title justice by releasing a game originally designed for mobile on PC. On the other, they wanted to have as many gamers play the game as possible, especially \"dedicated PC fans.\" In the end, the deciding factor was the knowledge that many players would emulate the game onto PC regardless. The decision to port the game to PC came late in the game's development cycle, after the mobile beta period had concluded (late 2021/early 2022).\nWhile the mouse and keyboard control scheme was taken from previous games, the decision to include a WASD configuration was that because many of the game's abilities are charged, WASD would allow players to continue attacking while charging. This is doable on a mobile touchscreen, but not for mouse and keyboard.\nA PC beta was held between the announcement and the game's final release. Progress made in the beta will be retained. The PC version exited beta in August, 2023.\nThe game's Asia-Pacific servers entered public testing on June 22, 2022. The game became available on Windows PC, Android, and iOS in Asia Pacific regions such as Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macao, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. The game will also be available in Vietnam on PC only.\nUpdates.\nAs of August 2022, the developers' current plan is to release new content for the game every two weeks. These updates will come in the form of either mini or major updates.\nMajor updates that have been released thus far include:\nReception.\nThe announcement of \"Diablo Immortal\" received significant attention in the gaming media for the negative reception it received. Fans and some media figures focused on it being planned as a mobile-only game, partnership with NetEase, and the choice to announce it at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; to an audience of predominantly PC gaming, heavily enfranchised fans, many of whom were eager for news about \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Upon release, \"Immortal\" was criticized for its microtransactions, but performed well financially and remains highly played, particularly among the mobile gaming audience.\nAnnouncement.\nReception to the game at its release was predominantly negative. Both the cinematic and gameplay trailers from &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt; received an overwhelming amount of \"dislikes\"; many more times than the \"likes\" amount in both cases. The Diablo Reddit was also noted for fans expressing dissatisfaction along with YouTube. At a followup Q&amp;A, the news that the game would not receive a PC release was met with boos, and taunts were thrown out throughout the session. One member of the public even asked whether the game was an \"out of season April Fool's joke.\" Reasons for the outcry were pointed out as being how the Diablo series was predominantly a PC-based series, and that Blizzard partnering with &lt;a href=\"NetEase\"&gt;NetEase&lt;/a&gt; was a source of contention, as Blizzard had previously kept development in-house. It was also suggested that fan expectation for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" had played a role in the outcry.\nGame websites were more amicable, but some pointed out the game's simplified gameplay when compared to \"Diablo III\". Others gave more positive feedback.\nIn response to fan outcry,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wyatt%20Cheng\"&gt;Wyatt Cheng&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that other \"Diablo\" games were in development by separate teams. In an interview with Kotaku, &lt;a href=\"Allen%20Adham\"&gt;Allen Adham&lt;/a&gt; stated that Blizzard had expected some backlash to the game, but \"not to this degree\" and \"that being said, we knew our audience here desperately wants to see and hear about one thing in particular.\" Nathan Grayson noted that Blizzard had made a blog post that had effectively told fans not to expect Diablo IV, but postulated that some might have taken this as an attempt at reverse psychology. Adham confirmed in the same interview that the blog post had indeed been intended to dissuade fan expectations for Diablo IV.\n&lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt; gave a mixed reception to the game, stating that he was willing to reserve judgement, but was puzzled by Blizzard's decision to partner with Netease, given that Blizzard already had mobile experience with \"Hearthstone\", and had a negative experience with outsourcing in \"StarCraft: Ghost\". He commented that BlizzCon 2018 hadn't been the correct venue to announce the game. &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Morin\"&gt;Jonathan Morin&lt;/a&gt; commented \"I think I was ahead of my time,\" referring to his development of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Junior\"&gt;Diablo Junior&lt;/a&gt;\" 14 years before the announcement of \"Immortal\".\nRelease.\nUpon release, the game was heavily criticized for its microtransactions.\nAs of April 2022, the game has over 30 million registered players. Within the first few months of its release, earnings from \"Immortal\" were estimated at over $1 million per day, and as of July 2022, the game had earned over $100 million in microtransactions. The majority of microtransactions occurred in the United States, followed by South Korea and Japan. It won the Best Mobile RPG award from the Pocket Gamer Awards and received nominations from Google Play, Apple Store Awards, The Game Awards, and D.I.C.E Awards.\nThe game's playerbase surged after the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Most of the game's playerbase is comprised of mobile gamers, with pre-existing \"Diablo\" players a minority within the \"Immortal\" fanbase.\nAs of December 2023, it is the fifth most played mobile RPG globally."}

While hunting for a new project to keep himself busy after the release of Diablo II, he toyed with the idea of porting Diablo I to pocket PCs. In this period, he saw a Game Boy development kit, getting the idea to make a \"Diablo Jr.\" game. \"Pok\u00e9mon\" was big at the time, and Morin had the idea of transferring the format to Diablo, where players would fight &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; in a similar manner. The game would be targeted at a younger audience than the PC games. At the time, there was a split within Blizzard North between those who never wanted to work on Diablo again, and those who wanted to continue working within the IP.\nWork in the game began in 2002/'03, and lasted four to six months. Morin was given a team of 3-4 people to work on the project. Development was carried out on the original Game Boy rather than the Color version, as they wanted to get the game working on the \"base system\" first. Various ideas were tossed around. One point of discussion was whether to make the game a turn-based RPG, or keep it in the hack-and-slash style of the PC games. A demo was created where a top-down perspective was used. It was planned to distribute the game either on the Game Boy Color or the Game Boy Advance, and have a cartridge system similar to the Pok\u00e9mon games, where different versions of the game would be released, with each version having a different character &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; and support for cross-system item trading. Heroes started in a unique town before moving into dungeons and wilderness areas. Morin has commented that one version would have the player play as a knight, and on the other, a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the resignation of &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Max%20Schaefer\"&gt;Max Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20South\"&gt;Blizzard South&lt;/a&gt; had a look at Blizzard North's projects. Blizzard South hadn't been informed of the development of the game, and ultimately scrapped it due to production costs. In a 2019 interview, &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Householder\"&gt;Matthew Householder&lt;/a&gt; suggested that Diablo Junior had been cancelled due to its lack of an Internet connection, whereas the previous Diablo games had succeeded because of &lt;a href=\"battle.net\"&gt;battle.net&lt;/a&gt;. In the same interview, Morin suggested that the game didn't match Blizzard South's focus on \"hyper-profitability,\" of producing a handful of games to gain long-term profits. Diablo Junior wouldn't fit this paradigm given the production costs of cartridges, and that Blizzard would have to work through &lt;a href=\"Nintendo\"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; in releasing the game. Furthermore, a Game Boy game wouldn't have fitted Blizzard's PC focus."}

She asked the Nephalem to tell the Scoundrel to leave the attempts to win her affection. Instead, she expressed a preference for Kormac, and could be overheard fantasizing about &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, imagining him as a man of unusual beauty and strength, capable of repelling the invasion of the Reapers."}

Like other gems, they come in varying quality levels and grant bonuses to specific stats. Gems including Diamonds were introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and appear in subsequent games with the exception of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo II.\nLike other \"Diablo II\" gems, several Diamond bonuses are related to their color, white, which signifies Purity and the Power of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the chromatic nature of white light. In Weapons, it adds a bonus to damage against Undead enemies, an indication of its relation to the Light. In Shields, it adds bonuses to all Resistances, as white is composed of all colors and by extension all elements. In Armor and Helms, it adds an increase in Attack Rating.\nPlacing diamonds in socketed shields are a very easy, yet very powerful way of adding resistances. While other gems give higher resistances to individual source of damage, diamonds give easily the most total resistance. A perfect diamond gives +19% to all resistances, something that is only beaten by an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Um%20Rune\"&gt;Um Rune&lt;/a&gt;, which is considerably more difficult to obtain and only gives 3% more resistance in a shield.\nThe Diamond graphic has a different orientation for the 'normal' tier compared to the other 5 gemstones.

Diamonds were the only standard gem type to be added after release, implemented with &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0.1%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, and the only one not to correspond to a &lt;a href=\"core%20stat\"&gt;core stat&lt;/a&gt;. The game brought back Diamonds' \"&lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; to all\" concept from \"Diablo II\", but they otherwise provide different benefits than before, although their percentage damage increase to a specific subtype of enemy could be seen as similar to the previous Undead bonus.\nDevelopment.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, gems in \"Diablo III\" had nineteen tiers.

{"id": "3061", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3061", "title": "Difficulty", "text": "Difficulties are intended to increase the replay value of the Diablo franchise by offering a greater challenge. Players can attempt to play the game in another tier, featuring penalties for their character while making the &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s more difficult to defeat. The result of adventuring in these tiers is not only the greater challenge, but also the possibility of greater rewards. This is voluntary, and players can return to an easier difficulty level should they choose so. The subsequent games also adopted this idea, however, featuring greater complexity with each iteration.\nDiablo I.\nThe original \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" and its have three difficulty levels. While the original game's higher difficulties could only be experienced online outside of cheating, Hellfire allowed higher difficulties in singleplayer games.\nNormal.\nCharacters created in the original Diablo start in the difficulty mode. Excluding a certain trick that requires an already leveled multiplayer hero, Normal difficulty is the only difficulty accessible in the original game if the hero is in singleplayer mode. Multiplayer heroes must grow in power if they wish to start/join a game on the harder difficulties.\nThe \"Hellfire\" expansion pack permits any hero access to and difficulties, even if he/she is a singleplayer hero. In addition, if the hero is in singleplayer mode, the game does not require them to grow in power for these levels. Choosing to go into a higher difficulty early on, however, is considered insanely suicidal or insanely bold, as the hero will have quite a hard time surviving in the depths of the labyrinth.\nNightmare.\nThis level is present in the multiplayer mode of \"Diablo I\" as well as Hellfire. In both cases, the monsters will possess at least three times the health they would have possessed on Normal difficulty, and players will need at least +80% to Hit and +80 &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; to dish out/avoid &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; like they would do in Normal. In Diablo I, the monsters also receive +1 to their &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Hit Points&lt;/a&gt; after the modifiers, while in Hellfire, the monsters receive +50 to their Hit Point capacity after the initial x3 difficulty bonus, making the foes even hardier than they are in the regular Diablo.\nHell.\nWhile both versions of the original Diablo and Hellfire have differences between them, there are several identical aspects; monsters will deal even higher damage per hit, and their Hit Point capacity is increased by at least x4. Players will need at least +120% to hit and +120 Armor Class to dish out/avoid damage like they would do in Normal, and monsters have grown even hardier to the effects of magic, many monsters even possessing &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;resists&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;immunities&lt;/a&gt; which otherwise wouldn't on other difficulty levels.\nIn the original Diablo, monsters have their Hit Point capacity increased by x4 compared to Normal mode, and receive +3 HP to their totals after the multiplication occurs. In Hellfire, they possess a +100 bonus after the multiplication, resulting in foes with at least 100 Hit Points even in the Cathedral section.\nIt should also be noted that suffering melee damage from the later monsters on Hell difficulty will stun you, no matter your level or &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;. Players are better off avoiding most attacks rather than reducing the damage dealt per blow. This is more apparent in the regular Diablo, because there are no classes that possess a stun threshold higher than 1 point per level, and because of no &lt;a href=\"Reflect\"&gt;Reflect&lt;/a&gt;.\nCasters should be aware that their &lt;a href=\"Spellbook\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; planning will need to be adjusted for Hell Difficulty. There are even monsters which are immune to all elements of spell damage, resulting in a greater dependence on &lt;a href=\"Golem%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Curse\"&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo II.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and its expansion, \"\", both featured the same three difficulty tiers as in the previous game.\nNormal.\nCharacters that are created will start on this difficulty level. &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; and Summons deal 50% damage to &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;Act Boss&lt;/a&gt;es on this difficulty. If a character kills &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; in the non-expansion, they will gain a new &lt;a href=\"Titles\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; and the option to venture into Nightmare upon starting the game. Expansion pack players will instead receive the title upon successfully defeating &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the opportunity to adventure in &lt;a href=\"the%20Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;the Secret Cow Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the classic, playing without the expansion, either by not installing \"Lord of Destruction\" or leaving the checkbox blank during character creation, male characters will be titled Sir and female characters Dame. Hardcore will grant Count to male characters and Countess to female characters. With the expansion, the titles will be Slayer for Softcore and Destroyer for Hardcore.\nNightmare.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; in Normal will rob you of a sum of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stash\"&gt;Stash&lt;/a&gt;, Nightmare will also take 5% of your current level's &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; points away for dying; you can recover 75% of that total by retrieving your corpse. This does not affect Hardcore heroes, as death prevents the character from ever being played again.\nIn classic \"Diablo II\", male characters will be titled Lord and female characters Lady. Hardcore will grant Duke to male characters and Duchess to female characters. In the expansion, the titles will be Champion for Softcore and Conqueror for Hardcore upon defeating Baal. Players will now have access to Hell difficulty, where they will face the greatest challenges that the game has to offer, but also the opportunity for the very best loot.\nThe changes between Normal and Nightmare are as follows:\nHell.\nAs in Nightmare, dying will also take experience away, though now increased to 10%. Again, it does not affect Hardcore heroes, who cannot come back from death to begin with.\nIn classic Diablo II, male characters will be titled Baron and female characters Baroness. Hardcore will grant King to male characters and Queen to female characters. In the expansion, after defeating Baal in Softcore, male characters gain the title Patriarch while female characters gain the title Matriarch; in hardcore, all characters gain the title Guardian.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;\u00dcber Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Jordan%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Diablo Clone&lt;/a&gt; events can only be completed on Hell difficulty.\nDifferences between Normal and Hell include:\nDiablo Immortal.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" has the following difficulty tiers:\nThe last &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; boss on each difficulty must be defeated to unlock the next difficulty.\nDifficulty level can be changed anywhere, although outside of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; this counts as teleporting, therefore it takes time and can be interrupted, unless standing on a warp point. Normal, Hell I-III and Inferno I-III are three separate instances of the maps. Each instance has its own copy of monsters, bosses, events etc., and players can only interact with each other if they are in the same instance.\nHistory.\nStarting with the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo-immortal/23954933/embark-on-a-pilgrimage-of-dread-through-sanctuary%23Feature\"&gt;Embark on a Pilgrimage of Dread Through Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; update, players can switch difficulty levels anywhere.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Unending%20Storm\"&gt;Unending Storm&lt;/a&gt; update, the difficulties were reduced from 15 to 4. Hell I-VIII was merged into Hell I, Inferno I-III to Hell II and Inferno IV-VI to Hell III. The level ranges for the difficulties before the update were as follows:\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Manifest\"&gt;Nightmare Manifest&lt;/a&gt; update, new versions of Inferno I-III were added.\nIn the August 21 2024 update, the requirement to reach Paragon level 99 with maxed out experience to advance to Hell II was dropped.\nDiablo III.\nLike its predecessor, \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" featured Normal, Nightmare, and Hell difficulties. However, it was found by many to be either too easy or too difficult, so by release of 2.0, difficulty levels were made more complex, but also much more suited to an individual's playing ability.\nInferno.\nUpon release day, Inferno was the final difficulty mode. The lowest monster level found here was 61, which is 1 level higher than the level 60-cap for player characters. Monsters increased by one additional level for every act, up to level 63 in Act III.\n2.0/Reaper of Souls.\nAs of the pre-expansion patch for Diablo III, Normal, Hard, and Expert are unlocked at the start, Master requires the player to either destroy Diablo or reach level 60, and Torment requires a hero at level 60. The way the game's actual difficulty works depends on that of the host's character level. That is to say, as a hero levels up in power, so do his/her enemies. The bonuses granted by increasing difficulty are as follows:\nIn addition, starting from Expert onwards, Bounties give double &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s. Master and Torment I+ allow monsters level 61+ to drop Imperial quality &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;. Torment I+ allows new &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; to be found at level 70, and gives a specific bonus to finding those items, scaling with increased difficulty (approximately 15% with each level, stacking multiplicatively).\nOn Torment difficulty, if &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; takes too long (usually over 3 to 4 minutes) to defeat most of the game's bosses, they become Enraged, greatly lessening the hero's odds of achieving victory. For exact details on an Enrage timer, see the bosses' individual pages. There are two types of enrage effects: a soft enrage (the combat grows more difficult the longer it lasts, up to the point where it becomes overwhelming) and a hard enrage (once the time is up, it becomes much harder, if not impossible, to defeat the boss without overpowered gear). If a player wishes to avoid these effects, tracking their effective damage per second is advised.\nNote that a hero's gold find is multiplied by the difficulty level's bonus. As an example, a hero who has a equipped (+100% gold, or 2x) on Expert difficulty (also +100%, or 2x) will receive a total of +300% (4x), not just +200%.\nDiablo IV.\n\"Diablo IV\" currently has the following difficulty levels:\n\"Diablo IV\" originally used a &lt;a href=\"World%20Tier\"&gt;World Tier&lt;/a&gt; system."}

Therefore it's best to put only a few points in Dodge (perhaps only one as a prerequisite for &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;). Any skill bonus gear would then make Dodge more effective without wasting points.\nAny points put into Dodge grant Valkyrie summons a chance to dodge melee attacks. The percentage for the Valkyrie is based on the number of hard points allocated to Dodge only. +skill equipment increases the percentage for the Amazon but not the Valkyrie.\nBugs.\nThere's a nasty \"Dodge-Bug\" that can make playing an Amazon more frustrating. If the Amazon has an attack in progress and Dodges an enemy's attack, the remainder of the Amazon's attack has no effect. Unfortunately, the full animation sequence of the attack is completed. For example, if the Amazon launches a 10-arrow attack, but dodges an attack after arrow #2, the other 8 arrows in the sequence still show up on the screen but do not actually have any effect. The Amazon is still \"Strafe-Locked\" for the duration."}

At the end of the battle, there were only three survivors: Donan, along with the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Airidah\"&gt;Airidah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nafain\"&gt;Nafain&lt;/a&gt;. In truth, Astaroth was not killed but was sealed into a &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. To prevent a repeat of history, the three of them designed a ward that suppressed the corrupting influence of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, which was to be placed over the hiding place of the soulstone. After that Aridah returned to her hometown, to resume her duty as the keeper of the spirits of the ancestors. Nafain and Donan travelled to &lt;a href=\"Laglend%20Fern\"&gt;the edge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvered%20Edgelands\"&gt;the wilderness&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;, where they sealed it within an underground cave. Donan built the &lt;a href=\"Eldhaime%20Keep\"&gt;Eldhaime Keep&lt;/a&gt; above the cave, to further hide its location.\nAt some point, Donan sought counsel with &lt;a href=\"the%20Crone\"&gt;the Crone&lt;/a&gt;. Airidah cautioned him to approach her with deference.\nOver the years, Donan improved on the wards, and added more of his own. This turned the area around his new home to a consecrated ground. As a result, a settlement grew around the keep, turning it into an estate/small town. He became known as a hero in Scosglen.\nThe Knife Twists Again.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, Eldhaime Keep had grown into a town. It was also under the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. One day, as he was alone in his study, an alluring whisper reaches him, requesting entrance. In a trance, he follows the voice to a door (which was in truth a portal). At this other side he sees &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. Broken from his trance, he backs away in wary caution, with Lilith following him in. She asked him for the location of Astaroth, promising him great rewards, even offering to make him young again so he can be the hero he once was, slicing his lower lip with her right thumb in the process. Donan refused and rejected her, which caused her to disappear. Knowing that he had angered the demon, Donan fell into paranoia, increasing the guard patrol and calling his son, &lt;a href=\"Yorin\"&gt;Yorin&lt;/a&gt;, to come back from his post at &lt;a href=\"Brasteig\"&gt;Brasteig&lt;/a&gt; to visit him. After Yorin's leave was over, Donan was reluctant to let him go.\nTheir argument was interrupted by the arrival of the , who introduced themselves as being sent by &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt;. After Yorin left for his post, Donan directed them to &lt;a href=\"Firebreak%20Manor\"&gt;his mansion&lt;/a&gt;, where they would discuss in private. There, the wanderer informed him that they saw his confrontation with Lilith in a vision. Now intrigued, he told them about his history with Astaroth, and how he was one of the survivors that killed the demon. \nDonan suggested to the Wanderer to check on the other two survivors, in case Lilith visits them next. Donan directed them to meet Yorin at Brasteig, as Airidah lived near the settlement.\nLater, Lilith attacked Eldhaime Keep with &lt;a href=\"Amalgam%20of%20Rage\"&gt;a beast&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they tore through the defenses of the keep, sparing Donan before entering the caves beneath it. As he did the burial rites for the dead knights the Wanderer returned. He told them the events that transpired and the truth about Astaroth's fate. Together, they entered the tomb beneath the barracks. There, they found the soulstone missing, and\u2014through a vision seen by the Wanderer, discovered that Lilith had taken it and planted it in Yorin.\nDonan still held hope for Yorin, as he had been taught how to resist demonic influence. Donan suggested to the Wanderer that they check the nearby town of &lt;a href=\"Cerrigar\"&gt;Cerrigar&lt;/a&gt; which had enough innocent to burn, which would strengthen Astaroth and enable him to subdue Yorin. The duo arrived at &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Cerrigar\"&gt;Lower Cerrigar&lt;/a&gt; to find it burnt. Inside, Lilith awaited him from atop a ruined tower. When Donan asked her about Yorin, she replied that \"he\" had been waiting for him, and commanded \"him\" to come forth. A figure emerged from the smoke, revealing it to be a demon riding a beast (the same one that attacked Eldhaime). Donan broke down in grief when he noticed that the demon's attire was the half burnt remains of Yorin's armor. As he was catatonic, the Wanderer stepped forward to fight Astaroth.\nFollowing Yorin's death after being possessed by &lt;a href=\"Astaroth\"&gt;Astaroth&lt;/a&gt;, Donan fell into a festering grief, unable forgive himself for letting it happen. When Lorath asked him to repair Astaroth's soulstone to use agains Lilith, Donan's confidence was clouded by his grief and he was unable to repair it.\nSecrets Bartered, Fates Sold.\nDonan was later given a potion made by &lt;a href=\"Taissa\"&gt;Taissa&lt;/a&gt; to help him deal with the grief and finally come in terms with Yorin's death. The potion required several ingredients found in marsh and swamp, including ichor from the &lt;a href=\"Maggot%20Queen\"&gt;Maggot Queen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDonan is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". In the segments where Donan joins the player's party temporarily during certain campaign quests, he'll fight by casting magic, such as shooting lightning bolts, as well channel an arcane beam on his target reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nDonan was a brilliant and skilled Mage, who spent over 20 years studying and the craft of &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;soulstones&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their differences, &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath&lt;/a&gt; held Donan in great respect and regard, and recognized his abilities.\nHe was also an overly protective loving father to &lt;a href=\"Yorin\"&gt;Yorin&lt;/a&gt;, whose death after being possessed by &lt;a href=\"Astaroth\"&gt;Astaroth&lt;/a&gt; devastated the old Mage."}

Doom is a difficult runeword to make due to the very high-level Cham rune. It also requires Ohm and Lo runes which are usually used for the more popular Call to Arms, Grief, and Fortitude runewords.\nDoom can only be used in 2-handed hammers (such as Ogre and Thunder Mauls) because 1-handed hammers can't have more than 4 sockets. Classes that want to Doom a 1-handed weapon should choose either an Ettin Axe or Berserker Axe to make the most use of Doom's Enhanced Damage stat.\nDoom can work well with Shapeshifting &lt;a href=\"Druids\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt;. If socketed into a Thresher or Greater Poleaxe, it can later be handed down to an Act 2 mercenary when the Druid finds a better weapon. However, a Doomed Thresher on a mercenary will be harder to hit certain increased attack speed breakpoints compared to the Greater Poleaxe.\nOne of the best classes to use Doom would actually be a Paladin. Much like how a Paladin would use the Dream runeword, the Holy Freeze aura from Doom receives synergies from a Paladin's Resist Cold and Salvation skills. A Frost Zealot who uses Zeal and Holy Freeze as their main skills can shift all their points from Holy Freeze into Fanaticism, greatly increasing their power without ruining their playstyle. The difference between a Frost Zealot's level 20 Holy Freeze and the level 12 Holy Freeze provided by Doom is mostly in the range of its aura.\nResult:"}

Concept art of the class originally showed the character with longer hair and being based around the use of &lt;a href=\"Staff\"&gt;Staves&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs part of the development of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;\"Diablo III\" Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Team%203\"&gt;Team 3&lt;/a&gt; looked at the Diablo II version. They concluded that it had a strong necromatic theme, but not a &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; one, hence the desire to distinguish between the two versions thematically."}

It was revealed at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The core concept is based on the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;original class of the same name&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nA &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, this young, enigmatic Necromancer has a strong, dark personality, and is able to see things which other mortals cannot. He/she holds the rank of acolyte, and possesses no relation to the &lt;a href=\"Xul\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; who defeated &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; two decades prior.\nStory.\nThis Necromancer was the student of Master Necromancer &lt;a href=\"Ordan\"&gt;Ordan&lt;/a&gt; and trained for many years. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Ordan learnt of the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;, which had awoken the dead in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. He bid his student travel there to return them to their graves. The Necromancer sensed a need for their unique power and answered the call on behalf of their order despite leaving with their training incomplete.\nIn-game.\nNecromancers in \"Diablo III\" are very similar to the \"Diablo II\" class, and retain most of their skills. In combat, they rely on bone and &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; spells, &lt;a href=\"Curses\"&gt;Curses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Golems\"&gt;Golems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; minions. The three &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; types are &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; (blight), &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; (blood and bone) and &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; (chill of the grave). As such, &lt;a href=\"Convention%20of%20Elements\"&gt;Convention of Elements&lt;/a&gt; is especially effective for Necromancers.\nThe Necromancer's core stat is &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Necromancer is available in the \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Necromancer\"&gt;Rise of the Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;\" pack, released at the same time as patch 2.6.0 came out. The pack was released on June 27 of 2017, and costs $14.99 USD in North America. To use the pack, one needs to have \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" installed for PC or have the \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Evil%20Edition\"&gt;Ultimate Evil Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" for console. New achievements were implemented along with the Necromancer.\nThe Necromancer is playable in both &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, fully voiced, and has new &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt;s to flesh out their backstory. New technology has been developed for the Necromancer, as it's an effects-heavy class. The player using the Necromancer will see the full effects of skill-use, while players in a party will see a more basic visual display.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s and Necromancers share many similarities, Blizzard has noted a few differences. Witch Doctors are more lighthearted, while Necromancers are more dark and grim (using &lt;a href=\"Curses\"&gt;Curses&lt;/a&gt;, Blood, and Bone). Necromancers have few &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; spells, and no &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; attacks, as that is the prerogative of Witch Doctor; to compensate, all Necromancer pets are controllable to some degree, unlike those of Witch Doctor. The Necromancer avoids the slapstick humor of the Witch Doctor, as the Necromancer class is not meant to be funny.\nOn the Hero Creation screen, the following is stated: \"Formidable opponents to even the most experienced warrior, Necromancers manipulate corpses, summon the dead, or curse their enemies to drain the life from them. Necromancers naturally sense the Essence within each lifeform, and their magic draws from this source.\" \nClass Items.\nThe Necromancer originally had less than four &lt;a href=\"Set\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt;s, to leave room for the community to come up with new playstyles and have those added onto new sets. Eventually, a total of 4 full sets was given, each complete with a &lt;a href=\"Set%20Dungeon\"&gt;Set Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. These do not count towards &lt;a href=\"Wings%20of%20the%20Dedicated\"&gt;Wings of the Dedicated&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wings%20of%20Mastery\"&gt;Wings of Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, instead rewarding their own two pennants.\nPlaystyles are extremely varied for the class. There are six Necromancer sets, all of them level 70 only:\nThe aesthetics for these sets are a \"Plague Doctor\"-esque set, Ossuary construct-themed set, a Dracula-esque set, and an Gothic-esque set with over-the-top gold elements. Some obvious Necromancer themes are better represented in items, sets, or animations rather than skills. For instance, Priest of Rathma themes are present in items. The developers tried to avoid too many class-specific items for the Necromancer.\nOne-handed and two-handed &lt;a href=\"Scythes\"&gt;Scythes&lt;/a&gt; are the Necromancer's class weapon type, and &lt;a href=\"Phylacteries\"&gt;Phylacteries&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; items (replacing &lt;a href=\"Shrunken%20Heads\"&gt;Shrunken Heads&lt;/a&gt;). They can also use &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; and all other non-class-specific melee weapon types except &lt;a href=\"polearms\"&gt;polearms&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul%27s%20Wings\"&gt;Trag'Oul's Wings&lt;/a&gt; are a special reward for collecting all Necromancer class achievements (can be used by any class once obtained).\nSkills.\nThe Necromancer's resource is called &lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt; and caps out at 200. It does not regenerate automatically, however, it is gained from using skills.\nThe Necromancer was designed with three themes: Blood and Bone, Frost, and Blight. Blood skills are more powerful, but cost health; Frost isn't about blizzards or frostbolts, but more about the cold and isolation surrounding graves and death; Blight, similar to a death and decay theme, encompasses debuffs, snares, and the idea of things withering away.\nNecromancer &lt;a href=\"Pets\"&gt;Pets&lt;/a&gt; are all Active/Passive, like the &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;'s Mantras, letting the player command them. There is no pet command interface different from the standard UI.\nMonster &lt;a href=\"Corpse\"&gt;Corpse&lt;/a&gt;s in the world serve as a secondary resource for some skills. They are only visible to Necromancers, and appear regardless of whether or not an actual monster corpse was &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt;. There is a whole category of skills called Corpses, devoted to different ways of utilizing them, such as &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;detonating them for area of effect damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Lance\"&gt;using them to create deadly missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devour\"&gt;consuming them&lt;/a&gt; for Essence, or &lt;a href=\"Revive%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;reanimating them as minions&lt;/a&gt;. Because many Necromancer skills are focused on corpses being available, one should anticipate swapping skills based on current situation.\nFor group play, each Necromancer sees their own corpses. For same screen co-op on consoles, corpses may have two charges. Corpses eventually despawn when off screen. There are skills and skill runes that can \"create\" corpses so that player always has access to some even if there are no lesser enemies around.\nA lot of Necromancer Blood skills cost &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; along with Essence, so there are a lot of mechanics built in to recoup lost health.\nOriginally, there was no special Shapeshift spell, just like with Witch Doctors, but &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Land of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; took this role later.\nMost Necromancer skills feature an optional Poison &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Rune\"&gt;Skill Rune&lt;/a&gt;, however, as the Witch Doctor is heavily based on poison, the developers didn't want the Necromancer to be too similar in this regard.\nSacrificing health to benefit pets isn't currently being considered; however, &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Mage%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Life Support&lt;/a&gt; and similar mechanics fulfill this role.\nPopular Necromancer skill combinations include:\nDevelopment.\nPre-Development.\nIn Diablo III, the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; bears many elements of the Necromancer class. However, the Witch Doctor was not designed to be a replacement for the Necromancer, and the game's developers stated in 2008 that if there was ever to be a playable Necromancer class for Diablo III, the presence of the Witch Doctor would not prevent them from implementing it. According to &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, a key difference between the classes is that the Witch Doctor is more inclined to deal direct damage than the Necromancer, which aside from specific builds, was pet heavy. There was a desire to implement the Necromancer post-release, so the skills of the Witch Doctor were designed to avoid overlap with a possible future necromancer class.\nActive Development.\nThe Necromancer's implementation in Diablo III came out of a \"game jam session\"; a practice Blizzard employs where members of a team get a few days, or even up to a week, to \"go wild\" in regards to generating ideas. Out of one such session came the idea of bringing the Necromancer into Diablo III. The Diablo II Necromancer was the jumping off point for the Diablo III version. The idea was to see if the developers could take the original class, and adapt it for the faster-paced, more skill-orientated Diablo III. The concept was well received, and the game jam session became the \"create the Necromancer exercise.\" This was around the time when Blizzard was looking at the upcoming 20th anniversary of the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" series, so it seemed appropriate in their eyes to bring the Necromancer back. When implementing the class various ideas were pitched from various departments within Blizzard. This included a \"king of the dead,\" \"the cryptkeeper,\" and \"the hunter\" concepts, reflected in the Necromancer's armor design. What was settled on was the \"commander\" concept and by extension, the \"rock star\" idea, of leading an entourage of skeletons.\nThematically, the Diablo III Necromancer is based around blood. As part of the development process, the developers looked at the classes of Diablo II, opinioning that the themes of the previous classes were not as well fleshed out as they could have been. Specifically, the Diablo II Necromancer had little blood interaction, but did have a strong necromancy theme. Hence, it was decided to attempt a blood-themed Necromancer for Diablo III.\nIn an early build, the Necromancer had the ability to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;. It has been replaced with &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rush\"&gt;Blood Rush&lt;/a&gt; since.\nNecromancer artwork leaked ahead of &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt;, showing a male and female Necromancer, mirroring Diablo III's gender selection. The Necromancer was confirmed as a class at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the event, the Necromancer was still in development, with only the male model finalized. As of December 2016, the Necromancer's skills were still being developed.\nThe Necromancer's skills are designed to be \"grounded and visceral.\" They are based on the visual identity of the Necromancer, with the intention of reflecting the dark and sinister nature of the Diablo II Necromancer.\nA beta test will be held for the Necromancer. Legendary and set items will be added to the game for the Necromancer's use over time.\nThe developers practiced \"DoT avoidance\" - meaning they wanted to focus on more hard-hitting, visceral skills. &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Day\"&gt;Travis Day&lt;/a&gt; wanted to avoid runes that were straightforward, obvious choices (for example, simply dealing more damage for that particular skill), instead, Necromancer runes are intended to be more focused on trade offs, such as lowering a skill's radius for increased damage.\nThe developers learned a lot about cheat death passives with the &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, and they realized all of the passives should be on the Crusader's level.\nPoison skills, such as &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Nova\"&gt;Poison Nova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Dagger\"&gt;Poison Dagger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Explosion\"&gt;Poison Explosion&lt;/a&gt; won't be carried over from Diablo II, as the Witch Doctor covers a lot of potential Poison skills that could be used in the Diablo III Necromancer. The developers didn't want to force Poison skills if they weren't viable. Poison will be represented in the \"Blight\" theme.\nThe Necromancer wasn't designed for the group meta or with a support role in mind. Instead, it was designed around sets and playstyles. However, the Necromancer does seem viable in a support role thanks to pets and curses.\nTrivia.\n\"I simply cannot.\"\n\"What would the skeletons think?\"\n[Emphaticaly]: \"I do not dance.\""}
{"id": "42706", "revid": "55464849", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=42706", "title": "Necromancer (Diablo IV)", "text": "The Necromancer is a playable &lt;a href=\"class%20\"&gt;class &lt;/a&gt;in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGameplay.\nNecromancers have four high-level playstyles: Bone, Darkness, Blood, and the Army. Among their spells are debuff skills called Curses, with Decrepify and Iron Maiden returning. &lt;a href=\"Scythes\"&gt;Scythes&lt;/a&gt; are the class-specific items of Necromancers, and &lt;a href=\"Swords\"&gt;Swords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daggers\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wands\"&gt;Wands&lt;/a&gt;, Focuses, and &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt; can also be equipped. The Necromancer is currently the highest-damaging class in the game, thanks to the array of versatile burst damage options.\nThe Necromancer utilizes two resources: Essence, a slow regenerating resource that is also gained by using basic skills; and Corpses, which come from fallen enemies or can be generated from certain effects.\nBone.\nA classic direct offense and enemy detaining skills, the new iteration of Bone skills are supplemented by effects such as Critical Strike and benefit from a large Essence pool.\nThe battlefield can be divided with Bone Prison, to either restrict enemies into certain areas or enclose them in a narrow space to facilitate area of effect skills. Bone Spirit is a foe-seeking missile that explodes on impact, but has a cooldown and consumes all Essence though with the benefit of its firepower increased per point of Essence spent.\nDarkness.\nDarkness skills are a new addition to the Necromancer, seemingly a reinterpretation of poison, decay, and curses, consolidated into the Shadow magic category. Offensively, they either deal damage over time or attack multiple times in a short window. Also, these skills tend to induce debuffs and crowd control effects.\nDecompose is a basic channeled Darkness skill that deals damage over time on a single while channeled, grants Essence in the process, and periodically summons corpses that can be used to summon skeletons.\nBlood.\nBlood skills are expressed differently from their predecessors, but they retain the ability to heal. These skills benefit from a large &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; pool and their usage proficiency is dependent on targeting multiple enemies, thus character positioning is critical to maximize these skills' effect. For example Blood Surge's explosion increases based on the number of enemies from which blood was siphoned.\nBlood Mist is a survival-oriented movement skill, that makes the caster immune to damage, drains life of enemies around the Necromancer, and grants mobility for retreat or a better vantage point.\nThe Army.\nThe Army skills deal with reanimated foes and golems. Skeletal Warriors and Mages are summoned by the Raise Skeleton skill, an extra skill on the skill bar, though each require a corpse to be summoned.\nBy design, the Army playstyle attempts to address the problem of past games where minion builds require heavy minion investment or maintenance, often making certain skills mandatory and excluding most from use. This new system averts this problem, and enables and encourages skill flexibility between minion and non-minion skills. Therefore a player can pursue a Bone, Darkness, or Blood playstyle and integrate this with the Army skills, which act as a separate layer that doesn't override and may synergize with the chosen playstyle.\nBook of the Dead.\nThe Book of the Dead is a unique Necromancer-specific skill mechanic that allows the player to customize the Necromancer's minions, how minions are deployed, which minions the player can have, and how they behave.\nThe core skills center on three summons: skeleton warriors and mages, and a golem. Each summon has three variants to choose from. And each variant has three modifications: two Upgrades (only one may be active at atime) and Sacrifice, which disables summoning that minion in exchange for conferring a permanent buff to the Necromancer.\nThe player may choose a minion-less playstyle by setting Skeletal Warriors, Skeletal Mages, and Golems to Sacrifice, buffing the Necromancer directly. Which buff the class receives depends on which summon variant is sacrificed. For example, a sacrificed Blood Golem grants a 10% increase to the character's maximum Life while a sacrificed Iron Golem grants \u00d730% Critical Strike Damage.\nDevelopment.\nThe Necromancer was chosen as the fifth class because it focuses on the theme of \"return to darkness\" that Diablo IV represents, particularly through the class' working with the occult, dark magic, and summoning the undead.\nThe goal for the class's system was that players are able to play with the full army, part of the army, or even forgo their army completely and play solo. The Book of the Dead feature remains beneficial to builds without any minions.\nThe Army playstyle had undergone many iterations of how the experience of summoning the undead would feel for the player, and how much of the skill bar should be dedicated to the Necromancer. The playstyle that was chosen was where the players would have as much customization as possible over not only their army itself, but also in which other skills they want to use to support their own unique playstyle."}

By killing these monsters, players can 'avenge' their friend's death and earn special rewards. Among these rewards are &lt;a href=\"Player%20Gift\"&gt;Player Gift&lt;/a&gt;s and possible chances of rare or legendary items. They can also spawn in co-op games for players in the same instance. The Nemesis will spawn in your world based on your profile, ignoring your &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;character level&lt;/a&gt; while keeping what ever levels it has gained. They do not appear for &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; characters.\nOnce a player is killed by a monster, there is a chance of a red void portal appearing near the character's body, indicating that the Nemesis has been created (Elite monsters seems to have higher chances to create a Nemesis). After that, it will seek a random player in the friends list that is currently online and infiltrate his/her game, though it's not always instantly. If there are no friends currently online and playing the game, the Nemesis will randomly appear when one of them logs in. If the player has no friends on the friends list, the Nemesis will appear in their game if they have a cursed item, but instead of bearing the name \"Nemesis\" it will say \"Fallen (class name)\"; it will still function like a normal Nemesis, keeping all of its levels.\nThe Nemesis form is similar to 's (regardless of the actual monster that birthed it), and is always accompanied by one or more &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Clone\"&gt;Shadow Clone&lt;/a&gt;s of the dead players, representing their characters. These clones will have the name \"Fallen (class name)\". Should the player die in a fight against a Nemesis, both the Nemesis and the shadows will disappear, and the creature will become even stronger and seek another player among the friend's friends. If the player defeats the Nemesis, the shadows will also disappear, meaning they won't have to be defeated too.\nBefore a Nemesis arrives in your world, a distinctive War Horn will sound a few times, followed by your game pad rumbling (if the feature is active). After about 3~4 warning horns, the Nemesis will spawn through its portal. When the portal forms, it releases a shockwave that will kill minor enemies within roughly 50~75 yards from the portal, though monsters behind walls appear to be safe. The Nemesis is able to spawn in a &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;, which will make things very difficult if it shows up near other &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;Elite Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nAffixes the Nemesis possesses includes Illusionist, Vortex, and red versions of Orbiter and Arcane Enchanted."}

The offspring of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, their existence would forever alter the balance of power in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nNephalem are much stronger than humans; they stood slightly taller than &lt;a href=\"aurochs\"&gt;aurochs&lt;/a&gt;. Like humans, nephalem possess &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s, which are different from those of angels and demons.\nNephalem are naturally immortal; they do not succumb to age, and are immune to plague. They can still be killed, however. Subsequent nephalem generations lost their immortality due to &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;'s tampering with the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; (eventually becoming the mortal race known as Man), while the &lt;a href=\"Firstborn\"&gt;Firstborn&lt;/a&gt; managed to retain theirs.\nIt is possible for nephalem and humans to produce offspring.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\n&lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was created by the rogue angel &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and his demon confidante, &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. They led a group of renegade demons and angels where they created a new world through the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, one where they would be free from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. In an act without precedent, Inarius and Lilith mated and created offspring. In time, other renegade demons and angels did likewise and produced offspring of their own. Thus, the nephalem were born\u2014the children of both angels and demons, yet a new entity in their own right.\nThe first generation of nephalem were called &lt;a href=\"the%20Ancients\"&gt;the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that they set out exploring, seeking answers, attempting to understand the world in which they lived. Millennia after their birth, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; speculated that thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of these Ancients existed, though by the time of his life, only the names of &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vasily\"&gt;Vasily&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esu\"&gt;Esu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt; were remembered, and treated more like deities. It is known that these Ancients developed along different lines from each other, including the cultures they fostered. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; would later believe that some early nephalem were born more demon than angel, resulting in &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20Phantasm\"&gt;Phantasms&lt;/a&gt; that would haunt Sanctuary far into the future. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt; was constructed in honor of these early nephalem. The nephalem were aware of their own divided natures, and as such, created their &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Guardian\"&gt;Temple Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s to be incorruptible.\nAs their numbers continued to grow, nephalem civilization spread across Sanctuary, ranging from great cities, to &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, to simple camps. In the early days of the nephalem, they did not have a concept of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, at least in as much as it applied to themselves. In their early days, no nephalem gave injury to another, and as such, had no need for burial. To best knowledge, &lt;a href=\"Gratian\"&gt;Gratian&lt;/a&gt; was the first nephalem to perish, slain by &lt;a href=\"Ahduma\"&gt;Ahduma&lt;/a&gt;, followed closely by &lt;a href=\"Bersarik\"&gt;Bersarik&lt;/a&gt;, who was slain by &lt;a href=\"Kalmor\"&gt;Kalmor&lt;/a&gt;. This marked a watershed moment in nephalem history, as they became aware of their own mortality, and based on certain interpretations, their deaths may have altered the nature of Sanctuary itself. Death began to find the nephalem, spreading across Sanctuary, but this was offset by the first generation birthing children, and their children giving birth in turn.\nOn another front, things were not well among the nephalem's parents, for their offspring were far more powerful than either angel or demon. Their forebears feared that not only might the nephalem become a threat, but might draw the attention of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; to Sanctuary. They knew that the co-mingling of their kind would be declared blasphemous, and that they would be destroyed if their refuge were discovered. Thus, some of the renegades called for the nephalem to be eradicated, while others believed they should be spared. The dissension troubled Inarius, who called for a period of reflection, so that each of his subjects could consider the matter in solitude.\nThe Rise of Man.\nLilith was driven into a mad frenzy by the threat of her children's extinction. Morphing into a horrific beast, she hunted down and murdered her fellow renegades, lest they do the same to the nephalem. Enraged at her actions, Inarius could not bring himself to kill his beloved and thus banished her to the Void. Subsequently, the angel attuned the Worldstone in such a manner to cause the powers of the nephalem to diminish over time. Thus, the nephalem became weaker over each subsequent generation, their lifespans declining. Some of the nephalem knew what had happened. Those who protested were crushed by Inarius, and the others scattered. Others were unaware of what Inarius had done, and thought they were succumbing to some kind of plague. As they weakened, the civilizations the nephalem had established began to splinter, and they fell into a dark age. Eventually, the nephalem became mortals, giving rise to the race called &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, a weaker, mortal species, without knowledge of its birthright. It was still possible for nephalem and humans to produce offspring together.\nYet the potential to reclaim its old glory still rested in humanity. It was this potential power that drew the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; to humanity, beginning what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. In the last stages of the conflict, the Worldstone was altered by &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;, who began to manifest powers befitting a nephalem, as did his &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; followers. However, as the last battle raged, he realized that the power being regained was too much over too short of a time, and if the nephalem were to be left unchecked, it would doom all of Sanctuary. In an act of self-sacrifice, he brought back his raging energies into himself before releasing them one final time, resetting and suppressing the power of the Worldstone, and stripping his followers of their powers. It was an act that ended the Sin War and convinced the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; to leave humanity to its own devices, seeing that they could follow the path of light as well as dark.\nIt was believed by some that by the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23285\"&gt;third century&lt;/a&gt;, there were no nephalem left in the world, though this turned out to be false.\nReturn of the Nephalem.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, the Worldstone was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, lest humanity be turned to Chaos through &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption of the relic. Thus, the mortal realm was left exposed to both Heaven and Hell. However, within a &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; walked in the world, their powers rivaling that of their distant ancestors. Going by the moniker \"the Nephalem,\" they defeated &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, bringing an end to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt; and saving both Heaven and the mortal realm from destruction. Soon afterwards, Sanctuary was saved by the Nephalem again, after defeating &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time of the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Cult\"&gt;Blood Cult&lt;/a&gt;, a number of nephalem had arisen within Sanctuary; few in number, but great in strength. The demon &lt;a href=\"Vidian\"&gt;Vidian&lt;/a&gt; used the cult and his own machinations to lure these nephalem into the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, where their blood was spilt and drained. Vidian was eventually defeated by the same nephalem that had defeated Diablo and Malthael.\nWhen the Black Soulstone was destroyed, a number of its fragments wound up in Sanctuary, still carrying the essences of the Great Evils. A number of nephalem sought out these shards, but they had to be careful, given the allure of such power.\nThe Great Enmity.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Warmth%20%28Cult%29\"&gt;Mother's Warmth&lt;/a&gt; (a cult dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;) hunted down humans in order to lay claim to their nephalem birthright. Not long afterwards, &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s under the command of Lord &lt;a href=\"Zir\"&gt;Zir&lt;/a&gt; fed on human &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim their nephalem birthright.\nKnown Nephalem.\nCurrent Generation.\nManifestations.\nThe following individuals have had nephalem powers manifest, but aren't necessarily nephalem themselves:\nMany &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s have also shown signs of their nephalem heritage.\nIn-game.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", nephalem spirits are fought as enemies in various contexts.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", each player character is a nephalem, and referred to as such when described in a narrative sense. It has been stated that because of the requirements of the narrative, and as such, no angel &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; is available in the game. &lt;a href=\"Kalmor\"&gt;Kalmor&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered in , being the last living nephalem of the pre-Sin War period. However, interestingly, he will not recognize the Nephalem as one of his kind."}

They are available in the game's &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; and use a randomized dungeon system.\nLore.\nNephalem Rifts are alternate realities to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, accessible from the mortal realm, where &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; test their strength, in order to prove their worth. A number of nephalem have fallen inside these rifts, and astute nephalem are able to listen to their petrified screams, finding themselves attuned to the last moments of their kin.\nGameplay.\nRift runs last 10-20 minutes (on adequate difficulty) and consist of random areas and monsters. &lt;a href=\"Unique%20monsters\"&gt;Unique monsters&lt;/a&gt; cannot spawn in the Rifts, but &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s can. Monsters that can normally ambush or flee from the player will not do so, or will do so much less often, in the Rifts.\nThe layouts stem from taking the tilesets and dungeons of the game and re-organizing/shuffling them. Monsters are likewise re-shuffled, found in combinations otherwise not present. The rifts have 1-10 levels. Each level is effectively a different dungeon, with a different monster combination (completely independent from the normal monster type set for that zone).\u00a0\nThe Rift is accessed via any of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Obelisk\"&gt;Nephalem Obelisk&lt;/a&gt;s, and can be opened at any time, at no cost. As of patch 2.3, &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Keystone%20Fragment\"&gt;Keystones&lt;/a&gt; are no longer required for it.\nDuring the event, a progress bar will appear just beneath the game's mini-map, starting at 0%. To fill it to 100%, player needs to kill enemies; until patch 2.1, exactly\u00a0999 kills were needed, each enemy regardless of type counted as just one, but as of 2.1, more powerful foes count as more than one kill, and least potent foes can count as a portion of a kill, or even not count towards it at all (see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.warpath.eu/mp.html\"&gt;the full list&lt;/a&gt; for details). As of patch 2.3, &lt;a href=\"progress%20orb\"&gt;progress orb&lt;/a&gt;s drop from &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;Elite Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, adding extra progress for killing Champion and Rares. Each elite pack drops 3 or 4, and each orb adds 1% to the progress bar.\nOnce the bar reaches 100%, a random &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0boss will spawn near the player (it is marked by characteristic sound, &lt;a href=\"Orek\"&gt;Orek&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement, and darkening of the sky, so it's very hard to miss).\u00a0After the boss's death, player can speak to &lt;a href=\"Orek\"&gt;Orek&lt;/a&gt; to receive a substantial &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and experience reward. After receiving the reward, the Rift will be forcibly closed in 30 seconds, so players will need to pick up their desired loot before turning in the 'quest'. Any players still in the Rift when it is closed will be teleported back to town. One may, however, finish the rift before turning the quest in, killing remaining monsters for extra loot.\n&lt;a href=\"Pylons\"&gt;Pylons&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0appear only in Nephalem Rifts and provide a huge 30-60 second buff to the party.\n&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; drop rates are increased in Nephalem Rifts, the exact bonus depending on the chosen difficulty. The bonus starts at 25%, increased to 44% at &lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment I&lt;/a&gt;, and increasing all the way to 901% at Torment XIII (that is, 10 times). This bonus suppresses (but exceeds by half or even more!) the increased legendary drop chance in the\u00a0Torment\u00a0difficulties (so, on average, a player that would get 7 times more Legendaries than on Normal at TXIII outside the Rifts, will gain 10 times more Legendaries than on Normal while in the Rift). See &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; for detailed chart.\nGreater Rifts.\nGreater Rifts\u00a0- sometimes called Tiered Rifts during development - provide a way for players to test their mettle beyond the highest levels of Torment difficulty. To access a Greater Rift, players must get a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift%20Keystone\"&gt;Greater Rift Keystone&lt;/a&gt; from any normal &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Vision of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;. As a Greater Rift is being opened, players must select a rank for it, which determines the damage and health of enemies inside, as well as the quality of loot received at the end, similar to regular game &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; tiers. The rank selected also determines the chances of success at upgrading &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt;, and qualifies the character for placement on Greater Rift &lt;a href=\"Leaderboard\"&gt;Leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHigher Greater Rift levels must be unlocked by completing lower ones first. The maximum rank that can be selected is based on those already completed, plus up to 9 levels higher depending on their best completion time. Levels available, and conditions inside the Greater Rift, are unrelated to the difficulty of the main game. Greater Rift levels have no limit, and most high level players can complete Greater Rifts of significantly higher level than the maximum &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; difficulty.\nGreater Rifts were added in patch 2.1. Before patch 2.3, the levels accessible were determined by performance in the Realm of Trials, a required intermediate phase between Nephalem and Greater Rifts.\nGreater Rifts differ from Nephalem Rifts in the following ways:\nIn the end, players can speak to &lt;a href=\"Urshi\"&gt;Urshi&lt;/a&gt;, who will upgrade their Legendary Gems (success chance depends on the difference between gem rank and rift rank). Urshi only offers her services if the Guardian is defeated in time.\nRegardless of whether or not the player completes the Rift on time, the Greater Rift Key is lost and must be obtained anew in normal Nephalem Rifts. If one completes a Greater Rift before the time expires, they may unlock a higher difficulty. Should their time be exceptionally good, they might even skip up to 9 levels. If time instead expires, the player may still complete the current Greater Rift, but will not get the upgrades for gems in the end. Their best results are posted to the appropriate &lt;a href=\"Leaderboard\"&gt;Leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGreater Rift Keystone Level Upgrade Times.\nThe chart below shows how much spare time player(s) must have \"remaining\" (out of the 15 minutes total) after the Rift Guardian is dead in order to unlock the corresponding number of ranks for completing the current Greater Rift.\nExample: if a player completes a rank 25 (T6) Rift in 12 minutes, leaving 3:00 minutes remaining, Rifts up to rank 26 (25 + 1) will be unlocked. After that, completing an additional level 25 Rift with less than 4:30 remaining will not unlock a new Rift rank. If that same player completes a level 25 Rift with more than 4:31 remaining, they will unlock additional ranks corresponding to the chart above, and can choose to play those ranks to continue unlocking Rift ranks.\nEmpowered Rifts.\nEmpowering a Rift option was added in Patch 2.4.\nBefore starting a Greater Rift, the player can empower it by spending &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of gold a player needs to spend to empower a rift scales with Rift rank.\nAn empowered Rift grants +1 attempt to upgrade Legendary Gems in the end (to a total of 4), in addition to the extra +1 attempt for a rift without any deaths (up to a total of 5). Gold is paid regardless of whether or not it will be beaten successfully; if Rift is failed, no upgrades will be awarded.\nEmpowering a Rift is performed by checking a box below the Rift rank selection list. If checked, it will replace the Accept button with gold cost.\nCost is actually rather high: hundreds of thousands or even millions of gold per rank, each next rank costs more. The gold cost was drastically reduced in patches 2.4.2-2.4.3 (along with gold drop rate, to compensate), prior to which it could be extremely high. Sample current rates are:\nChallenge Rifts.\nChallenge Rifts were added in Patch 2.6.0. They take a snapshot an actual player\u2019s build from the game each week and let other players use the build in a static dungeon. This allows players to easily discover new builds.\nChallenge rifts are entered from the Main Menu, outside of other game modes. The first time completing a Challenge Rift each week rewards a special cache that contains large quantities of crafting materials, plus 10 &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Breath\"&gt;Death's Breath&lt;/a&gt;. The reward is mailed to the regular characters on the account.\nDevelopment.\nThe concept for Nephalem Rifts existed as early as the pre-release version of Diablo III.\nDuring development, Nephalem Rifts were originally called \"Loot Runs.\"\u00a0In the beta of \"Reaper of Souls\", completion of the rift rewarded the player a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Horadric%20Cache\"&gt;Greater Horadric Cache&lt;/a&gt;. RNG in Rifts is going to be tweaked to make times more comparable. More similar density levels is expected. Rift-only zones are also being looked at.\nDuring the PTR, the maximum rank of a Greater Rift used to be 100. In the released game, there is no cap.\nThe idea of Nephalem Rifts is based on the community-proposed idea of endless dungeons with ever-increasing difficulty.\nPrior to patch 2.3, players had to choose either upgrading gems or increasing rift rank in the end. Upgrading gems would conclude the run.\nRealm of Trials.\nPrior to patch 2.3, the Realm of Trials used to be the next step in the Rift journey, in which\u00a0players could fend off increasingly difficult waves of monsters.\nTo access a Realm of Trials, players had to complete a regular Nephalem Rift in Torment difficulty. When the Rift Guardian was defeated, they'd have a chance to drop a &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Key of Trials&lt;/a&gt; which opened the Realm of Trials. This chance was high enough to get a Key on nearly every run, however, it was greatly reduced if the player already had it, or a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift%20Keystone\"&gt;Greater Rift Keystone&lt;/a&gt;, in their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"stash\"&gt;stash&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player could then use this new key at the Nephalem Obelisk, similar to other Rift Fragments. Upon doing so, all ongoing effects were be cleared, and all &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s were reset. The player(s) would be teleported instantly and irreversibly into the Realm of Trials (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Realm of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, but with 3 &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Well\"&gt;Healing Well&lt;/a&gt;s around), and after a brief preparation time, the waves would start to pour through. Each wave was 10-20 random monsters from any Act, due to be killed in 20 seconds. Their difficulty settings were matching those of the corresponding Rift rank. If the player killed a wave in time, the ranking will be raised by up to 6, depending on remaining amount of time. Waves spawned immediately one after another (as soon as the last monster of the previous wave dies), giving no pause to the character.\nAs of patch 2.1.1, each monster group was guaranteed to include at least one monster of each class:\u00a0low-Life creatures that die quickly, mid-ranged enemies, tanky damage-soakers, and more consistent damage-dealers.\nDifficulty of the resulting Rift would match the current wave reached minus three (four for 2 players, five for 3 players, six for 4 players). Dying within the Realm would not reset it, and would not cause the player to lose a Key (although for &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; characters, this death was real). Player could even revive and finish the wave on time, if they managed to do it quickly enough. Once the time ran out, all remaining monsters died, and a Key was obtained. After that, a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0opened, and Orek would even award some &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, reward based on the rank beaten.\nAs of patch 2.3.0, the Realm of Trials was removed from the game. Nephalem Rift Guardians now drop Greater Rift Keystones outright."}

It was intended, among other systems, to make sure that the end game was fun, exciting, and balanced so that a 3-minute run of the same area would not be the most efficient way to acquire loot.\nNephalem Valor was one of the major new systems in Diablo III and it became active at level 60. The philosophy stated by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; was as follows:\nIn the PC version, Nephalem Valor could be stacked as high as 5, with each stack offering +15% Magic Find, Gold Find, and a multiplicative modifier to EXP gained. The Magic/Gold find was allowed to go past the maximum cap of 300% by however much the stacks grant. So players who had already reached the cap could still accrue up to 75% Magic/Gold find from their Nephalem Valor.\nFor console games, the exact amount of magic find and gold find provided by the buff was +25%. It could stack up to 3 times (to a total of +75%) and would last 30 minutes. The duration could be refreshed by killing additional elite packs, opening a resplendent chest, or completing an Event. However, the buff would not grow to more than a stack of 3 (+75% gold find, magic item find, and experience).\nThis system was implemented to encourage players to stick with a skill build of their choice, select an area of the game they enjoy, and sweep it for elite and champion packs on their way to a boss (the buff is not refreshed when killing a rare - violet - enemy), finishing off a run with a boss that'll be worth killing. If the player wanted a shorter play session, they could be done at that point, but if they had more time, the path of least resistance would ideally be to stay in the same game and make their way towards the next boss."}

Nereza agreed, but instead turned them into misshapen creatures that waged war against their brethren. Her forces overcome the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; defenders, and they were reduced to &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, doomed to play out the battle over and over.\nNereza later came to reside on &lt;a href=\"Greyhollow%20Island\"&gt;Greyhollow Island&lt;/a&gt;. She was there at the inception of the civilization that formed upon the island. She was worshipped as a goddess by a cult of the island's inhabitants who would regularly perform human sacrifices to feed her. They believed that, with sacrifices, she would protect the island from evil forces. However, &lt;a href=\"Rayeld\"&gt;Rayeld&lt;/a&gt;, son of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Cleric\"&gt;High Cleric&lt;/a&gt;, killed her physical body after realizing that she was the evil itself.

It was known that the people of Greyhollow devoted themselves to a female being that was there from the civilization's beginning, but theories ranged that this woman was a &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, or simply a very charismatic &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; who managed to prolong her existence. It has even been suggested that there was no one individual, but rather a multitude of individuals who all took on the same identity of the same figure. Whether Nereza had caused Greyhollow's fall, or whether her death precipitated, became unclear in history.\nIn-game.\nHer corpse (suspiciously intact) can be found at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Tower\"&gt;Ancient Tower&lt;/a&gt; on Greyhollow Island along with the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Sara\"&gt;Sara&lt;/a&gt;, the sacrifice Rayeld spared."}

She excelled in playing cards and reading the faces of her opponents. While she never gambled as liberally as her husband, she emptied the purses of more than one rival in \"friendly\" card games, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Destiny\"&gt;Destiny&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Wild%20Geese\"&gt;Wild Geese&lt;/a&gt;\" (she particuarly excelled in this game).\nBiography.\nNerissa was married to &lt;a href=\"Ashton%20Natoli\"&gt;Ashton Natoli&lt;/a&gt;; a good man, in her eyes, but one who had taking to drinking and gambling, draining the coffers of &lt;a href=\"House%20Natoli\"&gt;House Natoli&lt;/a&gt; in the process. At some point he vanished, taking what remained of the family fortune with him. Thus, over the period of a year, Nerissa was forced to deal with the creditors, as her standard of living was reduced as she struggled to pay off her husband's debts. She also had to provide for her sister, &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth\"&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;, and while &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;strange creatures&lt;/a&gt; were reported in Westmarch. Things reached such a bad state that she knew she was at risk of losing her manor, per &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Dastin\"&gt;Vincent Dastin&lt;/a&gt;'s unwillingness to collect Ashton's debts any longer.\nOn the same night as Dastin's refusal, she was picked up in a carriage by &lt;a href=\"Carlotta\"&gt;Carlotta&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed to be an old friend of the family. She was aware of Nerissa's situation, and offered her a way out. She asked if she played cards, to which Nerissa responded in the affirmative. Thus, Carlotta arranged to come to Nerissa's manor the following evening. Nerissa guessed that Carlotta was sitting on a fortune, and that she wanted to intentionally lose it through a card game so that she wouldn't be seen giving out her wealth as an act of charity.\nThe next evening came, and Carlotta arrived. As they discussed the stakes, Nerissa offered what was left of her jewelry. Carlotta wasn't interested, and asked Nerissa what she valued most in the world. Nerissa, assuming that this was a game of social niceity, responded that what she desired most was to see her husband returned, sober, and with his wealth restored. In return, she wagered anything of hers that Carlotta desired. Carlotta agreed, and explained the rules of the game. They would each pick three cards, drawing them one at a time. By the end, whoever held the highest card would win. Nerissa was put off, knowing that this would be a competition of luck rather than skill, but agreed to take part. The game was played, and Nerissa won. Carlotta saw herself out, saying that she would come tomorrow night, if Nerissa chose, but warned her to choose carefully. And with that she left. The same night, a commoner arrived at her manor, bringing Ashton's body to be buried. He had nothing on him, and Nerissa had to foot the bill for the delivery fee.\nNerissa was aghast. She suspected Carlotta of &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;craft, but rationalized that it had to be a coincidence. She decided to have Carlotta return, in hope of getting the fortune she had offered. Carlotta arrived, and Nerissa offered the same stakes\u2014anything that Carlotta desired, against a dowry for Elizabeth. She was put off by how Carlotta seemed different, more \"hungry,\" but the game was played, and again, Nerissa won. Carlotta exited the manor before she could discuss payment of the dowry. She again warned Nerissa to consider the stakes, and that if she wished her to return (again), she would do so on the morrow. Nonetheless, Carlotta apparently honored her word, as a boy arrived with an envelope, containing a dowry. Apparently, Viscount &lt;a href=\"Delfinus\"&gt;Delfinus&lt;/a&gt; was a distant relation of House Natoli, and he'd just passed away. Before he died, the letter claimed, he had set aside funds for his youngest unmarried relations. She shared the news with Elizabeth, who was overjoyed. All seemed well...\n...at least it did until Elizabeth collided with &lt;a href=\"Maurice\"&gt;Maurice&lt;/a&gt;, their servant, who was holding an oil lamp. Elizabeth caught on fire as the flames spread, and while healers were able to save her life, her face was severely disfigured. It was now obvious to Nerissa that Carlotta was behind this. Twice she'd got what she wanted, and twice what she'd wanted had been ripped away. Thus, she resolved for a final game, one that she would win, no matter what. So the next night, Carlotta arrived, her visage still offputting, even as Nerissa refused to give her the usual social nicities. Regardless, Nerissa dictated the stakes. She would have Elizabeth's happiness and beauty restored, and it would be done so for the duration of the game, until she turned her last card. Carlotta resisted, but eventually acquiesed, and sure enough, Elizabeth's beauty was restored, though she was in a daze. Nerissa bid her goodbye as the game began. As it neared its end, with Nerissa waiting to turn her card, as Carlotta urged her to bring it to an end, Nerissa did so, by plunging a siletto into her own chest. Carlotta tried to save her, but it was too late. Nerissa was dead. And what was more, Carlotta had lost, for Nerissa had dictated that the terms of the bargain be \"until I draw my last card.\" Now, it was an action that she could never undertake. Losing her old vigor, Carlotta left the manor, commenting \"well played, my dear. Well played indeed.\""}

Like its predecessor, New Tristram has seen its share of misfortune. It is protected by the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Militia\"&gt;Tristram Militia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe founding date of New Tristram is unclear. Originally simply a collection of merchants looking to profit on adventurers and travelers drawn by legends of riches within the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, it slowly set down roots and became an established town. The town grew quickly, in part due to the abundance of farming. As soon as the cathedral was looted bare, however, the adventurers and travelers stopped coming, and New Tristram found itself in decline. By &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, the town was comprised mostly of depressing shacks. When he visited it, &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; noted that only the town's &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Calf%20Inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; looked the least bit habitable.\nRecent History.\nThe same year of Hazir's visit, a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;falling star&lt;/a&gt; crashed into the abandoned cathedral. This event caused the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; to stir, assaulting the town. Rationing was enforced. For six days, the miltia held the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt; at bay. Morale sagged, and many villagers became resigned to their fate. Salvation arrived with the coming of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. However, the militia still had to hold the dead at bay while The Nephalem were outside the town. Captain &lt;a href=\"Rumford\"&gt;Rumford&lt;/a&gt; had rations reduced to halves and quarters. After the (final) death of the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt;, a week after the assault had began, the attacks against the town died down, leading some to suggest making a break for &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;. However, this was impractical, as &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; were rampaging throughout the hills near the town.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, many of the townsfolk mourned his death.\nMonths later, New Tristram had more or less recovered. &lt;a href=\"Bron%20the%20Barkeep\"&gt;Bron&lt;/a&gt; ran for the position of mayor as a replacement for &lt;a href=\"Holus\"&gt;Holus&lt;/a&gt;, who had fled during the undead assault.\nAmid a hunting expedition, citizens hailing from New Tristram stumbled across an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;ominous altar&lt;/a&gt; in ruins in the &lt;a href=\"Festering%20Woods\"&gt;Festering Woods&lt;/a&gt;. The altar was brought back to New Tristram, where many townsfolk saw it, then left. Soon afterwards, the Nephalem themselves returned to New Tristram, demanding to see the altar for themself. Shaken to their core by the eldritch aroma of the monolith, the citizens enlisted the assistance of &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; willing to investigate.\nIn-game.\nNew Tristram is the hub area for the &lt;a href=\"Act%20I%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;first act&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".

Her mother, &lt;a href=\"Vhenard\"&gt;Vhenard&lt;/a&gt;, told her that the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; had the answers, so Neyrelle devoured their legends, their histories, their writings. She read of the order's founding, of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice to contain &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, and even read some works penned by &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. She studied both the Order's triumphs and failures. At the time, studying the Horadrim from a distance, Neyrelle considered them to be wise.\nNeyrelle and her mother travelled &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in search of artifacts and remnants of the Horadrim. They explored old ruins and read old texts, and in the process, Neyrelle learnt all manner of information pertaining to the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. Her mother affectionally called her \"Magpie\".\nA Cold and Iron Faith.\nThe Magpie and the Knight.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, Neyrelle and Vhenard arrived at &lt;a href=\"Yelesna\"&gt;Yelesna&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, In their search for the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Vault\"&gt;Horadric Vault&lt;/a&gt;, they entered &lt;a href=\"Mistral%20Woods\"&gt;Mistral Woods&lt;/a&gt; and within, the &lt;a href=\"Darkened%20Holt\"&gt;Darkened Holt&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were surrounded by mists, and forced to turn back.\nTo Neyrelle's surprise, Vhenard suddenly ran off. Unknowingly in the company of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, Vhenard used a wealth charm to bribe Knight Captain &lt;a href=\"Vigo\"&gt;Vigo&lt;/a&gt; to grant them entry to &lt;a href=\"Windfall%20Hollow\"&gt;Windfall Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Vigo obliged. Neyrelle saw the demon pass by herself.\nThe next day, a distraught Neyrelle came to him in Yelesna, claiming that a demon had entered those same mines. Vigo had already reported the demon sighting, but Neyrelle refused to give up. She also talked to Captain &lt;a href=\"Ankers\"&gt;Ankers&lt;/a&gt; of Yelesna's guard, but Ankers was also uninterested. Neyrelle spent a whole week pestering him before heading off to the mines herself.\nNeyrelle arrived at the mine entrance, finding Vigo in the companion of , who had been sent to investigate the demon sighting on orders of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Vigo remained obstinate, and Neyrelle asked the Wanderer for aid. To Neyrelle's horror, the Wanderer explained that the demon in question was Lilith. Vigo relented, opened the mines, and the three entered. As they made their way through, Neyrelle noticed her mother's wealth charm hanging from Vigo's wrist. Vigo claimed that Vhenard had given it to him as a gift. \nBecause the hoist was stuck, the trio had to make their way through a &lt;a href=\"Condemned%20Mines\"&gt;condemned section&lt;/a&gt; of the mines. Vigo suggested that they return to &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Hill\"&gt;Pine Hill&lt;/a&gt; to gather knights from the garrison, but Neyrelle refused, not wanting to leave her mother in Lilith's company any longer than necessary. After coming to a locked door, Neyrelle was able to crawl through a nearby hole to reach the other side, unlocking it. They fought their way to safety, but the mines collapsed behind them.\nVigo lamented their situation, but Neyrelle's attention was drawn by a great statue of Lilith; part of an &lt;a href=\"Firstborn\"&gt;ancient civilization&lt;/a&gt;, buried beneath the earth. Neyrelle recognized the statue as being identical to the demon she'd seen enter the mines with her mother. They continued on, and found the base of the ore hoist; a demon's &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt; had jammed its gears, and after the Wanderer removed it, the platform descended to the base. However, Vigo noted that the demon had clearly been slain.\nThey discussed their options. Vigo wanted to return to the surface for reinforcements, Neyrelle wanted to press on, but they heard the groan of a wounded man nearby. Heading through the gate of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Kasama\"&gt;Kasama&lt;/a&gt;, they found a group of Knights Penitent, slaughter, with only one survivor, &lt;a href=\"Grendan\"&gt;Grendan&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that they'd escorted two women into the city, and that one of them had revealed herself as Lilith, before she killed the knights. The other, Vhenard, had begged for her life, and Lilith had spared her. Grendan died, and listening to Vigo muse, Neyrelle realized that the charm her mother had supposedly given Vigo had in fact been a bribe to allow her entry. Nevertheless, Neyrelle insisted her mother could still be saved, but Vigo refused. He told Neyrelle to give up and headed to the surface, in order to tell the Cathedral what had happened.\nThe Wanderer stayed by Neyrelle's side, and they made their way through Kasama. While making their way through, the Wanderer came across some &lt;a href=\"blood%20petals\"&gt;blood petals&lt;/a&gt;. They explained their connection to Lilith, and that they'd had a vision, one that made clear that Vhenard was at Lilith's side. Further on, the Wanderer had another vision, and explained that Lilith intended on teaching Vhenard a ritual. One that needed blood. The two pressed on, and came across a magically-sealed door. Neyrelle dispelled the enchantment while the Wanderer held off attacking demons.\nThe pair made it to the &lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Shore\"&gt;Mourning Shore&lt;/a&gt; on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Lake\"&gt;Black Lake&lt;/a&gt;. They found a priest's &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;, his throat slit, and Neyrelle realized he'd been part of the escort Vigo had sent. Further on, they found Vhenard, who was writing runes in her own &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly mad, Vhenard explained that the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Necropolis of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt; lay on the lake's other side, and that she's opened the way for Lilith. Vhenard, however, lacked the \"divine element\" needed to pass, but she was still searching to find a way. Neyrelle begged Vhenard to leave, but the request caused Vhenard's mood to shift drastically, as she accused her daughter of wanting to lead her away so she could take the trove for herself. She cut Neyrelle's arm with her knife, and attacked the Wanderer, summoning demons before Neyrelle's eyes. \nNeyrelle begged Vhenard to stop, but her mother was beyond saving. The demons were slain, and the effort caused Vhenard to expire, dying seconds after collapsing. The Wanderer gave Neyrelle her condolences, and while part of Neyrelle hated the Wanderer for the role they'd played in her mother's death, she knew that Vhenard's end wasn't their fault. As they needed \"blessed blood\" to cross the lake, Neyrelle told the Wanderer to seek out &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt; to get the blessing required, while she would head for &lt;a href=\"Mistral%20Woods\"&gt;Mistral Woods&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Vault\"&gt;Horadric Vault&lt;/a&gt; Vhenard had sought was there, and there might be something in the vault that could help with the ritual. Even if there wasn't, Neyrelle knew her mother would want to be buried there. She told the Wanderer to leave, as she needed time to mourn.\nShroud of the Horadrim.\nNeyrelle re-entered the Darkened Holt, and like before, was waylaid by the mists. She was found by the Wanderer.\nFrom the Wound Spilled.\nAcross her journey, Neyrelle left letters for Lorath. She stopped by in his cabin, and found a &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; he had left for her, along with a letter wishing her luck. She took some of Lorath's ale for herself, and left a letter in kind, telling Lorath that her burden was heavy, but she was bearing it.\nAs she continued, Mephisto taunted Neyrelle, and assaulted her with visions. She believed herself able to ignore them. However, she passed south through &lt;a href=\"Yelesna\"&gt;Yelesna&lt;/a&gt;, and due to Mephisto's hatred, the people turned on each other, slaughtering each other over the most trivial of slights. Still heading south, she made it to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, which met the same fate as Yelesna. As soon as she arrived, Mephisto's voice grew louder, more insistent. He laughed at humanity's insiginificance, mocked her weakness. He showed her a vision of what was yet to come; Sanctuary devoured. A storm raged inside Neyrelle's mind, and she feared it would drive her mad.\nShe was only in the city for a day before she passed on. Horrified at what had happened in her wake, Neyrelle left Kurast as quickly as possible, and swore not to repeat the mistake she'd made. She gained passage across the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt;. She left a letter to the captain and asked him to give to Lorath if he saw him. In the letter, she detailed what had happened at Kurast, and assured him that she was not yet lost.\nNeyrelle travelled to &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, seeking aid from the &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monks of Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;. She learned as much as she could from the Veradani, and their techniques helped her ignore Mephisto's voice and visions (or so she hoped). The Monks, however, were terrified of her. Only a few would venture near enough to teach her, and she was forced to sleep in a guest hut far outside the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Sky%20Monastery\"&gt;Floating Sky Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. A Monk later commented that Neyrelle was an agent of pure chaos and hatred, even though it was clear that she did not wish to be.\nWhile in Ivgorod, Neyrelle had a vision of Lorath walking east through miles and miles of ash. She deduced (correctly) that she was seeing Lorath in the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;. Wary of staying in any one place for two long, Neyrelle left Lorath a letter in Ivgorod before departing. She was unsure in what direction she would travel, but knew it was better that she stayed alone.\nVessel of Hatred.\nNeyrelle's Lament.\nStill carrying Mephisto's soulstone, Neyrelle travelled to &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;. She struggled against Mephisto's influence every step of the way. A boatman took her along a river to &lt;a href=\"the%20River%20Gate\"&gt;the River Gate&lt;/a&gt;. By this point, the effects of carrying Mephisto's soulstone had become severe, both physically and mentally. The boatman offered her help, but she yelled at him to stay away. At this point, she saw a hallucination of her mother, whom she told that she had to carry out her burden alone of finding &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb. Her mother bade her to give in, and Neyrelle realized it was Mephisto trying to sway her. Mephisto tormented her psychologically before she regained her senses\u2014physically unharmed, but the same could not be said for the boatman, who had been killed by the soulstone's corruption. With a heavy heart, Neyrelle took his oar, and rowed on towards the River Gate.\nThe soulstone continued to affect her both physically and emotionally, and while Neyrelle knew she could not count on divine intervention, she prayed for help regardless. The sound of the river and soulstone became indistinguishable to her, and she was no longer able to sleep. As Mephisto continued to whisper to her, it took all of Neyrelle's strength to keep the Lord of Hatred at bay; to even remember who she was. She feared she was losing the fight, and it was a fear well founded, as Mephisto began warping her own perception and voice. As before, Neyrelle was able to resist the Lord of Hatred. She reflected how her mother had succumbed to Hatred on the shores of the Black Lake, and promised she would not similarly fall. Weeping, Neyrelle reflected how she had lost her family, her body, and was now losing her mind, but resolved to take as many steps as were needed to see her task through. Seeking solace in the victories of the past, she recalled how the Wanderer had defeated Lilith, of the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of a &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;trio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, of the defeat of Baal by &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;another group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, and of Mephisto's defeat by that same group. Yet even those victories rang hollow, for in every case sans Lilith, the demons of yore had been defeated, but never destroyed. She knew that the soulstone had to be destroyed, and she would only have one last chance to do so. She continued down the river, even as Mephisto continued to exert influence over her.\nAs Neyrelle continued to make her way down the river, the corruption from Mephisto's soulstone continued to not only affect just her, but the surrounding environs. Clutching the soulstone, a black, tar-like liquid began to spread from the stone and onto her hand, burning it. She plunged her hand into the water, and in so doing, spread Mephisto's corruption into the surrounding environment. The black liquid was left in her boat's wake and spread to the adjacent jungle. This resulted in the creation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Hollows\"&gt;the Hollows&lt;/a&gt;. By this point, Neyrelle's boat was just drifting, and she held the stone, as if entranced, the black liquid spreading to her body.\nEntering Nahantu.\nAfter passing through the River Gate, Neyrelle descended into the jungles. She followed in the footsteps of Akarat, searching for answers about what to do with Mephisto's soulstone. She sought to enter the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Light\"&gt;Vault of Light&lt;/a&gt; so she could purify the soulstone of Mephisto's essence and banish his spirit back to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nNeyrelle appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". In the segments where Neyrelle joins the player's party temporarily during certain campaign &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, she'll fight with her hatchet, and can also cloak herself with a smoke bomb to attack enemies.\nPersonality and Traits.\nBrilliant, brave, and stubborn, Neyrelle is naturally curious, and is more resilient than she is often given credit for. She is able to use some &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, but is untrained.\nNeyrelle was harrowed by her experiences with the Wanderer. Her naivete was sharpened into cautious optimism. In her mind, there is no difference between Heaven and Hell, at least as far as their dealings with Sanctuary are concerned.\nNeyrelle considered Lorath \"her most stubborn friend.\" As a child, Neyrelle was in quiet awe of the Horadrim, but harrowed by her experiences with the remnants of the Order (e.g. Lorath and Donan), her idealistic view of the Horadrim was marred."}

After this, Nihlathak struck a deal with &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Destruction. He would give Baal the &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Relic of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the most holy totem of the people, so he could reach the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; without being challenged by &lt;a href=\"the%20Ancients\"&gt;the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. In return, Baal would spare Harrogath.\nLegacy.\nNihlathak's betrayal was never forgiven by the survivors of Harrogath.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nNihlathak is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUntil the quest is completed, Nihlathak is found in the left-most corner of &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;. He has a very hostile personality, even to fellow s, and desires to keep to his own matters. It is revealed that it was he who kidnapped Anya and placed her in a Prison of Ice in the &lt;a href=\"Crystalline%20Passage\"&gt;Crystalline Passage&lt;/a&gt;. He fled from Harrogath as Anya was close to being rescued.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Anya\"&gt;Anya&lt;/a&gt; is rescued, he is found in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Vaught\"&gt;Halls of Vaught&lt;/a&gt; as a super unique boss. He is defeated in the quest. He uses the most popular Necromancer Skills, &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt; along with and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Minion\"&gt;Summon Minion&lt;/a&gt;. To top everything off, he will try to freeze you using the Druid skill &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Blast\"&gt;Arctic Blast&lt;/a&gt;. His Corpse Explosion was a sure one-hit killer in difficulty until it was nerfed in future patches.\nIn difficulty, Nihlathak drops the Key of Destruction, which is a part of the Battle.net &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nStats.\nNihlathak's &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Blast\"&gt;Arctic Blast&lt;/a&gt; skills are the main reason he is feared among &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; players. When you kill one of his summoned &lt;a href=\"Baal%27s%20Minion\"&gt;Minions&lt;/a&gt;, make sure you use a skill that utilizes the corpse before Nihlathak can explode it such as the Paladin's &lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;Redemption&lt;/a&gt;, Barbarian's &lt;a href=\"Find%20Potion\"&gt;Find Potion&lt;/a&gt;, or Necromancer's &lt;a href=\"Revive\"&gt;Revive&lt;/a&gt; or Raise Skeleton. Equipping Items with the \"Slain Monsters Rest in Peace\" modifier such as the &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Peace%20Ring\"&gt;Nature's Peace Ring&lt;/a&gt; has the same effect. In and you can also use freezing attacks to shatter the minions so they do not leave corpses. High &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and Physical Damage Reduction/Block Rate will help against his Corpse Explosion. It is also possible to lure all enemies aside from Nihlathak far away from him before killing them making their bodies too far away for him to use as weapons against you. If you get too close, Nihlathak will use Arctic Blast on you, giving him greater advantage. Being frozen will put the players in greater danger. Having &lt;a href=\"Thawing%20Potion\"&gt;Thawing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, the cannot be frozen ability, or hit recovery will lessen the effects of Arctic Blast.\nHe has the following skills:\nDevelopment.\nThere is an unused aura graphic named \"NehlithakGlow\".\nAlso in the game files is an alternate Nihlathak's death animation where his skeleton explodes instead of being dragged to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo IV.\nNihlathak is mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", during the \"&lt;a href=\"Consumed%20by%20Pride\"&gt;Consumed by Pride&lt;/a&gt;\", where &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;the Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; helps finding missing Barbarians from the &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Tribe\"&gt;Crane Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.

This included the island and prison where the Voidwound was sealed.\nSometime after the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;Fall of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;, the island was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt;. While she was distracted by the cultists, &lt;a href=\"Shumbeel\"&gt;Shumbeel&lt;/a&gt; arrived and attempted to destroy the prison. Nisza managed to stop him before he did too much damage and placed a ward to prevent trespassers from causing more damage. She then ventured into the prison to see the extent of the damage. \nUnfortunately, the Voidwound had started reforming and sent &lt;a href=\"The%20Many\"&gt;shades&lt;/a&gt; to overwhelm her but she managed to escape through a portal.\nLater, she sensed activity from a &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Slag\"&gt;prison fragment&lt;/a&gt; and portaled to the location to check it out. This led her to meet &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rayek\"&gt;Rayek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Kaya\"&gt;Commander Kaya&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Einfrinn%20Tree\"&gt;Einfrinn Tree&lt;/a&gt;. The shades tracked her location and ambushed all of them.\nAfter dealing with the shades and clearing a misunderstanding, she discovered that what she sensed was the Einfrinn Tree resonating with a Crimson Slag, creating flowers around it. Using a flower, she empowered her staff to make it better able to reseal the Voidwound.\nFearing that another portal might be tracked, she and the Shard-seeker took a ship back to the island. After dealing with the remaining cultists and a freed Shumbeel, she realized that the ward had been tampered with.\nThis resulted in the Voidwound breaking their prison. The explosion threw both Nisza and the Shard-seeker into the sea where they were rescued.\nTogether with some Westmarch soldiers that were mobilized by Kaya, Nisza and the Shard-seeker enter the portal at the Einfrinn Tree to get to the &lt;a href=\"Starless%20Shrine\"&gt;Starless Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. There, they battled with Catarag's demonic army, until Nisza created a ward to freeze every opponent in the battlefield.\nNoticing a shadow on the ground, she looked up to see Catarag pouncing on them in a surprise attack. Unfortunately, she was only able to protect the Shard-seeker, leaving the soldiers to die. Their battle with Catarag then begins in earnest.\nThrough out the battle, Nisza and the Shard-seeker supported each other, saving the other's life on different occasions. Finally, they succeeded in killing Catarag.\nExhausted and injured, Nisza left the demonic remains for her partner to deliver to Rayek and retreated back to her coven to recover.\nNisza later returned to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, where she offered &lt;a href=\"Rites%20of%20Cleansing\"&gt;Rites of Cleansing&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPersonality &amp; Traits.\nNisza is proud of her Circle and her duty to them, even willing to risk her life for it.

Her shields are strong enough to defend a blow from Shumbeel, and ward off the flames of Catarag. \nShe is knowledgeable enough to patch a damaged ward so that it can still contain powerful demons for some time. She can also cast a ward that instantly froze all enemies in the area.\nIn-game.\nNisza is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; that is seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

She offers the following features:\nNisza also has a scrying pool where the player can &lt;a href=\"Moonrite%20Divination\"&gt;witness a vision&lt;/a&gt; of the next/present major threat.

Choosing to go into a higher difficulty early on, however, is best considered as insanely suicidal or insanely bold, as the hero will have quite a hard time surviving in the depths of the labyrinth.\nDiablo II.\nCharacters that are created in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" will start in this difficulty level.\u00a0Hirelings and Summons deal 50% damage to Act bosses on this difficulty.\u00a0If a character kills Diablo in non-expansion they will gain a &lt;a href=\"Titles\"&gt;new title&lt;/a&gt; and the option to venture into Nightmare upon starting the game.\u00a0Expansion pack players will receive the title upon successfully defeating Baal, as well as the opportunity to adventure in &lt;a href=\"the%20Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;the Secret Cow Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn classic (playing without the expansion, either by not installing Lord of Destruction or leaving the checkbox blank during character creation) defeating Diablo will grant a specific title:\nIf it is an expansion character, killing Baal in &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Act 5&lt;/a&gt; will grant the following titles:\nDiablo Immortal.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", Normal is the default difficulty. Players are bound to Normal until they reach &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;character level&lt;/a&gt; 60. After this, they gain access to Hell-level difficulty. If a player returns to Normal difficulty after this point, experience and rewards are reduced.\nDiablo III.\nThere is nothing special about this difficulty. It can be thought of as the default from which all other difficulty levels are calculated.\nIt is the lowest difficulty possible. In the demo only one other difficulty is possible: &lt;a href=\"Hard\"&gt;Hard&lt;/a&gt;\nDiablo IV.\nNormal difficulty is the baseline difficulty of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Its predecessor was , under the old &lt;a href=\"World%20Tier\"&gt;World Tier&lt;/a&gt; system."}

{"id": "65", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=65", "title": "Normal Items", "text": "Normal (also called Common or White, for the color of the tooltips) is a level of item quality in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, generally the lowest one with no magical abilities at all. Later games also introduced Poor (also called Gray) items, which are Normal for most purposes but distinctly lower quality than \"regular\" Normal items. Normal and Poor item names are almost always color coded white and gray respectively.\nNormal items represent items that have the same usage and benefits as their equivalents in the real world - a modest amount of &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Defense&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and the ability to inflict &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; on enemies with &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. They have no magical &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt;es or special powers, and therefore provide no advantage to player statistics beyond those basic functions. Usually these items are worn by characters at very early levels, when they are yet to obtain even the simplest of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic Items&lt;/a&gt;. Once higher quality magical items become commonplace in later gameplay, a character will usually not wear a Normal item again.\nDiablo I.\nNormal Items first appeared in the original \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\". This is the most common drop quality, and at many occasions, their damage and defense allow players to use such items long enough, until they can obtain higher quality equivalents.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", in addition to the magical quality of items shared by other games, there is also a three-part progression of \"base item quality\", with &lt;a href=\"Exceptional%20Items\"&gt;Exceptional Items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Items\"&gt;Elite Items&lt;/a&gt; superior to Normal ones and attained at higher &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;difficulties&lt;/a&gt;, but still potentially dropping as \"White\" non-magical items. Just like the lower base items, these higher tiers could have magical properties as well or be used for &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt;, and each shares the same appearance as a Normal item. This causes confusion due to \"Normal\" being used as the default low level for both forms of item quality - Normal, Exceptional, Elite; and Normal, Magical, Rare, and beyond.\nUnlike those in the first game, Normal Items now may have prefixes that add no new properties, but may slightly increase damage, defense or &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes they may even have prefixes that actually \"reduce \" their already mediocre attributes, in which case they are called Poor and show up with Gray text. &lt;a href=\"Socketed%20Items\"&gt;Socketed Items&lt;/a&gt; appear with gray color, but are actually Normal, not Poor quality.\nWhile there is no real use for Normal items directly, they are often farmed for by players who seek to make use of &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt;, as those require either a Socketed Item, or a Normal item that can be converted to a Socketed via the use of &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Normal items return in two forms: as typical normal items similar to \"Diablo II\", including the optional minor prefixes, and as so-called (Gray) items. Poor quality items are essentially Normal for most in-game purposes - they can be worn by starting characters until better equipment is acquired, supply the same sort of materials when &lt;a href=\"salvage\"&gt;salvage&lt;/a&gt;d, and are treated the same by the powers of a &lt;a href=\"Puzzle%20Ring\"&gt;Puzzle Ring&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; - but represent a distinctly lower quality level and have worse statistics.\nThe only real use for Poor / Normal Items during most gameplay is to &lt;a href=\"salvage\"&gt;salvage&lt;/a&gt; them with the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith\"&gt;Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; to obtain a bunch of for &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt;. Equipping them is pointless after players get their hands on &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic Items&lt;/a&gt;, and selling them to vendors awards too little &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. Many players are in the habit of ignoring the gray or even white items and not even bothering to pick those up. However, this may be an inefficient approach given the following options:\nSome item types - &lt;a href=\"Jewelry\"&gt;Jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;Follower&lt;/a&gt; items, &lt;a href=\"Sources\"&gt;Sources&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quivers\"&gt;Quivers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mojos\"&gt;Mojos&lt;/a&gt; - may not exist in Normal quality; they are always of Magic quality or higher.\nDiablo IV.\nNormal items return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". As in previous games, they do not grant magical bonuses, but grant some basic statistical improvements."}

It may also be used to refer to the equipment slot such items are held in, or to the second equipped weapon when a character is \"dual wielding\". In the game interface this equipment slot is on the right side of the \"paper doll\" used to equip items (implying their left hand), and may also be called the \"second weapon slot\" or the \"&lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; slot\".\nShields themselves are often included in the off-hand category, while weapons are not usually considered \"off-hand items\" even when equipped in that slot. &lt;a href=\"Two-handed\"&gt;Two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons generally prevent the use of the off-hand slot.\n\"Off-hand\" became a more useful term for equipment starting with \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" due to the availability of off-hand items other than weapons and shields.\nDiablo III.\nThe third game of the franchise included a number of traditional &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, but also introduced non-shield off-hand items for the first time. (\"Diablo II\" &lt;a href=\"Shrunken%20Heads\"&gt;Shrunken Heads&lt;/a&gt; functioned as shields despite a rather different appearance.) These items are &lt;a href=\"Class-specific%20items\"&gt;class-specific&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from defensive to offensive to magical:\ns and s do not have a class-specific off-hand type, but both \"dual wield\" weapons frequently, and have class-specific weapons which are used almost as often in the off hand as the main hand - &lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Weapons\"&gt;Mighty Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fist%20Weapons\"&gt;Fist Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nMost types of off-hand item automatically have direct bonuses to &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, and are capable of dropping with various class-specific bonuses, especially to primary resource capacity or gains. Quivers come with &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; bonuses instead of flat damage bonuses. However, off-hand items are not weapons, and do not have a base weapon damage range or attack rate. Most are not shields either and do not grant a chance to block, but like shields, they receive the &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;-specific bonus from &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt; equipped in them. They cannot have weapon-specific &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt;, and cannot make use of &lt;a href=\"Ramaladni%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Ramaladni's Gift&lt;/a&gt;, which only works on weapons.\nLike other item types, there are numerous &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; off-hand items, and some &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Items&lt;/a&gt;.

Welcome to the Tavern of the Rising Sun\"\nOgden the Tavern Owner was a resident of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and owner of the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;Tavern of the Rising Sun&lt;/a&gt;. He was present in the town during its last days, where like almost all of its inhabitants, he met his own demise.\nBiography.\nOgden ran the Tavern of the Rising Sun from &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231259\"&gt;1259&lt;/a&gt; onwards, occupying one of the inn's private chambers. He served many adventurers over his life, and heard many tales from them.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nOgden was in his thirties when &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; began to suffer from madness, sparking a chain of events that would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. It became clear that some &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt; had taken root in the town's &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, and to confront it, the archbishop &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; led a group of villagers into the structure, in order to rescue Leoric's missing son, &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;. The villagers were set upon by &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt;, and few returned to tell the tale.\nAs despair gripped the village, Ogden's tavern provided an anchor of sorts to its people, a glimpse of what life was like before the darkening. &lt;a href=\"Farnham\"&gt;Farnham&lt;/a&gt; was one such person, who regularly came to the tavern to drown his sorrows. Under normal circumstances, Ogden would have made him leave, but remembering what Farnham had suffered in the labyrinth, allowed him to stay. So did his barmaid &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt;, despite Ogden's pleas for her to flee. and let Gillian and her grandmother stay with himself and Garda. Thus, Tristram endured and Ogden managed to make ends meet, keeping the town fed due to the tavern's supply of grain and dried meat.\nSalvation eventually came in the form of Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, who had returned from the disastrous war Leoric had waged against &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Ogden greeted the prince at his return, explaining what had happened in his absence, and with the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summoner\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, Aidan was able to defeat the evil that lay within the cathedral.\nFor a moment, it looked like Tristram had been saved, but it was not to be. Aidan had been darkened by his experiences, and headed east. Soon afterwards, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s settled upon the town, slaughtering its inhabitants, Ogden included.\nIn-game.\nDiablo.\nOgden appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\". He does not possess the knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; concerning things arcane, but initiates the and quests, and rewards the hero with the &lt;a href=\"Harlequin%20Crest%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Harlequin Crest&lt;/a&gt; when his tavern sign is returned to him.\nDiablo II.\nOgden does not make a direct appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", though a body can be found where he once stood outside his tavern when the player(s) visit(s) Tristram.\nPersonality and Traits.\nOgden was a gangly man who possessed a full head of chestnut hair. He was obsequious to all potential and current guests, never failing to compliment them or inquire if he could provide any aid. He suffered from a slight nervous condition, but was intelligent, industrious, and in the words of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, \"a good man with a sense of responsibility.\" He never much cared for poetry, and found &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mushroom%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;black mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; disgusting.\nNotes.\nLore from the manual of \"Diablo II\" established that the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; character from the first game was unknown to the village, despite Ogden apparently knowing him as per his greeting quote. The issue was 'solved' in a sense by lore developed for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", which established that the warrior was Aidan, known to Tristram, and thus apparently to Ogden as well."}

Each contributes to one of three achievements.\nAvailability.\nThe Old Keepsake Box is responsible to an unusually large number of lore books relative to the small area and low numbers in which they are found. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; are very rarely offered in these areas. As a result, since &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; came out it has become quite unlikely to find all the books during general endgame gameplay.\nEven for players who replay the &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; on new or &lt;a href=\"rebirth\"&gt;rebirth&lt;/a&gt;ed characters during multiple &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;s, it is difficult to obtain the second part of either of the journals that have them, since tome progress starts from scratch with every character. Each time the campaign is played, even assuming there are two boxes along the road, the first box would need to contain one of the two journals that has a second part (2/7), and the second box would have to contain the same journal (1/7), a final probability of 2/49, or approximately 4% of fresh campaign playthroughs - just to complete \"one\" of the two-part journals this way. The probability of getting both parts of the \"other\" journal would then be only 2% for each campaign thereafter.\nIntentionally hunting for the journals by repeatedly revisiting the area is therefore required for most \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" players to get the \"Quick Study\" achievement. Revisits to &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tristram%20Road\"&gt;Old Tristram Road&lt;/a&gt; also help with the hunt for &lt;a href=\"Ebenezer%20Samuel\"&gt;Ebenezer Samuel&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"unique%20monster\"&gt;unique monster&lt;/a&gt; required for another achievement, who is similarly unlikely to be encountered during endgame play. However each Keepsake Box \"is\" guaranteed to drop a journal not already found, so at most nine boxes must be opened on one character to complete all journals, whereas Samuel could require many more than nine trips down the road."}

It is often abbreviated as 1H.\nA character may only equip weapons and &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; items into two hand slots, with one-handed weapons occupying one (main) hand only, and &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons occupying both slots. With one-handed weapon in the main hand (left slot), a character may equip the other (right slot) hand with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, an off-hand only item (such as &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Quiver\"&gt;Quiver&lt;/a&gt;) or (for some classes) another one-handed weapon. Having two one-handed weapons equipped is generally called\u00a0Dual-Wielding.\nThere are some exceptions to this rule (see &lt;a href=\"Two-handed\"&gt;Two-handed&lt;/a&gt; for the list of those), but generally, a character must choose between dual-wielding, picking one-handed weapon + offhand item, or equipping a single two-handed weapon. Not all one-handed weapons may be taken as off-hand choices.\nClasses that can dual-wield:\n&lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s may equip a two-handed weapon in main hand, with a damage penalty. &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;s and Demon Hunters may equip their two-handed ranged weapons together with &lt;a href=\"Arrows\"&gt;Arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolts\"&gt;Bolts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Quivers\"&gt;Quivers&lt;/a&gt;. Diablo II Barbarians are the only class that can equip two two-handed weapons, one in each hand, but both will have a penalty to damage, in fact, using their 'one-handed' profile to calculate damage.\nBoth one-handed weapons in each hand have their own attack speed, damage and special attributes, but general bonuses (such as core stats) from both weapons stack.\nA general rule is that one-handed weapons deal less damage, and can roll less total stat bonuses than their two-handed counterparts, but have a faster attack speed. Some class skills may require a specific weapon type to be equipped, so there is no such thing as a 'best choice' here. It is generally believed that having a combination of a one-handed + off-hand item or dual-wielding is more flexible and allows better customization of the game style. Most of the time, the advantages from two weapons or one weapon and a side item are greater than those of a two-handed weapon, leaving the latter's potential use being for attack range or roleplaying purposes.\n&lt;a href=\"Wands\"&gt;Wands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daggers\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Crossbows\"&gt;Hand Crossbows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Javelins\"&gt;Javelins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scepters\"&gt;Scepters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20Knives\"&gt;Ceremonial Knives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fist%20Weapons\"&gt;Fist Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Weapons\"&gt;Throwing Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20Orbs\"&gt;Sorceress Orbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Katars\"&gt;Katars&lt;/a&gt; are always one-handed and do not exist in two-handed variants. This is also true for &lt;a href=\"Spears\"&gt;Spears&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nNote that &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Set\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt; weapons in \"Diablo III\" are Unique Equipped, that is, one cannot wield two identical weapons at the same time. While players may stack as many of them in their &lt;a href=\"stash\"&gt;stash&lt;/a&gt; as they want, only one of each items can be actually equipped. This includes the &lt;a href=\"set\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Shenlong%27s%20Fist%20of%20Legend\"&gt;Shenlong's Fist of Legend&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Shenlong%27s%20Relentless%20Assault\"&gt;Shenlong's Relentless Assault&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; extracted legendary affixes. This is also true of a leveled-up &lt;a href=\"Gem%20of%20Ease\"&gt;Gem of Ease&lt;/a&gt; - only one weapon can be equipped by a low-level character using the Gem, even if two dual-wieldable weapons have the Gem in them."}

To this end, she wore human skin around herself like a veil, and her crown was likewise fashioned.\nBiography.\nLike all the Voidwound, Ophinneb was reshaped by the primordial ages she spent in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nOphinneb \u2014 along with the rest of the Voidwound, arrived on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; at the five corners of &lt;a href=\"Sharval%20Wilds\"&gt;Sharval Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. She made a lair in &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Palace\"&gt;a long forgotten fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Ophinneb spent years in the fortress, and it accumulated both decoration and opulence.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Nightgrant\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Circle\"&gt;Witch Circle&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Sharval\"&gt;Sharval&lt;/a&gt; tried to treat with the Voidwound, she demanded the homes and families of the sacrifices she was to be given. A pact failed to be made. Later, Ophinneb and the other Voidwound (save &lt;a href=\"Catarag\"&gt;Catarag&lt;/a&gt;) were tricked by the &lt;a href=\"Untameable%20Wilds\"&gt;Untameable Wilds&lt;/a&gt; circle. The Voidwound were goaded into possessing the &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es, but this was a trap, as the Witches used themselves as vessels to carry their demonic hosts to the &lt;a href=\"Voidwound%20Cage\"&gt;Voidwound Cage&lt;/a&gt;. While it cost the circle dearly, Ophinneb and the other Voidwound were successfully imprisoned.\nYears later, the wards around their prison was damaged by the Cult of Terror, which allowed the Voidwound to awaken within their prison. Ophinneb relished the chance to be able to clothe herself once again with the &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;lives&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt;. Ophinneb was later killed by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;, and her &lt;a href=\"Skin-Veil%20Crown\"&gt;Skin-Veil Crown&lt;/a&gt; was sealed within the &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nOphinneb is the first Voidwound &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", introduced as part of the &lt;a href=\"Terror%27s%20Tide\"&gt;Terror's Tide&lt;/a&gt; update.

{"id": "8701", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8701", "title": "Golem", "text": "Golems are creatures that are animated from different elements. They appear frequently in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;\"Diablo\"&lt;/a&gt; series.\nLore.\nGolems can be summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;. While it is fairly simple for a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;animate&lt;/a&gt; dead tissue, it is another matter entirely to instill the spark of life into inanimate objects. Nonetheless, powerful necromancy can indeed bring golems into being. However, Golems are temporary constructs, and will quickly crumble into dust when their time runs out, when they are destroyed in combat, or when their master is killed. Golems can likewise only follow simple directions from their creator. If ordered to attack their master's foes, they will simply attack the nearest enemy, then the nearest after that, and so on. They will continue to attack until the Necromancer orders otherwise. Multiple Necromancers can combine their power to summon a single Golem.\nThe tallest Golem ever summoned was created at the hands of Master Necromancer &lt;a href=\"Maltorius\"&gt;Maltorius&lt;/a&gt;. However, he lost his record after a spike at the top of the Golem was cut from it.\nAt least &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Golem\"&gt;some Golems&lt;/a&gt; are capable of basic speech.\n&lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; was also able to create Golems. Notably, these Golems remained active long after his death. While other Golems are created by &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. necromancy), Kulle used living sand to animate his creations, imbuing within them the spark of life. A number of these Golems became wild and uncontrolled in the centuries following his death, and the secret of their construction was \"lost to time.\"\nGolem Types.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt; is the simplest form of Golem; a servant directly from the earth to serve the Necromancer. The intense drain this places on the psyche of the caster only allows him to maintain a single Golem of any type at a time. \nVariant types of Golem may be summoned by the priests. Through complicated arcane rituals and great mental concentration, a Necromancer can summon forth a &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt; from common base metals. The construct takes on the properties of the original source material, including any magical effects or other properties the original metal might have possessed. Additionally, by accelerating the particles of the air at an ever increasing pace, the Necromancer can force these particles to ignite, allowing a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Golem\"&gt;Fire Golem&lt;/a&gt; to appear seemingly out of thin air.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood\"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt; is a substance that has also been used in the creation of Golems. Utilizing a small quantity of their own blood, a Necromancer is able to give life to a creature neither living nor dead, yet formed of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; tissue. This &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Golem\"&gt;homunculus&lt;/a&gt; gains nourishment from the fresh blood of its slain enemies, from which it replenishes its strength. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; was able to raise &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Golem\"&gt;Flesh Golem&lt;/a&gt;s through the use of &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Gorger\"&gt;Flesh Gorger&lt;/a&gt;s were raised through a combination of earth, stone, and demon blood. &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Hurler\"&gt;Flesh Hurler&lt;/a&gt;s were born from the water and earth of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Marsh\"&gt;Blood Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Shaman\"&gt;Flesh Shaman&lt;/a&gt; was created through her own blood, and had mastery over &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther types of Golems that can be summoned by Necromancers include the Bone Golem, Decay Golem, Flesh Golem, and Ice Golem.\nKulle's Golems were mainly based around rock and stone.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nGolems were introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", where they could be summoned by using the spell or an item with golem charges, like the &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Onan\"&gt;Rod of Onan&lt;/a&gt;. There was only one type of golem in Diablo I. It was used most often by &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s as tanks and sometimes &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s with high &lt;a href=\"magic%20%28attribute%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. The Golems could not follow you downstairs and therefore self-destructed into clumps of rock as soon as you hit the stairwell. To train a Golem at level 1 required 81 magic.\nDiablo II.\nThe Golems were revamped in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", in which they could be summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; as one of his minions.\nThere are four variations of the Golem in Diablo II.\nYou can only have one Golem of any type at any time. Once you summon a new Golem, the old one will immediately disappear. You do not need a monster corpse to summon Golems although the Iron Golem requires an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;. Golems have a fixed &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt;, but their Life and damage increase on Nightmare, and again on Hell Difficulty.\nDiablo Immortal.\nGolems appear as enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", primarily in the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;.

Golems home in on nearby enemies. If nothing is nearby, they will walk in the direction their caster is facing. Golem's kills do grant &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo golems on a single level will attack each other (if two players summon them), and each player can only summon one golem (attempting to summon another will kill the older one). Venturing into another level automatically causes the golem to crumble into dust.\nGolems are immune to &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Curse\"&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/a&gt; and .\nIn addition to protection, it can be useful for &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s against triple &lt;a href=\"immune\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; foes in &lt;a href=\"Hell%20difficulty\"&gt;Hell difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. Golem can also be used to kill foes around corners, behind bars etc.\nA unique staff (\"&lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Onan\"&gt;Rod of Onan&lt;/a&gt;\") contains golem charges.\nCalculations:\nBugs.\nGolems are weak against &lt;a href=\"Succubi\"&gt;Succubi&lt;/a&gt;, as due to a bug in the Golem's light radius (it's set to infinite) every Succubus on the level sees the golem the moment it's cast, and will fire at the Golem if they have a line of sight. This can still be useful to take a pack of Succubi off the character's back."}

It improves the Necromancer's &lt;a href=\"Golems\"&gt;Golems&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\n\"Developing this skill permits the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; to divert more of his will and energies into his artificial creations. This allows the Necromancer to create more robust golems and control them with greater finesse. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nGolem Mastery is a passive skill that increases the &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"movement%20speed\"&gt;movement speed&lt;/a&gt; of all &lt;a href=\"Golems\"&gt;Golems&lt;/a&gt; that a Necromancer can summon. As a passive skill, its benefits are granted persistently and do not need be activated by use of the skill. It also grants a small bonus to all Golems' &lt;a href=\"attack%20rating\"&gt;attack rating&lt;/a&gt;, but, notably, not their &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough investing a lot of &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; into Golem Mastery grants the ability to produce extremely durable Golems, most Golems will still suffer from their greatest weakness: their inability to cause high damage, especially later in the game. In addition, while the speed bonus is welcome, it suffers from prominent diminishing returns and is usually not very necessary; Golems tend to keep up well and have few problems reaching enemies in time. A Necromancer who uses items with bonuses to skill levels may find it more prudent to invest a single point in Golem Mastery and spend other skill points elsewhere.\nThe extra life that each level of Golem Mastery grants Golems amounts to 20% of their \"base\" life:\nEven if a Golem is frequently destroyed in combat, a Necromancer should first consider that simply replacing it is often less cumbersome than investing more points in Golem Mastery. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;s are an obvious exception to this rule; a Necromancer who uses Iron Golems created from expensive items may choose to spend more points in Golem Mastery (as well as &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Resist\"&gt;Summon Resist&lt;/a&gt;) to keep them worthwhile.\nSynergy Details.\nNote that this skill takes actual skill level including all skill modifiers from equipment, buffs and similar into account when granting synergy bonuses. This is different to how most synergies work, since usually the raw skill points placed, without any modifiers, are used."}

Even &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; of these items is only available to Necromancers.\nThe set is named after &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, and focuses on Bone spells. In game files, this set is dubbed \"Saint\".\nPieces.\nThe set consists of six pieces. All six are required to complete the set, and all six are Necromancer-restricted.\nSet Bonus:\nThe first bonus plainly boosts the damage Bone Armor deals. Coupled with the third bonus, it actually turns the spell into a damaging attack.\nThe second bonus increases damage reduction per stack from 3% to 6%, to a maximum of 60% at 10 stacks. However, with &lt;a href=\"Wisdom%20of%20Kalan\"&gt;Wisdom of Kalan&lt;/a&gt;, the maximum number of stacks increases to 15, giving a potential of 90% damage reduction. An undocumented feature of the second bonus is that with every cast, \"all\" stacks of Bone Armor become \"refreshable\", so that every new cast brings the duration of \"each\" stack to its full duration.\nThe third bonus creates a storm of bone shards around the Necromancer that follows them when they move. The storm lasts while at least one stack of Bone Armor remains, and has a range of 15 yards. Any enemy within it both takes damage over time and takes greatly increased damage from any of the Necromancer's attacks. \nAs the 6-piece bonus dictates, upon contact with the swirling tornado from Bone Armor, the damage they take from the Necromancer is increased by 10,000%, this increase for some reason does NOT have any impact on the Bone Armor itself. Meaning the Bone Armor skill which is now a swirling tornado, does not gain the attributed benefits, even though the skill itself is indeed coming from the Necromancer.\nNote that &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; type of the tornado matches the Elemental Damage type of Bone Armor. Visually, the character will no longer be encased in bones. \nThis set is oriented at fighting in melee range. Limited Immunity rune is ill-advised with this set, as it brings the uptime of Bone Armor to just a few seconds per minute."}

Outraged by this, Kormac went with &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; to confront the Grand Maester, who told him that he wanted Kormac to join the order again, and eventually become its leader himself. Kormac refused, and the Grand Maester ordered his &lt;a href=\"Inquisitors\"&gt;Inquisitors&lt;/a&gt; to kill him, only to be slain along with his men in the battle that followed.\nIn-game.\nThe Grand Maester is a &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; Inquisitor, encountered during &lt;a href=\"The%20Templar%27s%20Reckoning\"&gt;The Templar's Reckoning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; quest in the &lt;a href=\"Templar%20Outpost\"&gt;Templar Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. In combat, he has Reflects Damage and Extra Health affixes, and also possesses all skills of Kormac, including the ability to heal himself and his allies. To finish the quest, both the Grand Maester and all his guards must be killed.\nNote that the Grand Maester is fought at two locations: once he loses enough &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, he will flee from the first hall, awaiting Kormac and the Nephalem with reinforcements in the second room.\nUpon death, he drops the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Maester%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Grand Maester's Journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Grand Maester is armed with the &lt;a href=\"Heraldic%20Heater\"&gt;Heraldic Heater&lt;/a&gt; shield and a .

He is notably the first (known) nephalem to &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nGratian lived in the early history of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;; one of four hunters alongside &lt;a href=\"Corvik\"&gt;Corvik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bersarik\"&gt;Bersarik&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Helgrotha\"&gt;Helgrotha&lt;/a&gt;. It was said that no animal could conceal its tracks from them, and no beast could stand against them. Always, the four hunted together, and were as close as kin. Gratian was beloved by the other three for his wisdom, and his grace with weapons.\nThe Last Hunt.\nOn what would be their last hunt, Bersarik declared that they would hunt the &lt;a href=\"aurochs\"&gt;aurochs&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;grasslands&lt;/a&gt; to the north. \u201cWe have never faced such a challenge,\u201d said Gratian, and when Bersarik asked him what he feared, he replied, \u201conly that we will fail.\u201d Bersarik declared that as the children of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, they could not. \nAfter three days of preparation, they left the golden city in which they dwelt, and traveled north. In the mountains, they were attacked by creatures similar to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Hawk\"&gt;Blood Hawk&lt;/a&gt;s, which they slew. Corvik declared them scavengers, and Gratian asked what made the animals think they could feast on their flesh, as they might other creatures? Though puzzled by the boldness of their attackers, they nevertheless continued on.\nIn the steppes, Gratian found the trail of the aurochs, and again declared that they had never faced such a challenge. Nevertheless, the quartet followed Bersarik\u2019s lead. For four days they tracked the trail the herd had made, ignoring the weakness crawling into their limbs. On the fifth day, they found the herd, and made plans to separate an aurochs from its kin. Gratian was uneasy, but they proceeded with the plan. They managed to corner one of the creatures before they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Ahduma\"&gt;Ahduma&lt;/a&gt;. Gratian stood between her and the trapped aurochs, and though his companions shouted and pleaded to him to flee, he was too stunned by the bulk of Ahduma\u2019s form to move. \nAhduma\u2019s right horn opened Gratian\u2019s belly. He fell to the earth, tangled with his own innards, before Ahduma trampled him. The aurochs fled, and with a sniff, Ahduma joined the creature she had saved. The remaining trio rushed over to Gratian, who lay twisted and blinking in the torn earth, unable to voice his agony. His jaw twitched but formed no words, and a few moments later, he died.\nLegacy.\nGratian\u2019s death had profound consequences for his fellows, as each reacted to his death in their own way. Helgrotha wandered into the world alone. Bersarik declared his intentions to hold his makers to account (in regards to the nephalem\u2019s mortality), and to this end, Corvik fashioned Gratian\u2019s bones and cords into a &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; which she named &lt;a href=\"Severian\"&gt;Severian&lt;/a&gt;, which she gifted to Bersarik (in a sense, Gratian \u2018\u2019became\u2019\u2019 Severian). Ultimately, Bersarik\u2019s quest for vengeance ended with &lt;a href=\"Kalmor\"&gt;Kalmor&lt;/a&gt; slaying him, who in turn went to slay Corvik, who had been driven insane by Gratian\u2019s death. Helgrotha, however, was spared, as among Gratian\u2019s three companions, she accepted death rather than ran from it. "}

Greater Evils) are the seven most powerful &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; lords of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. They are sub-divided into the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; (comprised of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;), and the four &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; (encompassing &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;).\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThe Great Evils were formed from the seven heads of &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;. The three most powerful of them were spawned from Tathamet's dominant heads, and became known as the Prime Evils, holding the balance of power within Hell. The weaker four became known as the Lesser Evils. Each one of them ruled over their own domain in Hell. They led their legions against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, while also waging wars against each other, destroying entire realms in the process.\nThe Eternal Conflict ground to a halt with the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the actions of &lt;a href=\"Jere%20Harash\"&gt;Jere Harash&lt;/a&gt; however, the Prime Evils were alerted to the existence of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, which dwelt upon it. The Prime Evils sought to turn humanity to their own ends, to use as pawns against the forces of Heaven, instigating the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Primes kept the existence of Sanctuary and humanity secret from the Lesser Evils.\nThe Dark Exile.\nThe Sin War ended with a truth brokered between Heaven and Hell, but the events had caused a wedge between the Prime and Lesser Evils. The Primes turned their attention to the perversion of human &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s, for they realized that mankind was key to their eventual victory over &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;. This deviation from the norm caused many of the Lesser Evils to question the authority of the Three, and so brought about a great rift between the Prime Evils and their servitors. That the Primes had not revealed the existence of Sanctuary to the Lesser Evils when they first discovered it prior to the Sin War had already soured relations between them and their lesser brothers, and &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would speculate hundreds of years later that this deception added to the Lessers' decision to rebel.\nA civil war erupted in Hell between the Prime and Lesser Evils, ending in the Lesser Evils' victory, and the banishment of the Primes to Sanctuary in what would be called the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;. As the fires of war died down, however, &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; began to argue over which of them held the higher authority. The pact that they had made quickly fell to ashes as the two demon lords took up arms against each other. The legions of Hell that remained were polarized behind either warlord, launching themselves into a second civil war.\nReunification.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Evils were still sundered\u2014the Primes sealed on Sanctuary, while the civil war between Azmodan and Belial continued to rage. However, Diablo escaped his prison from beneath the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; by possessing &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, intent on reuniting with his brothers. &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; concluded that the Primes would inevitably reclaim their position in Hell. Therefore, they endeavored to gain favor with the Lord of Terror by protecting his human host. However, over the sequence of events, five of the seven Evils were slain by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, and furthermore, the spirits of the Primes banished to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Azmodan and Belial the last remaining Great Evils.\nHowever, this was not the end, as over the next two decades, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; enacted Diablo's master plan. The essences of the Great Evils sans Azmodan and Belial lingered on Sanctuary, and over the years, Adria marked the essences of Baal, Mephisto, Duriel, and Andariel. As such, upon the moment of its completion, the essences of five of the Evils were drawn into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, and upon their respective defeats in Sanctuary, Belial and Azmodan as well. The plan Adria presented to her allies was that they could destroy all the Evils by destroying the stone once it had their essences. In truth, she was simply enacting Diablo's plan.\n&lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, spawned of a union between Diablo and Adria, became Diablo's new vessel. All essences of the Great Evils were drawn into him, making Diablo a singular Prime Evil. Tathamet reborn.\nDispersal.\nDiablo was ultimately defeated by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, and all seven of the Great Evils were drawn back into the Black Soulstone. However, the stone was taken by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, and in battle with the Nephalem, shattered the stone before drawing the essences of the Evils into himself. After his defeat, Malthael's body disintegrated, Diablo was released, still containing the essences of the other Evils. Eventually however, each of the Evils broke away from Diablo.\nMembership.\nPrime Evils.\nThe Prime Evils comprise the Three Brothers - the de facto rulers of Hell:\nLesser Evils.\nThe Lesser Evils are second only to the Three Brothers in terms of power and prestige but are nonetheless beneath them:"}

Natural leaders in life, they continue their positions of dominance within the ranks of the undead, rallying hordes of &lt;a href=\"mummies\"&gt;mummies&lt;/a&gt; about them as they seek the flesh of the living. Moving slightly faster than their lesser followers, Greater Mummies' scythe-like arms deliver devastating blows to any who move within striking distance. Their breath, filled with the vapors of the grave, is a deadly poison that has claimed the lives of many would-be heroes. These undead horrors also cast bolts of unholy energy at their enemies and can also raise the bodies of their undead minions, making them immediate targets whenever they are encountered. They are distinguished from their lesser breathren by their size and elaborate headresses.\nIn-game.\nGreater Mummies appear in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". They can raise any Low Undead in sight, though they can't raise High Undead: other Greater Mummies, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Archer\"&gt;Skeleton Archers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;. \nThey are able to shoot dark spheres of energy, the &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Bolt\"&gt;Unholy Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, which is the exact opposite of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Bolt\"&gt;Holy Bolt&lt;/a&gt; spell both visually and thematically. They have a powerful melee attack delivered by their &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;scythe&lt;/a&gt;-like arms, along with a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Breath\"&gt;Poison Breath&lt;/a&gt; attack. Greater Mummies don't move quickly, but their ability to rapidly cast Unholy Bolts makes them persistent opponents, especially in interior areas. It is best to kill Greater Mummies as quickly as possible, in order to negate their ability to revive undead enemies, but melee attacks have to bear their Poison Breath ability in mind. Another effective counter against these creatures is to lure their minions far away so they cannot be revived and once the minions are dealt with, the Greater Mummies are easily disposed of. \nThe unique version of the Unraveller often spawns with the &lt;a href=\"Multiple%20Shot\"&gt;Multiple Shot&lt;/a&gt; special ability. Players should be especially careful when facing this enemy. Normal Unravellers deal an unusually high amount of magic damage, and the Multiple Shots variant has been known to kill even the strongest adventurers with just two or three hits. \nThey also have a 15/20/25/30% chance respectively, to deal Poison damage with melee attacks. All Unravelers regenerate health 50% faster.\nThey are able to cast Bestow skill on any damaged low undead in vicinity ( only), it heals 20-50% of that monsters health on &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, 35-50% on &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and 50-55% on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; (values may be incorrect)"}

She first appeared in &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.1.0%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.1.0&lt;/a&gt; of\"\", as the end boss in The Inner Sanctum of &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt;, where she resides.\nIn-game.\nWhen players enter The Inner Sanctum, Greed is resting at her throne. Kicking the chest from beneath her foot will cause her to wake up.\nShe uses the following attacks, most of which can be outrun due to her very slow movement speed:\nOver the course of battle, Treasure Fiends jump from Greed's back when she charges into an obstacle. They do not attack players, but can be killed for extra loot, and immediately start to channel their escape portal. If all players die and reset the battle, whatever loot the Fiends dropped will be lost. A maximum of seven Treasure Fiends jump down, regardless of whether they're killed.\nOnce players bring Greed's Life down to around 5% of her maximum, the battle is won as Greed's Strongbox, a massive chest filled with items and gold, appears from above and crushes her. Players are stunned during this period, allowing any Treasure Fiends a chance to escape, although it is possible to kill them after the stun expires, with fast enough attacks. This chest has a guaranteed drop of two &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20items\"&gt;Legendary items&lt;/a&gt; per run (prior to any reward modifiers), but no gems or materials. If a player does not have the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Boon%20of%20the%20Hoarder\"&gt;Boon of the Hoarder&lt;/a&gt;, one will drop upon killing Greed. (Like other Legendary Gem drops, the Gem will not drop if it is equipped, in inventory, or in stash, including socketed in an item in those locations.)\nGreed's Strongbox can be slammed repeatedly onto Greed's bloodied corpse, which somehow ends up inside the chest. This has no real effect and does not award extra loot, but it creates quite a gruesome sight.\nOpening the chest begins a 60 second countdown to being forced out of the realm, sending players back to town. Another portal can be opened to a new instance of &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt; after time expires.\nDevelopment.\nInitially Greed was going to be male, but the development team changed the character to a female baroness. This fell in line with the beehive motif Blizzard was aiming for with the Vault, as per having a 'queen' at the end of the dungeon.\nThe repeatability of Greed's Strongbox animation smashing her corpse started as a glitch, but was left unchanged due to players' positive reactions.\nPersonality and Traits.\nGreed lives up to her namesake, and does not take kindly to intrusion into her realm. She is never satisfied, and sends her minions out to find gold constantly. The incoming gold in turn has to be tallied. And the existing gold must be inventoried to make sure none of it has gone missing. Plus, Greed takes a bath in all her gold every three hours. She is obsessed with all things valuable, and is compelled to increase her wealth."}

He collected a wide variety of plant and animal specimens, which he stored in his abode. He was a good friend of the city's ruler, &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Khan\"&gt;Juris Khan&lt;/a&gt;. As the city became besieged by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, he contributed the most to the spell that would supposedly take the city into &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;. However, he discovered Khan's affiliation with Diablo, and realized that the spell would in reality drag Ureh into &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. He reconfigured the spell, which saved Ureh from descending into Hell, but nonetheless left it stranded between worlds. He was &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed outside the city by Khan, and watched as Ureh faded away before his eyes. Mazi was left a broken man, and was found by the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;. They cared for him until his mind had healed enough, but afterwards, he left them, determined as he was to join his family and friends in Ureh. He traveled the world, looking for a means of joining his city. Along the way, he made notes of his discoveries. But twelve years after Ureh's disappearance, he returned to his now abandoned homeland, in the company of &lt;a href=\"Humbart%20Wessel\"&gt;Humbart Wessel&lt;/a&gt; and other mercenaries. Humbart observed that Mazi blamed himself for Ureh's fall, and often saw him praying for redemption. After seven days, Mazi again approached the edge of the city's ruins. Wessel opinioned that they should leave, but Mazi refused. As the light shone on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Nymyr\"&gt;Mount Nymyr&lt;/a&gt; at just the right angle. Ureh appeared to shimmer before their eyes, and Mazi entered. He never returned to them.\nUpon entering Ureh, Mazi discovered Father &lt;a href=\"Tobio\"&gt;Tobio&lt;/a&gt;, who had been imprisoned by Khan. Khan sought to return Ureh to the mortal realm, and they sought to prevent this, by destroying or removing the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Light\"&gt;Key of Light&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Key of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. Khan caught him with the Key of Shadow, and after a furious battle, defeated him, carving him into a sentinel. However, Tobio had managed to escape with the Key of Light, so for now, Khan's plans had been thwarted.\nLegacy.\nThe writings of Mazi and Wessel were recovered by the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; Sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Quov%20Tsin\"&gt;Quov Tsin&lt;/a&gt;, who followed in Mazi's footsteps, trying to gain access to Ureh. Khan and his daughter &lt;a href=\"Atanna\"&gt;Atanna&lt;/a&gt; presented a false version of history to the company, claiming that it was Mazi who had tried to damn them to Hell. In truth, Mazi had confronted Khan, and Mazi was embedded into Mount Nymyr itself. His body was left immobile, but his mind was still allowed to function. His body was found in the rock by the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;Zayl&lt;/a&gt; and the mercenary &lt;a href=\"Kentril%20Dumon\"&gt;Kentril Dumon&lt;/a&gt;, as they investigated the lower levels of Ureh's palace. Zayl suggested that Mazi was no longer concious, that his mind had been lost due to the extended period of imprisonment. However, he was indeed still concious, causing Zayl to perform a mercy killing. Mazi looked at Zayl with something that looked like gratitude, before his eyes closed."}

It is exclusive to &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nSteeped in intrigue, many myths abound about Greyhollow Island, ranging from its supposed great treasures to a great evil said to plague the island. What few facts are known have been passed on by crazed hermits, demented &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s, and the whispers of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe island itself is located several miles off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, and can be seen from its &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;. However, not even the might of Westmarch's &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; has ever been able to verify its location, and many believe it to be little more than legend. Rumors abound that those who visit are doomed to never return. Wild beasts and supernatural creatures prowl the island, and the land itself is said to be hungry for &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. Forests cover the island, and its jagged shores are littered with shipwrecks. The island is surrounded by rocky shallows, treacherous currents, and bizarre weather patterns.\nHistory.\nRise and Fall.\nThanks to the treacherous seas surrounding it, Greyhollow's civilization developed in isolation. Often times, such isolated societies grow and advance at incredible rates, and Greyhollow was no different. In Greyhollow's case, because of its isolation, it did not have to spend any resources on defending itself. Cut off from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s developed civilizations, Greyhollow became the center of a grand empire. However, while Greyhollow enjoyed the benefits of physical isolation, it also had to contend with the cost of philosophical isolation. Ideas that have might otherwise been challenged developed within its culture. A new religion took hold, and as part of this new faith, its citizens devoted their cause to a mysterious and, as is often the case in Sanctuary, completely evil being. Until recently, all was known was that this individual was female, and was within Greyhollow's civilization from its inception, and there at its end. Theories have ranged that this woman was a &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, a Wizard, or simply a very charismatic &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; who managed to prolong her existence. It has even been suggested that there was no one individual, but rather a multitude of individuals who all took on the same identity of the same figure. But for reasons unknown, this unimaginably advanced society collapsed, leaving ruin, chaos, and a lingering curse behind. Greyhollow entered a dark age that it never recovered from. This figure of myth's role was also mysterious, as to whether she caused the fall herself, or whether her death precipitated it. The island was deemed cursed ever since, and few people who dared venture there, exposed to the evil of the Greyhollow, perished as they were quickly driven equally mad.\nOver the years, inquisitive adventurers would catch glimpses of this land off in the distance, though many presumed it to be an illusion, perhaps even a trap devised by the many evils that inhabited the world. Some found themselves on the island without choice, such as sailors, pirates, etc. Others who found their curiosity insatiable attempted to travel to and explore the land, dreaming of notoriety or wealth. Instead, each journey ended in tragedy, as those foolish enough to pursue this myth were never to be seen again. Most died on the island's shores, and the few that made it inland did not survive long. This mystery gave Greyhollow an aura of mystique, and numerous myths grew over the years.\nThe Mystery Unveiled.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; succeeded where others had failed. As became evident from &lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; found across the island, the deity worshiped by the inhabitants turned out to be a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Nereza\"&gt;Nereza&lt;/a&gt;. The young priest &lt;a href=\"Rayeld\"&gt;Rayeld&lt;/a&gt; (who would later be known as The Crazed Man) attempted to rid the island of her, yet only partly succeeded: while the physical body of the demon had been killed, the evil eventually overcame the land, turning it into a dark place infested with horrific creatures, and leaving no sane living people around. Rayeld tried to contain the evil and keep the rest of the world safe from Nereza's corruption by erecting wards and performing rituals, until he finally lost his sanity, trapped alone on the cursed soil..\nIn-game.\nGreyhollow is exclusive to the game's Adventure Mode, and exists outside the main narrative of Diablo III. It features seven s and a number of &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt;s; both of these are designed to reveal the story over time. &lt;a href=\"Bounties\"&gt;Bounties&lt;/a&gt; also feature in the area.\nThe zone can be accessed via a separate &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;Waypoint&lt;/a&gt; in the northern part of the map in Act V.\nMonsters.\nGreyhollow Island features monster types unique to the zone, some of which are variants of creatures in other Acts with drastically different abilities.\nIn addition to the island itself, &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20Caves\"&gt;Tidal Caves&lt;/a&gt; below the island's surface feature additional monster types:\nDevelopment.\nThe area was originally intended to be released as part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20King%20in%20the%20North\"&gt;The King in the North&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion. After the expansion was canceled, it was released as free content.\nThe initial idea for Greyhollow Island was to make it a forest zone. The concept was first pitched at the same time as &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Sescheron\"&gt;Ruins of Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;. Early pitches had much less vegetation than the final version.\nFew sketches were developed for Greyhollow, and the ideas for the zone came together quickly. The area is designed to embody the motif of man vs Nature; to this end, it was decided to employ as few humanoid monster designs as possible. Inspiration for the zone was taken for a variety of real-world locations, one of them being \"the Graveyard of the Pacific\"; a section of the Pacific Northwest coast of the United States, which is known for having a high number of shipwrecks. The island has also been likened to the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle\"&gt;Bermuda Triangle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Greyhollow storyline was designed to be optional, with players allowed to choose the level of their investment within the zone's lore. The storyline was intended to be driven more by exploration than exposition, with less of a main narrative, and more focus on mystery and side story, players being tasked with figuring out the area's story by themselves. The overall story is outside the events of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is intended that the monsters of Greyhollow have a \"natural\" feel to them (e.g. animals), and that there be relatively few human-based enemies (zombies, ghosts, etc.)"}

The ward itself lasts 40 seconds; the frightening effect has a significantly shorter duration.\u00a0Using this spell prevents that corpse from being used in any other way, including &lt;a href=\"Find%20Item\"&gt;Find Item&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Find%20Potion\"&gt;Find Potion&lt;/a&gt;. \nGrim ward is useful in some situations, but generally obeys same limitations as &lt;a href=\"Howl\"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;: it also does not stack with other Fear effects and other Warcries. It doesn't affect other players, &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, and some monsters like s. As Grim Ward is long-lasting and is immobile, it effectively creates a safe zone to (for instance) kill &lt;a href=\"Elites\"&gt;Elites&lt;/a&gt; without them receiving reinforcements.\nAs the Grim Ward makes monsters flee, this effect is detrimental for melee builds.

A balding man, his lifetime of smithwork showed in his hulking shoulders, huge biceps and meaty hands. He was friendly, especially to adventurers who had the &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt; to pay for his services.\nBiography.\nGriswold spent most, if not all of his life, in smithwork. He labored and studied for many years to devise the &lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Masterpiece\"&gt;perfect sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nDue to the awakening of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and corruption of &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, tough times befell the town of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. This included Leoric executing many villagers for \"kidnapping\" his son &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Albrecht\"&gt;Prince Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;, the king's madness only ending at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;Lachdanan&lt;/a&gt;. However, darkness remained, and the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be the source. Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; persuaded many of the town's inhabitants to enter the labyrinth beneath the cathedral in order to rescue the young prince. Griswold, now in his forties, was among them.\nUnfortunately, Lazarus was in service to the Lord of Terror and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s beset the mob. Griswold waded into battle, using his bulk and brute strength to shatter the skulls of &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Imp\"&gt;imps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Beast\"&gt;siege beasts&lt;/a&gt; until suffering a terrible leg wound. Thanks to &lt;a href=\"Farnham\"&gt;Farnham&lt;/a&gt;, Griswold survived, but his leg wound rendered him incapable of fighting.\nDarkness and despair settled over Tristram. However, salvation arrived in the form of Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt;. Griswold did what he could, selling and buying arms and armor. Eventually, Aidan succeeded in vanquishing the Lord of Terror.\nThe Bitter Taste of Victory.\nAlthough Aidan had saved Tristram, a feeling of dread remained in the town, Griswold included, the effects of demonic contact lingering with him. One day, Aidan suddenly left, demons subsequently descending on the town. Griswold was among those who fell to the minions of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, and was transformed into a &lt;a href=\"Griswold%20%28monster%29\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;. However, a new group of heroes slew him.\nGame NPC.\nDiablo.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", Griswold is an NPC resident of Tristram who can be found outside his smithy in the town center. He buys and sells &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; (except &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and accessories. He also repairs damaged armor and weapons for a price. He initiates the quest, giving the hero &lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Edge%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Griswold's Edge&lt;/a&gt; upon its completion.\nDiablo II.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Griswold%20%28monster%29\"&gt;Griswold (monster)&lt;/a&gt;\"\nGriswold appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" as an undead &lt;a href=\"Griswold%20%28monster%29\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, there are a number of items in the game that bear his name, particularly &lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Edge%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;the sword from the first game&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Legacy\"&gt;Griswold's Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, usable only by &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s. These items are as follows:\nDiablo III.\nGriswold does not make an appearance, monster form or not, but his shop is still there destroyed as the player makes their way through the quest line into Old Tristram. He is referenced in items though, such as &lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Masterpiece\"&gt;Griswold's Masterpiece&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Perfection\"&gt;Griswold's Perfection&lt;/a&gt; swords, &lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Scribblings\"&gt;Griswold's Scribblings&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Blacksmithing\"&gt;Tome of Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;. Although this is randomized, you can also find the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20of%20Fury\"&gt;Anvil of Fury&lt;/a&gt; sitting plainly at the blacksmith shop's door, which, in Normal difficulty, will drop the &lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Worn%20Edge\"&gt;worn edge&lt;/a&gt; made by him as a weapon for the heroes in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nGriswold was a stoic, loud and very honest man. Despite his intimidating presence and large build, he was a gentle giant, a kind soul that genuinely cared for Tristram and its inhabitants, believing firmly that putting oneself above others was the true virtue of a good person.\nHe and &lt;a href=\"Farnham\"&gt;Farnham&lt;/a&gt; had a brotherly bond, with Griswold saying he wouldn't been able to come out alive of &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;' trap if Farnham wasn't there to help. He also had a deep concern for &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt;'s new, dangerous way of life following the traumatic return from the labyrinth; he tried to encourage the boy to work at the forge with him, but his offer was refused. Griswold was also incredibly grateful for Ogden to help keeping the town together with his tavern and supplies.\nBecause of his warm personality, Griswold was beloved by nearly all the inhabitants of Tristram. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; considered him a man of courage and honesty, while &lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; all acknowledged and praised his exceptional crafting skills, the latter stating that Griswold was a like a sorcerer capable of melding and bending steel. &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt; considered Griswold a hero like the late &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;. Wirt was skeptical and sour, but even he was grateful to Griswold, especially since his life was saved thanks to him.\nGriswold was truly passionate for his craft at the forge, and proudly spoke of his weapons as if they were his own children. When interacting with the heroes, he would give them advice about how to deal with the forces of hell, and reassure them that he could fix their equipment as brand new."}

They are often encountered within the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; or other dungeons. They are lethal creatures for two reasons: First, they are capable of dealing damage by producing spikes from their short, stubby arms and slamming forward. Secondly, Grotesque are basically living pinatas: upon death they explode and expel whatever lurked in their bellies.\nIn patch 2.4, their additional danger was a bug that could prevent them from dropping loot or even make them unkillable and untargetable by freezing their model between stages.\nTips and Additional Information.\nGrotesques are dangerous foes, mostly because of their rupture-attack. In addition, they are surprisingly fast for their size, so think twice about outrunning them. Like most enemies, Grotesques are deadliest when encountered in groups.\nTheir spike-attack does moderate damage, but should not be a major concern. Their rupture-ability can easily kill a weakened player however, especially when multiple Grotesques die simultaneously. When a Grotesque dies you have approximately three seconds to run for cover before the creature detonates. This explosion triggers regardless of which way the monster is killed, and if they have Molten affix, two explosions will occur.\nThe Grotesque's rupture can be used against other monsters. When you battle a group of creatures including a Grotesque, make the Grotesque your priority. The explosion will take out most enemies nearby. This also works for packs of Rare Grotesque &lt;a href=\"Minions\"&gt;Minions&lt;/a&gt; and Unique monsters. Killing one might detonate the entire pack, and spawned creatures may be killed by the explosion of another Grotesque.\nMonsters spawned from the Grotesque upon death include &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Worms\"&gt;Corpse Worms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imp%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Demon Imps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swarm%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Vile Swarms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spiders\"&gt;Spiderlings&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and even &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Mother\"&gt;Wretched Mother&lt;/a&gt;s on higher difficulties, depending on the location."}

It is one of the major ways the &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; of an attack &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; can be increased beyond its base level defined by equipped &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and the skill itself.\nA critical hit has a specific chance of happening, for each enemy hit by an attack. When it occurs, the attack causes additional damage. Monsters cannot deliver critical hits, only player characters can. Both the Critical Hit Chance and Critical Hit Damage (CHD) bonus are significant character stats, and can be increased by &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s, and other sources.\nSome classes and skills also have special effects that only trigger on a critical strike, such as &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power\"&gt;Arcane Power&lt;/a&gt; regained for s. On the other hand, many &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Over%20Time\"&gt;Damage Over Time&lt;/a&gt; attacks cannot be Critical Hits. Instead, they receive a flat bonus to damage based on the expected damage weighted between crits and non-crits, which can be calculated by multiplying Critical Hit Damage by Critical Hit Chance. This way, Damage Over Time still benefits from crit stats, although they will never trigger effects that require a critical hit to happen.\nCritical hit mechanics replace (and partially incorporate) many passive weapon effects from &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"slain%20monsters%20rest%20in%20peace\"&gt;slain monsters rest in peace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Strike\"&gt;Deadly Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; etc.\nAn attack that delivered a critical hit uses a different, larger font for its popup damage number.\nDiablo III.\nCritical Hit Chance defaults to 5%. Increased chance is normally rollable on gloves (up to +10%), rings (6%), bracers (6%), amulets (10%), helms (6%) and off-hand items (10%), for a total of +54% maximum from items. Some s may make different amounts or slots possible, and their unique powers may also modify Critical Hit Chance, for one, some, or all attacks depending on the power.\nCritical Hit Damage (CHD) starts at +50%. Bonuses from items are normally possible on gloves (up to +50%), amulets (+100%), and rings (50%), or +250% total. Some &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; can roll this stat on other slots. &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt;s in weapon sockets also increase CHD, by up to +130%, and are generally the most used gem type for weapons because of the significant increase this brings to overall damage.\nIn \"Diablo III\", when a critical hit kills the enemy, its corpse is destroyed. The animation used depends on the type of damage dealt. For example, &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; damage may cause the target to be vaporized, while &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage can tear the victim limb from limb, and &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; damage can freeze the enemy solid, then shatter it, etc. Whatever the case may be, its corpse cannot be revived by other monsters (like &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;Fallen Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s). Corpses that normally cause on-death damage (&lt;a href=\"Accursed\"&gt;Accursed&lt;/a&gt; noxious vapors, &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Molten&lt;/a&gt; explosion etc.) are not subject to this effect, so the monster's post-mortem revenge will occur as usual despite the critical hit. These effects only destroy corpses that monsters can use: secondary resource of s, the corpses only visible to them, remain intact. This includes the Necromancers' own attacks, so they don't leave themselves without fresh bodies with their own critical blows.\nEach class has a cap of Critical Hit Chance from items and skills (in addition to 5% innate chance):\nIn addition to those bonuses,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; levels can add up to +5% more critical hit chance and +50% critical hit damage. &lt;a href=\"Shi%20Mizu%27s%20Haori\"&gt;Shi Mizu's Haori&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Promises\"&gt;Broken Promises&lt;/a&gt; make all hits guaranteed Critical Hits on certain conditions.\nObviously, Critical Hit Chance is capped at 100% (achievable by legitimate means). Critical Hit Damage has no cap other than what is already allowed by skills, class, and equipment/Paragon levels.\nDiablo Immortal.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", the default Critical Hit Chance is , and that of Critical Hit Damage is . The amount written in the player stat is the bonus Chance and Damage on the default values.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally, each Critical Hit was supposed to cause a certain &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; effect in addition to increased damage, such as &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; attacks, or &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is one of the first skills an Amazon can learn in the &lt;a href=\"Passive%20and%20Magic%20Skills\"&gt;Passive and Magic Skills&lt;/a&gt; tab.\nCritical Strike is also the name of the effect provided by skills of &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Claw%20Mastery\"&gt;Claw Mastery&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s (various weapon-specific &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Masteries\"&gt;Combat Masteries&lt;/a&gt;). They also allow a chance to do double damage on attacks.\nLore.\n\"Among the arsenal of techniques employed by the Amazon &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; is her ability to study opponents carefully and detect any weaknesses. She can then use these deficiencies in her adversary to strike at precisely those areas that will cause the greatest injuries.\"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nCritical Strike grants the Amazon a chance to deal double the damage her strike would normally have dealt. Other effects, including non-physical damage, still only apply once. Amazons who focus on skills that deal elemental damage (&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Fury\"&gt;Lightning Fury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Arrow\"&gt;Freezing Arrow&lt;/a&gt; or such) only gain a doubling of the physical component of their damage.\nInvesting in this skill suffers heavily from diminishing returns. There is only a 10% better chance to release critical strikes between levels 11 and 20, which averages to about less than 0.5% per point. Most of the time, placing just one point into it is plenty, especially when paired with items that grant bonus skill levels.\nBecause Critical Strike works with any weapon, it is a very useful Amazon skill regardless of build. Critical Strike is potent because it is a Passive skill, so it is always active and combines with any additional skills such as &lt;a href=\"Multiple%20Shot\"&gt;Multiple Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce\"&gt;Pierce&lt;/a&gt; and so on.\nAny points invested into Critical Strike also grants &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; summons the same chance to deal twice the amount of damage.\n &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Masteries\"&gt;Combat Masteries&lt;/a&gt; give the chosen weapon type a chance to deal Critical Strike, functioning just like this skill."}

{"id": "27873", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27873", "title": "Crowd Control", "text": "Crowd Control (a.k.a. Control Impairing Effects or Status Effects, often abbreviated as CC) is a common term for all negative effects that can be placed on players or monsters which impede their ability to act rather than than dealing &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; or changing the amount of damage received. The name implies their purpose; they are mostly used to buy the attacker time to deal their own damage (or cover their escape), while preventing numerous or overly strong enemies from offensive actions or normal movement.\nCrowd Control is mostly used against hordes of lesser enemies to prevent them from overwhelming the player by number, but is also often utilized against single targets to minimize the danger their attacks pose. It can also be used to finish off an enemy while keeping its allies from intervening. In PvP, Crowd Control is especially important, as players are using more cunning tactics, and their combat potential is affected more by all effects that prevent them from acting normally even for a second.\nCrowd Control is often applied by &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s automatically or with high probability, but many &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; grant a small chance to apply crowd control also. If a character is using multiple such items, the chances are combined into a single percentage, checked upon each attack.\nIn most games Crowd Control has built-in diminishing returns against enemies, preventing endless re-use of Crowd Control (\"stunlocking\") from trivializing fights.\nDiablo I.\nIn the original \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", only two forms of Crowd Control existed (three if hit animation counts, i.e. microstun, although that is a property of any attack, not a specific trait or skill, and four if one counts the \"&lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;\"-only spells):\nDiablo II.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" added more forms, used by both players and monsters, but removed the Stone Curse and Berserk, replacing them with similar, but different mechanics:\nDiablo Immortal.\n effects in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" are:\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", all of the effects from Diablo II, except Stone Curse/Berserk and Dim Vision, are used, many of them altered compared to Diablo II, one new effect was added, and one was cut prior to release:\nSome monsters may be partially or completely immune to some (or even all) forms of Crowd Control, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt; being immune to Charm, Knockback and Confusion.\nCrowd Control Resistance.\nAlso, in \"Diablo III\" monsters have the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Crowd Control Resistance&lt;/a&gt;\" for balancing reasons. Each form of Crowd Control has its own resistance, so using one type will not dampen the effectiveness of others.\nThis makes it very hard to control the monster continuously. Monster CC resistance stacks up to a maximum of 95%. In addition, very large monsters are generally immune to Knockback. Both &lt;a href=\"Elites\"&gt;Elites&lt;/a&gt; and normal monsters can build resistance to crowd control.\nSome monsters are so protected against crowd control effects that very few, if any at all, work on them. Great examples of this could be the &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, and most &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;. For encounters like these, little more than directly damaging the foes will suffice. Other bosses may be affected by certain types of crowd control, or summon regular monsters who are vulnerable to those. &lt;a href=\"Juggernaut%20%28Monster%29\"&gt;Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elites\"&gt;Elites&lt;/a&gt; are also immune to Crowd Control, at the cost of taking more damage and moving slower.\nPlayers may build up their own CC resistance as well, by stacking the corresponding stat (\"reduces duration of control impairing effects\"). This stat can roll up to 40% per item at level 70. It can be stacked all the way up to 100% (though legitimately obtainable maximum is 99.26%), where the effects become nearly unnoticeable. This, however, is multiplicative; as &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; adds to this protection, they will find that its aid weakens. The diminishing returns are calculated as follows: having two items that each increase CC resistance by 40% will grant a total of 64% protection, not 80%, as the total duration of a CC effect would be (1 \u2014 0.4) x (1 \u2014 0.4) = 0.36 = 36%.\nSome skills and/or items (for example, &lt;a href=\"Invigorating%20Gemstone\"&gt;Invigorating Gemstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bottomless%20Potion%20of%20the%20Unfettered\"&gt;Bottomless Potion of the Unfettered&lt;/a&gt;) may even make players completely immune to some or all forms of CC effects, such as the &lt;a href=\"Cannot%20Be%20Frozen\"&gt;Cannot Be Frozen&lt;/a&gt; affix that allows ignoring Freeze effects. Morphing skills ('s &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Berserker\"&gt;Wrath of the Berserker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Akarat%27s%20Champion\"&gt;Akarat's Champion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;'s , &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Epiphany\"&gt;Epiphany&lt;/a&gt;) also make the player briefly immune to all forms of CC. In addition, some skills may break one, several or all Crowd Control effects that are already applied to the player character."}

These living fortresses use impenetrable plate and towering shields to wade through scores of foes, leaving demonic bodies smoldering in their wake.\nThe thick of battle is unforgiving, but crusaders rush in without hesitation, relying on holy magic and heavy armor to guarantee victory. Well-trained crusaders are adept at deflecting attacks entirely, often shrugging off massive blows that would fell lesser combatants. If pressed, they can sacrifice speed and mobility for pure staying power.\nBone-crunching flails and wicked shields are perfect for melee, but crusaders are hardly limited to extinguishing evil at close range. When one of these divinely empowered warriors joins battle, blazing fire and blinding light follow, smiting entire packs of enemies who dare to resist judgment.\nGameplay.\n The Crusader is a mid-range hybrid caster/melee class wielding a &lt;a href=\"flail\"&gt;flail&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.

The Crusader uses &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20%28Crusader%29\"&gt;Wrath&lt;/a&gt; as his/her energy resource, and uses battle magic to strengthen allies and weaken foes.\u00a0Crusaders are the only class with a passive skill, &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Strength\"&gt;Heavenly Strength&lt;/a&gt;, that allows them to equip &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons with Shields.\nWith skills that force attackers to focus on them while punishing them for doing so and mitigating or eliminating the incoming damage, the Crusader is the definitive tank class. He/she is better suited to simply standing there and soaking up dangerous boss attacks than any other class, and can enable other players to waste less time running away instead of doing damage. Crusaders are also incredibly proficient with &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt;, in fact being the only class to use those as a real tool of protection, many skills increasing the potency of &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;s.\u00a0Moreover, being masters of retribution, Crusaders are the only class that can make truly shine, turning the mediocre reflection of damage into a powerful offensive weapon.\nAlthough it was not initially put in place, a patch has provided the Crusaders with a +30% built-in damage reduction, to help ease the dangerous nature of melee combat.\nThe Crusader's story is retroactively included in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\"\u2014 &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s will question and interact with the Crusader as readily as other classes.\nOn the Hero Creation screen, the following is stated: \"The Crusader uses cruel flails and shields to dominate the battlefield and cleanse the world of corruption. The Crusader is imbued with the righteous power of Wrath. Each attack generates more, which in turn allows the Crusader to unleash ever more devastating powers\". \nCrusaders have six class sets:\nThere are three types of Crusader class items: &lt;a href=\"Flails\"&gt;Flails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20Flails\"&gt;Two-Handed Flails&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Shields\"&gt;Crusader Shields&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkills.\nThe Crusader has a variety of skills. Most of them are used either in melee or at medium range, as opposed to s who are almost exclusively fighting in melee. Many of these skills also have potent &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; effects, mostly &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blind\"&gt;Blind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;. The Crusaders focus on &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Damage\"&gt;Holy Damage&lt;/a&gt;, but can use &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Damage\"&gt;Lightning Damage&lt;/a&gt; as well, along with a few &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; runes prior to patch 2.4 (items with bonus Cold damage do not smart-drop for Crusaders).\nMany of the Crusader skills require &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt; to be equipped before these skills can be used.\nAlmost all Crusader skills are damage dealing, or can be enhanced to deal damage over area of effect, hitting more than one enemy with a single cast. This makes Crusaders especially effective against hordes of lesser enemies. While less potent than &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;'s, some of the Crusader skills can heal them or allies. The defensive skills of the Crusader are resourceful as well: they can summon a mythical warhorse, encase themselves in holy armor, or even turn into mighty avatar of &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most potent Crusader skills are notable for dealing damage independently, being usable even while the character is engaged in direct combat.\nThe Crusader never fights alone: &lt;a href=\"Avatars%20of%20the%20Order\"&gt;Avatars of the Order&lt;/a&gt; always follow them, appearing at the time of need. They may form an invincible &lt;a href=\"Phalanx\"&gt;Phalanx&lt;/a&gt;, or even launch a long-range &lt;a href=\"Bombardment\"&gt;Bombardment&lt;/a&gt; with pinpoint accuracy.\nCrusaders' arsenal also includes Laws skills, similar to &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Auras\"&gt;Auras&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;'s Mantras. All of these skills have an active and passive effect, and only one law skill can be used at a time.\nPopular Crusader Skill combinations include:\nDevelopment.\nThe concept of the Crusader existed during the development of Diablo III, prior to release. A scenario existed where Blizzard would either develop the as a class and add the Crusader in an expansion, or vice versa. The Monk was ultimately chosen.\nThe Crusader originally began life as a darker Paladin-type class. &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Mosqueira\"&gt;Josh Mosqueira&lt;/a&gt; wanted it to be a 'dark' class, to balance out against &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Crusader turned into something different over the course of development. The Crusader thus differentiated from the Paladin, as the team wanted to broaden Sanctuary's lore. While the Crusader is melee orientated, it is intended to be different from the &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; classes. Most, if not all Crusader lore was developed by &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Kindregan\"&gt;Brian Kindregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe core idea of the Crusader is to mix a Paladin with the war ethos of a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan\"&gt;Spartan&lt;/a&gt;, and a modern armored tank, the idea coming from lead designer &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Martens\"&gt;Kevin Martens&lt;/a&gt;. The three core pillars of the Crusader design were deemed thus:\nIn the brainstorming phase for the Crusader, the development team was allowed to submit any kind of skill idea as long as the skill related to one of these 'pillars.' It was decided to do a 50/50 split for the Crusader's skills, half of them being melee based, the other half being ranged.\nWhen designing the Crusader, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; employed an art technique referred to as \"shape language.\" Shape language is the overall simplification of the major elements down to basic geometric shapes. By using rectangular angles, artists emphasied the Crusader's heavy armored knight ethos. However, unlike the armor, the Crusader's clothes are designed to represent the fact that Crusaders are capable of using &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and are not entirely based on melee gameplay. After some brainstorming, designers settled on four pillars of Crusader design\u2014the body armor, the cloth element, the shield, and the flail. The flail was chosen as heavily armored warriors are traditionally depicted as wielding a flail or mace. Maces generally lean towards a clergymen or clerical type of character, while the Crusader definitely leans more towards the martial side of things. Thus, the flail was chosen.\nCrusader animations ran into a hiccup in that the idle pose was deemed too rigid. The pose was altered to look more fluid and dynamic."}

Unbending champions of faith and law, Crusaders' formidable skills and abilities once set them apart on the battlefield, wading through scores of foes and leaving &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic bodies in their wake. Experienced veterans, Crusaders often spent their lives on the move, in the wilderness and city alike, taking part in thousands of fights from epic battles to back alley brawls. The thick of battle was unforgiving, but Crusaders rushed in without hesitation, relying on &lt;a href=\"holy%20magic\"&gt;holy magic&lt;/a&gt; and heavy armor to guarantee victory. Well-trained Crusaders were adept at deflecting attacks entirely, often shrugging off massive blows that would fell lesser combatants. If pressed, they could sacrifice speed and mobility for pure staying power. Crusaders took zealotry to a whole new level, finding comfort and strength in their unshakable confidence in their undying cause. When one of these divinely empowered warriors joins battle, blazing fire and blinding light follow, smiting entire packs of enemies who dare to resist judgment.\nThe Crusaders' only goal is to find a way to save their faith; any other objectives will fall to the wayside should it ever threaten to impede their quest. Each Crusader swears an oath to follow this goal to the death, though they are free to decide the method through which they fulfill it. The oath does not prohibit Crusaders from romantic attraction. Unlike other &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; orders, the Crusaders have never fallen to corruption. Oathbreakers are rarely punished physically. Instead, they are scourged by the Light such that their spirits bear the mark.\nCrusaders are a group of men and women chosen not only for their formidable prowess and cunning on the battlefield, but also for their uncompromising and unyielding dedication to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Tracing their origins to the early days of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith, they represent an older and perhaps purer version of the faith than it is currently known on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Many Crusaders often show signs of their &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; heritage, and their belief states that the mingling of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; and demon produced the only truly balanced beings in Creation (&lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity).\nCrusaders lived off the land, and never stayed in settled places for longer than is necessary. Crusaders developed secret symbols and hand gestures to communicate with other Crusaders should they encounter by chance. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, it was rare for Crusaders to interact with one another or the public as a unit, which was part of the reason why they remained unnoticed for so long. Individual Crusaders make no attempt to mask their presence however, and it is rumored they speak openly about their quest to anyone with the courage to ask. Because of the presence of lice in the &lt;a href=\"Swamplands\"&gt;Swamplands&lt;/a&gt;, many male Crusaders (and some female) shave their hair off, in order to reduce the chance of lice infestation. That, and it reduces the time needed to spend bathing between battles.\nThe quest of the Crusaders is eternal. Their goal is not only to remove the taint of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, but purge &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; of all evil through discipline, honor, and unswerving vigilance. Thus, as long as &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;'s influence lingers in the mortal realm, the Crusaders will not rest until their task is done. Crusaders believe strongly in signs and symbols. The Crusaders believe that the discipline of their lives ennobles them, and they are to find meaning within the quest itself. Each Crusader is sworn to live and die as one.\u00a0The fate of criminals among the Crusaders is unknown, however it is suggested to be incredibly harsh.\nCrusaders have been operating too long to take anything apart from their crusade seriously. This allows them to generally be relaxed individuals, and they enjoy witty conversation whenever possible. Excitement comes only from the thought of ending their crusade.\n&lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim&lt;/a&gt; is the only &lt;a href=\"Que-Hegan\"&gt;Que-Hegan&lt;/a&gt; worshipped by the Crusaders.\nStrength and Succession.\nBecause of the focused purpose and lifestyle of the Crusaders, the order is quite small. The first generation of Crusaders who set out for the east numbered 427, and their number has diminished over time. Each Crusader took an apprentice with them. When a Crusader passed away in battle, the apprentice would take their master's armor and weapons as their own, along with their place in the order and even their very identity. The rationale behind this is that by taking the name of their master, the former apprentice will live up to their sacrifice.\nAt least early on in an apprentice's training, a Crusader has the right to release them from their vows and allow them to return to normal life. Crusaders of subsequent generations have repeated this cycle of succession, choosing a single initiate to train. Initiates are chosen from local populations, and the choice is based on a number of factors such as the initiate's affinity for the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt; and talent for the Light. Apprentices are generally recruited from the wilderness or working-class parts of a city. When they identify a child as their intended apprentice, they often negotiate with the child\u2019s family to start the apprenticeship. Rich families are less likely to initiate their children into such endeavors, so Crusaders usually come from peasant or lower class families. To become an initiate, an individual must expunge any vestige of their former life. Affinity with the Light by itself is not enough however, and initiates train extensively throughout their apprenticeship to master their innate abilities. Only when they take their master's place do they achieve the rank of Crusader themselves. Crusaders often travel in pairs (master and apprentice,) however, some Crusaders travel alone, having inherited the mantle from their masters, but not yet taken an apprentice of their own. If a Crusader perishes/disappears without having taken an apprentice, their name is struck from the Crusader rolls. The lives of at least some Crusaders are recorded in the order's annals. Crusaders' lifespans tend to be short, and their lives are filled with hardship.\nIn the late 13th century, the Crusaders differed physically from their forebears;&lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; referred to them as \"tall blonde warriors,\" very different from their &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;i forefathers. While these Crusaders still bear the name of their forefathers, they are ethnically of Sanctuary's far east rather than Kehjistan.\nArmament.\nCrusaders are traditionally equipped with &lt;a href=\"flails\"&gt;flails&lt;/a&gt; and towering &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;. To brandish a Crusader's shield requires extraordinary training, as they're used for more than just protection. Crusaders hew about with their shields, flinging them like &lt;a href=\"javelins\"&gt;javelins&lt;/a&gt; or bashing their opponents into a daze. Veteran crusaders learn to grip a giant two-handed weapon in one mailed fist or swing a one-handed weapon with incredible speed.\nA Crusader's life is fraught with peril and they must dress accordingly. For armor, fledgling Crusaders use gear light enough for wide-ranging travel, displaying distinct Zakarum iconography. Crusaders who\u2019ve spent time picking over battlefields furnish themselves with heavy mail and wrought gorgets, guarding the sensitive areas of their body. Most distinct were Crusaders who clad themselves from head to toe in plate armor, along with carefully selected regalia. A Crusader's armor is an emblem of their identity. Over the centuries it is constantly molded and reshaped to fit the needs and personality of its current master. It is a crime for anyone who is not of the order to wear the armor of a Crusader, and its members are duty bound to kill anyone they find doing so.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Zarbinzet\"&gt;Zarbinzet&lt;/a&gt;, Crusader helmets bearing no name were put on display. speculated that they served a reminder of what happens to a Crusader's name when the one bearing it was lost to the order.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the Crusaders lie during the time of &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Crusade\"&gt;crusade&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, a campaign that would end with the founding of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis's Paladin forces&lt;/a&gt; pressed west, the cleric &lt;a href=\"Akkhan\"&gt;Akkhan&lt;/a&gt; sensed &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s taint in the Zakarum faith, and independently (and secretly) founded the Crusader order. Akhan specifically avoided calling his recruits paladins, for he saw paladins as a product of the corrupted church's errant ways. The Crusaders were specifically founded as a separate entity from the Paladins for fear of carrying over corruption into their new sacred duty.\nFor his new order, Akkhan searched far and wide for warriors of unparalleled strength, for believers who burned with inner Light\u2014young recruits chosen for honor, goodness, and most importantly, an unwavering devotion to duty.\u00a0After rigorous preparation, that involved training in the use of weaponry and flesh-scouring magics, the Crusaders departed &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt; and pushed east on their mission, traveling the same path &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt; was rumored to have taken in the last days of his life. They later entered the &lt;a href=\"Swamplands\"&gt;Swamplands&lt;/a&gt; in the far east of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly disappearing without a trace, making no further contact with the Church. Some clerics scoffed at the possibility of the Crusaders achieving their goal, but they pressed forward nonetheless, having sworn to dedicate their lives to the search. Akhan stayed behind to fight Mephisto's corruption directly, a task which cost him his life. Because of the cleric's belief that the Church was corrupted, the Crusaders refrained from communicating with Paladin orders. As a result, only very high level members of the Zakarum Church are aware of the Crusaders' existence, and they suppressed knowledge of the Crusaders as best they could, including those of their own order.\nEarly History.\nOver the centuries, the Crusader order was hardened through relentless, brutal combat with the foul evils plaguing eastern &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, as their centuries-long quest to cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; from Mephisto's taint and the corruption of Sanctuary as a whole drove them. A goal they were intent on achieving by any means necessary, though they did not know the form the redemption of their faith would take. Over this time, they remained a mostly secretive sect. According to the studies of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; a member of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that some Crusaders investigated legends of lost Zakarum writings and holy relics from bygone eras. Others were driven by stories of infants born with an inner Light so pure it would cleanse the faith of its affliction. However, he could find no definitive evidence that a Crusader actually uncovered a means of completing their quest, and that they had exhausted most, if not all promising leads. \nMephisto's Jungle.\nOver two centuries after the beginning of their search, members of the order began returning to &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, by which time Mephisto's corruption of Zakarum had become visibly manifest. Cain speculated that this only strengthened their sense of purpose. From what he could gather, the remaining Crusaders began to fix their gaze on the unplumbed lands of the West. \nThe End of Days.\nIn the 1280s, with the sighting of a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;fallen star&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; assault on &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, the Crusaders' attention was still drawn to the West. Coming from the East, the Crusaders found a different world from the one they had left behind.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, a number of Crusaders were investigating &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great Enmity.\nAt some point after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s genocide, the Crusaders embarked on a quest to find &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Light\"&gt;Akarat's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, and an expedition of Crusaders ventured into the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;, where they believed it could be found. A number of Crusaders remained in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. The Crusaders used &lt;a href=\"Zarbinzet\"&gt;Zarbinzet&lt;/a&gt; as their base of operations and quickly mapped Hawezar, while also protecting the townsfolk.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, the Crusaders had spent decades mapping the region and scouring the swamps, but their attempt to locate the tomb was a failure. Many of the Crusaders were slain during this quest, and by 1336 most of those who had survived were demoralized and ready to abandon the quest. The Crusaders were scattered and were left disheartened and few in number, and had been whittled down through a combination of attrition and desertion.\nThe Crusaders came into conflict with a serpent cult that worshipped the &lt;a href=\"nangari\"&gt;nangari&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point during the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23The_Great_Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johanna\"&gt;Johanna&lt;/a&gt; led a group of Crusaders to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Maugan%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Maugan's Folly&lt;/a&gt;, a Zakarum fort which had fallen to brigands \"generations ago.\" This was to be a foothold for a renewed search for the Tomb of Akarat, but Johanna and many others were slain, and their bodies were left behind as the Crusaders in Zarbinzet did not want to risk the safety of more of their people to recover them. Johanna's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Tomyris\"&gt;Tomyris&lt;/a&gt;, recruited the help of and was able to recover her master's armor, and took on her name per Crusader tradition.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, the Crusaders began making arrests in &lt;a href=\"Zarbinzet\"&gt;Zarbinzet&lt;/a&gt;, looking for &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; collaborators.\nThe Age of Hatred.\nIn late &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, the Crusaders were decimated by &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption, as it seeped out of the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; carried by &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; as she made her way through the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;.
