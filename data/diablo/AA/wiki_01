He was present during &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, where he forged &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; for the town's warriors.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nAccording to Larzuk, his ancestors were the finest craftsmen in Harrogath. As a child, he used to play soldier among the barricades of Mount Arreat.\nThe Siege of Arreat.\nAs Baal's &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; lay siege to Harrogath, Larzuk forged weapons for the defenders, determined to stay the course until the conflict concluded. However, his supplies ran lower with each passing day, and he feared the day neared when he would have to put down his &lt;a href=\"Hammers\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt; and take up a &lt;a href=\"Swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; instead, though if the &lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s did not need the weapons, he would have been out there fighting himself. He offered &lt;a href=\"Qual-Kehk\"&gt;Qual-Kehk&lt;/a&gt; ideas on how to break the siege, such as using , but these ideas were dismissed. Likewise, he suggested to &lt;a href=\"Malah\"&gt;Malah&lt;/a&gt; the idea of using . She scoffed at the idea and wondered if he had gone mad.\nSalvation came with the arrival of a group of heroes who, according to &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, had slain Baal's brothers, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. Larzuk was skeptical, but directed the heroes to deal with &lt;a href=\"Shenk%20the%20Overseer\"&gt;Shenk the Overseer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; who Baal had left in command of the siege of Harrogath while he scaled Mount Arreat. The heroes succeeded, and Larzuk apologised for underestimating them.\nNext, the heroes were sent to rescue Qual-Kehk's men, who had been taken prisoners by the demons. The heroes again succeeded, and Larzuk admitted that he was beginning to find Cain's tales of their past heroism more and more believable.\nThe race to stop the last of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s continued, as did the heroes' actions. Larzuk learned how their elder &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; had betrayed them. He also learned how the heroes had been forced to defeat the mountain's &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients\"&gt;Guardians&lt;/a&gt;, a deed for which they gained his enduring respect. Eventually, the heroes defeated Baal himself, but at the cost of the purity of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, which had to be destroyed. Larzuk was eventually killed in the resulting explosion.\nIn-game.\nLarzuk appears as an NPC in \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Lord of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;\". He offers players the \"&lt;a href=\"Siege%20on%20Harrogath\"&gt;Siege on Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;\" quest which, after completion, adds &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;s to any one of the player's &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"unique%20items\"&gt;unique items&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of those that cannot have sockets in the first place and items that already have sockets.\nTrade.\nLarzuk offers a range of items including:\nHe can also &lt;a href=\"repair\"&gt;repair&lt;/a&gt; items.\nPersonality and Traits.\nLarzuk was young, passionate, and a \"firebrand,\" who took pride in his ability to craft the finest instruments of war. According to &lt;a href=\"Anya\"&gt;Anya&lt;/a&gt;, Larzuk would have been married long ago if not for his work as a blacksmith. For his part (going by dialogue options), Larzuk appeared to be attracted to the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; hero, suggesting that after the siege, they travel to the &lt;a href=\"Skovos%20Isles\"&gt;Skovos Isles&lt;/a&gt; together.\nLarzuk's ideas appeared to be well ahead of his time, or indeed, the technological level of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. His suggestions to Qual-Kehk and Malah were basically those of and respectively, while Nihlathak also suspiciously mentions to the Assassin that Larzuk claims to have avoided Red Fever by washing his hands before meals."}

{"id": "4408", "revid": "1687225", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4408", "title": "Leaf Rune Word", "text": "Leaf is the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Word\"&gt;rune word&lt;/a&gt; \" for &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; in \"\".\nLeaf is an excellent &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; for a lower level &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;. Both runes are very easily acquired (the Ral Rune is given as part of a reward for an &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20on%20Mount%20Arreat%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Act V quest&lt;/a&gt;, while both are common drops from &lt;a href=\"The%20Countess\"&gt;The Countess&lt;/a&gt;), and the low requirement level allows lucky Sorceresses to have an easy time until mid- or even . However, it has the downside of being a staff rune word, which precludes equipping a &lt;a href=\"Shields%23Diablo%20II/Lord%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; with this weapon. Like &lt;a href=\"White%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;White Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;, finding a decent base weapon is crucial. When combined with a Staff which innately already gives a bonus to the &lt;a href=\"Warmth\"&gt;Warmth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt;, this staff potentially generates a total of +9 to Warmth which is very helpful for early game Sorceresses where mana depletion is a constant issue. \nA 2-socket staff required for crafting Leaf with good skill bonuses can be easily acquired from &lt;a href=\"Drognan\"&gt;Drognan&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in Act II on difficulty. Make sure to roll a map with &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; gate at northeast (near &lt;a href=\"Drognan\"&gt;Drognan&lt;/a&gt;), so you can quickly exit and enter town in order to reroll vendor items. However, staves with bonuses to higher level skills, such as or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Mastery\"&gt;Fire Mastery&lt;/a&gt; cannot be obtained from vendor and have to be found.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Skill\"&gt;Fire Skill&lt;/a&gt; bonus is general, any class with fire skills can take advantage of it, such as &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s, and perhaps even specific &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s. In such case, the player can avoid the burden of finding a staff with high skill bonuses.\nWhile Leaf is very useful for early-game sorceresses, it is outclassed in terms of power and utility by the nearly equally accessible &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Spirit Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;.\nResult:"}
{"id": "6070", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6070", "title": "Leah", "text": "Leah was the ward\u00a0of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and the biological daughter of &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nConception.\nFrom the outset, Leah was conceived as a host for &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. While the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; had masterminded their &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;exile&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo had taken the plan one step farther. He would become \"the\" Prime Evil, combining the essences of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; into a single form. And to do that, he would need a vessel to inhabit.\nTo this end, when Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt; struck down Diablo in the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; and bound himself to the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of containing Diablo's essence, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; had been given the means to fulfill his plan. Not long after Aidan's 'victory,' he met the &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, who realized that Diablo was influencing the prince. By Diablo's will, Leah was conceived and born a year later in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Aidan became corrupted by Diablo and so became the Dark Wanderer, &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; fell to the forces of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. Adria escaped with &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt; and the two made their way to &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. Adria set up wards around Gillian's residence and departed, leaving the barmaid to care for the infant.\nGrowing Up.\nLeah had a hard time growing up in Caldeum. Gillian's mind had been adversely affected by her contact with demons, and so was not always in the right state of mind to function in society, let alone raise a daughter. Gillian's stigma made its way down to Leah herself and she was regarded as an unlucky child. \"Sewer rat\" was a name that bullies gave her, in part due to her time exploring the sewers beneath the city. For all her time in the city, she learned to live with the insults and indeed, her time exploring the city imparted survival skills to her. Throughout her life, Gillian never told her the truth about her father, or that Adria was her biological mother. And all the while, Leah had to contend with the powers she had inherited from her mother, such as prophetic dreams. Throughout her entire life, Leah would suffer from nightmares. Dreams of blood and war, of bloated corpses, of the eyes of crows glaring at her with hate. Other times she would dream of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s with frightening clarity as if she were seeing memories. Gillian told her not to confuse the dreams with what was real, but the stern tone of her voice that she always used made Leah feel uneasy. As if Gillian was afraid that her own madness was creeping up on her adopted daughter.\nAt the age of eight, the insults Leah endured were starting to become unbearable and dark times were settling over Caldeum. &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; had set his minions in motion and was on the hunt for her. To make matters worse, Gillian's state of mind was deteriorating even further.\nThe Order.\nA New Guardian.\nOne day in Caldeum, Leah came across a beggar ranting about the &lt;a href=\"Gareth%20Rau\"&gt;Dark One&lt;/a&gt;, and was pursued by the sewers by a group of thugs. By the time she emerged, it was evening. Gillian was unimpressed by her poor state of hygiene, but her mind was too damaged to linger on the subject for long. Before long, she was ranting about demons, promising to protect Leah and accusing her of being a demon as well within the same breath. She retired to her bed, but awoke several hours later, with night having well and truly fallen. Gillian was in one of her moods, but before she could do anything drastic, there was a knock at the door. It was &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, whom Gillian let into her home. Leah found something comforting about Cain, in part because she didn't want to be left alone with her mother. Gillian introduced Cain as someone she'd grown up with in the town she'd hailed from (a town she refused to specify as being Tristram).\nThe next morning, Gillian sent Leah to fetch something good to eat, as Cain arriving was a \"special occasion.\" She obliged, and Cain spent the rest of the day exploring Caldeum, pursuing his own agenda. Come night, Leah went to sleep, but Gillian, in one of her less lucid moments, approached her with a knife. While still sleeping, some energy emanated from Leah, and the force of it sent Gillian slamming against the wall. Leah awoke and screamed as the same force ripped the knife from Gillian's hand. Cain used some powder to incapacitate both of them. He fell asleep himself, but it was Leah who woke him up\u2014the house was on fire. Leah refused to leave, wanting to save Gillian despite Cain's protests. Leah shut her eyes and her body began to tremble, and her &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; caused the temperature of the house to decrease. However, the effect was temporary, and she passed out. A &lt;a href=\"James\"&gt;bearded man&lt;/a&gt; managed to get both her and Cain out of the building.\nWhen Leah came to, Cain told her that her mother had been taken away (to the madhouse) and that he'd find a safe place for her as soon as he could. Also that they had to leave Caldeum by first light. Leah silently followed her new guardian out of the city.\nThe Truth.\nLeah remained silent as she followed Cain across the desert from Caldeum. As the sun rose in the sky, Leah began to regain more of her sense of self. She reflected that Gillian, for her madness, had still been her mother, and now her mother had been taken away. There was also the question of Cain\u2014Gillian had called him \"Uncle Deckard,\" but not specified how they were related. She could tell that he was uneasy with her, but regardless, they made camp for the night, and she accepted the food he offered her. Cain, breaking the silence between them, told Leah that Gillian wasn't her mother. That her real mother was a woman named &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, and that she and Gillian\u00a0had come to Caldeum together to escape &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. That it was in Caldeum where Adria gave birth to Leah, but had left her in Gillian's care. Leah accused him of lying, but Cain replied that he wasn't. Caught up in her grief, Leah ran into the night, unwilling to believe what Cain had told her. She screamed, but the sound came back to her, cracking the very earth. The force of it knocked her out.\nWhen Leah came to, she was back at the campfire with Cain, who'd found her passed out near a river. He was finally able to get her to eat, and after she'd finished, she began to ask him questions, wanting to know everything. Cain told her about Adria, and how last he'd heard, she'd perished in the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;. Leah burst into tears, but eventually went to sleep.\nCome the next morning, they didn't discuss what had happened the night before. They headed off, and Cain revealed that they were headed for &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. Leah was aghast\u2014Gillian had warned her about Kurast (a warning that was well founded given the city's sorry state), and accused Cain of wanting to sacrifice her. Leah ran away from him. Cain eventually found her at an overlook, where she told him that \"I've nowhere to go, and nobody to help me.\" She pointed to a nearby &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that they could help them. Cain agreed to head for the town, and Leah followed him.\nLord Brand's Manor.\nBy the time Leah and Cain reached the town, night had fallen. While the guards were unwelcoming, the one they served wasn't\u2014Lord &lt;a href=\"Brand\"&gt;Brand&lt;/a&gt;, who embraced them warmly. He invited them to his &lt;a href=\"Brand%20Manor\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt;. As they proceeded through the town, Leah saw only a few townsfolk, but after awhile, dropped her gaze, and simply followed Cain. She began to regret asking him to come here. Something about this place made her terribly afraid, but she couldn't put her finger on it. Brand was welcoming enough, but he did look off. The town appeared dead, so different from Caldeum. She also worried about Cain, noticing how tired he looked.\nWhatever the case, they arrived at Brand's manor, the sight of which didn't alleviate Leah's anxiety. Walking inside, Leah found that the fire offered little warmth, and something smelt funny. Dinner was served, and while the food was tasteless, Leah didn't care, given how hungry she was. She ate until she was full, and watched as Brand did a &lt;a href=\"Taratcha\"&gt;Taratcha&lt;/a&gt; reading. She saw one that held the image of a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tower\"&gt;dark tower&lt;/a&gt;, and the image of it swirled before her eyes. For a moment, her perception changed, as she beheld that the food on her plate wasn't the fine meal she had imagined, but strings of raw gristle and matted fur. She shoved the plate away, wanting to scream, but something was wrong with her throat. She tried to speak, tried to move, but could do neither. Brand's followers dragged her and Cain into separate rooms. She tried to scream, to wake Cain, but to no avail. Eventually, sleep took her.\nAs it turned out, Brand and his followers were a cult, believing that Sanctuary and Heaven were doomed to fall, but that if they did what was necessary, they might survive the coming flame. They attempted to offer Leah up as sacrifice, but her innate magic once again came to her aid, blue fire extending from her fingertips. She walked across the room as if in a trance, as if &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;something else&lt;/a&gt; was guiding her. Her magic ended up freeing Cain as well, and he led her back into the town. Cain led her through the village, as the cultists closed in on them. However, they were slow and clumsy, and they were able to evade them. Cain bid Leah run ahead, and she did so, coming across a &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Mikulov\"&gt;Mikulov&lt;/a&gt;. He beckoned Cain to follow him, and the three of them fled into the surrounding jungle.\nKurast.\nAs Cain and Mikulov discussed matters, Leah looked out over the jungles. When Cain came to see her, she commented that there were no animals, and that the trees were greying. Cain said that he would find a place for her, and once his task was done, that he'd come back for her. Leah, however, wanted to stay with Cain, pointing out that Cain had told Gillian that he would take care of her. Relenting, he promised Leah that they'd stay together, and on that note, the trio headed for Kurast.\nAs they travelled, Leah became fascinated with Mikulov. Arriving at Kurast, they entered &lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Circle\"&gt;The Red Circle&lt;/a&gt;, where a man exclaimed that the inn was no place for a girl. They met with &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28The%20Order%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;, who informed them as to the state of the town, and kept the patrons in line as they took note of Leah. He told them where to find &lt;a href=\"Hyland\"&gt;Hyland&lt;/a&gt;, and showed them to their room.\nThe following day, they met with Hyland at the docks. He informed them of &lt;a href=\"Gareth%20Rau\"&gt;Gareth Rau&lt;/a&gt; and the fledging new order of Horadrim. Cain was taken aback by Kurast's hostility to the group, but Leah urged him to keep his cool. Mikulov led her out of his office while Hyland and Cain continued to talk. Back at The Red Circle, Cain explained to the pair what Hyland had told him\u2014that the Horadric scholars he sought were apparently real, and that they had been close to Kurast, perhaps located in &lt;a href=\"Gea%20Kul\"&gt;Gea Kul&lt;/a&gt;. \nThat night, a &lt;a href=\"Feeder\"&gt;Feeder&lt;/a&gt; attacked Cyrus, though Cain was able to save him, and brought the innkeeper back to their room. He was alive, but incapacitated, perhaps permanantly. They set off for Gea Kul before the sun had even risen.\nGea Kul.\nOn the road out of Kurast, the trio came across the corpse of an ox. Looking at it, Leah felt it was mocking her, daring her to run away. For a moment, she was tempted to run back to Kurast. She found herself yearning for Gillian, but let Cain lead her on. As they walked, Mikulov told them of his &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28Country%29\"&gt;homeland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monks of Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, in what Leah suspected was a bid to distract her. She listened to Mikulov's stories with interest, but had less interest in Cain talking about the Horadrim. As they travelled, she noticed that the sky had grown darker. She thought back to Caldeum; of the fire that had taken her and Gillian's house, and how she had blacked out. How she had done likewise at Brand's manor. Reflecting on Gillian's words, she wondered if she was indeed going crazy.\nCrazy or not, they reached Gea Kul, and Leah was aghast at the sight of not only crumbling buildings, but corpses of horses and even people on the road leading out of the town. As they headed to the town, a woman, not quite dead, grabbed Leah's foot, whispering that she was damed, and that \"they will return...soon...\" Leah stared in horror before Cain pried the woman off her. They headed on, the woman's laughter echoing in her ears.\nArriving in Gea Kul itself, they found it dilapidated, filled with mist, and while there were people living there, they were \"more skittish than wild deer.\" The people closed in on them, not moving, but there was a clear threat of violence in the air. However, a horn sounded, and the people slunk back into the mist. The one who sounded the horn was Captain &lt;a href=\"Hanos%20Jeronnan\"&gt;Hanos Jeronnan&lt;/a&gt;, who led them to the &lt;a href=\"Captain%27s%20Table\"&gt;Captain's Table&lt;/a&gt;. He gave them food, and Leah found herself warming to him. He told them of the Horadrim, stating that they were responsible for the ills that had befallen Gea Kul. How the group had arrived months before under the direction of a man named &lt;a href=\"Garreth%20Rau\"&gt;Garreth Rau&lt;/a&gt;, who'd built a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt; on the edge of the sea. However, Rau had disappeared, and soon afterwards, there were sightings of creatures in the middle of the night, sucking the life out of people. He offered to take the trio to where the Horadrim used to gather. He took Cain there, while Leah was left with Mikulov.\nCain returned to the Captain's Table with a man named &lt;a href=\"Egil\"&gt;Egil&lt;/a&gt;. Leah was glad to see Cain's return, but was wary of Egil. Nevertheless, Egil led the trio through the night to where the rest of the Horadrim were, or, rather, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. In a copse of trees, they found Egil's followers, numbering around thirty in total. However, not all of the First Ones were enthused to meet Cain, and Leah could sense the disappointment around her. Leah fell asleep as Cain discussed matters with Egil. Waking up from a nightmare, she found a companion in &lt;a href=\"Lund\"&gt;Lund&lt;/a&gt;, who gave her a &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, and later, taught her how to use it. She quickly got the hang of it, and found comfort in the weapon; a sense that she was no longer powerless. That night, she listened to Cain telling the group stories of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, finding herself more content than she had in weeks.\nThe next day however, townspeople from Gea Kul, alongside other &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s, attacked. Lund was killed, but Leah was able to use her magic to kill several of the attackers, However, she was downed with a dart, and she was dragged off.\nThe Dark Tower.\nLeah was brought before Rau, who marvelled at her latent abilities. He planned to gather the magical energy within her to use as a \"lifespark\" to raise his undead army from &lt;a href=\"Al%20Cut\"&gt;Al Cut&lt;/a&gt;, as well as summon Belial into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. He tried to withdraw some of her &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;, but in a trance, she used her magic to repel him. Nevertheless, Rau set up a full-blown ritual.\nArtifact Hunting.\nOver the next thirteen years, Leah and Cain (or \"Uncle Deckard\" as she called him) would hunt for artifacts and lore across the world that would help them piece together the &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20the%20End%20of%20Days\"&gt;Prophecy of the End of Days&lt;/a&gt;. Other areas of study included that of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; and their (supposed) summoning of demons. Cain also tried to teach her how to control her abilities, which he told her came from her mother. His &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; knowledge formed the basis of his teachings, but it never really helped. Still, he never gave up on her.\nLeah found her travels to be quite exciting, a boring summer in &lt;a href=\"Bramwell\"&gt;Bramwell&lt;/a&gt; notwithstanding. They came across danger many times, and many times, she had to drag Cain away from a \"boring old tapestery\" as &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s bore down on them. However, while she saw many strange things and loved her adopted uncle, she remained skeptical of Cain's claims of a looming apocalypse. She did not believe in the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt; or that of demons, or at least, not what many people believed them to be. Cain would later reflect that her lack of belief (when compared to his) was due to their lack of shared experiences in some areas. Unlike him, she had never encountered Diablo or the other Prime Evils. Leah herself would look back on these days fondly, but in hindsight, realized what the years had cost Cain, as well as herself.\nAt some point they entered &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, arriving at &lt;a href=\"Kingsport\"&gt;Kingsport&lt;/a&gt;, looking for a &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; cipher. Cain had her stay with an old friend while he went looking for the cipher. In reality, he was looking into Adria's origins, a truth that Leah would discover over a decade later.\nEventually, after &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231284\"&gt;twelve years&lt;/a&gt; of travel and with Leah now a young woman, the two-headed for &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as they set out, Leah began asking questions about her mother with growing frequency. On the first day they arrived, Leah sketched a portrait of Adria, despite having never seen her mother before. Cain was put off by the perfect likeness. He wondered if straying near Adria's hut had awoken some kind of dormant memory. He warned Leah not to linger around the place, but Leah refused to listen.\nWith Cain still in pursuit of the prophecy, he spent his days poring over the tomes and manuscripts found in the ruined &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Leah split her time between looking after him and helping out in the town.\nThe End of Days.\nThe Fallen Star.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, what had begun over twenty years ago began coming to an end. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; of Justice fell to Sanctuary, having abandoned his place in the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; to aid humanity. However, his trajectory took him straight into the Tristram Cathedral. To make matters worse, Belial was aware of Tyrael's descent and had his minions attack &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Leah tried to search for Cain, but the dead were already rising. She returned to New Tristram to rally the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Militia\"&gt;militia&lt;/a&gt;. The militia headed for the cathedral, but were overcome. Leah and &lt;a href=\"Rumford\"&gt;Rumford&lt;/a&gt; retreated to New Tristram, which came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the stakes, Leah refused to give up on the idea of rescuing her uncle. For six days, the line was held against the undead. Morale sagged. She told Rumford and the other militiamen not to give up home, but she was running out of it herself.\nThe fortunes of the down changed with the arrival of a new band of heroes at the town, having all answered the call of the \"fallen star.\" Leah aided the heroes in their quest, helping them find her mother's &lt;a href=\"Adria%27s%20Hut\"&gt;cabin&lt;/a&gt;. She stayed to find out what she could, while the heroes pressed on to the cathedral to find her uncle. Going through Adria's writings, she learnt that Adria did not hail from Tristram, but had come during the town's darkening. She ascertained that she was in search of something, but wasn't sure what. Furthermore, she noted that Adria appeared as obsessed with the supposed war between &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s as Cain was.\nLeah returned to New Tristram. She spent all day defending the gates, and all night tending the wounded alongside &lt;a href=\"Mira%20Eamon\"&gt;Mira Eamon&lt;/a&gt;. She later reunited with Cain, her uncle having been saved by the heroes. He told them in light of the Fallen Star, the Prophecy of the End of Days indicated that the end had begun. Leah dismissed such a claim, and stated that she was just glad to have Cain back. After the heroes left to search for Leoric's crown, Cain pressed the issue. In light of what was happening around them, surely she could not dismiss the signs of the End of Days so readily. Leah pointed out that he'd been telling her about the texts that prophecized the end of the world since she was eight, and that the lands had endured similar horrors before and survived.\nAfter defeating Leoric, the heroes returned to New Tristram with a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;stranger&lt;/a&gt;; a man, apparently having descended as the Fallen Star. However, he was amnesiac. Leah could tell that her uncle was disappointed; that he had been hoping for something more miraculous. However, the stranger remembered falling, and that he had had a &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, which had separated into three pieces as he fell. Leah wondered if the scattered pieces were the reason why the &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Misery\"&gt;Fields of Misery&lt;/a&gt; had gone mad. By this stage, Leah admitted to herself that the events were getting to her. That maybe her uncle's \"crazy stories\" weren't as far-fetched as she'd believed.\nThe heroes returned with the first shard. The leader of the cultists had stated that the second fell \"fell where only &lt;a href=\"ancients\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; may tread.\" Leah deduced that this was a reference to the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Temple\"&gt;Drowned Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Cain told her to go with the heroes, as her knowledge of the structure might prove useful. Arriving at the temple, they met with &lt;a href=\"Alaric\"&gt;Alaric&lt;/a&gt;, whom she thought was a myth. Alaric instructed them to gather keys from the outlying tombs so that they may gain entrance. They managed to gain access to the tomb and retrieve the second shard, but were again ambushed by the Coven. Its leader, &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;, appeared before the heroes as an apparition and recognized Leah as being Adria's daughter, as well as sensing a power within her. Maghda's words disturbed Leah, as they suggested that Adria was still alive, and she wondered what this power was she spoke of. &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; told her not to listen. Leah suspected that Maghda was toying with them, and said that they had to return to New Tristram as soon as possible.\nWith two of the three shards retrieved, the stranger remembered the third streaking towards a fishing village; Leah identified it as &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;. She and the heroes took the ferry to it, but found the village ablaze, under attack by the Coven. Perturbed, Leah headed back to New Tristram to check on Cain, while the heroes fought to retrieve the third shard. Unfortunately for them, Maghda retrieved them first. And unfortunately for Leah, Maghda took her, Cain, and the stranger hostage. She threatened to kill Leah if Cain did not use his Horadric arts to fix the sword. She wounded him using her magic, which caused Leah to unleash her own power, killing the cultists Maghda had brought with her. In the instant she unleashed her power, her mind briefly connected with Maghda's.\nMaghda retreated, leaving the sword fragments, but taking the stranger hostage. Leah rushed over to Cain, finding that he was mortally wounded. As his last act, he mended the sword, and told Leah that the stranger was an angel, and to heed his &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Cain%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;writings&lt;/a&gt;. Leah cried out in anguish as her uncle died before her eyes. She bitterly reflected that while Cain had called the stranger an angel, he was only a man. They were just stories. And her uncle had died for them. However, some of her anguish was reserved for herself, feeling that if she had been able to control her powers, she might have been able to save him.\nWith Cain's death, his &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Cain%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; passed into Leah's possession. She read (part of) it, how it spoke of an angel falling from the Heavens as a shadow rose from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. She determined that the stranger that Maghda had abducted was key to everything. She told this to The Nephalem, and how her mind had connected with Maghda's. Through this link, she knew that Maghda had fled to the highlands, and that they could reach her by traveling through the caves near Wortham.\nThe Nephalem returned with the stranger; alive, and in possession of his reforged sword. He told them that &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; was spreading his influence in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, and that they would have to head east. He told Leah that they would not have to search for Belial directly. Rather, they would follow Maghda and the Coven, who would lead them to her master. Leah said that they wouldn't leave without laying Cain to rest first. The stranger acquiesced, telling her that he would arrange a caravan to guide them east, and that they would see to Cain as they departed.\nWith The Nephalem having got their affairs in order, Cain and Leah prepared to cremate Cain's body. An emotional Leah lashed out at the stranger, only for him to reveal himself as Tyrael. Taking up Cain's &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Cain\"&gt;writings&lt;/a&gt;, Leah vowed to finish her guardian's work before cremating his body.\nAt some point after discovering the stranger's identity, Leah wrote to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, telling them of Cain's death and Tyrael's arrival.\nShadows in the Desert.\nArriving in &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, the group set up &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Camp\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; on a bluff overlooking Caldeum. She and Tyrael made sure it was set up in secret. The Nephalem instructed her and Tyrael to search for Belial, while they hunted Maghda. Leah roamed the sewers of the city, and found her mother, Adria, who was being help captive by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; but she was captured by the Imperial Guard herself, and brought before Emperor &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt;. He presented her to The Nephalem as 'proof' of their complicity in the slaughter at &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt;. The Nephalem was able to escape, and Leah led them into the sewers in order to get away from the Guard, explaining that she had found her mother there. The heroes found Adria being tortured by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, and after freeing her, Adria recognized Leah, stating that she had watched over her all her life, but could not get close to her due to the danger that followed her. \nAdria told the group of her plans to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, per her plans to use the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Belial and Azmodan. Adria was wary of reviving Kulle, given his reputation, but trusted Adria, since Cain had trusted her in life. While The Nephalem departed to retrieve Kulle's head, Adria had Leah practice her powers. With the head returned, Leah cast a spell that Adria had taught her, and Kulle's spirit returned. He agreed to give them the Black Soulstone under the condition that his physical form be restored. Leah headed out with The Nephalem, putting Kulle's head in a bag that they took with them. When they reached the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Sands\"&gt;Desolate Sands&lt;/a&gt;, she headed back to the camp, telling The Nephalem that she had to learn the spell that would restore Kulle's body. However, she said she would meet him at his &lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;. \nInside the archives, Leah arrived in time to see another projection of Hakan II, who claimed that he had discovered Belial's identity. Afterwards, The Nephalem explored the archives to retrieve Kulle's body, while Leah remained put to prepare for the ritual. Leah successfully resurrected Kulle, who, true to his word, led them to the Black Soulstone. However, he reneged on his promise upon discovering that the stone already had the essences of five of the seven Great Evils, and was slain by The Nephalem. Adria arrived, and told Leah that Cain had told her of the stone over twenty years ago in Tristram, and Leah concluded that she had marked the Great Evils' souls, so they could be drawn into the stone. Once the stone contained the souls of all seven Evils, Adria planned to shatter it, destroying them.\nThe group returned to their camp. Leah stated that they had to evacuate the people of Caldeum before meeting with Hakan to face Belial, and that Asheara and the Iron Wolves could help them. However, upon entering the city, they found that Belial had already started his attack, raining fire down upon the city. Leah instructed The Nephalem to rescue citizens and bring them to the sewers, and while Adria objected, wanting to focus on Belial, Leah wasn't swayed. With that done, the group moved on into the city proper, with Leah using her power to bring down the gates. Exhausted, she stayed behind with Adria looking after her, while The Nephalem went on to confront Belial. After The Nephalem defeated the demon, Leah bound his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; inside the Black Soulstone.\nWhile Belial was defeated and Caldeum saved, that still left the issue of Azmodan. Leah guessed that he would strike where defeat would break humanity's will to resist. Complimenting her for her insight, Adria told Leah to enter the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Library\"&gt;Great Library&lt;/a&gt;, in order to ascertain where Azmodan would emerge.\nThe Lord of Sin.\nReturning to her studies, Leah poured through scrolls of lore, seeking a clue as to where &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; would emerge. Even as she searched through the tomes, her thoughts drifted to Deckard, as she was still haunted by his death. She felt herself under pressure from Adria, Tyrael, and the Nephalem, believing that they believed her to have all the answers, while, in her own words, \"I don't know a damn thing.\" She recorded her thoughts, reflecting on her fears and her uncle's absence, hoping that if there was indeed something waiting for mortals after death, her uncle had found it to be everything he wished for.\nAfter days of searching, Leah finally succumbed to her weariness. It was a brief moment that led to a vision, where she saw\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Sin, and the last of the lord of Hell, boasting of his impending and inevitable victory to the &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;younger brother&lt;/a&gt;. Through the vision, he revealed his plans, that the &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Legion\"&gt;Demonic Legion&lt;/a&gt; would emerge from the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt; and lay siege to Sanctuary. Tyrael pulled Leah back into reality. Sobbing, she informed him of what she had seen. Azmodan was coming, and all that stood in his way was the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nRevelations.\nBefore setting off for Bastion's Keep, Leah came across one of her uncle's old journals, where he detailed his findings on Adria. She was touched as she read her uncle's thoughts on her, as he expressed his love for his ward within the pages. What was less touching, however, were his uneasy thoughts on her mother. Leah supposed that her uncle had thought he was protecting her by not telling her the truth about her mother. Her unease weighed down on her, filling her thoughts even more than the threat of Azmodan. She tried to ask her mother about her past (which she had gained insight to thanks to Cain's journal), but Adria kept changing the subject. As she continued to read, she discovered that her mother had once been part of the Coven.\nLeah was left at a crossroads\u2014it made no sense for Adria to have ever been part of the Coven, for, after all, hadn't she spent her life fighting \"against\" the power of Hell? She didn't tell her mother about the journal but pondered what she should do. She didn't want to ruin Adria's opinion of Deckard, as she knew Adria considered him to be a friend. Meanwhile, she reflected that ever since they'd recovered the Black Soulstone, her nightmares had been getting worse. She kept vigil over the stone and could sense the five Evils within it, watching her, battering against the prison's walls, their screams filling her ears. Adria's lessons, helping her learn how to control her magic, allowed her to stay in control. Leah was uneasy at first, given how Cain had tried and failed to help her control her powers, but Adria made her see her power as a natural extension of herself. That she was tapping into something that was meant to be set free.\nEventually, Leah confronted her mother about her role in the Coven. Adria admitted to her connection, claiming that it was part of her quest to fight against the forces of Hell, but admitted she had gone too far. Leah kept this revelation a secret from her companions, for their trust couldn't afford to be jeopardized at this critical hour. As she continued to read Cain's notes on Adria, and his assessments became more damning, Leah's notes took on a tone of self-rationalization. Adria was her mother. Adria couldn't have been there for her because she had been planning the defeat of Hell. Just because Adria and Cain had chosen different paths, it didn't mean that Adria's path had been wrong.\nBastion's Keep.\nLeah and her comrades arrived at Bastion's Keep in time to confront Azmodan's army. She tended to the Black Soulstone with Adria supervising, the relic becoming harder to control.&lt;Ref name = \"TheSiegeofBastion'sKeep\"&gt;\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt;\", \""}

It also causes Knockback on all the monsters around the area where the Barbarian lands, though it does not damage them.\nLeap is very handy for quickly traversing obstacles. Leap is also a good skill for getting out of danger when surrounded, or getting closer to the fray.\nLeap can also be used to jump in tight dungeon corridors such as &lt;a href=\"Maggot%20Lair\"&gt;Maggot Lair&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"Leap%20Attack\"&gt;Leap Attack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Flight\"&gt;Dragon Flight&lt;/a&gt;, and , and although these are somewhat superior, they cost at least 4 times as much Mana, and are only available at a higher level.\nWhen facing foes infamous for resurrecting other minions, like a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mummy\"&gt;Greater Mummy&lt;/a&gt; or the , Leap can close the gap quickly and safely to quickly take out these troublesome monsters.\nThe position desired must be within the user's line of sight, i.e., no complete solid walls between the user and the spot. This is one of the ways Leap is inferior to the likes of Dragon Flight and Teleport, which are free from such restrictions.\nLeap has a radius in which the knockback-effect is caused. It has a base of 2.6 (actually 2.64) yards, and gains 0.66 yards per level. For Example, a level 10 Leap has a knockback radius of ( 1.98 + ( 10 * 0.66) ) = roughly 8.5 yards. High levels of Leap can cause knockback to almost an entire screen of monsters, just like a rune would do to a single monster.\nBugs.\nUp until version , the Barbarian's Leap and Leap Attack were affected by a bug which was resolved in .

Hearing tales of the Barbarian people's expertise in close combat, he hired a phalanx of mercenary spearmen to accompany him, thinking their long spears would force the Barbarian warriors to fight from a distance. He soon learned his mistake as a single Barbarian warrior was enough to slaughter his entire party. Ambushing the raiding party from a patch of scrub grass, the Barbarian leapt over them, slaying one whilst airborne, and skewering two more as he landed. Before the would-be thief could draw a single breath, all of his hired lancers had been dispatched. It was a long walk home.\"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nLeap Attack is an improvement over ; a great skill for picking off targets blocked by other enemies. It's particularly useful against the highly mobile\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sand%20Leaper\"&gt;Sand Leaper&lt;/a&gt;s and unique bosses with the ability to .\nOnce Leap Attack is learned, the regular Leap skill becomes mostly obsolete (although it uses less mana), used only as a crowd control thanks to its knockback. Also, Leap Attack has an extremely long range from the very first point, and therefore allows farther leaps than the normal Leap skill. However, Leap does provide synergy to Leap Attack.\nIt is sometimes beneficial to use a two-handed weapon for more damage (calculated by the right-hand weapon), more specifically a Polearm or Spear-class weapon (for they have farther range, hitting an enemy slightly further if he moves away while the attack is being executed).\nLeap Attack combined with can be an extremely deadly combination. Leap Attack can be used to get into a good starting position for Whirlwind and it can also be used to help escape quickly if Whirlwind is interrupted or when out of Mana.\nLeap and Leap Attack both have a hidden Knockback radius associated with them. With Leap, it has a base of 2.6 (actually 2.64) yards, and gains 0.66 yards per level. Example, a level 10 Leap will have a knockback radius of ( 1.98 + ( 10 * 0.66) ) = 8.5 yards. This is an approximation. With Leap Attack, the base knockback is 2.6 yards, and gains 1.32 yards per level. Example, a level 15 Leap Attack will have a knockback radius of (1.28 + ( 15 * 1.32 ) ) = 21.08 yards. Leap Attack causes knockback just like a rune would do.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 10\nRadius: 4.6 yards\nBugs.\nSince the original release, the Barbarian's Leap and Leap Attack were affected by a bug which was resolved in version 1.13. If the Barbarian is attacked during a Leap or Leap Attack manouvre, the skill would effectively be disabled for the remainder of that game session. The only known way to restore the ability was to exit the game, restart it, load and continue."}

Although other species are known to exist, the desert leapers are the most common. Leapers get their name from their tremendous leaping ability. As a result, these extremely agile creatures make for difficult targets. Leapers are versatile animals and the desert variety has an extremely slow resting metabolism to minimize water use and storage. The harsh environment of Aranoch, however, leaves little room for mistakes, and these creatures never pass up the opportunity to eat or drink. Packs sighting a potential meal leave their resting spots and work together to bring down their quarry with great tenacity.\nUsually they live in numbers where at least one at a time stands at a guard post to watch for nearby threats. Attacking happens with a long hop towards enemy while strong claws straighten to a constricting, flesh-ripping strike. The best way to kill a single Cliff Lurker is to use oppressing tactics to minimize its area of movement and then bring it down with quick blows.\nIn-game.\nLeapers use an attack similar to the &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Barbarian's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leap%20Attack\"&gt;Leap Attack&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes it can be time-consuming to take out Leapers because they get knocked back when they are struck. Players can use &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; attacks to freeze Leapers in place while they attack them. Area effect spells can also help against Leapers.\nLeapers are annoying, bothersome, and very agile. Even one of these monsters can give a lot of trouble, as they tend to \"kite\" the player. Crawling on all fours, these beasts can run quickly to and fro, and their leap allows them to deal damage while taking a minimal amount.\nAll Leapers have a 5/10% chance to deal &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage with jump attacks in &lt;a href=\"Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Difficulty\"&gt;Hell Difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen using a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, these creatures cannot be &lt;a href=\"Revive\"&gt;Revive&lt;/a&gt;d. Their &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Uniques&lt;/a&gt; are excluded from spawning with &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Lightning Enchanted&lt;/a&gt;."}

The base value for 1-star legendary gems is 1, for 2-star legendary gems it's 4, and for 5-star legendary gems it's 32. During an upgrade, the gem power used in the upgrade is added to the gem power of the resulting gem.\nGem Fragments exist as a quality of life feature in case you have enough gem power but can't piece together the exact amount of gem power. In this case, using more than the required gem power will return the excess gem power in the form of gem fragments. Gem fragments exist in bound and unbound varieties, with the latter resulting from using an unbound gem as an upgrade material and having excess gem power. Unbound gem fragments can't be sold on the market but still count as unbound materials when upgrading unbound gems.\nUpgrade requirements.\nIn the following tables, rank 1 is included as obtaining the gem itself which is not an actual upgrade. For higher grades, Total GP indicates how much gem power the gem is worth when used as material for other gems, while the Total GP+R1 column indicates how much gem power (made of arbitrary gems) plus rank 1 copies of the gem are necessary. For 1- and 2-star legendary gems the rank 1 copies are not a big deal since it is possible to craft any one of your choice using &lt;a href=\"Telluric%20Fragments\"&gt;Telluric Fragments&lt;/a&gt;, but for 5-star ones this is much more important as the only way to pick the one you want is by crafting from &lt;a href=\"Telluric%20Pearl\"&gt;Telluric Pearl&lt;/a&gt;s which is a slow process, or buying from the market where the most sought-after ones will have the highest prices. Since 5-star gems need higher-rank copies to upgrade, it is not obvious how many rank 1 copies you need without doing some calculation, hence these values are included in the table.\n5-star Legendary Gems.\nThe individual star rating of the gem doesn't matter for the upgrade costs, however it is possible to transfer the stars from a lower-rated gem to a higher-rated one by using the higher-star gem as the duplicate (not as gem power) when upgrading the lower-star one.\nPower Extraction.\nLegendary Gems can undergo Extraction, which turns the gem \"dormant\" by removing the stored Gem Power into Gem Fragments. A dormant gem can be socketed and can activate &lt;a href=\"Awakening\"&gt;Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, but does not provide Resonance or bonuses. A dormant auxiliary gem works as well as an active one if used on an active main gem.\nThe Gem Power inherent in the rank 1 copies \"cannot\" be extracted; for example, a 5-star rank 4 gem contains 225 Gem Power and 3 rank 1 copies, but extracting it only yields the 225 Gem Power. A dormant gem can be reactivated by Infusing it, which requires the same amount of Gem Power in Gem Fragments and/or gems, as does an upgrade. It can also be reactivated by Transferring, which is similar, but some or all of the Gem Power is provided by extracting another gem. (Note that if the extracted Gem Power is used in 1-star or 2-star gems, that power can only be recovered by destroying the 1-star or 2-star gem; the duplicate copies are lost.)\nGem Power Contribution.\n5-star Legendary Gems receive Gem Power as contribution from the embedded Resonance gems. This means even a dormant gem can provide its effect as long as the Resonane gems have a total Gem Power that would be enough to infuse it. This saves Gem Power when both upgrading and using resonance gems in the expensive 5-star Legendary Gems.\nHistory.\nExtraction, infusion and transfer were introduced in the November 09, 2023 update.\nUpon its introduction, only 5-star Legendary Gems could be extracted. This was extended to all Legendary Gems in the update. The same update "}

The star rating determines the gem's Resonance and upgrade cost.\nLegendary Gems can be &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem%20Upgrade\"&gt;upgraded&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Jeweler\"&gt;Apprentice Jeweler&lt;/a&gt;.\nShared Stats.\nLegendary Gems have some stats that are the same between the different gem types, only depending on the star rating of the gem.\nDiablo III.\nLegendary Gems were introduced in &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.1.0%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.1.0&lt;/a&gt; of \".\"\u00a0Each usable Legendary Gem has two unique powers. One is active as soon as the gem is &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed into an equipped item, and can be strengthened by upgrading the gem to higher ranks; the second is a fixed bonus that is unlocked when the gem is upgraded to Rank 25.\nLike all gems, Legendary Gems are &lt;a href=\"account%20bound\"&gt;account bound&lt;/a&gt;. They only drop at &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;character level&lt;/a&gt; 70, but have no level requirement. They are unique-equipped - two of the same Gem cannot be equipped at the same time. All but three of them (see below) can only be socketed into &lt;a href=\"Amulets\"&gt;Amulets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rings\"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt;, so typically only three Legendary Gems can be used at a time. They are powerful enough that it is always preferable to use jewelry with sockets to benefit from three different Legendary Gems. Followers can have Legendary Gems equipped, but only two have any effect this way: and , which both have defensive powers.\nLegendary Gems only drop from &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s, except for three with unique drop mechanics. A Greater Rift Guardian will always drop one of the possible Legendary Gems a character does not already \"own\", chosen randomly. Gems count as owned if they are in the inventory or stash, or are socketed into items in those locations. Those carried by other characters on the account or in the party do not count, nor do Gems on the ground. If each possible Legendary Gem is already owned, the Guardian does not drop a Legendary Gem at all.\nGems always drop\u00a0at Rank 0, regardless of Greater Rift level, except for the . They can all be upgraded by speaking with &lt;a href=\"Urshi\"&gt;Urshi&lt;/a&gt; after completing Greater Rifts. Most gems can be upgraded as high as Greater Rift completion allows, but a few have a limit, after which Urshi will stop offering the chance to upgrade that gem.\nThe Legendary Gems that don't drop and/or socket in the usual way are:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;s which drop in some &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;s are similar to Legendary Gems, with unique powers and ranks. However they drop and upgrade via random drops, not from Greater Rifts, have less predictable powers, and socket into weapons and/or helms rather than jewelry. They were likely inspired by the , itself one of the most unusual Legendary Gems.\nGem List.\nIn addition, the is considered a Legendary Gem, but has no powers at all.\nUpgrading.\nUrshi will offer several chances to upgrade Legendary Gems at the end of any &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;, if the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; is defeated \"in time\". The blue property on the gem is the only property that will be upgraded. The player can select any gem equipped, in inventory, or in the stash to upgrade, and may use different upgrade chances on different gems if desired.\nAfter a successful Rift, Urshi will automatically offer three upgrade chances. Up to five total chances can be obtained with two potential additional chances:\nEach attempt to upgrade may succeed or fail with a probability based on the level of the completed Greater Rift Tier compared to the rank of the Gem. This probability is updated with each new attempt, so if previous attempts were successful, the higher gem rank could make the next chance less likely. Starting with the Greater Rift Tier and subtracting the \"current\" Legendary Gem Rank determines the success rate as follows:\nPerfect success at reaching a specific rank is therefore guaranteed when clearing a rift 9 levels higher than the target rank. It is only possible at all from a rift at most 16 levels below the target rank - although attempting to upgrade with such a low chance is not recommended.\nMost Legendary Gems can be leveled as far as Greater Rift completion allows. However, a few have a limit. Urshi will simply not allow using chances to upgrade these gems if they are already at their maximum:\nCaldesann's Despair.\nThe Caldesann's Despair recipe in &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0consumes a Legendary Gem to imbue an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Legendary\"&gt;Ancient Legendary&lt;/a&gt; item (including Primal Ancients) with an additional bonus to a core &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or Vitality). Each Rank of the gem consumed grants 5 points in the attribute.\n&lt;a href=\"Whisper%20of%20Atonement\"&gt;Whispers of Atonement&lt;/a&gt; are designed to be used for this purpose, avoiding the need to rank up a normal Legendary Gem. In &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;Soul Shards&lt;/a&gt;, an upgraded Soul Shard can also be used this way, functioning as if it were a level 50, 75, 100, or 125 Legendary Gem depending on upgrade level."}

{"id": "25478", "revid": "2011810", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25478", "title": "Legendary Items", "text": "Legendary Items are a class of item in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", similar in terms of rarity to &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique Items&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". On many occasions, &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; of that quality are also called , or\u00a0\"\" (often abbreviated to \"legos\" or \"legs\", not to be confused with leg-slot &lt;a href=\"pants\"&gt;pants&lt;/a&gt;). They are among the strongest and rarest items in \"Diablo III\".\nDiablo III.\nLegendary Items made their debut in \"Diablo III\". \nUnlike ,\u00a0 can have affixes that normally are not allowed on that type of item (for example,\u00a0 on &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Chest Armor&lt;/a&gt;). Many of them have re-rollable or non-re-rollable affixes that are unique to that item (for instance, damages and periodically knocks away Demon and Undead enemies in close proximity of the bearer). Normal affixes on Legendary Items will roll significantly higher (and sometimes extremely high even compared to other Legendary Items) and amount to more than those on regular items of similar levels. However, still, some Legendary Items are a little bit more than glorified \"\", able to boast no unusual stats nor affixes. Over time, such Legendaries are replaced, gaining new names, descriptions and properties, while older variants become Legacy.\nLegendary &lt;a href=\"Affix\"&gt;Affix&lt;/a&gt;es on items are in color, with numbers that may roll in some interval (if any) highlighted in\u00a0. Example (&lt;a href=\"Winter%20Flurry\"&gt;Winter Flurry&lt;/a&gt;):\nOrange affixes are always Secondary, so they do not compete with Primary attributes of an item. Most of these affixes can be &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube/Archive%20of%20Tal%20Rasha%20powers\"&gt;extracted&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll legendary items dropped since patch 2.0 are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Account\"&gt;Account Bound&lt;/a&gt;, to an extent. The item will be tradeable for the next two hours of gameplay to any player that was in the same game when the item was dropped. After two hours of gameplay, the item will be bound to the player's account permanently. Legendary items become account bound immediately if they are enchanted.\nAs of patch 2.0., a Legendary item can drop at any level equal to or above its minimum level, with stats corrected accordingly. Craftable Legendary items sometimes have two recipes (normal and max-level), each of which needs to be obtained separately. All items with minimum level of 61 or higher require access to \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", although players can trade them to classic players if these items roll an affix that lowers the level requirements.\n\u00a0are, essentially,\u00a0\u00a0which come with additional bonuses for wearing more than one piece of the same set. In return, &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Items&lt;/a&gt; \"very rarely\" have .\nNote that all Legendary &lt;a href=\"Rings\"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"One-Handed\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt; are Unique-Equipped, meaning that a character can only equip one item of each type at a time, and even if the player manages to find two Rings, the character can still only have one equipped. However the only exception to this is that a character can still equip a pre-loot 2.0 version of that same item along with a post-loot 2.0 version of the very same item. This restriction was done to prevent characters from being too powerful; to name an example, a dual-wielding two &lt;a href=\"Thunderfury%2C%20Blessed%20Blade%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Thunderfury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Swords\"&gt;Swords&lt;/a&gt; would cause massive &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Damage\"&gt;Lightning Damage&lt;/a&gt; wherever the player went, especially if he or she was a fast-hitting character. The same rule applies to the \u00a0\"Powers Collection\".\n&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Potions\"&gt;Legendary Potions&lt;/a&gt; exist in-game as well, in addition to Legendary Equipment, that is to say.\nAcquiring.\nLegendaries can be dropped by monsters, chests, and destructibles. They cannot be found in shops (except &lt;a href=\"Kadala\"&gt;Kadala's&lt;/a&gt; gambling store). Some can only be obtained by crafting, and only after finding/buying the corresponding jeweler or blacksmith plan. Some legendaries (typically those with minimum level of 70) can only be found in , while others can only be found in &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cache\"&gt;Horadric Cache&lt;/a&gt;s, and only if the cache was obtained from a specific Act. The Torment-exclusive legendaries cannot be found in Horadric Caches.\nWhen a legendary is first found, it is &lt;a href=\"Unidentified%20Items\"&gt;unidentified&lt;/a&gt;. The player can identify it by right-clicking it. If the player has multiple unidentified legendaries, it may be quicker to travel to town and use the . The stats for the item are created at the time it is spawned, not when it is identified. It can have between six and seven magical properties, rarely more.\nThe first time a character level 1-59 kills an &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;act boss&lt;/a&gt;, it is guaranteed to drop at least one &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; item. Once the game is completed with that character, they can choose to \"Reset Quests\". Doing so will again guarantee one legendary item for the first kill of each act boss. Once a character reaches level 60 or higher, only &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; will drop a guaranteed legendary item. If the player does not have \"\", this guaranteed drop moves to &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach level of Torment difficulty increases the chance of a legendary to drop by 1.15^N, N being the level of Torment. &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s also increase the drop rate of legendaries, stacking multiplicatively with other modifiers.\nAs of the pre-expansion patch, \"Diablo III\" also provides a bonus to the legendary drop chance for players who have not found a legendary in a while. This has been intended for the unluckiest of players; without this, they might have been unable to finish their quest in an efficient timeframe, even on lower difficulty settings. This bonus requires that the player spend his/her time killing monsters, but it does increase over time, in an attempt to give all players at least some legendaries. The bonus is reset when a actual legendary item, \"not\" plans or material, is dropped for that player. The bonus is even reset if the player is not near it when it drops, such as when the player is in town selling items and another player in their party is out killing monsters.\nUpon dropping, each Legendary item produces a distinctive sound and shows a star icon on the minimap. Each item will also be highlighted with a pillar of bright light, so it is really hard to miss it.\nCrafting.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Salvage\"&gt;salvaged&lt;/a&gt;, Legendary items will award one &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Soul\"&gt;Forgotten Soul&lt;/a&gt; each. Crafting level 70 Legendary items will require two &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cache\"&gt;Horadric Cache&lt;/a&gt; materials each.\nCraftable Legendary items, unlike the normal Legendary items, award no Forgotten Souls, but rather one &lt;a href=\"Reusable%20Parts\"&gt;Reusable Parts&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Dust\"&gt;Arcane Dust&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Crystal\"&gt;Veiled Crystal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncient Legendary Items.\nAncient Items are a special tier of items introduced in patch 2.1.2. These are identical to level 70 Legendary items, except that base attributes (&lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;) and all affixes roll +30-33.3% higher values for both minimum and maximum possible rolls.\nAny level 70 Legendary or Set item dropped on &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; I difficulty or higher from any source will have a chance to be an Ancient item, with the chance increasing on higher levels of Torment (roughly 10% at Torment X). An item gambled from &lt;a href=\"Kadala\"&gt;Kadala&lt;/a&gt;, crafted by artisans or transmuted in the &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; will always have a 10% chance to be Ancient, unless specifically stated otherwise.\nThe item interface will have a bright gold trimming to show that the item is Ancient.\nExamples of affix stat ranges:\nAncient items are not a separate item tier; that is, Ancient Set items can be combined with usual Set items, and one cannot equip both Legendary and Ancient Legendary versions of the same &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapon or &lt;a href=\"ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn Ancient item's increased rolls only affect base values that are expressed as absolute numbers; values expressed in % (such as &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt; Chance or increased damage dealt by skills) are not improved. Values related to resources (such as increased maximum &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power\"&gt;Arcane Power&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"yards\"&gt;yards&lt;/a&gt; are also not affected.\nWhen linked in chat, to distinguish them, Ancient items will appear as while an ordinary Legendary is displayed as .\nThe &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20Nightmares\"&gt;Legacy of Nightmares&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Set\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt; gives a significant damage and protection bonus for each Ancient item the player has equipped, but only as long as no other set bonuses are active.\nAs of patch 2.4, one can \"empower\" an Ancient Item via Kanai's Cube: sacrificing a &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt; of high rank will grant +5 primary attribute bonus per rank to the Ancient item of player's choice.\nAs of patch 2.5, &lt;a href=\"salvage\"&gt;salvage&lt;/a&gt; rewards 3 &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Soul\"&gt;Forgotten Soul&lt;/a&gt;s for each Ancient Item.\nPrimal Ancient Legendary Items.\nAs of patch 2.5.0, each Ancient Legendary or Set item has a much lower chance to drop as a Primal item. This unlocks when any character on an account successfully beats a rank 70 &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt; in solo. Drops are unlocked for all characters of the same type, so Normal/&lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;al and Softcore/&lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; characters must unlock them separately.\nThis does not count as different quality, and does not provide further increase to stat ranges of an item compared to Ancient items. Instead, all stats on the item (including variables in the legendary affixes) will gain perfect values: maximum possible numbers of the Ancient stat ranges. &lt;a href=\"Salvage\"&gt;Salvaging&lt;/a&gt; a Primal item yields 55 &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Ashes\"&gt;Primordial Ashes&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerfect rolls affect every affix including Primary, Secondary, and Legendary, putting them to ideal value (whether that means the maximum or minimum value). Items do NOT align affixes to better fit class or build (they are still random), however:\nPrimal Ancients can drop from any source of Legendary item in the game, including &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cache\"&gt;Horadric Cache&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Kadala\"&gt;Kadala&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;, but only after having completed at least a level 70 Greater Rift. This requirement must only be completed once per game mode (Hardcore vs. Non-Hardcore, or Seasonal vs. Non-Seasonal), which means that for Seasonal characters it will reset with every Season. However, once that requirement has been met, all characters in that game mode will benefit from it.\nVisually, a Primal item has a rich blood red ornament in place of the usual orange. As of &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patch 2.6.4&lt;/a&gt;, Primal Legendaries are marked by a red beam when they drop and indicated by a red pentagram icon on the mini-map. They also have a red border and updated background on their icons in the player's stash.\nPrimal Items can be crafted through 100 &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Ashes\"&gt;Primordial Ashes&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nThese items were added for the most dedicated players, so that there would be a clear progression track beyond augmenting Ancient Legendary items or completing the Season Journey.\nOriginally, Primal items were supposed to have stat ranges even higher than those of Ancient items; this idea was scrapped and replaced with perfect rolls.\nBefore Patch 2.7.5, salvaging Primal items yielded 15 Forgotten Souls.\nDiablo Immortal.\nLegendary Items return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". They alter the player's skills.\nPlayers can obtain Legendaries through &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rites%20of%20Cleansing\"&gt;Rites of Cleansing&lt;/a&gt; and the first &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Bestiary\"&gt;Horadric Bestiary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; completed each day will grant a Legendary. &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Monster\"&gt;Ancient Monster&lt;/a&gt;s are also guaranteed to drop a Legendary upon death.\nEach Legendary grants a random &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Rating\"&gt;Combat Rating&lt;/a&gt; bonus, random attributes, random magic attributes, and a Legendary Gem Socket. They also alter a single skill, either by adding a buff to it, or unlocking a variant of it. The magic attributes of legendaries can be altered using &lt;a href=\"Reforge%20Stones\"&gt;Reforge Stones&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome events reward a Mystery Legendary Item, which is an item that appears in the last page of the inventory, and turns into a random unidentified Legendary Item when used. The level of the resulting item is determined when using the Mystery item, not when identifying the result. Mystery Legendary Items are stackable.\nEssence Transfer.\nAs opposed to salvaging as for normal items, legendary items can have their essence extracted using the Essence Transfer Vendor. If not extracted already, the essence will be added to the player's extracted essences, which can be inherited into any legendary item for the same slot. When an item with an inherited essence is extracted, the original essence of the item will still be extracted if not owned already.\nThere is also a loyalty bonus for extracting essences that allows players to specify an essence to obtain. One point is added for every legendary item extracted, with a chance to get 5 or 25 points instead. Once the meter reaches 400 points, the essence chosen for the loyalty bonus is awarded as an extracted essence. This way essences for other classes can also be obtained, to help players who are considering changing classes.\nExtracted essences also contribute to Essence Mastery. Extracting an already obtained Essence increases a counter on that Essence, and when it fills up, it gives a point of Essence Mastery. Once the Essence Mastery bar is filled, it increases the character's Essence Mastery, which boosts the effects of all Essences. Essence Mastery has a maximum level of 4, after which the extraction counters stop being shown. Just like Essences themselves, Essence Mastery is tracked separately for each class.\nHistory.\nOriginally Mystery Legendary Items didn't stack, and they could take up considerable space in the player's inventory. In the update, the Mystery items were changed to be stackable.\nDiablo IV.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\",\u00a0Legendaries have an equal or even greater power level compared to that of\u00a0 from previous games. Sub-types include \"Sacred Legendary\" and \"Ancestral Legendary.\" Legendaries grant buffs to the player. A Legendary's property can be transferred from one item to another by removing its \"aspect\" (this destroys the original item) and transferring it. This can only be done once. However, the &lt;a href=\"Codex%20of%20Power\"&gt;Codex of Power&lt;/a&gt; allows players to choose buffs for their Legendaries at will.\nSacred and Ancestral Legendaries only drop towards the end-game. Legendaries cannot be &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;d. In the game's mini-map, Legendaries are represented by an orange star."}

{"id": "2627", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2627", "title": "Leoric", "text": "King Leoric was formerly the ruling monarch of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. Once a devout follower of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith, he was ultimately corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, the result being the end of his line, his kingdom and everything he strove for.\nBiography.\nArrival in Khanduras.\nLeoric originated from &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in the 13th century, at the behest of the Zakarum Church Leoric came into the lands of Khanduras and, in the name of the Zakarum, declared himself to be king. He was unaware that Zakarum had been corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, subtly under Mephisto's influence, was to ensure that Tristram would be his seat of power\u2014the resting place of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeoric brought with him his family, knights, and priests, the latter two groups forming his &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Order of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Along with his advisor, Lazarus, Leoric and his entourage made their way to the town of Tristram, appropriating the decrepit &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts as his seat of power. Although the people of Khanduras were not pleased with coming under the rule of a foreign king, Leoric served them with justice. Eventually, his subjects came to respect him for his purity of heart and deed. A case in point was &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt;, who forged Leoric's &lt;a href=\"mithril\"&gt;mithril&lt;/a&gt; sword and crown.\nAt some point, a &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt; was constructed for Leoric, located well outside Tristram.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nLeoric's Corruption.\nUnknown to Leoric, however, his seat of power was the resting place of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, imprisoned in the catacombs beneath the cathedral by the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; long ago. Lazarus fell under the Lord of Terror's sway, shattering his &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. Requiring an anchor to the world, Diablo chose the strongest soul available to him to be his host\u2014Leoric himself.\nFor many months, Leoric, unaware, fought against Diablo's will. Sensing that he had been possessed by some unknown evil, Leoric kept his condition a secret from those close to him, believing that his piety would be enough to exorcise the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. In this he was sorely mistaken, and Diablo stripped away the core of Leoric's being, burning all honor and virtue from his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;. Lazarus, now also under Diablo's sway, kept close to his lord at all times, and sought to keep Leoric's condition a secret. Despite this, Leoric's change in demeanor became known to his subjects. His once proud visage became ravaged and deformed while his sanity slipped away. Becoming increasingly deranged, Leoric began ordering summary executions of any who questioned his decisions or authority, while he sent his &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Khanduras\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; to the outlying towns to force them into submission. At the height of his madness, Leoric would evince his displeasure by pummeling courtiers, servants, and even foreign dignitaries with his &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Monarch%27s%20Scepter\"&gt;scepter&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that merely a glance in Leoric's direction was enough to earn death at the height of his paranoia. In his &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;hunting grounds&lt;/a&gt;, where he had once led hunts, he would kill any peasant he came across. Horrified by his actions, Leoric's subjects began calling him \"the Black King.\"\nConcerned by the \"traitorous rabble\" in Tristram, Leoric ordered &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Eamon\"&gt;Chancellor Eamon&lt;/a&gt; to secure his manor. He ordered that the caves to the east be sealed, and filled with &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s that Lazarus had obtained. Eamon sorrowfully obeyed.\nLazarus, concerned of the suspicions Leoric's subjects had, convinced the now delusional king that the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; was plotting to take over and annex Khanduras, manipulating him into declaring war, diverting attention, as well as sending many troublesome knights into their deaths when the armies of Westmarch inevitably crushed those of Khanduras. Leoric's priests were, meanwhile, sent as emissaries. Thanks to Lazarus's influence, Leoric even ordered the execution of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Asylla\"&gt;Queen Asylla&lt;/a&gt;, his own wife.\nThe Fall of King Leoric.\nWith the lack of inquisitive eyes, Diablo had free rein to assert his will over his vessal. However, Diablo found that a part of the king's soul still fought against him, and that he would still not be able to take full control. Thus he abandoned his attempts to take over Leoric, leaving him broken and insane as he much more easily took control of Leoric's youngest son &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nWhen King Leoric found that his son had gone missing, he went into a rage and had many innocent people executed for kidnapping the prince, slipping deeper into madness with each passing day. He was eventually slain by his own lieutenant, the knight &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;Lachdanan&lt;/a&gt;, who returned from the Westmarch war only to find that he, too, was being accused of the kidnapping, and that the king was nothing but a raving madman who set his guard upon those knights who were returning. The knights came to blows and Lachdanan begged Leoric to explain his actions. Leoric simply spat at him, condemning Lachdanan and his men as traitors. Sorrowfully, Lachdanan struck down his liege, Leoric cursing him and all of his knights in his last moments.\nRise of the Skeleton King.\nDespite his crimes, Leoric was nonetheless given a proper burial beneath the cathedral. He was buried in his armor within the royal crypts. Unfortunately, Diablo was not content to leave Leoric in the peace of death, and raised Leoric from the dead as a powerful undead warlord called the Skeleton King. Lachdanan's knights were overcome at once, becoming the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Knight\"&gt;Hell Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, with only Lachdanan himself still retaining his mind and choosing to venture down into the labyrinth of the cathedral to die alone rather than put Tristram in danger if he should fall to the same darkness that claimed his men.\nCommanding a host of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and finally serving the evil he had resisted while alive, the Skeleton King was poised to lead forth his undead horde to the surface and overwhelm Tristram. Many adventurers tried to slay Leoric, but ultimately failed. However, he was felled by his eldest son &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; heroes. Standing over the fallen king, they assured him they would find his son. \n&lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; was apparently given a description of the Skeleton King.\nReturn of the Skeleton King.\nDue to his corruption of the monarch, Diablo had left some of his power tied with Leoric's blackened soul.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;Seven years&lt;/a&gt; after his defeat, the rogue &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lethes\"&gt;Lethes&lt;/a&gt; intended to gain that power by summoning Leoric's spirit. She did this by resurrecting the spirit of Asylla, and in doing so, provided a tether. The ritual was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Xul\"&gt;Xul&lt;/a&gt;, but not stopped before a breach was created to Leoric's location within the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Unformed Land&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;The Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; ventured into &lt;a href=\"Mad%20King%27s%20Breach\"&gt;the breach&lt;/a&gt; to slay the king, in which they succeeded. Before being defeated, he vowed to remember the trespass, and make the living sufer for it.\nDespite this, Leoric still endured, and it was warned that once he returned, he would summon an undead army. Adventurers were urged to travel to Ashwold and slay Leoric before his army could be raised.\nFall of the Skeleton King.\n22 years after his first death, Leoric reawakened. The &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt; had descended upon &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, smashing through the cathedral, awakening Leoric and his undead minions. Enraged, he set his minions on Deckard Cain, who had fallen into the depths of the cathedral after the meteor's impact. The scholar was saved, however, by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, who went on to retrieve Leoric's old crown and use it to bind Leoric's spirit into his skeletal body. In a furious battle, the Nephalem defeated Leoric, this time permanently.\nLegacy.\nBecause of his actions at Tristram, Leoric earnt himself a place among the tyrants of history.\nAfter Leoric's (apparently final) defeat, a villager in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; intended to write an epic poem on Leoric's final death. All they needed to do was to find out how he was killed. While another villager pointed out that they could simply ask The Nephalem as to the details of the battle, the aspiring poet refused, as they didn't want to give up their artistic license.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28monster%29\"&gt;Skeleton King (monster)&lt;/a&gt;\"\nLeoric appears in multiplayer games in the first \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" game in his Skeleton King form.

By the end of his (un)life, he was a malevolent being. In his mind, even as madness took him, he had dedicated himself to his kingdom, and it was his people who had betrayed him. Adria regarded Leoric as a man who sought peace and stability, who loved his family and found comfort in his faith. All of these things, according to her, made him weak, and it was his hidden fears that allowed Diablo to corrupt him.\nIn life, Leoric's hair was mid-dark brown color. As he succumbed to madness, it turned white. As the Skeleton King, his hair was blue-silver.\nAt some point, he authored \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Craft%20of%20War%20%28Leoric%29\"&gt;The Craft of War&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

It applies to the gem in the hero's actual helm if the power is activated in &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;. It is desirable while leveling to improve the &lt;a href=\"Ruby\"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; experience bonus, and in the endgame is perhaps most useful to &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s desiring large amounts of &lt;a href=\"Cooldown%20Reduction\"&gt;Cooldown Reduction&lt;/a&gt; via a &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis legendary power was added in &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.1.0%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 2.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, so it is not present in the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 console versions.\nGuaranteed drop.\nThis helm is guaranteed to drop from the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt; the first time a character kills him in &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt; between level 5 and 65. This is the only time in the main game a specific legendary item is guaranteed to drop, aside from the gem. This frequently makes the Broken Crown the first Legendary item acquired by characters leveled through the story, since the Skeleton King is the very first boss.\nThis perk prompted some leveling strategies to include a Campaign Mode as far as the Skeleton King fight before switching to &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; and its denser rewards. The guaranteed Crown has good stats and improves the &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; bonus from a head &lt;a href=\"Ruby\"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe drop guarantee can be reset by starting a new campaign.\nAs a quest item.\nDuring the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Shattered%20Crown\"&gt;A Shattered Crown&lt;/a&gt;, the crown of King Leoric is found in the &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Chancellor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, and repaired by &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%20Eamon\"&gt;Haedrig Eamon&lt;/a&gt;. It is ultimately used to unlock &lt;a href=\"The%20Royal%20Crypts\"&gt;The Royal Crypts&lt;/a&gt; and placed on the Skeleton King's head to awaken and defeat him. The fact that this item then drops from his body upon defeat suggests that it may literally be the crown used in the story.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items\"&gt;Quest Items&lt;/a&gt; are not managed through the loot and inventory system in \"Diablo III\", and in gameplay terms the quest events are completely unrelated to the equipment. Leoric's Crown may drop as a regular random loot item before or after its appearance in the campaign, and may not drop at all during these quests if the character is outside the required level range. If the hero happens to obtain the Crown before doing the quest, it may be stashed, equipped, salvaged or sold like any other piece of equipment, and is unaffected by any events in the story."}

When &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; was falling into madness due to &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s influence, he ordered the manor be protected from the \"traitorous rabble\" in Tristram. To this end, he ordered the sealing of caves nearby, to prevent access to the area. Furthermore, the chambers below the manor were used as &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;torture chambers&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Over two decades later&lt;/a&gt;, the manor was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt;.

Beyond them lie the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarters\"&gt;Royal Quarters&lt;/a&gt;, filled with Leoric's skeletal guards and servants, sometimes including one of several possible &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; targets.\nPast a courtyard to the northwest of the Quarters is a room empty of monsters but filled with books.

This caused the Lesser Evils to question the authority of the Three. \nIn their ignorance, the Lesser Evils began to believe that the Three were afraid to continue the war with Heaven. They considered themselves innately superior to humankind, and that the Eternal Conflict was theirs alone to fight. Frustrated by the cessation of the war, &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; saw the situation as their chance to overthrow the Prime Evils and take control of Hell for themselves. Belial manipulated Azmodan into revolt and the demon lords made pacts with their brethren, assuring them that humanity would not deter them from seizing victory in the Eternal Conflict. &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; had their doubts at first, afraid that they would fall in the coming conflict. Belial however, kept them in the fold. Azmodan and Belial devised a plan to end the stalemate, achieve victory in the Sin War and ultimately ride the bloody crest of the Great Conflict straight into the very arms of Armageddon. Thus, a great revolution was set into motion as all of Hell went to war against the Three Brothers.\nCivil War.\nHell became embroiled in civil war as the Lesser Evils turned against the Primes, culminating in the banishment of the Primes to Sanctuary, where Azmodan hoped that they would remain trapped forever. Azmodan believed that with the Three set loose upon humanity, Heaven would be forced to turn their focus upon the mortal plane, thus leaving the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Heaven\"&gt;Gates of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; abandoned and defenseless. Those few demons who still pledged allegiance to the Three Brothers fled the wrath of Azmodan and Belial, escaping to Sanctuary to seek out their lost masters.\nAs the fires of war died down, Azmodan and Belial began to argue over which of them held the higher authority. The pact that they had made quickly fell to ashes as the two demon lords took up arms against each other. The legions of Hell that remained were polarized behind either warlord, launching themselves into a second civil war. One account states that there was no falling out however, and that the two Lesser Evils began a scheme to subjugate all life to their will. In truth however, the two lords did indeed do battle up until at least the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, by which point Azmodan had held the upper hand for quite some time. Eventually, both Lesser Evils would turn their attention to Sanctuary.\nRecent History.\nIn the aftermath of the Darkening of Tristram, Diablo possessed a &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;mortal host&lt;/a&gt; and departed the &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, intent on reuniting with &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. Andariel and Duriel concluded that the Primes would inevitably reclaim their position in Hell. Therefore, they endeavored to gain favor with the Lord of Terror by protecting his human host. However, both met their end at the hands of a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, who went on to defeat the Prime Evils as well, thus leaving Azmodan and Belial as the last lords of Hell.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Two decades later&lt;/a&gt;, both Azmodan and Belial were defeated by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. However, along with all of the other Great Evils, they were absorbed into Diablo via the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to be reborn as a singular Prime Evil. However, he too was defeated by the Nephalem. However, the stone was taken by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, and in battle with the Nephalem, shattered the stone before drawing the essences of the Evils into himself. After his defeat, Malthael's body disintegrated, Diablo was released, still containing the essences of the other Evils. Eventually however, each of the Evils broke away from Diablo.\nMembership.\n&lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Pain, is the \"twin\" brother of Andariel. Though Duriel had his part in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, he once again aligned with the Three. Sent to guard &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Chamber&lt;/a&gt;. Specializes in heavy melee attacks and uses ice as an aura and has the appearance of a giant bug. His other title is the Maggot King.\n&lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0the Maiden of Anguish, is the \"twin\" sister of Duriel. Sent to guard the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Monastery\"&gt;Rogue Monastery&lt;/a&gt; by Diablo himself. Specializes in mid range poison attacks but ironically enough is weak against the element of fire. She is the only female member of the Seven and is the first to fall in the series. Her other title is the Demon Queen.\n&lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Lies, is one of the leaders of the rebellion against the Three. Uses fire for both phases of his fight with heroes: on the 2nd phase, he'll dig his massive claws into the ground, breathe huge gusts of fel flame and make fiery eruptions. Throughout the game, he possesses Emperor Hakan II during the Scouring of Caldeum as he attempted to claim the Black Soulstone. \n&lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Sin, is one of the leaders of the rebellion against the Three. Throws fire boulders, summons demon gates to call upon minions, rains dead bodies upon enemies, and calls forth dark magic in a large AoE. Azmodan is said to be a brilliant tactician of the Demonic Army, having almost defeated &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Archangel Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; on many occasions, and considers Belial to be his chief rival. He was also the last Great Evil to be sealed in the Black Soulstone. "}

Though she proudly advocated for resilient undead nations, her &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; was often imprecise. After she spread curses through the Necropolis, Lethes was put on trial by her mentor, &lt;a href=\"Xul\"&gt;Xul&lt;/a&gt;. She fled, abandoning her dream of a dead kingdom... until she discovered a &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; shard.\nBiography.\nThe Wayward Apprentice.\nLethes was the student of &lt;a href=\"Xul\"&gt;Xul&lt;/a&gt;. She came to resent her mentor, accusing him of attempting to suppress her potential. She ended up leaving the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, though would later claim that she had been \"cast aside.\" She also indicated years later that Xul intended to put her down, but would not (or could not) do it.\nShe sought out the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, intending on using it to reshape &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. After its destruction, she managed to obtain a shard.\nAshwold Cemetery.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, Lethes came to &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, looking for the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Asylla\"&gt;Queen Asylla&lt;/a&gt;. She believed that Asylla's spirit would be able to lead her to &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, giving her the power to rule the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt;. She accousted &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Fjord\"&gt;Guard Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, and after slaughtering his fellow townsfolk, he gave her the location of the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Honored%20Dead\"&gt;Crypt of Honored Dead&lt;/a&gt;. For whatever reason, she let him live.\nAt the Crypt itself, she tortured two members of the &lt;a href=\"Wortham%20Guard\"&gt;Wortham Guard&lt;/a&gt;, demanding to know where it was located. She killed &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Mayfair\"&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; when he told her nothing, and the &lt;a href=\"Bramden\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; told her that only Asylla's &lt;a href=\"Handmaiden%27s%20Spirit\"&gt;handmaiden&lt;/a&gt; knew the tomb's location. The man's life was saved when Xul arrived, demanding that she stop. Lethes refused, claiming that she'd obtained the power of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, and that Xul and his order would be swept away, replaced by one which would reshape &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. She summoned &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to cover her escape, as her minions fought Xul and a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;.\nLethes later found the handmaiden inside her &lt;a href=\"The%20Handmaiden%27s%20Cottage\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;. She tortured the woman until she revealed where Asylla's tomb was located, before killing her and then departing. Entering the tomb, she summoned a &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Mage%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Skeletal Mage&lt;/a&gt; to waylay her pursuers. In the meantime, she intended to awaken Asylla's spirit so that it may lead her to &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, in order to claim his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nLethes tried to waylay her pursuers by summoning necrotic barriers and a trio of &lt;a href=\"Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;s to defend them. However, the barriers were taken down, and the heroes arrived to find Xul and Lethes in a battle of wills, with the latter summoning Asylla's spirit, tethering it to Leoric's, and attempting to gain his power. Or, rather, the power that &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; had left behind in Leoric's soul when he had corrupted him during the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Xul did what he could to disrupt the ritual, but with Lethes inside the summoning circle, she apparently couldn't be harmed.\nLethes summoned a &lt;a href=\"Lethes%27s%20Simulacrum\"&gt;simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the heroes, but the simulacrum itself was destroyed. Xul continued to disrupt Lethes's summoning, while the heroes entered the manor to slay Leoric. The tether was destroyed, and Leoric slain, but outside, history repeated itself, as Xul found himself unable (or unwilling) to slay his former apprentice. Lethes, however, was quite willing to wound her former master, and flee. The hero(es) pursued her however, and confronted the rogue Necromancer at &lt;a href=\"Lords%27%20Rest\"&gt;Lords' Rest&lt;/a&gt;. Here, Lethes stood her ground, but was apparently slain, exploding in a torrent of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. However, Xul told the hero(es) that he believed that Lethes was still alive, pointing out the lack of a corpse. In truth, the Lethes the hero(es) had faced was a simulacrum; one that appeared to be real than her earlier one due to holding a Worldstone shard. He resolved to follow her.\nIn-game.\nLethes is encountered in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", as part of the &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; questline.

Xul's lines adjust too, who explains that the Lethes boss was a simulacrum. This information is not given to other player characters, who are simply given the \"no body, not dead\" explanation."}

Lhex's father wanted his son to be a priest of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Church\"&gt;Zakarum Church&lt;/a&gt;. At the age of eight, he was sent to study under sages in &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. His subjects included poetry, literature, history, marketing, philosophy and premonition. He believed that particular subject was just a form of guesswork, and found its use of chicken gizzards to be \"quite disgusting.\" That said, he later reflected that his teachers had taught him to have an open mind. Among the lessons were the nature of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, and how the sages were trying to piece together the truth from old tales where demons were said to be involved. His teacher taught him that it was better to hunt demons down rather than waiting for them to reveal themselves. Among the &lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; he read was the tale of &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Kabraxis&lt;/a&gt;. He also read writings of philosophy, which dealt with the thematic struggle between Man and \"his demons.\" He also read of the tales of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was expected to become a full priest at the age of fourteen.\nPirates and Demons.\nc. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;1263&lt;/a&gt;, Lhex, was kidnapped by pirates under the command of &lt;a href=\"Aribar%20Raithen\"&gt;Aribar Raithen&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned on the \"&lt;a href=\"Barracuda\"&gt;Barracuda&lt;/a&gt;\" in the port-city of &lt;a href=\"Tauruk%27s%20Port\"&gt;Tauruk's Port&lt;/a&gt;. The \"&lt;a href=\"Lonesome%20Star\"&gt;Lonesome Star&lt;/a&gt;\" (a &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Navy\"&gt;naval ship&lt;/a&gt;) was sent to rescue him. Over his five days of imprisonment, he bloodied the ear of &lt;a href=\"Bull\"&gt;one of the pirates&lt;/a&gt; by using one of his bed supports. When Raithen came down to inspect him, Lhex assaulted him with a plank of wood, but was easily fended off. Lhex remained defiant, at least until Raithen threatened him with a knife, and made him admit that his father would indeed miss one of his sons. Having cowed him, Raithen handed him a piece of paper, wanting to know what it meant. Lhexx identified the writing as being of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic origin, and identified one of the symbols as belonging to &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Kabraxis&lt;/a&gt;. Raithen doubted the existence of demons, but Lhex stood firm. He went on to tell him of the tales of Kabraxis and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Road\"&gt;Black Road&lt;/a&gt;. The tale came to a halt as the \"Lonesome Star\" launched an attack, its sailors fighting to rescue him.\nLhex was rescued by the sailor &lt;a href=\"Darrick%20Lang\"&gt;Darrick Lang&lt;/a&gt;, but was despaired when he felt a cold wind blowing from the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%27s%20Beak%20Mountains\"&gt;Hawk's Beak Mountains&lt;/a&gt;; he believed that Kabraxis had been freed. He struggled against the sailors who weren't interested in talk of any demons. He wondered if &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Kabraxis's Lair&lt;/a&gt; was within the ruined port. Lang still wasn't interested\u2014if the pirates had found a demon, good for them, it would hopefully kill the buccaneers. Lhex played his royal blood as his trump card, claiming that if the sailors refused to investigate, he'd tell his uncle of their refusal to find out more. And with the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;troubles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, that might be seen as dereliction of duty. Lang relented and agreed to investigate, but ordered Lhex be taken back to the \"Lonesome Star\".\nLhex was validated in fearing Kabraxis. Unfortunately, Kabraxis escaped, and took the life of &lt;a href=\"Mat%20Hu-Ring\"&gt;one of the sailors&lt;/a&gt;. Lang grimly acknowledged that he had seen the demon leave upon his return to the \"Lonesome Star\". Lhex attended the sailor's funeral. As night fell, he approached Lang, apologizing for his friend's death, but Lang wasn't interested. Nor was he interested in talking about Kabraxis. Lhex declared himself to be the king's nephew, but as Lang grunted, he wasn't the king. Lhex kept pushing him, stating that he held Lhex responsible for his friend's death, and that if he wanted to fight demons, he'd have a short life. And it wasn't a fight he was interested in.\nPersonality and Traits.\nLhex was lean and muscular, and by the time of his captivity, was starting to lose his baby fat. He was very defiant, though to the point of naivete in some cases. He accepted the existence of demons, or at least, that they had once existed within &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. That said, he was cynical of the claims of those who stated that they fought demons, believing their motives to be to gain &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; by playing on superstitions. Yet he saw fighting demons as his calling, and believed in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;."}

From the first days, Isendra believed that a prophecy was actually talking about Li-Ming, even though everyone except the two of them had been quite skeptical.\nLike Isendra herself, Li-Ming dismissed most of the warnings, and refused to ignore the needs of people around &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. At the age of 16, she saved the city of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Bahadur\"&gt;Lut Bahadur&lt;/a&gt; from drought by bringing water back. However, the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;' attention was focused on Isendra \u2014 they believed that she was influencing Li-Ming.\nLi-Ming discovered Isendra's mangled body shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated in the eastern desert. Questioning Valthek, she concluded that Isendra died unnaturally, and eventually confronted him about this. Even though he tried to stop Li-Ming, she left the Sanctum after besting him in combat (with relative ease, due to the secrets she uncovered).\nAfter Isendra's death, Li-Ming (now age 20) ventured to &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, pursuing a sighting of a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;fallen star&lt;/a&gt;. Valthek dispatched an &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate her, despite his misgivings. As she left, Li-Ming sensed that &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;strange things&lt;/a&gt; were afoot in Caldeum.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nLi-Ming can be considered to be the canonical version of the Wizard character class for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". In her dialogue, she often exclaims disrespect and annoyance of her former mentors (except Isendra), stating that perhaps they will change their mind about her when they learn of her deeds as &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Valthek%27s%20Rebuke\"&gt;Valthek's Rebuke&lt;/a&gt; staff is stated to have disappeared shortly after \"an incident\" with the \"rebellious student\" (i.e. Li-Ming). However, it is unlikely that she stole it. Enchantments on &lt;a href=\"The%20Twisted%20Sword\"&gt;The Twisted Sword&lt;/a&gt; are stated to be made by Li-Ming.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nLi-Ming appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" as a Wizard class representative.\nHer Basic Abilities are , &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Orb\"&gt;Arcane Orb&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;.

Li-Ming also has a &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; themed-skin, which is a modified version of her default appearance, and also has her wearing the &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Guise%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Guise of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; helm.\nPersonality and Traits.\nLi-Ming is extremely sure of herself and frequently boasts of her superior power and skill when in battle. The term \"Wizard\" is often given to Mages with rebellious attitudes or an obsession with power. Li-Ming displays a little of both and she's hardly ashamed of it. \nDuring her time as a student, she often showed disobedience, studying the arcane arts much for herself, without guidance (or permission) from her superiors, being particularly interested in magic of time and space distortion. Many teachers told her that she was full of herself. By the end of her training, she was able to single-handedly beat the magisters in combat.\nMany other students were fascinated by Li-Ming. &lt;a href=\"Delsere\"&gt;Delsere&lt;/a&gt; even swore that she would one day wear his &lt;a href=\"Delsere%27s%20Magnum%20Opus\"&gt;masterpieces&lt;/a&gt;. She was fond of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagic has always come easily to Li-Ming. She was prone to experimentation with magic and even Valthek agreed that she was a genius (though he denied ever admitting it)."}

To this end, the &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; adhere to strict militaristic disciplines. &lt;a href=\"Seraphim\"&gt;Seraphim&lt;/a&gt; warriors strike at the enemies of Light with &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s imbued with righteous wrath and justice. The Angels believe that only absolute discipline can properly restore order to the myriad realms, while the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic denizens of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; hold that absolute chaos is the true nature of all things.\" \n\"The battles of the Great Conflict rage across both time and space, often infringing upon the very fabric of reality itself. From the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt; at the very heart of the High Heavens to the arcane &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt; of the Underworld, the warriors of these eternal realms journey to wherever their timeless conflict carries them. The legendary deeds of the heroes of the realms beyond elicit both veneration and insight.\" \n\"The greatest of these heroes was &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt;, lieutenant to the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;Arch-Angel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and bearer of the Angelic &lt;a href=\"Runeblade\"&gt;Runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azurewrath\"&gt;Azurewrath&lt;/a&gt;. He once led a fierce attack upon the Hellforge as the creation of the dark &lt;a href=\"demonblade\"&gt;demonblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang\"&gt;Shadowfang&lt;/a&gt; was nearing completion. His quest was to destroy both wielder and weapon - a charge that he was destined never to complete. Izual was overcome by the legions of chaos and, tragically, was lost to the Darkness. His fate stands as testament to the fact that Angels and Demons alike shall fearlessly enter into any domain - so long as their hated enemies dwell within.\" \n\"Although the Great Conflict burned hotter and longer than any of the stars in the sky, neither side could gain dominion over the other for long. Both factions sought some way to turn the tides of the war to their favor. With the ascension of &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Conflict ground to a mysterious halt. Both armies paused in a breathless stalemate, waiting to see to whose side Man would eventually turn.\" \n\"Mortals had the unique ability to choose between Darkness and Light, and it was held that this would be the deciding factor in the outcome of the Great Conflict. Thus, the agents of the nether-realms descended to the mortal realm to vie for the favor of Man\u2026\"\nThe Sin War.\n\"The coming of the Great Conflict to the mortal realm is known as the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. Angels and Demons, disguising themselves while traveling amongst men, attempted to secretly lure mortals to their respective causes. Over time, the forces of Darkness discovered that mortals responded much more to brute force than to subtle coercion, and so began to terrorize Man into submission. The Angels fought to defend humanity against this demonic oppression, but all too often their austere methods and severe punishments succeeded only in alienating those whom they sought to protect.\" \n\"The violent battles of the Sin War occurred often, but they were seldom witnessed by the prying eyes of Man. Only a few \u201cenlightened\u201d souls were aware of the supernatural beings that walked amongst the huddled masses of humanity. Powerful mortals arose and accepted the challenge of the Sin War, allying themselves with both sides in the Great Conflict. The legendary deeds of these great mortal warriors served to earn both the respect and hatred of the netherworlds. Although lesser demons kneeled before those possessing power and strength, they also cursed the very existence of mortal man. Many of these fiends believed that the deadlock brought about by the emergence of Man was a perverse offense to their \u201chigher\u201d role in the great scheme of things.\" \n\"This jealousy of Man led to harsh, atrocious acts of violence by the demons against the mortal realm. Some men learned of this deep hatred and used it against the denizens of the Underworld. One such mortal, &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt; the Summoner, delighted in summoning demons and then breaking them to his will. Horazon, along with his brother &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;, were members of the Eastern &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan\"&gt;mageclan&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt;. This mystic clan studied the ways of demons and had catalogued their lore for generations. Empowered by this knowledge, Horazon was able to take the work of the Vizjerei and pervert it for his demented purposes. The denizens of Hell sought revenge against this bold mortal, but Horazon managed to keep himself well protected within his &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;arcane sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\" \n\"&lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;, the brother of Horazon, was eventually lured to the side of Darkness. He was granted exceptional strength and longevity, and fought alongside the legions of Hell against the cursed Vizjerei, and eventually his own brother during the Sin War. Although Bartuc was renowned amongst the warriors of many realms, his dominance in battle came with a terrible price. An insatiable lust for mortal blood pervaded his every thought and deed. Bartuc soon became as fond of bathing in the blood of his enemies as he did of shedding it, and in time he came to be known only as the Warlord of Blood.\" \nThe Dark Exile.\n\"\u201cSeven is the number of the powers of Hell, and Seven is the number of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d \"\n\"These are the true names of the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;lesser&lt;/a&gt; of the Great Evils. For ages uncounted each have ruled over their own domains within the Burning Hells, seeking absolute dominion over their infernal brethren. As the Lesser Four continuously vied for the control of those forces that dwelled within their realms, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Greater Three&lt;/a&gt; held absolute power over the whole of Hell. The Lesser Four used dark and evil measures in their quest for power, and herein begins the legend of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;.\" \n\"These are the Prime Evils of Hell that wielded their power as a dark, sovereign triumvirate. The Three Brothers ruled over the Lesser Four by brutal force and malicious cunning. Being the eldest and strongest of the Evils, the Three Brothers were responsible for countless victories against the armies of the Light. Although they never held sway over the High Heavens for long, the Three were justly feared by enemies and subjects alike.\" \n\"With the ascension of Man and the subsequent standstill of the Great Conflict, the Three Brothers began to devote their energies to the perversion of mortal souls. The Three realized that Man was the key to victory in the war against Heaven, and thus altered their rigid agendum that they had propagated since the Beginning. This change caused many of the Lesser Evils to question the authority of the Three, and so brought about a great rift between the Prime Evils and their servitors.\" \n\"In their ignorance, the Lesser Evils began to believe that the Three were afraid to continue the war with Heaven. Frustrated by the cessation of the war, Azmodan and Belial saw the situation as their chance to overthrow the Prime Evils and take control of Hell for themselves. The two demon lords made a pact with their minor brethren, assuring them that the wretched plague of humanity would not deter the ultimate victory of the sons of Hell. Azmodan and Belial devised a plan to end the stalemate, achieve victory in the Sin War and ultimately ride the bloody crest of the Great Conflict straight into the very arms of Armageddon. Thus, a great revolution was set into motion as all of Hell went to war against the Three Brothers\u2026\" \n\"The Brothers fought with all of the savagery of the Underworld, and to their credit, annihilated a third of Hell\u2019s treacherous legions. In the end, however, they were overcome by the &lt;a href=\"Horned%20Death\"&gt;Horned Death&lt;/a&gt; led by the traitors Azmodan and Belial. The Prime Evils, weakened and bodiless, were banished to the mortal realm where Azmodan hoped that they would remain trapped forever. Azmodan believed that with the Three set loose upon humanity, the Angels would be forced to turn their focus upon on the mortal plane - thus leaving the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Gates of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; abandoned and defenseless. Those few demons who still pledged allegiance to the Three Brothers fled the wrath of Azmodan and Belial, escaping to the realm of Man to seek out their lost Masters.\" \n\"As the warfires died out upon the battlefields of Hell, Azmodan and Belial began to argue over which of them held the higher authority. The pact that they had made quickly fell to ashes as the two demon lords took up arms against each other. The legions of Hell that remained were polarized behind either warlord, launching themselves into a bloody civil war that has lasted to this day\u2026\"\nThe Binding of the Three.\n\"In the ancient days, before the rise of the Western Empires, the dark and terrible entities known as the Three Evils were exiled to the world of Man. These eternal entities wandered throughout the waking world and fed upon the lusts of men, leaving chaos and attrition in their wake. The Evils turned father against son and prompted many great nations into brutal and petty wars. Their Exile from Hell left them with an insatiable hunger to bring suffering and pain to all who would not kneel before them, and so the Three Brothers ravaged the lands of the Far East for countless centuries.\"\n\"Eventually, a secretive order of mortal magi was gathered together by the enigmatic Arch-Angel Tyrael. These sorcerers were to hunt the Three Evils and put an end to their vicious rampage. The order, known as the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, consisted of &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s from the diverse and numerous mage-clans of the East. Employing disparate magical practices and disciplines, this unlikely Brotherhood succeeded in capturing two of the Brothers within powerful artifacts called &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s. Mephisto and Baal, trapped within the swirling, spiritual constraints of the Soulstones, were then buried beneath the dunes of the desolate Eastern Sands.\"\n\"The powers of Hatred and wanton Destruction seemed to diminish in the East as a nervous peace began to settle over the land. Yet, for many decades the Horadrim continued their grim search for the third Brother, Diablo. They knew that if the Lord of Terror was left untamed there could never be any lasting peace within the realm of humanity.\"\n\"The Horadrim followed in the wake of terror and anarchy that spread throughout the Western lands. After a great battle which claimed the lives of many brave souls, the Lord of Terror was captured and imprisoned within the last of the Soulstones by a group of Horadrim monks led by the Initiate &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt;. These monks carried the cursed stone to the land of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; and buried it within a secluded cave near the &lt;a href=\"river%20Talsande\"&gt;river Talsande&lt;/a&gt;. Above this cave the Horadrim constructed a great &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Monastery&lt;/a&gt; from which they could continue to safeguard the Soulstone. As ages passed, the Horadrim constructed a network of catacombs beneath the Monastery to house the earthly remains of the martyrs of their Order.\"\n\"Generations passed in Khanduras, and the numbers of the Horadrim slowly dwindled. With no quests left to undertake, and too few sons to sustain their guardianship, the once powerful Order faded into obscurity. Eventually, the great Monastery that they had built fell to ruins as well. Although villages grew and thrived around the shell of the old Monastery, no one knew of the dark, secret passageways that stretched into the cold earth beneath it. None could have dreamed of the burning red gem that pulsed within the labyrinth\u2019s heart...\"\nBook Two: The Return of Terror.\nThe Lands of Khanduras.\n\"Years after the last of the Horadrim had died, a great and prosperous society grew in the lands of the West. As time wore on, many Eastern pilgrims settled in the lands surrounding Khanduras and soon established small, self contained kingdoms. A few of these kingdoms bickered with Khanduras over holdings of property or routes of trade. These quabbles did little to upset the lasting peace of the West, and the great Northern kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; proved to be a strong ally of Khanduras as the two lands steadily engaged in ventures of barter and commerce.\" \n\"During this time, a bold, new religion of the Light known as &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; began to spread throughout the kingdom of Westmarch and into many of its northern principalities. Zakarum, founded in the Far East, implored followers to enter into the Light and forsake the darkness that lurked within their souls. The people of Westmarch adopted the statutes of Zakarum as their sacred mission in the world. Westmarch began to turn towards its neighbors, expecting them to embrace this \u201cNew Beginning\u201d as well. Tensions rose between the kingdoms of Westmarch and Khanduras as the priests of Zakarum began to preach their foreign dogma whether they were welcomed or not.\" \n\"It was then that the great northern lord &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; came unto the lands of Khanduras and, in the name of Zakarum, declared himself King. Leoric was a deeply religious man and had brought many Knights and Priests with him that comprised his &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Order of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Leoric and his trusted advisor, the Arch Bishop &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, made their way to the city of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Leoric appropriated the ancient, decrepit Monastery on the outskirts of the town for his seat of power and renovated it to match its time-lost glory. Although the free people of Khanduras were not pleased with being placed under the sudden rule of a foreign King, Leoric served them with justice and might. Eventually, the people of Khanduras grew to respect the kind Leoric, sensing that he sought only to guide and protect them against the oppression of Darkness.\"\nThe Awakening.\n\"Not long after Leoric took possession of Khanduras, a power long asleep awakened within the dark recesses beneath the Monastery. Sensing that freedom was within his grasp, Diablo entered the nightmares of the Arch Bishop and lured him into the dark, subterranean labyrinth. In his terror, Lazarus raced throughout the abandoned hallways until he at last came to the chamber of the burning Soulstone. No longer in command of his body or spirit, he raised the stone above his head and uttered words long forgotten in the realm of mortals. His will destroyed, Lazarus shattered the Soulstone upon the ground. Diablo once again came into the world of Man. Although he was released from his imprisonment within the Soulstone, the Lord of Terror was still greatly weakened from his long sleep and required an anchor to the world. Once he had found a mortal form to wear, he could begin to reclaim his vastly depleted power. The great demon weighed the souls residing in the town above, and chose to take the strongest of them - that of King Leoric.\" \n\"For many months King Leoric secretly fought the evil presence that twisted his thoughts and emotions. Sensing that he had been possessed by some unknown evil, Leoric hid his dark secret from his Priests, hoping that somehow his own devout righteousness would be enough to exorcise the corruption growing inside him - he was sorely mistaken. Diablo stripped away the core of Leoric\u2019s being, burning away all honor and virtue from his soul. Lazarus too, had fallen under the sway of the Demon, keeping close to Leoric at all times. Lazarus worked to conceal the plans of his new Master from the Order of Light, hoping that the demon\u2019s power would grow, well concealed amongst the servants of Zakarum.\" \n\"The priests of Zakarum and the citizenry of Khanduras recognized the disturbing change within their liege. His once proud and rugged form became distorted and deformed. King Leoric became increasingly deranged and ordered immediate executions of any who dared to question his methods or authority. Leoric began to send his Knights to other villages to bully their townspeople into submission. The people of Khanduras who had once grown to see great honor in their ruler began to call Leoric the Black King.\" \n\"Driven to the brink of madness by the Lord of Terror, King Leoric slowly alienated his closest friends and advisors. &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;Lachdanan&lt;/a&gt;, Captain of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Light\"&gt;Knights of the Order of Light&lt;/a&gt; and honored Champion of Zakarum, tried to discern the nature of his King\u2019s deteriorating spirit. Yet at every turn the Arch-Bishop Lazarus would waylay Lachdanan and admonish him for questioning the actions of the King. As tensions grew between the two, Lazarus charged Lachdanan with treason against the Kingdom. To the Priests and Knights of Leoric\u2019s court, the prospect of Lachdanan committing treason was ridiculous. Lachdanan\u2019s motives were honorable and just, and soon many began question the reason of their once beloved King.\" \n\"Leoric\u2019s madness was growing more obvious with each passing day. Sensing that the advisors of the court were becoming increasingly suspicious of foul treachery, Lazarus desperately sought to contain the eroding situation. The Arch-Bishop masterfully convinced the delusional Leoric that the kingdom of Westmarch was plotting against him, secretly planning to dethrone him and annex Khanduras into its own lands. Leoric flew into a rage and summoned his advisors to his side. Manipulated by the Arch-Bishop, the paranoid King declared a state of war between the kingdoms of Khanduras and Westmarch.\" \n\"Leoric ignored the warnings and admonishments of his advisors and the &lt;a href=\"royal%20army%20of%20Khanduras\"&gt;royal army of Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; was ordered to the North to engage in a war that they did not believe in. Lachdanan was appointed by Lazarus to lead the armies of Khanduras into Westmarch. Although Lachdanan argued against the necessity of the coming conflict, he was honor-bound to uphold the will of his King. Many of the high-priests and officials were forced to travel to the North as emissaries on errands of diplomatic urgency, as well. The desperate ploy of Lazarus had succeeded in sending many of the King\u2019s more \u2018troublesome\u2019 advisors to their certain deaths\u2026\" \nThe Darkening of Tristram.\n\"The absence of prying advisors and inquisitive Priests left Diablo free to assume total control over the King\u2019s battered soul. As the Lord of Terror attempted to strengthen his hold upon the maddened King, he found that the lingering spirit of Leoric fought with him still. Although the control over Leoric that Diablo held was formidable, the Demon knew that in his weakened state he could never take complete possession of his soul as long as a glimmer of his will remained. The demonlord sought a fresh and innocent host upon which to build his Terror.\"\n\"The demon relinquished his control over Leoric, but the King\u2019s soul was left corrupted and his mind crazed. Diablo began to search throughout Khanduras for the perfect vessel to act as his focus, and found such a soul easily within his reach. Enjoined by his dark master, Lazarus kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt; - Leoric's son - and dragged the terrified youth down into the blackness of the labyrinth. Flooding the boy\u2019s defenseless mind with the essence of pure Terror, Diablo easily took possession of the young Albrecht.\"\n\"Pain and fire raced through the child\u2019s soul. Hideous laughter filled his head and clouded his thoughts. Paralyzed with fear, Albrecht felt the presence of Diablo within his mind as it seemed to push him down, deeper and deeper into darkness and oblivion. Diablo gazed upon his surroundings through the eyes of the young prince. A lustful hunger still tortured the demon after his frustrating bout for control over Leoric, but the nightmares of the boy provided ample substance to sate him. Reaching deep into Albrecht\u2019s subconscious, Diablo ripped the greatest fears of the child from their hiding places and gave them breath.\"\n\"Albrecht watched, as if out of a dream, twisted and disfigured forms appeared all around him. Unholy, writhing visages of terror danced about him chanting choruses of obscenities. All of the \u2018monsters\u2019 that he had ever imagined or believed that he had seen in his life became flesh and were given life before him. Large bodies comprised of living rock erupted from the walls and bowed to their dark master. The ancient, &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;skeletal corpses&lt;/a&gt; of the Horadrim arose from archaic crypts and lumbered off into the red washed corridors beyond. As the cacophony of madness and nightmares hammered its final blow against Albrecht\u2019s shattered spirit, the bloodlusted &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s and demons of his mind scattered and scrambled maniacally into the lengthening passageways of his waking Nightmare.\"\n\"The ancient catacombs of the Horadrim had become a twisted labyrinth of raw, focused Terror. Empowered by Diablo\u2019s possession of young Albrecht, the creatures of the boy\u2019s own imagination had gained corporeal form. So strong was the terror that grew inside of Albrecht, that the borders of the Mortal realm began to warp and tear. The Burning Hell began to seep into the world of Man and take root within the labyrinth. Beings and occurrences displaced by time and space, and long lost to the history of Man were pulled screaming into the ever-expanding domain.\"\n\"The body of Albrecht, fully possessed by Diablo, began to distort and change. The small boy grew and his eyes blazed as tendril-like spines ripped through his flesh. Great, arched horns erupted from Albrecht\u2019s skull as Diablo altered the form of the child to match that of his demonic body. Deep within the recesses of the labyrinth, a growing power was being harnessed. When the moment was right, Diablo would venture once more into the mortal world and free his captive Brothers Mephisto and Baal. The Prime Evils would be reunited, and together they would reclaim their rightful place in Hell.\"\nThe Fall of the Black King.\n\"The war against the zealous armies of Westmarch ended with a horrible slaughter. With the army of Khanduras ripped to shreds by the superior numbers and defensive positions of Westmarch, Lachdanan quickly gathered together those who were not captured or killed and ordered a retreat back to the safety of Khanduras. They returned to find the town of Tristram in shambles.\" \n\"King Leoric, deep within the throes of madness, went into a rage when he learned that his son was missing. After scouring the village with the few guards that remained with him at the monastery, Leoric had decided that the townsfolk had abducted his son and hidden him somewhere. Although the townsfolk denied any knowledge of Prince Albrecht\u2019s whereabouts, Leoric insisted that they had crafted a conspiracy against him, and that they would pay the price for such treachery.\" \n\"The mysterious disappearance of the Arch-Bishop Lazarus left no one in Tristram with whom the King would take council. Overcome by grief and dementia, Leoric had many of the townsfolk executed for the crime of high treason.\" \n\"As Lachdanan and his fellow survivors returned to confront their King, Leoric sent his few remaining guards against them. Believing that Lachdanan was somehow part of the townsfolk\u2019s conspiracy, Leoric decreed that he and his party were to die. Lachdanan, finally realizing that Leoric was beyond salvation, ordered his men to defend themselves. The ensuing battle carried them down into the very halls of the darkened Monastery, bringing a final desecration to the once holy sanctum of the Horadrim. Lachdanan won a bittersweet victory as his men were forced to kill all of Leoric\u2019s deceived protectors. They cornered the ravenous King within his own sanctuary and begged him to explain the atrocities he had committed. Leoric only spat at them and cursed them for traitors against both his crown and the Light.\" \n\"Lachdanan walked slowly towards his King and sorrowfully drew his sword. Full of grief and rage, all honor having been cast to the winds, Lachdanan ran his blade through Leoric\u2019s shriveled, blackened heart. The once noble King screamed an unearthly death-cry, and as his madness finally overtook him, he brought down a curse upon those who had so betrayed him. Calling upon the forces of Darkness that he had spent his entire life combating, Leoric condemned Lachdanan and the others to eternal damnation. In that last, fleeting moment within the heart of the Monastery, all that was ever virtuous or honorable about the stewards of Khanduras was shattered forever.\"\nThe Reign of Diablo.\n\"The Black King lay dead, slain at the hands of his own Priests and Knights. The young Prince Albrecht was still missing, and the proud defenders of Khanduras were no more. The people of Tristram looked about their lifeless town and were greatly dismayed. Awash in feelings of both relief and remorse, they soon realized that their troubles had merely begun. Strange, eerie lights appeared in the darkened windows of the Monastery. Misshapen, leathery-skinned creatures were seen venturing forth from the shadows of the church. Horrible, wounded cries seemed to linger on the wind, emanating from deep underground. It became apparent that something quite unnatural had infested the once holy sight\u2026\" \n\"Travelers on the roads surrounding Tristram were accosted by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;cloaked riders&lt;/a&gt; that seemed to now constantly roam the deserted countryside. Many villagers fled Tristram, making their way to other towns or kingdoms, fearing some unnamed evil that seemed to wait in the shadows all around them. Those few who chose to remain seldom ventured out at night, and never tread foot upon the grounds of the cursed Monastery. Whispered rumors of poor, innocent people being abducted in the night by wicked, nightmarish creatures filled the halls of the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;local inn&lt;/a&gt;. With no King, no law, and no army left to defend them, many of the townsfolk began to fear an attack from the things that now dwelt beneath their town.\" \n\"The Arch-Bishop Lazarus, frayed and disheveled, returned from his absence and assured the townsfolk that he too had been ravaged by the growing evil of the Monastery. With their desperate need for reassurance clouding their good judgment, Lazarus whipped the townspeople into a frenzied mob. Reminding them that Prince Albrecht was still unaccounted for, he persuaded many of the men to follow him into the depths of the Monastery to search for the boy. They gathered torches and soon the night air glowed with the flickering light of hope. They armed themselves with shovels, picks and scythes and so prepared, they boldly followed the treacherous Arch-Bishop straight into the fiery maw of Hell itself...\" \n\"The few who survived the horrible fate that awaited them returned to Tristram and recounted what they could of the ordeal. Their wounds were terrible, and even the skills of the &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; could not save some of them. As the stories of demons and devils spread, a stifling, primal Terror began to consume the hearts of all of the town\u2019s inhabitants. It was a Terror that none of them had ever known...\" \n\"Deep beneath the foundations of the ruined Monastery, Diablo gorged himself upon the fears of the mortals above him. He slowly sank back into the welcoming shadows and began to harness his depleted power.\" \n\"He smiled to himself in the sheltering darkness, for he knew that the time of his final victory was fast approaching...\"\nReferences.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; Manual\""}

Within the library, &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; ascetics peer into the crystals, recording the visions they behold for Itherael to interpret.

Zoltun Kulle's Library) is one of the repositories of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe library is located in the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, either in or on the boundary of the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt;. It is filled with the types of traps that Kulle would normally employ, replete with powerful artifacts and the many traps that are there to keep them out of prying hands. A &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle%20%28Simulacrum%29\"&gt;copy&lt;/a&gt; of Zoltun Kulle was created by the &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the library's curator.\nThe library's entrance was apparently kept hidden by &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and its defenses powered by a &lt;a href=\"The%20Central%20Core\"&gt;central core&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;s were created to serve as its protectors.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThe library was the first of its kind that Kulle established. He constructed it alongside a series of unique constructs he built to endure the shifting sands. His primary focus was the physical strength and obedience of the constructs, not their adaptability.\nKulle kept a journal which detailed the library's inner workings. He conducted a number of \"unfortunate experiments\" which resulted in the creation of &lt;a href=\"Aberration\"&gt;monstrous creatures&lt;/a&gt;. He also conducted &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ation experiments via &lt;a href=\"terminus\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt; devices.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; breached the library as part of their efforts to defeat Kulle. The Horadrim were defeated and resurrected as his slaves. Kulle eventually abandoned the Library and moved to his &lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;. As he was not able to get a terminus to connect between the two facilities, he bitterly resigned the library to rot. \nKulle later met his end by the Horadrim. Over time, the library fell into disrepair. Its central core shut down, and &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s overran the library. Kulle's Golems were steadily destroyed over time, and couldn't keep the monsters in check. Additionally, a number of Golems became wild and uncontrolled. Furthermore, wards went up that prevented &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt; from gaining access to certain sections of the library, and despite his efforts, he was unable to breach them. The constructs Kulle created still continued their tasks centuries later, despite the library crumbling around them.\nThe existence of the library was known to the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Blades\"&gt;Amber Blades&lt;/a&gt;. However, aware of Kulle's reputation, they stayed clear of the structure.\nRecent History.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, one of its shards crashed into the library. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;Five years later&lt;/a&gt;, a group of thieves entered the library hoping to make a big score. Unfortunately for them, the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; had also arrived, hoping to retrieve the shard. &lt;a href=\"The%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;The Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; later found the library with the help of &lt;a href=\"Peth\"&gt;Peth&lt;/a&gt;; they had come to find how to destroy the corrupted Worldstone shards, already in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. However, they found that everything was trying to kill them. This included Kulle's duplicate, who attacked them, believing the intruder(s) to be thieves, despite their protests. He was defeated, and they explained that they weren't thieves, but rather, sought a way to destroy the Worldstone shards. The Curator stated that if Kulle knew of a way, he would have stored the information in his private archives. However, given his weakened state, he couldn't reach that location. He had to regain his strength, and ordered the hero(es) to clear the library of the creatures that infested it. Having proved their worth, he led them to the central core to reactivate it. However, upon their arrival, the Curator found her was unable to reactivate it. He sent the hero(es) to find Kulle's journal, which detailed the library's inner workings. Upon their return, the Curator discovered that they needed &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; to reactivate the core. He bid the hero(es) travel to the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Engine\"&gt;Chaos Engine&lt;/a&gt; to extract the essence of Golems, in order to reactivate the core.\nAt round about this time, the &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Scorpions\"&gt;Sand Scorpions&lt;/a&gt; broke into the library in search of treasure.\nWith the core reactivated, the wards that had prevented access to certain sections went down. Subsequently, the entire library came under the Curator's control, and he gave the hero(es) leave to come and go as they pleased in the future. \nLater Events.\n\"Note: The following events aren't necessarily in chronological order.\"\nThe Curator managed to regain control of a number of Golems, but others still remained wild and uncontrolled.\nNow that the library had been opened to the world, it attracted a number of hapless adventurers, along with the Sand Scorpions. While some of them pillaged the archives, others lay in wait for hapless explorers. &lt;a href=\"Peth\"&gt;Peth&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Blades\"&gt;Amber Blades&lt;/a&gt; requested that adventurers remove them.\nAt some point, Peth himself ventured into the library, but found it had been invaded by &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Ghouls&lt;/a&gt;. He requested that adventurers remove the Ghouls from the library, as he dared not set foot inside again until the monsters had been removed. Furthermore, in doing so, the library's archives would be protected from the Ghouls' ruthless scavenging. The Library was also invaded by &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"drub\"&gt;drub&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;Scepter of Fahir&lt;/a&gt;, the Amber Blades declared war on the Sand Scorpions, but were forced to retreat into the library. In the ensuing battle, both &lt;a href=\"Tabri\"&gt;Tabri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vataos\"&gt;Vataos&lt;/a&gt; were apparently killed, leaving both factions leaderless.\nIn-game.\nThe library appears as a zone in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". Its entrance is located in the Shassar Sea zone, available after completing the Shassar &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line. It has a recommended &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; of 35-41.\n&lt;a href=\"Tomes\"&gt;Tomes&lt;/a&gt; can be found outside the library, and if enough are collected, it unlocks a secret level. The secret level varies in its content. Enemies can be fought here from across the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;series's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"timeline\"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nAt &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; 2018, it was stated that the heroes of \"Diablo Immortal\" came to the library to find its Worldstone shard. In the final version, they come to the library to find how to destroy the corrupted shards."}

In addition to her weapons, she also carried a sack with her, one containing a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;. As she slept, she caught Rigley trying to open it. Putting a blade against his neck, she warned the caravan driver that she'd kill him if he tried to open it again. Whomever she delivered the demon to would apparently grant her significant profit.\nRigley eventually apologised to her the next day, and some semblance of normal conversation was established. However, it was clear that he was still interested in the sack, and she repeated her threat. However, as she slept, Rigley opened the sack, releasing the demon. The creature possessed him and destroyed the caravan in its rampage, along with setting the camels free. Lidra was buried under the debris, and when she came to, was heavily bruised, and there was no sign of her quarry bar the damage it had caused.\nShe was approached by a man, &lt;a href=\"Slavut\"&gt;Slavut&lt;/a&gt;, a former priest, and now a scavenger. Both being wary of the other's motives, she claimed that she had been attacked by a desert beast. She could tell that he didn't buy her story, but he still offered her a place at his camp. Lidra killed him, and headed towards the camp herself. Along the way she was able to find and track Rigley, gauging his situation. He to was headed for the camp, so she decided to wait, let him feed on the bandits, and once the demon had gorged itself and lowered its guard, she would strike. \nThe plan worked, to a point - not all the scavengers were killed, and Rigley clearly had enough self-control to fight the demon's actions. But with his guard lowered, she struck, downing Rigley. Plunging her blades into his body, she recited an incantation that drew the demon out of Rigley's body, in an effort to get it back into the sack. Rigley pulled her arms in deeper into his wounds, and the demon possessed her instead. Rigley and &lt;a href=\"Kulin\"&gt;one of the scavengers&lt;/a&gt; impaled her with a blade, passing right through her body, and consequently, the demon as well. Both Lidra and the demon were killed as a result.\nPersonality and Traits.\nLidra was callous, quite willing to kill and let others die. She was equipped with numerous blades that she primarily uses as thrown projectiles. She wore lavender robes."}

Vitality can be rolled on any items in the game, while Life% can only be rolled on helms, amulets, shoulderpads, chestplates and rings. The total bonus to Life % from items is limited to 108% (200% with the help of ). &lt;a href=\"Amethyst\"&gt;Amethyst&lt;/a&gt; gems in a &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed helm may also add up to +23% Life (up to the double with the aid of ). One should be careful about increasing Life over Armor and Resistances, though; while a higher amount of Life allows them to take more punishment than gathering protection might some of the time, it is also much harder to replenish a great deal of said Life in the field. This last point is seen in an easier form if you choose to not go with a passive skill that grants a form of healing based on your Life. To name an example, a &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt; with skills like &lt;a href=\"War%20Cry%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Warcry&lt;/a&gt; could use the passive skill &lt;a href=\"Inspiring%20Presence\"&gt;Inspiring Presence&lt;/a&gt;, which grants him/her and nearby allies a bonus to Life Regeneration that improves as their Life maximum reaches new heights.\ns (and, to a minuscule extent, &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s who take the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Ritual\"&gt;Blood Ritual&lt;/a&gt; skill) can attune most of their skills to drain Life upon cast, in addition to normal &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt; cost, in exchange for empowered effect. This will never actually \"kill\" them, reducing to 1 Life instead or simply preventing the cast if not enough Life is available, but may leave the characters vulnerable to attack if overused. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20for%20Blood\"&gt;Blood for Blood&lt;/a&gt; skill can be used to sometimes remove the cost that would otherwise be drained from Life.\nNote that resource cost reduction effects will not reduce Life cost of skills that consume it (&lt;a href=\"Pylons\"&gt;Channeling Pylon&lt;/a&gt; being a notable exception). Moreover, Life costs of skills bypass \"all\" forms of protection (even damage immunities), unless specifically stated otherwise.\nThere are many ways to regain lost Life in Diablo III:"}

So 5% Life Stolen will return 5% of the damage that you do to a monster to your health as life, adjusted by the amount of Drain Effectiveness the monster has.\nThere are several &lt;a href=\"Suffix%23Life%20Stolen%20Per%20Hit\"&gt;magical suffixes&lt;/a&gt; that enable Life Steal, so the effect may occasionally be found on &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo I/Hellfire.\nLife Steal only works on melee attacks.\nLife steal is only available in 3 forms; 3% Life Steal, 5% Life Steal, and Life Stealing. The Life Stealing affix can only be found on &lt;a href=\"The%20Undead%20Crown\"&gt;The Undead Crown&lt;/a&gt; possessed by the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt;, but it offers 0-12.5% life stolen per hit, and stacks with life steal on the hero's weaponry. 3% Life Steal and 5% Life Steal however, cannot stack if a &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt; were to try to dual wield weapons with those suffixes. Only the most powerful of the combination applies.\nDiablo II/Lord of Destruction.\nLife and &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Steal\"&gt;Steal&lt;/a&gt; work on melee and physical ranged attacks.\nLife Steal gains some potency, and is generally among the affixes wanted by Melee and Ranged physical attack heroes alike. They can spawn on Weapons, Jewelry, Circlets, and Gloves. In the case of a hero possessing 2 weapons, such as a Barbarian or an Assassin dual wielding Claw-class weaponry, the life steal is specific to the weapon possessing that affix.\nSome things to keep in consideration about Life Steal:\nCan be found on:\nDiablo III/Reaper of Souls.\nLife Steal returned in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", although it was nerfed from Diablo II/Lord of Destruction. For one thing, the maximum life stealing possible was 6% from a Two-Handed Weapon, and 3% for all other sources. To complicate matters, only the Barbarians had access to another source of this: their Mighty Belts had the potential to roll life steal. This, in turn, lead to different legitimate caps of life stealing for different classes. From top to bottom they were:\nUnlike in Diablo II/Lord of Destruction, reaching a higher level penalizes a hero's effective Life Steal. Comparing to one who has just started his/her journey, life steal will be reduced to:\nThe restriction above was not planned until the pre-expansion patch, but before that point, this affix had too much staying power. As the game increased your healing power the higher your damage (DPS in the game's case) increased, this affix allowed a hero to ignore his Life, &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt; almost\" completely\". As long as the hero had enough to survive one major blow in endgame content, he/she was considered a fully qualified tank, but with much higher damaging capabilities. This was quickly spread and became the dominant force in all ingame builds, and the ones who played this style felt that this was the most efficient way to play, making others who never wished to use it feel as if they were 'gimped' players.\nAs a result, the effectiveness of Life Steal drops past level 60, and the moment a hero reaches level 70, it ceases to work at all, being replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Life%20on%20Hit\"&gt;Life on Hit&lt;/a&gt; stat wherever possible. Consequently, as of the pre-expansion patch, Life Steal has been made non-existent, with the notable exception of equipment found before the above mentioned patch. As a part of this change, all player skills that granted Life Steal in any way or returned part of damage inflicted as Life were either reworked to grant Life per Hit / Life per resource spent, removed entirely or limited to X% of maximum health per application.\nLife Steal on Monsters.\nHeroes should be warned, however, that they are not the only players who can steal life from their opponents. The following monsters were readily allowed access to life stealing:\nIn addition, in Diablo III/Reaper of Souls, Champion, Rare and Unique monsters could possess the &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Vampiric&lt;/a&gt; affix, which allowed them to heal while damaging the &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; in combat. Fortunately, this was the only source of monster healing in Diablo III, removed altogether in later patches, only some Unique monsters keeping it as a legacy trait."}

Unlike most \"on hit\" effects, Life per Hit requires hitting an enemy, not an object, and dealing any damage with that attack. This normally does not trigger off attacks from &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; and minions, attacks that deal no damage (e.g. using a non-damaging skill or hitting only an enemy affected by the &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20III%29%23Shielding\"&gt;Shielding&lt;/a&gt; immunity) and skills that do not interrupt normal casting, attacking and channeling (i.e. do not animate, like or &lt;a href=\"Overpower\"&gt;Overpower&lt;/a&gt;). Channeled attacks heal the character every attack period (that is, with 2 attacks per second, it will heal the player every 0.5 seconds). &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20time\"&gt;Damage over time&lt;/a&gt; attacks (like &lt;a href=\"Haunt\"&gt;Haunt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;) only heal the caster once, whenever the first enemy is initially affected, and do not heal the caster with continuous damage.\nLife per Hit can roll on rings, gloves, weapons, helms, amulets, and bracers. At level 70, maximum Life per Hit on a single item can be as high as 18,429 on legendary follower items, amulets or one-handed weapons (23,950 for ancient legendaries). Legendary two-handed weapons can have up to 27,644 (35,940 for ancient legendaries). Legendary rings, gloves, helms and bracers can have up to 9214 (11,975 for ancient legendaries). This allows a\u00a0maximum of 101,357 LpH from all items (131,725 with &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Legendary\"&gt;Ancient Legendary&lt;/a&gt; bonuses).

An &lt;a href=\"Amethyst\"&gt;Amethyst&lt;/a&gt; in a weapon &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt; also grants up to 28000 LpH. &lt;a href=\"Leech%20%28Demon%20Hunter%29\"&gt;Leech&lt;/a&gt; passive skill also adds up to 18507 Life per Hit (scales with level) for &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Demon Hunters&lt;/a&gt;.

It is the opposite of &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;s are said to be servants of the Light.\nVarious mortals are capable of using the Light. Individuals associated with its usage include &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Templar%20Order\"&gt;Templars&lt;/a&gt;. Some individuals are born with a natural affinity towards the Light. Usage of the Light grants mortals an array of abilities, including healing, resistance, and even share the Light's power with those around him/her via an aura. The spirits of the Light are ever vigilant, and in times of great need, have been known to aid their loyal disciples in subtle ways. Before using the powers of the Light however, a Paladin must submit to its glory. The Light rewards conviction, not dereliction.\nLight is anathema to the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Ellig%20Barrows\"&gt;Ellig Barrows&lt;/a&gt;, the Light is not a malignant force, but is vengeful against those who transgress against it. The Light cannot be used to harm the innocent. This is used to test true followers of the Light, or the innocence of an accused.\nThe Light is used by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s in various phrases, such as \"go with the Light,\" \"thank the Light,\" etc. The &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith states that an ember of Light exists in every human heart.\nLight can be stored in physical objects.\nHistory.\nIt is said that the concept of the Light was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yaerius\"&gt;Yaerius&lt;/a&gt;, who came to the ascetic &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt;. The teachings the angel imparted stressed the necessity of resisting all things evil, and embracing, with total devotion, the Light. The angel appointed Akarat to be the prophet of these new teachings, and bade him take the word to the people of all lands. Akarat's teachings of Zakara, or \"inner light,\" eventually gave rise to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith. Thus, worship of the Light became the dominant religion on Sanctuary, with few corners of the world untouched by its influence. The most basic tenet of Zakarum states that the Light exists in all mortals. Akarat believed (or claimed) that &lt;a href=\"the%20Ancients\"&gt;the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; embraced the Light wholeheartedly. The \"sign of the Light\" can be made in the air by followers of the Zakarum faith. Zakarum scripture states that an ember of Light exists in the heart of every human on Sanctuary, and only through faith and obedience can one's inner Light fight the darkness.

It is subject to &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;Immunities&lt;/a&gt; of the target. Lightning is typically depicted in light blue, yellow or white.\nCharacteristics.\nLightning damage is perhaps the most recognizable and feared out of the three elemental damage types seen in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo series&lt;/a&gt;. In\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\",\u00a0this is because of its extremely large damage range, sometimes ranging from a measly 1 to a player killing 2000. It is used by players who need to kill, but do not care even if the attack does almost no damage at all.\nLightning is used quite effectively by the Sorceress in her spells. The &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spells\"&gt;Lightning Spells&lt;/a&gt; tree is used by many &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es for quick and ruthless carnage. Another common source of massive lightning damage is the typical javazon with &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Fury\"&gt;Lightning Fury&lt;/a&gt; which is one of the most powerful skills for an amazon. Other mentionable lighning skills are &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Sentry\"&gt;Lightning Sentry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Sentry\"&gt;Death Sentry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Strike\"&gt;Phoenix Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Claws of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Strike\"&gt;Lightning Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Vengeance\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; deals a lot of lightning damage.\nBut what is perhaps the greatest threat to the player's life comes in the form of &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Lightning Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"unique%20monsters\"&gt;unique monsters&lt;/a&gt;, who have the ability to send sparks of flying when they are hit. The sheer number of these bolts, combined with the aforementioned high range of damage has been known to send players running for their lives, especially in &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;, where surviving matters. In earlier versions of the game, there was a chance of a unique monster spawning with the &lt;a href=\"Multi-shot\"&gt;Multi-shot&lt;/a&gt; bonus along with the Lightning Enchanted modifier, commonly called MSLE monsters in player lore. They were sure player killers at higher levels because the number of Charged Bolts tripled due to the Multi-shots modifier. This was deemed a bug, even though it was certainly legal according to game mechanics, and soon rectified by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; in a patch.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", all classes except &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s and s occasionally use Lightning damage, although s and &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s do so much more often. &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s from Lightning skills rupture the target, tearing it limb from limb as excessive power is arcing electrical charges. Many Lightning-based skills &lt;a href=\"Stun%20%28Mechanics%29\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; their targets.\nDespite being used by most classes and majority of &lt;a href=\"skill%20runes\"&gt;skill runes&lt;/a&gt;, Lightning damage is, ironically, the least prevalent damage type in game by default, as there are only five skills that use Lightning damage without a skill rune: &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Fists of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Electrocute\"&gt;Electrocute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Pulse\"&gt;Shock Pulse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Armor\"&gt;Storm Armor&lt;/a&gt; and .\n,\u00a0,\u00a0,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Point%20Shot\"&gt;Holy Point Shot&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0, &lt;a href=\"Odyn%20Son\"&gt;Odyn Son&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Crow\"&gt;Storm Crow&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Gesture%20of%20Orpheus\"&gt;Gesture of Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Won%20Khim%20Lau\"&gt;Won Khim Lau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Land%20Waders\"&gt;Swamp Land Waders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; are the items with unconventional bonus to Lightning skills damage. &lt;a href=\"Xephirian%20Amulet\"&gt;Xephirian Amulet&lt;/a&gt; will render the character completely immune to Lightning damage (the attacks will actually \"heal\" &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;).\nLightning damage is featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of &lt;a href=\"legendary\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; essences, &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt;s or . Lightning is usually chained (ie, it extends from the target to a nearby monster, and another in a chain). Some skills also inflict &lt;a href=\"Shock\"&gt;Shock&lt;/a&gt;: lightning &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt;, and increased damage from subsequent lightning attacks.\nNotable users.\nAlmost all Lightning Enchanted monsters are remembered in some form by players. A vast majority of players have been killed at least once by the aforementioned LE unique monsters. This makes them a very feared variety of enemies in the realms, feared almost as much as &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;other players themselves&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut the game itself is not without its fair share of Lightning Enchanted super uniques. The &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20One\"&gt;Carver&lt;/a&gt; lord, &lt;a href=\"Rakanishu\"&gt;Rakanishu&lt;/a&gt; is the first Lightning Enchanted boss encountered by most players. He does not pack quite a mean punch nor is he quite notable. But having to hear his name being recited by all kinds of as some sort of battle-cry makes him very notable.\nBesides Rakanishu, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20Member\"&gt;Council Member&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bremm%20Sparkfist\"&gt;Bremm Sparkfist&lt;/a&gt; was also a user of Lightning as his name implies. But he was severely nerfed in a patch that made him &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Enchanted\"&gt;Cold Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; making his name almost irrelevant to his powers. Although he was reverted to Lightning Enchanted in later patches.\nThough not a Lightning Enchanted Boss, the Lord of Terror himself, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; uses Lightning in one of his most dreaded signature attacks, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Lightning%20Hose\"&gt;Red Lightning Hose&lt;/a&gt;. He fires the -like stream of red death with a deadly combination of Lightning and Physical damage, very unusual for a ranged attack. But nonetheless, it still has players fleeing from it when it is used.\n&lt;a href=\"Shumbeel\"&gt;Shumbeel&lt;/a&gt;, one of Diablo's greatest servants, is also notable for its usage of lightning. During the &lt;a href=\"Terror%27s%20Tide\"&gt;siege of Stormpoint&lt;/a&gt;, it rained down torrents of lightning from the sky upon &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint\"&gt;the island's&lt;/a&gt; defenders as it flew by.\n&lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;'s attacks use the Lightning damage as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Saarodan\"&gt;Saarodan&lt;/a&gt; is another demon known for using lightning. His mastery over the elements earned him the moniker, \"Sky-Sunderer\"."}

Firstly, the charged bolts can deal a tremendous amount of damage to a player per bolt. Secondly, if positioned poorly, the player is going to be hit by multiple bolts more often than not. This can be a surefire way to kill off a hero, and is one of the reasons why stacking Lightning resistance could be considered a priority. Melee heroes should fight these monsters with the highest damaging weaponry available. This results in less hits needed, which does help minimize the amount of charged bolts they release. Heroes using ranged weaponry and/or skills are allowed a larger window of opportunity to move out of the way, preventing an overdose of lightning damage. Another surefire way to help reduce damage is through&lt;a href=\"%20Absorption\"&gt; Absorption&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Demon\"&gt;Scarab Demon&lt;/a&gt;s naturally have this bonus.

The High Priestess of Zerae will teach select Amazons the secret of focusing the power of the goddess, consecrating a javelin to become the ultimate weapon of vengeance. The energy contained within the javelin is so powerful that its electrical energy explodes from its stricken target, releasing bolts of lightning that strike down hapless foes nearby. Swift and powerful is the justice administered by an eminent Amazon. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nLightning Fury is thrown as a single projectile, and subsequently releases a set number of lightning bolts towards each of the surrounding monsters when a monster or solid object is hit with this spell. The maximum number of bolts increases with skill level. The minimum number of bolts is determined by the amount of monsters in close proximity to the one being targeted.\nLightning Fury applies only to thrown &lt;a href=\"javelins\"&gt;javelins&lt;/a&gt;, so equipping a &lt;a href=\"Spears\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; will not allow casting this spell.\nIf the javelin goes through the initial target (possible through investment into the &lt;a href=\"Pierce\"&gt;Pierce&lt;/a&gt; Skill and/or obtaining other sources of pierce, such as the &lt;a href=\"Razortail\"&gt;Razortail&lt;/a&gt; unique belt or &lt;a href=\"Wisdom%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Wisdom Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;) then the javelin releases bolts again upon hitting the next hard surface(s).\nThis skill is excellent for crowd control due to its power and accuracy, although it is lacking when confronted with single, more powerful enemies. It is a staple ranged attack of most &lt;a href=\"Javazon\"&gt;Javazon&lt;/a&gt; builds."}

While the priest urged them to resist Lilith, Vani took a Cathedral emblem and bashed him in the head. The priest pleaded to her, reminding Vani that he'd helped deliver her child. However, Vani and the townsfolk continued to assault the priest as Lilith left. They placed the headless body in &lt;a href=\"Icehowl%20Ruins\"&gt;Icehowl Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Iosef\"&gt;Iosef&lt;/a&gt; later found it.

The Wanderer succeeded, to Vani's apparent surprise. She posed a celebration with the other villagers in order to drug the Wanderer.

Her words drove the people mad, turning them against the priests. Cormond begged Varshan to flee, but he refused to abandon his flock, and as such, Cormond left him behind. By the time Cormond returned, Varshan was the only one left in the village, and had been driven mad by Lilith. Cormond found him in the &lt;a href=\"Velkhova%20Church%20Undercroft\"&gt;church undercroft&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo remove Lilith's corruption, Cormond used a &lt;a href=\"Cage%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Cage of Binding&lt;/a&gt; on him in an attempt to remove the corruption, but something went wrong. The corruption within Varshan burst out of him. Consumed his body and &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, and in so doing, turned him into the first Malignant.\nVarshan spread Malignancy to everyone he touched. He apparently had some level of intellect left, as he pursued Cormond to &lt;a href=\"Orbei%20Monastery\"&gt;Orbei Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. He rampaged through the upper levels before crashing into the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Records\"&gt;Hall of Records&lt;/a&gt;. Cormond fled, and Varshan battled . The Wanderer defeated Varshan, but when they used a Cage of Binding upon Varshan's &lt;a href=\"Malignant%20Heart\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, the cage exploded and Varshan escaped in wisp-like form. The cage failed due to Varshan's power.\nLater, Varshan was summoned to the Velkhova Church undercroft through a ritual conducted by Cormond and the Wanderer. Like in Orbei, the Wanderer defeated Varshan. This time however, the Wanderer used a more advanced Cage of Binding, destroying Varshan's heart and ending his life. With Varshan's &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, it marked the beginning of the end for the Malignant. \nCormond continued to make Cages of Binding to help the remaining Malignant find peace. He believed Varshan would rest easier for it.\nIn-game.\nVarshan was the &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Malignant\"&gt;Season of the Malignant&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".

Those who refuse to follow his orders were killed.\nOver the years, Vataos had a reign of terror against &lt;a href=\"Shassar\"&gt;Shassar&lt;/a&gt;'s scattered people.

She was able to wound him, but disappearing in a puff of smoke, Vataos escaped before she could deliver the killing blow.\nThe Scepter of Fahir ended up in Tabri's hands, which made Vataos desperate. The Sand Scorpions began searching for a weapon to counter the scepter's power. However, events played in the Scorpions' favor, as when the Amber Blades attacked, they drove them back, forcing the Blades to retreat into the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, Tabri left the Blades to search for Vataos, and using a &lt;a href=\"terminus\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt;, ended up in a &lt;a href=\"Obliterated%20Realm\"&gt;realm beyond Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. However, Vataos followed her through the portal, engaging her in combat. \nVataos was able to claim the scepter and wound Tabri, but was immediately confronted by the Shard-seeker, who defeated him and took the scepter. However, still alive, he attacked Tabri as she and the Shard-seeker sought to leave. He and Tabri remained locked in deadly embrace as the structure collapsed around them. Back in the Library of Zoltun Kulle, the terminus portal closed, leaving their fates unclear.\nIn-game.\nVataos appears in the \"&lt;a href=\"Fahir%27s%20Legacy\"&gt;Fahir's Legacy&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

She was one of the attendants of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Verathiel would sing of creation to the Worldstone, and with it, worlds and life were born of the dreams of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;.\nVerathiel despaired when the Worldstone was stolen on her watch. To atone for her shame, she brought steel and death to the enemies of heaven. When the heavens discovered &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Verathiel asked her mistress for them to invade Sanctuary and retrieve the Worldstone, but Auriel refused, as she wanted peace.\nUtterly relentless, Verathiel was the leader of a group of angel sentinels. They discovered the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Realm of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; as it was taking shape. Cut off from the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, they carved out &lt;a href=\"the%20Last%20Vestige\"&gt;a foothold&lt;/a&gt; in the realm, battling &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s over the eons.\nEventually, her cadre was overwhelmed and she was imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Baron%20of%20Pestilence\"&gt;Baron of Pestilence&lt;/a&gt; for an unknown amount of time. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; encountered her and freed her with the help of &lt;a href=\"Yl%27nira\"&gt;Yl'nira&lt;/a&gt; after killing the Baron. With the help of the dagger, she was able to cleanse the area and turn it to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Vestige\"&gt;a foothold&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Shard-seeker's aid, she was able to free two &lt;a href=\"Andalon\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mikayel\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the &lt;a href=\"Shaddox\"&gt;third one&lt;/a&gt; was already corrupted and had to be killed. She then learnt that &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; was extracting the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; to create demons in &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;pits&lt;/a&gt;. Together with the Shard-seeker they were able to destroy the pits. \nShe was one of the angels that created a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Skarn%27s%20Throne\"&gt;Skarn's Throne&lt;/a&gt; for the Shard-seeker to battle him. She then had to rush in to save the Shard-seeker from the resurrected spirit of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; but the portal, now unstable closed behind her. Unfortunately, Diablo overpowered her, and her &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Verathiel\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; fell into the depths of Hell.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;Two years later&lt;/a&gt;, Verathiel was held captive and tortured by Diablo. He projected an image of her suffering to the Shard-seeker in order to taunt them, and show them the price of defiance.\nThe Unmaking.\nAs Diablo's plans neared completion, he moved his forces (including Verathiel) to the World's Crown. Diablo devised a plan to unmake Sanctuary, and for that, he needed her &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt;. Verathiel still had steadfast faith in the High Heavens even after years of torture so Diablo shifted his efforts to psychological means. He reminded her of the failure of her mistress and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; to rescue her from the Realm of Damnation even twisting the Shard-seeker's actions as abandoning her after they had no more use for her. In the height of her despair he offered her a chance to \"atone\" for her greatest sin; a chance to sing to the Worldstone once again. With that, Verathiel's will broke.\nShe was then moved to &lt;a href=\"Crater%20of%20Unmaking\"&gt;a large crater&lt;/a&gt; and chained to a monolith. The &lt;a href=\"Bride%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Bride of Hell&lt;/a&gt; would occasionally come by to corrupt her angelsong. \nDiablo's ritual for the Unmaking was an imitation of Sanctuary's creation, and required the power of an angel, a demon and creation. He forced Verathiel to sing, with the Worldstone shard and the monolith amplifying her song in potency and range. As each note travelled, it turned all living in its path to ash, and unraveled Sanctuary in its wake. \nVerathiel's Fate.\nDiablo left her after the Unmaking had been set in motion. The Shard-seeker (who survived the Song of Unmaking because of &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt;'s protection) later arrived at the monolith. Verathiel attacked them, hoping for her anguish to end.\nIn-game.\nVerathiel is the &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; companion for the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Realm of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; storyline quests in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". Verathiel makes a brief appearance in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Open%20Revolt\"&gt;Open Revolt&lt;/a&gt;\". She returns in the \"&lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shattered Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;\" update, where she's the boss of the \"&lt;a href=\"Resounding%20Discord\"&gt;Resounding Discord&lt;/a&gt;\" quest. After defeating her, the player makes a choice to either spare or kill her.

Finding the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Vault\"&gt;Horadric Vault&lt;/a&gt; was her life's work. Neyrelle wanted to know why things were the way they were, and Vhenard told her that the Horadrim had the answers.\nThey explored old ruins and read old texts, and in the process, Neyrelle learnt all manner of information pertaining to the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. Vhenard felt guilt over dragging her daughter all over the world in her search, but was able to rationalize it, later claiming that she'd done it to teach Neyrelle how to survive.\nDuring this period, Vhenard was aware of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. She apparently believed (to at least some extent) the Church's claims about the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;. She was likewise aware of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; to some extent.\nA Cold and Iron Faith.\nIn Her Wake.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, Vhenard and Neyrelle came to &lt;a href=\"Yelesna\"&gt;Yelesna&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. To Neyrelle's surprise, Vhenard suddenly ran off. Unknowingly in the company of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, Vhenard used a wealth charm to bribe a &lt;a href=\"Vigo\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; stationed at &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Hill\"&gt;Pine Hill&lt;/a&gt; to grant them entry to the &lt;a href=\"Windfall%20Hollow\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; beyond. The knight obliged, and Vhenard and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Penitent\"&gt;Knights Penitent&lt;/a&gt; entourage entered.\nBeneath the mines lay the ancient &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Kasama\"&gt;Kasama&lt;/a&gt;. When Vhenard and the entourage entered, Lilith revealed herself as the \"Mother of Sanctuary,\" and slew the knights. In that moment, despite the horror unfolding before her, Vhenard knew Lilith's words were true.\nVhenard begged for her life, and Lilith spared her, leading her further into the city. With her sanity already deteriorating, Vhenard used chalk to record their journey through Kasama, which as they soon saw, had murals depicting the history of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. Lilith explained that the war had been waged since the beginning of time, as &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s battled for control of Creation. Vhenard asked to what end, and Lilith simply laughed.\nFurther in, Lilith spoke to Vhenard directly. She claimed that Vhenard had always pursued knowledge, and had dragged Neyrelle all over Sanctuary to get it. Vhenard protested that she'd taught Neyrelle how to survive, but Lilith told her to drop the act, and stated that Vhenard had questions, she had answers, and she was willing to provide them. While everything Vhenard had read warned her against Lilith, she nevertheless succumbed to the demon's temptations. \nAs they made their way through Kasama, Lilith continued to tell Vhenard the history of Sanctuary, and Vhenard continued to scribble in chalk. Lilith told her of her seduction of &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, which made Vhenard note that despite her earlier beliefs, Inarius was clearly not infallible. She told her of how she and Inarius had created Sanctuary, confirming her earlier claims to be the world's \"mother.\" She further told Vhenard of the &lt;a href=\"Firstborn\"&gt;Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, and most pertinently, &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;; the son she and Inarius had birthed born together. His lair, she explained, lay further within the city.\nThe two pressed on. Vhenard wondered why she was spared, and when asked by Lilith if she had faith in her, murmured that she wanted to have faith in her. Lilith simply commented that they were going to meet with Rathma. As they moved through the &lt;a href=\"Cradle\"&gt;Cradle&lt;/a&gt;, Vhenard continued to scribble her chalk writings. &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; would later speculate that Vhenard had written these things at least in part to justify her actions to Neyrelle. He suspected that some part of Vhenard must have known and feared what others would think of her actions.\nVhenard still missed Neyrelle, and Lilith noticed. The Daughter of Hatred gave Vhenard a final choice; go, or stay. Vhenard cast her lot with the demon, rationalizing that Neyrelle would be fine without her. Pleased, Lilith explained that they were heading for a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the ruins, and it would require a ritual to pass over. Now fully enthralled by Lilith, Vhenard noted in her scribblings that whereas once she'd believed in the Horadrim, they could not be the saviors of Sanctuary. Lilith, however, would make humanity victors.\nThe pair reached the &lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Shore\"&gt;Mourning Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Lilith had Vhenard assist in a ritual where they sacrificed a priest from the original escort. Vhenard's role was to cut the priest's neck, and he had no fight left in him. With the holy blessing from the priest's &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;, Lilith was able to cross the Black Lake to enter the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Necropolis of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;. Vhenard, twisted by Lilith's influence to the point of insanity, was left on the shore. She continued to draw symbols with her chalk, desperate to join Lilith, and when the chalk was reduced to its last nub, she began to draw in her own blood.\nIt was in this state that Vhenard was found by Neyrelle and , both of whom had followed the path she and Lilith had taken through Kasama. Neyrelle begged her mother to leave with them, but in her insanity, Vhenard believed that her daughter was trying to lure her away so she could take the trove in the Necropolis for herself. Using the dark gifts Lilith had bestowed upon her, Vhenard summoned demons to attack her daughter and companion. In the ensuing fight, the demons were killed, and Vhenard gave out, dying seconds later.\nLegacy.\nVhenard was buried in &lt;a href=\"Mistral%20Woods\"&gt;Mistral Woods&lt;/a&gt;, outside the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Vault\"&gt;Horadric Vault&lt;/a&gt;. Neyrelle reasoned that as finding the vault had been her life's work, she would want to be buried nearby.\nVhenard's last piece of chalk made it into Lorath's hands. He reflected that Vhenard's record might have been an attempt at justifying her actions, but instead, her writings only confirmed how far she had fallen. The piece of chalk he now held was now a cursed token of her madness and denial. Vhenard had joined the ranks of those who were desperate to tell their own tales, who knew there would be others who told them, who sought to have the final word. Often, these attempts were in vain, and Vhenard was no different. She was among the countless others who had been enthralled by Lilith over the history of Sanctuary.\nVessel of Hatred.\nAs Neyrelle approaches &lt;a href=\"the%20River%20Gate\"&gt;the River Gate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;, her body is wracked by tremors caused by &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. In a moment of distraction, the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; floats in front of her and puts her in an illusion. There Mephisto took the visage of Vhenard to catch her off guard and convince her to give up control.\nIn-game.\nVhenard appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" in Kasama. She is fought as a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; at the conclusion of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cost%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;The Cost of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the fight, Vhenard can't be harmed herself, but instead summons numerous &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to attack the player. The fight goes through four phases, each being more intense than the last. After her death and the quest's conclusion, the player is gifted &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Knife\"&gt;Mother's Knife&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was also known as Daivin the Adventurer in his human disguise.\nBiography.\nThe Eternal Conflict.\nVidian was once one of &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sin%20Lieutenants\"&gt;Sin Lieutenants&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Azmodan's other lieutenants, Vidian seldom obeyed the commands of his master, though during those times that he did, he had a talent for sowing discord and disorder among the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt;, which cost the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s at least one battle during the course of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood of the Nephalem.\nAt some point after &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s fall, Vidian took up residence in the Temple of the Firstborn. At some point after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, Vidian's presence, new or otherwise, became noted, as the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; learnt of something stirring beneath the &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Moors\"&gt;Shrouded Moors&lt;/a&gt;. A newly formed &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Cult\"&gt;Blood Cult&lt;/a&gt; took up residence in the temple, and at Vidian's direction, they twisted the flesh of mortals and bent creatures to their ill will. Their particular prey were the newly emergent &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, whose blood and power Vidian and the cult desired for themselves, and who they ensnared at times of vulnerability. Vidian personally led more than one adventurer into the temple's depths to die.\nIn what would be his last attempt at beguilement, Vidian encountered &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; in the Shrouded Moors, to whom he posed as a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; named \"Daivin the Adventurer.\" He offered to join the hero(es) as they made their way through the moors. After the Nephalem destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Statue\"&gt;Blood Statue&lt;/a&gt;, Daivin commented that they may have brought bad luck upon themselves.\nUpon entering an &lt;a href=\"The%20Excavation\"&gt;excavation&lt;/a&gt; above the temple, Daivin was imprisoned in a cage of bone by &lt;a href=\"Theodosius%20Jordan\"&gt;Theodosius Jordan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 one of the cultists who had taken up residence in the temple. The Nephalem slew the cultist, but Daivin was apparently killed and torn apart by the cage. In what was apparently his last moments, Daivin asked the Nephalem to not fail him.\nAt the bottom of the temple, \"Daivin\" appeared to the Nephalem a final time. He taunted his foe(s) before assuming his true form of Vidian, Lord of Envy. He engaged the Nephalem in battle, while summoning fellow demons to his side. As the fight progressed, he mocked the Nephalem's allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. It came to naught, as Vidian was slain.\nIn-game.\nVidian appears in the &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", where he takes on two forms. His first is as \"Daivin the Adventurer\" - Daivin being an anagram of his true name - who functions as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; until The Excavation, although he does not do much in combat.\nHe later appears as a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, within the Sanctum of Blood area (accessed from Level 2). The fight will occur in a square arena without any objects or obstacles.\nVidian is a greatly empowered &lt;a href=\"Reborn\"&gt;Reborn&lt;/a&gt;:\nAt 25% life Vidian will stand in place and fire red bolts at you. He will also spawn Red Vermins to attack you. Stay back from Vidian and keep killing the Red Vermins to rack up kills. Vidian's red bolt attacks will continue to reset the fuse on your massacare bonus. If you have the &lt;a href=\"Azurewrath%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Azurewrath&lt;/a&gt; equipped or in the Cube, you can just stand still and let the Red vermins kill themselves racking up more kills for your Massacare Bonus. When you are done killing them, run up to Vidian and kill him via the Azurewrath and attacks.\nVidian is also present as &lt;a href=\"Vesalius\"&gt;Vesalius&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. In this version, he focuses on damaging abilities rather than &lt;a href=\"minions\"&gt;minions&lt;/a&gt;."}

He had his doubts as to their claims.\nA Cold and Iron Faith.\nThe Knight and the Magpie.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, Vigo was stationed at &lt;a href=\"Yelesna\"&gt;Yelesna&lt;/a&gt;. where he received word of the sighting of a &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;horned demon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gale%20Valley\"&gt;Gale Valley&lt;/a&gt;. He performed a routine inspection, found nothing, and sent in a priest and escort of knights into the mines to investigate. He wrote a report and sent it to Reverend Mother &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;. \nHaving reported the demon, Vigo continued with his gambling habits. In one might, he lost an entire month's wages. The next day, while on guard duty at the mines, he was approached by &lt;a href=\"Vhenard\"&gt;Vhenard&lt;/a&gt; (alongside another woman and an escort of knights) who gave him a wealth charm in exchange for entry. Vigo agreed, and when he gambled that night, found that the wealth charm apparently worked. The day after that, however, Vhenard's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt;, arrived, pestering him about the demon sighting. He told her that he'd already reported it, but she refused to give up. He headed to mines, knowing that Neyrelle would break in if he wasn't on duty.\nVigo's intuition was well founded; no sooner had he met a &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, Neyrelle turned up at the mine entrance, much to Vigo's annoyance. Neyrelle once again pestered him about her mother and the demon, Vigo responded that they had soldiers inside the mines. The Wanderer told Vigo that &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt; had sent them (much to Vigo's fear), and that the demon Neyrelle spoke of was &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. Relenting, Vigo opened the mines, and the trio headed in. With the ore hoist stuck, they had to descend on foot. During the journey, Neyrelle spotted her mother's wealth charm on Vigo's wrist. Vigo explained that Neyrelle had given it to him, omitting that he'd taken it as a bribe. \nBecause the hoist was stuck, the trio had to make their way through a &lt;a href=\"Condemned%20Mines\"&gt;condemned section&lt;/a&gt; of the mines; a section that Prava had insisted no-one enter, though Vigo didn't know why. Vigo suggested that they return to Pine Hill to gather knights from the garrison, but Neyrelle refused, not wanting to leave her mother in Lilith's company any longer than necessary. After coming to a locked door, Neyrelle was able to crawl through a nearby hole to reach the other side, unlocking it, while Vigo and the Wanderer held off attacking &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s. The trio made it through the mines, but with the mines collapsed behind them, and the ore hoist inoperative, Vigo lamented they were trapped. Heading deeper into the earth, they found themselves in the shadow of a &lt;a href=\"Firstborn\"&gt;buried civilization&lt;/a&gt;, one clearly not made by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; hands.\nFurther down, they found the ore hoist; its gears had been jammed by a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;, hence why they weren't able to operate it further above. The Wanderer removed the corpse, allowing the hoist platform to descend, but Vigo noted that the demon had been killed by something, and wondered what had happened. He concluded they needed reinforcements, but before they could discuss the matter, they heard a groan. Heading through the gate into the city, they found the corpses of the knights that had accompanied Lilith and Vhenard into the mines. One, &lt;a href=\"Grendan\"&gt;Grendan&lt;/a&gt;, was still alive, however barely, and told Vigo that Lilith had slaughtered them (all save Lilith, who had followed the demon into the city after being spared). Grendan begged Vigo to tell the Cathedral what had happened before succumbing to his wounds.\nVigo was aghast, in that not only had he trusted Vhenard, but that through his actions, his fellow knights were dead. Neyrelle wanted to press on, insisting her mother could still be saved, but Vigo refused, and departed the mines to head for &lt;a href=\"Kor%20Valar\"&gt;Kor Valar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPilgrimage.\nAt Kor Valar, Vigo told Prava what had happened at the mines. Unimpressed, Prava dismissed him from the fortress keep, and many inside the fortress resented him for what he'd allowed to happen. He oversaw the cremation of his fellow knights that had perished at Lilith's hand, before reuniting with the Wanderer. The pair entered the keep together, where the Wanderer told Prava that they needed a divine blessing to pursue Lilith. Prava told the Wanderer to make a pilgrimage to &lt;a href=\"Alabaster%20Monastery\"&gt;Alabaster Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, and to this end, Vigo told the Wanderer to meet him at the ruins south of Kor Valar.\nVigo met with the Wanderer outside the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Light\"&gt;College of Light&lt;/a&gt;. He instructed them on how to take the pilgrimage that would \"cleanse\" them for their meeting with Inarius. However, Vigo wouldn't take the pilgrimage himself, for in his mind, he wasn't ready for it. The Wanderer departed, and Vigo headed for the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Penitent\"&gt;Shrine of the Penitent&lt;/a&gt;, where he prayed for his own salvation. However, he found none, and while he didn't consider himself a sinner, he was weighed down by the knights who were dead because he'd accepted Vhenard's bribe. It was here that he reunited with the Wanderer as they completed their pilgrimage. He wished them well, warning them that not everyone returned from a meeting with Inarius.\nVigo returned to Kor Valar where he and Prava had a \"good conversation.\" He agreed to do his penance, which meant being sealed inside a suit of &lt;a href=\"Penitent%20Armor\"&gt;Penitent Armor&lt;/a&gt; and becoming a &lt;a href=\"Dreadknight\"&gt;Dreadknight&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescent.\nVigo assists the playing character in the battle with &lt;a href=\"Lilith%27s%20Lament\"&gt;Lilith's Lament&lt;/a&gt; boss fight, ultimately dying due to the wounds inflicted by the armor. \nLegacy.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; heard of what had befallen Vigo. He wrote that the knight had been a gambler and a fool, and however unintentional, had played a role in the suffering Lilith inflicted. However, he also noted that to Vigo's credit, the realization of his error gave Vigo the drive he needed for redemption. Lorath speculated that Vigo believed that he died for his sins, but also believed that Vigo could have survived Lilith's Lament in standard armor rather than the Penitent Armor he wore. Yet if he had done so, would he have found redemption in life rather than in death?\nLorath couldn't answer, and nor could the dead.\nIn-game.\nVigo appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" in . He aids the player on two occasions.\nThe first is in the &lt;a href=\"Condemned%20Mines\"&gt;Condemned Mines&lt;/a&gt;, where he attacks with a sword and shield. He also has a &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-esque barrier ability that he can generate in front of him, negating any attacks that come its way.\nThe second is in the Lilith's Lament boss fight, where he wields Penitent Armor. He is able to generate a sphere barrier that the player must (or at least should) take cover under to avoid the boss's area-of-effect attacks. After his death, he drops &lt;a href=\"Vigo%27s%20Protecting%20Amulet\"&gt;Vigo's Protecting Amulet&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond this, Vigo is found as the questline dictates, such as &lt;a href=\"Kor%20Valar\"&gt;Kor Valar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Light\"&gt;College of Light&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Penitent\"&gt;Shrine of the Penitent&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nA gambler, Vigo enjoyed playing cards, and wasn't particularly devout. Lorath considered him to possibly be a fool, given how easily he was swayed by Vhenard and Lilith. However, Vigo valued the lives of those under his command. "}

In his need, the weight of the world lifts from his shoulders, allowing him to march forth without heed to the lamentations of his body.\"\nGeneral Information.\nVigor increases run/walk speed and stamina regeneration for the user and nearby allies. It is a useful skill for retrieving corpses after dying, escaping from tough enemies, and exploring in general.\u00a0It also may be used in town to get to the vendors faster and save time between battles.\u00a0In battle with very fast foes that require a lot of evasion, its use may be situationally helpful, but this comes of the cost of using other, potentially more combat-oriented auras.\nThe increase in speed provided by Vigor is separate from &lt;a href=\"Faster%20Run/Walk\"&gt;Faster Run/Walk&lt;/a&gt; modifier in that it does not suffer from the diminishing returns Faster Run/Walk is subject to. No matter how high players' Faster Run/Walk is, Vigor always increases their speed by a set amount.\nVigor suffers from diminishing returns after 5 points or so in terms of increased run/walk speed, and even a level 1 vigor typically grants enough stamina and stamina regeneration to never run empty, so when used as a utility spell, it is often best to put one point into vigor and let +skill gear do the rest. &lt;a href=\"Hammerdin\"&gt;Hammerdin&lt;/a&gt;s, however, typically max out this skill to make the most out of their &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Hammer\"&gt;Blessed Hammer&lt;/a&gt;s thanks to the synergy. Vigor increases Blessed Hammer damage more than &lt;a href=\"Concentration\"&gt;Concentration&lt;/a&gt;, and so it's better to max it first, unless the hammerdin is specifically playing consistently with many other physical damage dealers.\nThere is also an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; that gives this Aura: the &lt;a href=\"runeword\"&gt;runeword&lt;/a&gt; ."}

In the last Vision, a special &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt; drops a &lt;a href=\"Diabolic%20Hoard\"&gt;Diabolic Hoard&lt;/a&gt; reward chest. It contains a significant amount of loot, scaling with the number of Visions cleared, and including a fairly large number of the crafting materials normally found from &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; reward caches (an equal amount of all five types). There is no way to tell how long the chain will be until the last one.\nOpening the Hoard starts a 30 second timer to finish looting before the Visions disappear. Any character still inside them when the timer expires will be teleported to &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Echoing%20Nightmare\"&gt;Echoing Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Before the Vision closes, players may return to where they had been in the normal game world by working backwards through all the vision levels, although this is unfeasible in longer Vision chains. If they do not, they must travel back to where they were from town.\nDiabolical Fissures can occur quite frequently. For example, while completing the &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;, assuming a reasonable number of monsters are killed along the way, it is more likely than not that one or even several will open. The Fissures appear on the &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;, with an arrow pointing to them if far away. The Act map does not show them, however, so players must remember for themselves where to find it if they do not enter immediately. Only one Vision sequence can be open at a time in a game, so if a player chooses to continue adventuring in the normal game world without looting the Hoard from an open Vision, no other portals will appear.\nLevels and maps.\nThere are 15 maps possible for any Vision. They are mostly recreations of small, recognizable zones or areas from the \"Diablo III\" &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;, but with a different name, and eerie blue glowing cracks in the terrain. They range from as small as &lt;a href=\"The%20Ram\"&gt;The Ram&lt;/a&gt; to as large as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tristram\"&gt;Old Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. The Visions in a sequence never repeat maps, so the longest possible sequence will have each of the 15 maps one time. The maps can occur in any order.\nEach map has a set location the hero enters from, either a red portal or one of the area's normal exits. The blue portal to the next Vision depends on where the monster happens to spawn it. Other exits normally present in the real world are all locked or blocked.\nEach Vision is populated with one of four categories of monsters:\nThe exact number of monsters is also based on which map they appear in, although Rift Guardians always come in threes. In addition, regardless of the rest of the monsters, there is always either one normal monster which creates the next Diabolical Fissure, or one Treasure Goblin which drops the Diabolic Hoard that ends the Vision sequence.\nList of maps.\nEach map has a special name related to the role or flavor the area plays in the regular world or campaign.\nMonsters.\nThe exact type of monsters present in a Vision varies widely, but any one level tends to have monsters that appear near each other in the normal game world. It is not correlated to which Vision map is present on the level.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt; in the final Vision in a sequence is special - it will \"never\" escape, so the player can easily focus on the other monsters before killing it, even leaving and re-entering the zone if desired. It will still try to run away within the current level.\nVisions full of &lt;a href=\"Champion%20monsters\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; packs can be deadly. They are very densely grouped on most maps, so many different packs may start out right next to the player, and even walking a short distance can unavoidably engage several packs at once. Players will therefore face multiple attacks and instances of &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Skill\"&gt;Monster Skill&lt;/a&gt;s like Thunderstorm and Wallers simultaneously, beyond anything encountered in the normal world.\nThe Treasure Goblin levels will have a mix of varieties, excluding &lt;a href=\"Rainbow%20Goblin\"&gt;Rainbow Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s. They will try to escape through portals as usual, but still must be engaged first (by attacking or moving near them), so depending on the level it is possible to deal with them in groups. They are quite densely populated just like the other levels, so players will certainly have to engage multiple at once, but the rewards are impressive."}

This opens the possibility of a Two-handed weapon hero at close range.\nDiablo II/Lord of Destruction.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Vitality again determines how much Life a character has, but now also determines the quantity of &lt;a href=\"Stamina\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; that a character has.\nVitality can be increased by magical items, but even so, it is still the character's class that determines how much Life is given to the character. The Stamina regeneration rate also increases with more points.\nThe bonus to Life per point in Vitality by class is:\nAll classes receive +1 Stamina per Vitality with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; who gets +1.25 instead.\nPlayers who plan on using items that give bonuses to their Vitality might want to be warned that the Life obtained from those bonuses will \"not\" be affected by items/skills that give +% Life. For example, a Werebear Druid normally has +190% Life from a maxed out Lycanthropy. This would normally give him slightly less than 6 Life per point into Vitality. However, if the same Druid were to apply anything with +Vitality, like the unique charm &lt;a href=\"Annihilus\"&gt;Annihilus&lt;/a&gt;, the bonus Life he'd get from the enchantments will only be 2 per point.\nDiablo III.\nVitality returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", once again as the stat that determines a character's Life. The effects are small at only 10 Life per point initially, but the gains begin to increase in value depending on the following level ranges:\nIt should be noted that Classic players can only go up to the level cap of 60. Thus, they must upgrade to the expansion if they wish more gains out of their Vitality, or gather equipment that gives a % bonus to total Life.\nOne may increase Vitality through finding equipment that offers affixes that specifically increase that stat. &lt;a href=\"Amethyst\"&gt;Amethyst&lt;/a&gt; gems will also offer Vitality if they are placed in a socket that is not a weapon or helm socket; up to +280 per gem. The &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; system also allows all players to place their Core points into Vitality, with no cap other than what is allowed by their Paragon level.\nUpon leveling up in the normal system, all players gain +2 Vitality, no matter their specializations."}

Once he could no longer sleep, he painted the tenebrous &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; he saw in his dreams. Vithu's paintings were adored throughout the provinces, and many called him a seer. Patrons chased the sublimity of his feelings. In one year, a dozen leaping &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;s from the heights were recorded in &lt;a href=\"Fengge\"&gt;Fengge&lt;/a&gt;. Vithu was consumed by guilt and left Fengge, vowing to paint no more. A year later he was visited by a young girl asking for his work, with a penknife held unsteadily in her hand. Vithu opened his door with downcast eyes, certain that she had come for revenge. He was shocked when she begged to be his apprentice.\nThe girl, &lt;a href=\"Miray\"&gt;Miray&lt;/a&gt;, confessed that she imagined the Void years ago, and drew it for her parents. If Vithu was guilty of their deaths, she was as well. But she preferred to blame the Void. Vithu accepted Miray's apprenticeship, and they painted the Void in new colors, undeniable but robbed of all its power. Eventually, Vithu was surpassed by his student in talent, which aroused fury in him towards her. He painted the void in deep colors on her ceiling which immediately began to darken.

The Order remains veiled in secrecy, and few people, even among the Mage Clans, know of its existence. However, the mere rumor of their existence has been enough to prevent many mages from falling into temptation.\nAbilities.\nKnowing that the Order might be itself corrupted if exposed to magic, the Vizjerei deemed that the Assassins would have to possess the purest, most focused minds, that they should draw their power from within, not without. As such, the Order does not employ magic directly. Rather, Assassins use ingenious devices and enchanted items to battle those possessing great magical powers. To further their campaign against demonic corruption, they hone the natural martial abilities of their bodies, both physical and mental/psychic. They train extensively in the use of a specialised type of weapon\u2014special blades that are attached to their wrists, which are used in conjunction with their style of martial arts. Additionally, Assassins are masters of infiltration, using a variety of shadow disciplines.\nThe martial arts techniques used by Assassins fall into two groups. The first type are &lt;a href=\"Charge-up%20Skill\"&gt;charge-up moves&lt;/a&gt;, attacks that add a \"charge\" for each successful attack done within a short period of time. The second type is the &lt;a href=\"Finishing%20Moves\"&gt;finishing move&lt;/a&gt;, which follows charge-up strikes, adding a charge of its own.\nHistory.\nThe Order has its origins in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of the conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; foreswore the use of demonic &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, the Viz-jaq'taar were created, a secret order whose sole goal was to police the Mage Clans.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, the Viz-Jaq'taar fought a war against the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the return of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s, the Order's actions became more public. They dispatched one of their own to investigate, the assassin in question allying with a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; who prevented the Prime Evils' schemes from coming into fruition."}

{"id": "128", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=128", "title": "Vizjerei Clan", "text": "The Vizjerei Mage Clan, otherwise known as the Brotherhood of the Vizjerei or the Spirit Clan, is one of the eldest and most dominant of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;. Their ranks are composed of &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLore.\nVizjerei are known for their brightly colored \"turinash\" (spirit robes), which grant them protection from spells and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic creatures. They focus on the use of &lt;a href=\"Magic%23Elemental_Magic\"&gt;Elemental Magic&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas they were once based around the summoning of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, they now take great interest in seeing that demons are slain. A Vizjerei neonate knows only the simplest of spells to start, but can expect to rapidly grow in power as he/she discovers new incantations. The Vizjerei discovered ways to use a simple wooden &lt;a href=\"Staves\"&gt;Staff&lt;/a&gt; as a container for focused magical energy. The process of creating a spell staff is very time consuming, but even an apprentice Vizjerei can recharge a staff by channeling magical energy into it.\nThe symbol of the clan is a dragon bent over a crescent moon. They are currently based in the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, but maintain(ed) a number of outlying schools for the study of &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers of the clan are sometimes called \"spirit mages,\" though this is a term used only by the Mage Clans and demons.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Anno%20Kehjistani\"&gt;Anno Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt;, the Mage Clans were formed around the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23-2200\"&gt;-2200&lt;/a&gt;, where the study of arcane sciences was formalized. The Vizjerei appear to originate from this time period. The Vizjerei were convinced that spirits dwelled on and beyond &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. While the clans Sorcerers could not directly commune with these entities, they believed contact was possible. Thus, the driving goal of the Vizjerei became to perfect the arts of conjuring and summoning spirits.\nFor years, the clan conducted the experiments and carried out empirical research into the practices of the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Druids\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom successfully contacted spirits in their own way. Yet for all the combined dedication and intellect of the Vizjerei, they could only hear a whisper of the beings they sought.\nAround this time, the Vizjerei engaged in a short-lived feud with the &lt;a href=\"Ammuit%20Clan\"&gt;Ammuit Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Summoning of Demons.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23-1992\"&gt;-1992&lt;/a&gt;, an unremarkable Sorcerer named &lt;a href=\"Jere%20Harash\"&gt;Jere Harash&lt;/a&gt; succeeded where his fellows had failed. Reaching out, his heart roiling with anger and rage at the recent loss of his family, he made contact with one of these \"spirits.\" Yet it was no such creature, but rather a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; of pure hate and malice. Whether the Vizjerei knew from the outset what this creature was is unclear, but soon, if not immediately, they realized that this was not some ancestral spirit. The Vizjerei worked feverishly to mask the truth of what had happened, even going so far as to write false histories of Harash\u00a0and some of his early interactions with \"the dead.\" These were written by &lt;a href=\"Dumal%20Lunnash\"&gt;Dumal Lunnash&lt;/a&gt;, though at least one account of Lunnash's existed where he was truthful in writing what had actually occurred.\nThe Vizjerei didn't know that Harash's actions had revealed the existence of Sanctuary to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;, but that aside, there was much controversy among them concerning this new art. Some argued that these entities could not be controlled, and posed a threat to the world. The one thing they all agreed on was that Harash's discovery had to be kept secret. Thus, they covered up the truth of Harash's discovery, and adopted the lie that they were merely communing with the spirits of the dead. Thus, they could claim innocence of any wrongdoing should their actions lead to disaster.\nThe Vizjerei quickly perfected this dark art, establishing demonology and the enslavement of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell's&lt;/a&gt; minions as the basis of their power. &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Kabraxis&lt;/a&gt; was a demon that the Vizjerei summoned into Sanctuary multiple times. So successful were they in their summoning of these \"spirits\" that the Vizjerei earned the moniker of \"the Spirit Clan.\" They grew confident that if they could control one demon, they could control others, and their Sorcerers set about summoning more and more demons into Sanctuary for short periods. While the clan had no intention of using the demons as weapons, their &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s concluded that there was much to be learned from these creatures about the universe and new forms of Magic.\nThe Vizjerei's actions led to Hell's discovery of Sanctuary, and ultimately, the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. After the war's end, many people turned to the Mage Clans for guidance.\nThe Age of Magic.\nIn the decades after the Sin Wars, the Mage Clans reasserted the control they once held over the east. Taking heed of the events, the &lt;a href=\"Ennead\"&gt;Ennead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ammuit\"&gt;Ammuit&lt;/a&gt; declared that no mage clan would ever summon another &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and Hell had to stay out of mortal affairs however. In the midst of this period, the Vizjerei rose to greatest success. Operating under close scrutiny, the Vizjerei ranks soon included thousands of active Sorcerers. In what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Age of Magic&lt;/a&gt;, the Vizjerei enjoyed great popularity. At some point in this period, the Vizjerei established military outposts, and possibly temples, in &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. However, these sites were abandoned as Kehjistan abandoned its foothold. The city of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; was built on one such Vizjerei fortress.\nAt some point prior to the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the Vizjerei were able to (again) banish Kabraxis. Afterwards, they tore down his temples within &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt; and other locations.\nThe Mage Clan Wars.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23-264\"&gt;-264&lt;/a&gt;, the truth of the Vizjerei's summoning became known to the Ennead, as one of their sources within the Vizjerei reported seeing a ritual of summoning in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Assassins were assigned to target key Vizjerei members, where the Vizjerei targeted key Ennead and Ammuit figures in retaliation. The situation further deteriorated where a heated meeting in the &lt;a href=\"Al%27Raquish\"&gt;Al'Raquish&lt;/a&gt; erupted into a battle that resulted in multiple deaths. With the violence coming out into the open, the Ennead and Ammuit stormed the main Vizjerei academy at &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the dust cleared, the academy had been leveled, and not a single Vizjerei Mage was left alive. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs battles raged across &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Ruling%20Council\"&gt;Vizjerei Ruling Council&lt;/a&gt; fled &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;, went into hiding, and began consolidating its forces. Over the next seven years, the combined Ennead and Ammuit forces won several victories against isolated Vizjerei pockets before directing the entirety of their combined might against the Vizjerei's main force. During the height of the war, the Vizjerei began feeling the stress of long struggle. One Vizjerei faction resolved to create an army of demon-possessed victims, and the peaceful &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; people of &lt;a href=\"Teganze\"&gt;Teganze&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be the ideal subjects. Over the course of a few decades, as Umbaru were taken by Vizjerei and turned into &lt;a href=\"Khazra\"&gt;Khazra&lt;/a&gt;, the once peaceful Umbraru-Vizjerei relations had turned into an outright war. Over the next two centuries, the khazra would continue to plague the Vizjerei; the first generations of khazra gleefully slaughtered any Vizjerei they encountered.\nAfter seven years of war, the Vizjerei were hopelessly outnumbered and on the verge of defeat. Thus, they played their trump card\u2014the summoning of demons. In an instant, the tide turned as creatures of the Burning Hells cut their way through the Ennead and Ammuit ranks, allowing the Vizjerei to drive their foes all the way back to Viz-jun.\nAlthough the Vizjerei were willing to utilize demons to achieve their goals, differences of opinion existed as to how this would be carried out. The siblings &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;, both Vizjerei Mages, exemplified this. Horazon believed that while demons were a great source of power, they had to be bent to one's will. The process of breaking a demon's will was a great delight to Horazon. In contrast, Bartuc grew to sympathize with the demons. With no small amount of influence from them, he believed that demonkind would be best understood through an outright alliance with them, so their secrets could be shared freely.\nNonetheless, Bartuc continued the war, earning the title of \"Warlord of Blood.\" Demonic corruption spread through the Vizjerei and the hellspawn he summoned lacked any kind of control, and destroyed everything in their path. Bartuc was not dismayed though\u2014he viewed demons as humankind's masters, and that loyalty to them would be genorously rewarded. Horazon, however, realized that Bartuc's path would only lead to ruin. Even if the Vizjerei won the war, there would be nothing of civilization left, that the clan's only legacy would be death or enslavement to the Burning Hells.\nIn the final stages of the war, as victory seemed assured, the Vizjerei Council resolved to remove Bartuc from command due to his acts of depravity. With the philosophical schism of Horazon and Bartuc coming to a head, the Vizjerei fell into civil war, as Bartuc turned his forces against his own people. After many hard fought battles, Bartuc's contingent gained the upperhand, and he set his armies against Viz-jun. The Vizjerei outnumbered Bartuc 10:1, but when they summoned demons to fight against Bartuc, the creatures turned on their masters. One third of the Vizjerei lost their lives in the siege, and if not for the \"lesser clans\" that followed them, they would have been wiped out. But ultimately, the end of the war would be decided by Horazon and Bartuc themselves.\nThe battle between the siblings took place just outside the towering gates. Horazon, appearing at the eleventh hour, rose to answer Bartuc's challenge. The cataclysmic battle that resulted brought the walls of the city down around them. In the midst of this, the hero &lt;a href=\"Telranden\"&gt;Telranden&lt;/a&gt; led a charge that saved many lives. Yet the city was leveled, and the death toll numbered in the hundreds of thousands. And yet the brothers battled, realizing too late that they had both been played for fools by demons. Yet as the smoke cleared, Bartuc lay dead, with Horazon standing over his brother's corpse.\nAftermath.\nThe grieving Horazon was aware that as long as the agents of the Burning Hells had access to Sanctuary, the corruption of hearts and civilizations would never cease. Following the battle, he crafted for himself the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, a place where the agents of Hell could never find him. For their part, the Vizjerei resolved to forevermore spurn &lt;a href=\"Magic%23Demonic_Magic\"&gt;Demonic Magic&lt;/a&gt; and instead focus their studies on &lt;a href=\"Magic%23Elemental_Magic\"&gt;Elemental Magic&lt;/a&gt;. To further ensure that a tragedy of this magnitude would never be repeated, the &lt;a href=\"Viz-Jaq%27taar\"&gt;Viz-Jaq'taar&lt;/a&gt; were formed, an order of mage slayers known as \"&lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s.\"\nYet, it was a little too late. Once, mages had been revered in eastern culture, but faced with the events that had occurred, the people of Kehjistan turned against them. Many mages were exiled, or even executed, and while the Vizjerei survived as a group, they were but a shadow of their former selves. With the exception of the Yshari Sanctum, the mages' holdings and bastions were pulled down and burnt by the angry citizenry, along with all the knowledge they had collected. Laws were passed against the use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately, the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Age of Magic&lt;/a&gt; was replaced by what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Age of Faith&lt;/a&gt;. Over the period of over a thousand years, many corrupt Vizjerei would again turn to Hell as a source of power.\nRecent History.\nBecause of their actions in the Mage Clan Wars, the Vizjerei never escaped the stigma of their summoning of demons. Even by the 13th century, some still called them \"demon worshippers.\"\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, the Vizjerei sent a number of Sorcerers to the &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;. The Vizjerei elders hoped that their acolytes would learn the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;dark evil&lt;/a&gt; that they sensed growing in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, and destroy it. The possibility of discovering long-lost &lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al knowledge within the confines of the &lt;a href=\"Diablo_I_Walkthrough%23The_Cathedral.2FDungeon\"&gt;labyrinth&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; also captured the interest of many wandering Sorcerers. It was one such Sorcerer, &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt;, who worked with &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moreina\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt; to successfully defeat the evil in question\u2014&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Terror.\nAt some point after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Consortium%20Council\"&gt;Trade Consortium Council&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; worked to unite the Mage Clans and constructed the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to turn Caldeum into a beacon of learning. Along with the Ennead, Ammuit, &lt;a href=\"Taan\"&gt;Taan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zann%20Esu\"&gt;Zann Esu&lt;/a&gt; clans, the Vizjerei clan established themselves here, working together with their fellow clans."}

The &lt;a href=\"Nightgrant\"&gt;Nightgrant&lt;/a&gt; observed them and gave them the name \"Voidwound,\" and learnt what they could of these demons. \nThe Voidwound approached the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt; in Sharval, where they met with at least two of the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Circles\"&gt;Witch Circles&lt;/a&gt;; the Nightgrant and &lt;a href=\"Untameable%20Wilds\"&gt;Untameable Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. The Voidwound made their offer to the Nightgrant dark blessings to shape Sanctuary to their liking, in return for sacrifices. The Voidwound did not mention peace, only one generation of trade between themselves and these mortals. The two exceptions were &lt;a href=\"Apothrus\"&gt;Apothrus&lt;/a&gt; (who remained silent} and &lt;a href=\"Catarag\"&gt;Catarag&lt;/a&gt;, who alone refused to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es. He instead roared of its &lt;a href=\"Dhasocth%20Iyadur\"&gt;Dhasocth Iyadur&lt;/a&gt;: a time without light.\nThe possibility of a pact was rendered impossible. Untamable Wilds drove away the Nightgrant, and lured Catarag into their glade. They were able to seal Catarag, but at the cost of seven lives. To deal with the remaining Voidwound, the Untamable Wilds circle enacted a desparate plan. They tricked the Voidwound into possessing them, and held them at bay long enough to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Sea\"&gt;Forgotten Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The Voidwound were sealed in the &lt;a href=\"Voidwound%20Cage\"&gt;Voidwound Cage&lt;/a&gt;, which was sunk beneath the waves. By the time the ordeal was over, the Untamable Wilds circle had been reduced to only ten members. Nevertheless, the circle remained in vigil over the Voidwound's prison.\nRecent History.\nCenturies later,\u2014around &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Voidwound Cage in order to free its prisoners. They were stymied by &lt;a href=\"Nisza\"&gt;Nisza&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the current wardkeeper of the Untameable Wilds, but their cage was damaged, causing an explosion that scattered &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Slag\"&gt;bits of the cage&lt;/a&gt; far and wide. This caused the Voidwound to awake. Dymdrail sent &lt;a href=\"the%20Many\"&gt;the Many&lt;/a&gt; to hunt her, but she received help in the form of &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rayek\"&gt;Rayek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Kaya\"&gt;Commander Kaya&lt;/a&gt;. \nWith their prison damaged, the Voidwound were able to break free, just as Nisza returned with help.\nThey were later defeated by the Shard-seeker and sealed in the &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nThe Voidwound are &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", introduced as part of the &lt;a href=\"Terror%27s%20Tide\"&gt;Terror's Tide&lt;/a&gt; update.

Most Vulture Demons, however, have poor defensive stats and most can be brought down in one to two hits, depending on the weapon and skill used.\nWhen spotting battles between players and other desert creatures, the scavenger is drawn to feed on the endangered adventurer. If they are flying around when a monster is killed near they immediately land down.\nDifferent types of Vulture Demons are: &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Bird\"&gt;Carrion Bird&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scavenger\"&gt;Undead Scavenger&lt;/a&gt;s (Undead), &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Buzzard\"&gt;Hell Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;s (Demon), &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Nightmare\"&gt;Winged Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Bird\"&gt;Carrion Bird&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scavenger\"&gt;Undead Scavenger&lt;/a&gt;s are found in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; desert areas. &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Buzzard\"&gt;Hell Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;s are found in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt; city areas.

The giant vultures of old were, for the most part, scavengers who ate only the dead or dying. Now befouled, these creatures circle the desert in search of live prey. Their razor sharp beaks and talons can cause deep wounds, and a group of these demons can quickly bring down a victim. Although impossible to target while &lt;a href=\"Fly\"&gt;in flight&lt;/a&gt;, these vultures must land to attack, and are vulnerable when on the ground."}

By all accounts, Vyr was a tyrant. However, he took enormous pride in his appearance.\nBiography.\nVyr created the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Obelisk\"&gt;Black Obelisk&lt;/a&gt; to gather the power of the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, a being he claimed existed on a different plane of reality. He is even reputed to have stored this macabre power in &lt;a href=\"Vyr%27s%20Astonishing%20Aura\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; of his own design. While manipulating power summoned from beyond &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, he wielded &lt;a href=\"Vyr%27s%20Grasping%20Gauntlets\"&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was murdered by his own acolytes, who believed he would bring a curse upon them all, and the Black Obelisk was destroyed.\nMuch later, Vyr's armor was found. His &lt;a href=\"Vyr%27s%20Swaggering%20Stance\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt; were the last, thought destroyed along with the obelisk. His history was recorded by scholars such as &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valthek\"&gt;Valthek&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nVyr was gifted and incredibly proud (hence his Vainglorious title), yet progressively paranoid: either as result of his magical experiments or otherwise. He demanded a helm protecting his mind from enemies crafted. In his pride, assured of his superiority, Vyr failed to see the true danger coming: convinced of his absolute control of his acolytes, he did not expect them to backstab their master.\nIn-game.\n&lt;a href=\"Vyr%27s%20Amazing%20Arcana\"&gt;Vyr's Amazing Arcana&lt;/a&gt; set can be found in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", being the level 70 offensive class set for &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s, assembled to greatly augment their &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; skill.

This set can only drop at\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0difficulty.\nWhile technically it can be completed by any class, it is specifically designed for Wizards.\nPieces.\nThe set consists of six pieces, all of them are required to complete the set. None of the pieces are Wizard-specific.\nSet Bonus:\nDamage type for Archon with all runes is selected by the highest skill bonus to &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt;. Combustion rune blast damage type will not change; it always delivers &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage. If this set is coupled with &lt;a href=\"Chantodo%27s%20Resolve\"&gt;Chantodo's Resolve&lt;/a&gt;, the damage type of that set's special attacks matches the damage type of Archon. &lt;a href=\"Freezing\"&gt;Freezing&lt;/a&gt; effect from Slow Time rune is applied even if non-&lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; damage is selected.\nThe stack bonuses are multiplicative with other similar modifiers, including the Archon's own protection bonus. These bonuses are retained when out of Archon form if the Wizard wears &lt;a href=\"The%20Swami\"&gt;The Swami&lt;/a&gt;. Even better, the 6-piece damage reduction and empowered damage per stack remain active with The Swami as well.\nThe last bonus grants a stack per damaging hit (damaging tick for channeled Disintegration Waves), one stack per ability, regardless of how many enemies it hits (as long as any damage is done). Remember that number of stacks can grow without limit. With &lt;a href=\"Fazula%27s%20Improbable%20Chain\"&gt;Fazula's Improbable Chain&lt;/a&gt;, up to 50 stacks will be gained from the start.\nDamage reduction from the stacks is multiplicative and synergizes well with the 4-piece bonus, but is actually smaller than it sounds: at 100 stacks, it will only add 15% extra protection. However, since the total number of stacks one can accumulate is theoretically unlimited, it can potentially go all the way to 100%."}

Due to its high speed, good number of shoots and wide coverage, this trap can still be very effective well past Normal. However, due to its relatively low synergies and innate damage, as well as the higher amount of fire immune and resistant monsters in later difficulties, the efficiency of this skill is not as high in the very later stages of Nightmare and most of Hell.\nDue to the relative low damage of the spell, dropping many of these traps at once is helpful for dealing more damage. This ability is also much more effective in dungeons, as the cramped corridors and rooms lets the waves hit many more targets than normal.\nThe waves are not radial, but instead are fired in cone-shaped bursts, like &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s cold waves.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 13\nShoots 5 times"}

An object affected by this spell will be triggered as if the character left-clicked it while being next to it. This includes , &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, levers, , &lt;a href=\"traps\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; etc. Alternatively, one can pick up &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; with Telekinesis from distance, which in multiplayer can help recover the items lost after &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt even works over bars and walls, on an object the character can see. Casting it on an object will not alert nearby foes, which is useful in some situations. Players must have enough space in &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; to pick up an item, otherwise it will be transported to them and immediately dropped to the ground.\nSpell Level only decreases the &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; cost, and does not improve the spell in any other way.\nWhen used on monsters, Telekinesis will &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;knock them back&lt;/a&gt;, dealing no damage. It will count as assist for a kill, though. Using Telekinesis on a monster affected by &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Curse\"&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/a&gt; will immediately remove the Stone Curse effect. is immune to Telekinesis.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; monsters are immune to Telekinesis:\nLore.\n\"This versatile spell is derived from a training exercise that was used by the Horadrim. Once they reached a certain point in their training, acolytes were bound and locked in a cell, with the key to the door lying on the floor in front of them. The student had to unlock and open the door without being able to physically move. Through intense concentration and fine control, the acolyte could manipulate the key as if it was held by an invisible hand. Those\"\n\"that were able to open the cell door were allowed to proceed to the next level of training. There is some speculation as to the fate of those unfortunates that lacked the magical prowess to escape. Today, this spell serves as a reminder that what was once a simple mental exercise for the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; is now a difficult spell known by few sorcerers. Telekinesis could prove very useful in the labyrinth, as there are many trapped doors and chests that could be safely opened from a distance. By exerting greater force, at a cost in fine control, creatures can also be pushed away from the caster.\""}

However, users of &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Shield\"&gt;Energy Shield&lt;/a&gt; will probably find themselves maxing out Telekinesis for its synergy: each point into Telekinesis makes the points of &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; lost per damage ratio of Energy Shield 0.0625 more effective. 16 points are needed in Telekinesis to make 1 point of damage consume 1 point of Mana, down from 2."}

It is certainly useful in PvP, to elude and confuse opposition.\nTeleport also has a secondary ability of bringing both &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; and Summons back to the user; when a player Teleports, their Hireling and summons Teleports with them, appearing wherever they do. This can help a player pull their hireling and summons out of danger, preventing them from dying and therefore preventing a hefty resurrection cost, or can also help the hireling and summons to focus on a particular enemy, by Teleporting right next to it.\nLevels in Teleport only decrease its mana cost, so many players choose to put only one point into it, then let +skill items do the rest.\nQuite the popular spell, any non-Sorceress player can also acquire this skill with the item .

It became playable as part of a free &lt;a href=\"Unending%20Storm\"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; in May, 2024.\nLore.\nTempests are warrior-priests based in the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Isles\"&gt;Cold Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Chosen from among the pure of heart, Tempests are raised to protect their people. \nAbilities.\nTempests wear waterproof, lightweight armor. They train in fighting upon the waves, and excel in blade-dancing, wavewalking, and seafaring. They harness movement and elemental powers as they unleash twin &lt;a href=\"edge\"&gt;edge&lt;/a&gt;s; wind and water blades of immense power that harness the elements of air and water. Tempests can move and morph like water to both maneuver around the battlefield and damage enemies. They can also conjure &lt;a href=\"Zephyr\"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;s;temporary shades that mirror the Tempest's movements to distract and taunt enemies, leaving their foes open for the kill. However, unlike the &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt;, tempests do not wield their power over the northern elements in harmony with nature. They command wind and wave in the tongues of forgotten empresses, and twist their power in unnatural ways.\nTraining.\nProspective tempests (called Bladedancers) begin training from a young age. They are at first given reeds and sticks to master channeling of the northern elements and the Samilian martial style. As they master each element (when they are able to channel it without splitting or damaging their weapons) they are given a wind edge or wave edge, signifying the element mastered. \nThe purest and bravest of the Tempests are sent on dangerous voyages to breathe in the mists of &lt;a href=\"the%20Spiral\"&gt;the Spiral&lt;/a&gt;. To hear the whispering voices of an earlier age, and grow in knowledge and power to command sea and sky as Empress &lt;a href=\"Mehrwen\"&gt;Mehrwen&lt;/a&gt; did. The Tempests who are purest of heart and will drink the mists in daily, ultimately trading their material thoughts and bodies for greater power over wave and wind. Symptoms preclude this stage, which are visible in a Tempest's reflection.\nHistory.\nThe history of Tempests goes back thousands of years, and their attire has remained the same throughout their history. Their origins stem back to &lt;a href=\"Pelghain\"&gt;Pelghain&lt;/a&gt;\u2014after the empire's collapse, the empire's once proud people turned to the Tempests for protection. They sailed as far south as the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to hunt the beasts that ravaged their shores. However, storms continued to batter the Cold Isles for centuries, and more Tempests were needed to curb them each year. With each beast the Tempests slew, two more lurked below. However, the rulers of the Isles refused to abandon their homeland.\nOver time, a number of Tempests have strayed from their home. Indeed, some Tempests voyage widely, and have beheld a world just as embatted as their homeland. This has led some Tempests to reject their society and refuse to lose their humanity to the mists. Those who abandon the Cold Isles are made pariahs, in order to deter others from following their example, but for these Tempests, their calling is to use their talents to protect the lives of mainlanders at all costs. They claim their perspective is greater than that of the mist-addled &lt;a href=\"Unmoored\"&gt;Unmoored&lt;/a&gt;, and lament their strongest wasting their lives; delaying the inevitable, never stopping it. Some believe their home will be doomed forever. \nc. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231273\"&gt;1273&lt;/a&gt;, a small group of Tempests voyaged to the mainland to confront its evils. They cut down &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s with blade and water, and sought to preserve any lives they could. But when they spoke, it was always as exiles\u2014with the chill of the wind and the voices of centuries gone. If their home was doomed despite all their people had sacrificed, what would it cost them to save Sanctuary?\nGameplay.\nTempests are based around dual-wielding blades. Their abilities are themed around water and wind. This allows them to lash enemies with water whips, swirl around to target enemies and trap &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s to dash through them for increased damage. They are a &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;-based class.\nWhen playing as the Tempest, players have access to an exclusive &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Relentless%20Tide\"&gt;The Relentless Tide&lt;/a&gt;.\" This depicts the backstory of the Tempest class and takes place 2-3 years before \"Immortal\" begins. However, the quest can be skipped if the player so chooses. The Tempest class also has a trial dungeon which has pre-builds meant to allow players to test out various styles.\nDevelopment.\nDevelopment on the Tempest began after the release of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;. Early on, the developers were toying with early ideas for a wind and wave class. Concepts existed for classes such as the Sage and Siren. There was also an illusionist-type character.\nOne of the key ideas that the designers had for the Tempest was to create a narrative surrounding the class from the beginning of development. They used that narrative to drive the design, rather than creating the class first. The idea of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Isles\"&gt;Cold Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelghain\"&gt;Pelghain&lt;/a&gt; was developed first, which drove the idea for the class to be characterized by the elements of wind and water. The idea for this came from looking at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt; and asking what was up there. As of 2023, there was little material that depicted the area.\nIt was decided that the Tempest was going to be movement-based, and control water and wind. To accentuate the water and wind elements, the developers took inspiration from telltale patterns and art nouveau due to the style's use of curvy lines that further accentuate the theme and their movement overall. It was decided to use a cooler color palette for the Tempest, making it visually distinct from other classes within the game.\nEarlier in production, the Tempest was going to look completely different from its final version. At some point, it was going to look like a sea creature, akin to a half-human, half sea creature. When the theme of the Tempest was discussed, the developers had a chart where they looked at the other classes of the franchise. They saw that they didn't have much of a light-based, light-themed class that is not holy or &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic. The developers wanted something that was life-based to contrast with the Blood Knight. Thus, the visuals were changed to make the Tempest more human. The Tempest's color scheme is primarily white and teal, setting it apart from other classes. The white and teal colors stemmed from the idea of a class with a brighter color palette. Furthermore, the colors sync with the Tempest's fluidity, lightweight gear, and the chaos of storms.\n&lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; lore inspired the design of the Tempest.\nVisually, one of the key differences that sets the Tempest apart from other is the main weapon that they use, namely swords where the blade can separate from the hilt and turn into a water whip.\nDuring development, it was considered making the Tempest a summons-based class, akin to the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. This only went as far as the Zephyr, and it was designed to make the Zephyr feel like a mimic of the Tempest as opposed to a summoned creature.\nThe Tempest was first hinted at in March, 2024, where it was announced that a new class would be released for the game, and would not be a pre-existing class. The class was formally revealed in May of the same year."}

Rather, they rose from the ashes of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;Hand of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; after it fell to corruption by &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, and they viewed themselves as the new, pure continuation of that faith. In the mind of &lt;a href=\"Diadra\"&gt;Diadra&lt;/a&gt;, the Templars \"represented all that &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt; intended\" before they were led astray by the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Maester\"&gt;Grand Maester&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, the Templar searched for their holy scrolls, stolen by &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;. It was found that the Order was involved in the creation of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al weapons, &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic in nature, but designed for &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; hands.\nStorm of Light.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, a branch of the Templar under the command of Lord &lt;a href=\"Norlun\"&gt;Norlun&lt;/a&gt; took control of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Cathedral\"&gt;Zakarum Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, renaming it the \"Church of the Holy Order.\" They quickly established a sense of authority over the capital's citizens, even if they possessed no official standing. Tensions quickly developed between the Templar and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. While some knights defected to the Templar, most remained true to their own order. The Zakarum Cathedral had once been the Knights' base of operations, and the slight of the Templar taking it as their own had not gone unnoticed.\nThe Knights came to believe that the Templar were planning a rebellion against King &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever the truth of the matter, the Knights moved against the Templar, but their plans were leaked by an informant. As such, the Templar were ready for them. Combat began in the streets, while Templar archers manned the cathedral. However, the Templar found themselves under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; as well, who attacked them from the rear.\nThe Knights fought their way into the cathedral, but the Templar refused to surrender, and made their stand in the cathedral's underground chambers. Most of them refused to surrender, and some even fought with their bare hands. Eventually, Norlu threw down his weapon and ordered the remaining Templar to yield. The Knights disarmed the remaining Templar, and Norlun was hauled away to meet the hangman's noose.\nReaper of Souls.\nLater in the year, when the Nephalem came to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; to stop the onslaught of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, Kormac learned that the Templar Order was meeting in the Vault of the Order, their great fortress in the city, and resolved to find out how deeply their corruption ran. When the Nephalem and Kormac entered the Vault, Kormac was hailed as one of the greatest Templars the order had ever seen for his role in destroying &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Grand%20Maester%27s%20Proclamation\"&gt;newest proclamation by the Grand Maester&lt;/a&gt; was given to them, which laid bare the Grand Maester's intent to turn every citizen of Westmarch, and beyond, into Templars in preparation for a \"day of reckoning\", an announcement that Kormac called \"damning\", indisputable proof that the corruption of the order went straight to the top. Kormac and the Nephalem came across the Templar Inquisitors preparing to torture a new Templar initiate, which Kormac swiftly put a stop to by demanding to know how they could do this to a fellow Templar. Kormac and the Nephalem were taken into the presence of the Grand Maester, who praised Kormac for his heroics before announcing his intention to name him as his successor as Grand Maester. Kormac refused, calling the Grand Maester and his Inquisitors out for lying to and betraying every Templar, beginning with the torture of their initiation.\nThe Grand Maester ordered the Inquisitors to kill Kormac and the Nephalem, but the two quickly proved too much for their combined forces to stop, and the Grand Maester fled. Kormac and the Nephalem pursued him, killing every Inquisitor who attempted to stop them. The two finally cornered the Grand Maester and his most loyal bodyguard in the courtyard of the Vault, and in a furious battle, the Grand Maester and his Inquisitors were defeated and slain, bringing an end to the Templar Order and its corruption as it stood. As Kormac and the Nephalem prepared to return to the Survivors' Enclave, Kormac vowed to track down every Templar still indoctrinated by the Order and show them the error of their ways, by force if need be."}

At a point, almost all its inhabitants were sacrificed to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sargoth\"&gt;Sargoth&lt;/a&gt;. The Betrayer was sealed by the desperate actions of the priestess in the ruins of the temple, along with his top lieutenants. The &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of some nephalem were bound to the temple to ensure that the dark summoner and his followers never resurfaced\n, with the Priestess &lt;a href=\"Namari\"&gt;Namari&lt;/a&gt; being Sargoth's warden.\nThree beacons were installed, imbued with &lt;a href=\"preservation%20magic\"&gt;preservation magic&lt;/a&gt;, so that Sargoth would be kept alive. A number of barriers were erected to contain Sargoth's own magic. However, over the aeons, his rage granted him power, and his connection to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; stronger. \nAt some point, Namari faced Sargoth in single combat, but was defeated.\nOver the years, various adventurers retrieved/stole relics from the temple, and attempted to sell them at &lt;a href=\"Port%20Justinian\"&gt;Port Justinian&lt;/a&gt;. However, misfortune appeared to follow the relics, and eventually, &lt;a href=\"Talva%20Silvertongue\"&gt;Talva Silvertongue&lt;/a&gt; stopped seeing them pass its gates. One of its three beacons ended up in a &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Village\"&gt;different village&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the temple's three beacons were stolen, which left Namari powerless to deal with Sargoth, whom she warned would escape in time. She was met by &lt;a href=\"Jin\"&gt;Jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; who agreed to retrieve the beacons in exchange for Namari granting them the items they sought. The first beacon came into the hands of &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Owen\"&gt;Elder Owen&lt;/a&gt;, which kept him alive even as &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Worm\"&gt;Corpse Worm&lt;/a&gt;s devoured him from the inside. Owen was put out of his misery and the beacon claimed. The second ended up in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Fetish\"&gt;Fetish&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rikari%20Village\"&gt;Rikari Village&lt;/a&gt;, and wielded by Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Ongori\"&gt;Ongori&lt;/a&gt;. He was slain by the hero(es) and the beacon retrieved. The third beacon was obtained by &lt;a href=\"Rhodri%20the%20Red\"&gt;Rhodri the Red&lt;/a&gt;, who too was slain. The heroes returned to the temple with the beacons, to Namari's joy. She ordered Jin to stay at the altar lest Sargoth break the seal before they were ready, while she led the other hero(es) into the temple to confront Sargoth. They succeeded in striking him down.\nAfter that, there was a resurgence of adventures raiding the temple for its relics, though they risked acquiring cursed relics.\nGameplay.\nThe temple is encountered as a Bilefen zone in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", and also serves as a &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dungeon becomes accessible during \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Summoning\"&gt;The Final Summoning&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;.

The zone rotates every hour. The zone with the active Terror Rift portal is denoted on the world map, as well as the next zone with a countdown timer. Players must track down the portal to enter. After entering, each player gets 13 minutes to complete the Rift, with Stygian Spires spawning at set times.

After gathering a certain number of Fragments from fallen foes (displayed via a progress bar), the player must search for a Stygian Spire. The number of fragments required is 100, 150, 250 and 300 respectively for the four Spires.

Toppling this enemy grants a reward chest. The player can complete this process as many times as they can within 13 minutes, in order to press onto more plentiful rewards. Rewards may be earned up to 10 times a week from the Terror Rifts, resetting each Monday at 3 a.m. server time. Once a player acquires all weekly rewards, they can continue to run Rifts but will only be able to earn drops from enemies.

The monsters in these zones will be at least two levels higher than the player's current level or their original level, up to a maximum per difficulty. The experience received and the loot dropped by killing a terrorized monster will be based on this new level. In addition, terrorized monsters will also grant additional experience points.\nThe base player level used for the above calculations are taken from the creator of the game. If the host leaves the game, a new player will be selected for the base.\nUpon entering a Terror Zone-enabled game, players will be informed of the current terrorized areas through a message sent to via the Chat Box. When the time for new terrorized zones draws near, players will be informed of the impending changes via the Chat Box.\nIn addition, players will be informed that you\u2019re entering a terrorized area by several indicators:\nIn Hell difficulty, Terror Zones are the only places in which monsters can drop Sundered &lt;a href=\"Charm\"&gt;charms&lt;/a&gt;."}

They were built by Kulle singlehandedly, and dwarf even the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. They were created of creating the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, but also served as a repository for vast amounts of lore. He spent years preparing traps for the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, in case they came in search of him. As he worked on the stone, Kulle would lure unwilling &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s into his archives and subject them to gruesome experiments. He would draw their &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; from their organs, all the while trying to distill their \"&lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; essence.\"\nAs the Black Soulstone neared completion, the Archives were breached by the Horadrim, triggering the wards that Kulle had set up. They found the Archives strangely empty at first, but Kulle had set traps everywhere, and each step was harder than the last. The Horadrim found Kulle in the midst of a summoning spell, and in the battle that followed, many Horadrim lost their lives. They defeated him, but however, by this stage, Kulle had become immortal. He bled sand, and mocked the Horadrim to the end. As such, they separated his head from his body, and hid the latter within the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Realm\"&gt;Shadow Realm&lt;/a&gt;. The locks to the archives were sealed with two vials of his &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. The Horadrim had no means of destroying the archives, or finding Kulle's other archives.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Centuries later&lt;/a&gt;, the Archives were re-opened by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, guided by Kulle's spirit as part of a deal of resurrecting him in exchange for the Black Soulstone. Kulle's body was retrieved, and, reunited with his head, he was revived. However, Kulle was slain again soon afterwards, as he betrayed The Nephalem.\nIn-game.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", it is a location visitable in . \nThe Archives consist of many subzones, of which only &lt;a href=\"The%20Archives\"&gt;The Archives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unknown%20Depths\"&gt;Unknown Depths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Terminus\"&gt;The Terminus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Halls\"&gt;Storm Halls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Realm\"&gt;Shadow Realm&lt;/a&gt; (indirectly, but the only functioning portal is in the archives) and &lt;a href=\"Soulstone%20Chamber\"&gt;Soulstone Chamber&lt;/a&gt; are known.\nThe Archives are a dark place built from enchanted stones, many of which are seen around, ignoring laws of physics. Everywhere around the Archives are ancient books (drop &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; if distrurbed, then crumble to dust). Notable objects include the Force Gates, walls of energy that, while being harmless and allowing passage through, block any ranged attacks, both players' and monsters'.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt; is taken to the Archives, she will note that Kulle's warding spells are similar to those of &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt;, and conclude that he must have studied their methods. She will also wonder if Kulle's guardians are as angry as he is."}

Years ago he left the town of &lt;a href=\"Bramwell\"&gt;Bramwell&lt;/a&gt; to walk the wide world as a soldier of fortune and champion of the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;. But Bramwell is not as he left it. Something dark and terrifying has ensnared the townsfolk, something very old and very patient, tangling innocents in a web of malice and profaning the very earth itself. Now that same power calls to Darrick and his only hope may be to walk the same perilous path of damnation.\nSynopsis.\nDarrick Lang, a sailor in the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Navy\"&gt;Westmarch Navy&lt;/a&gt;, is on a mission with other sailors to rescue a favored nephew of the King from a notorious pirate captain named &lt;a href=\"Aribar%20Raithen\"&gt;Aribar Raithen&lt;/a&gt;. They track down the pirates to a hidden cove in a long-forgotten harbor named Tauruk's Port, rumored to be the site of the long-lost buried city of Ransim.\u00a0The pirates, led by Raithen, are working under the direction of a former &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; priest, &lt;a href=\"Buyard%20Cholik\"&gt;Buyard Cholik&lt;/a&gt;, who believes Ransim to hold a gateway to a plane of Hell ruled over by a powerful demon named &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Kabraxis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sailors, led by Darrick, manage to destroy two of the pirates' ships and rescue the boy, but he is insistent on further investigation of this possible gateway to Kabraxis. Cholik, however, has already opened the gateway, and offered his soul to Kabraxis. A small force of sailors led by Darrick arrive at the gateway just in time to witness Raithen confront Cholik and Kabraxis. Kabraxis offers to spare them in exchange for their loyalty, but Raithen refuses and is burned to death by Kabraxis. When Kabraxis discovers the watching sailors, he raises a large number of skeletons to kill the crew. Darrick manages to escape, but in their flight his best friend Mat Hu-Ring is killed.\nBlaming himself for Mat's death, and without Mat's help, Darrick is unable to deal with his memories of his traumatic past, in which he, as a bastard child, was abused physically and emotionally by his butcher father. Gripped with guilt, Darrick sinks into alcoholism and is eventually abandoned by the Westmarch Navy. Working briefly as a mercenary and bodyguard, Darrick lives as a vagrant, not wanting to live but being unable to commit suicide, before finally collapsing in a small town called Seeker's Point, where he is found and nursed back to health by an old man named Sahyir.\nUnder Kabraxis' direction, Cholik arrives at a large town named Bramwell, and founds a new religion, with Kabraxis being the supposed prophet. Through simple acts of healing aided by Kabraxis' powerful demonic magic, Cholik quickly gains fame and wealth, building a vast church and rapidly earning converts from Zakarum. Kabraxis' plan is for his religion to eclipse Zakarum itself, first taking over all of Westmarch and eventually enslaving all of humanity to his will. His plans seemingly come to an end when an assassin described only as an extremely burnt man attempts to kill Cholik in his own church with a crossbow, but Kabraxis is able to heal Cholik and keep him alive. Their scheme comes to fruition when they successfully convert Bramwell's ruler, Lord Darkulan. With Darkulan's help, Kabraxis intends on converting the King of Westmarch, creating an army of believers that will eradicate Zakarum from Sanctuary.\nSahyir directs Darrick to a friend of his who might be able to help Darrick with his troubles.\u00a0This friend turns out to be a powerful and experienced demon hunter and mage named Taramis Volken, who leads a group of warriors and is intent on recruiting Darrick to his cause. Volken is successful in earning Darrick's trust when he reveals he knows both of Kabraxis' location and intentions, and plans on going to Bramwell to kill Kabraxis, if possible. He has come to Seeker's Point in search of a powerful artifact which will aid him in this goal - an enchanted sword named Stormfury, once used by a mighty warrior named Hauklin to slay Kabraxis in an earlier incarnation and is possibly the only weapon that can kill him.\nThey find Stormfury, but are unable to wield it - it is ensorcelled so that none other than the one destined to slay Kabraxis can touch it. Volken is certain this must be Darrick, as he was the only person to survive witnessing Kabraxis in Tauruk's Port, but Darrick finds himself unable to touch Stormfury until he suddenly begins to hear Mat's voice in his head. Mat reveals that after his death at Tauruk's Port, he has been drifting as a spirit, unable to pass on and unable to communicate with Darrick until the latter had found Stormfury. Mat intends to guide Darrick to killing Kabraxis, the only way he can finally be at peace. Darrick and Volken and the demon hunters however, are soon attacked by demonic creatures summoned by Kabraxis, who has divined their identities and locations and plans on killing them.\nArmed with Stormfury, Darrick and the demon hunters slay the creatures and begin their journey to Bramwell, which by now has become one of the largest cities in Westmarch, brimming with travelers from all over the world who have journeyed there to witness this new religion. Cholik's church has become a mighty fortress, with an army of Kabraxis' converted warriors serving as guards. Darrick and the demon hunters commandeer a ship and, setting it on fire, steer it in a direct course into the Bramwell harbor, triggering a massive explosion that breaches the sewers underneath the city. They then enter the sewers, attempting to find an underground entrance into the well-guarded church.\nAfter battling undead horrors summoned by Kabraxis in the sewers, the demon hunters apparently come to a dead end. Darrick, convinced that Mat's voice in his head must be another demonic trick, almost loses his faith when a path opens in front of the group, opened by Captain Raithen - the pirate captain that had fought Kabraxis at Tauruk's Port. Although burned to death by Kabraxis, Kabraxis had also cast a powerful spell to raise the undead army there, and his magic had in turn raised Raithen's corpse as well. He was the burned man who had attempted to assassinate Cholik, but after communicating with Mat and witnessing Cholik's apparent resurrection, he is now also convinced that Darrick is the only one who can truly kill Kabraxis.\nWith Volken and Raithen's help, Darrick and the demon hunters storm the main hall of Cholik's church, battling Cholik's guards and even killing Cholik himself. However, in the process Darrick is pulled into the Black\u00a0Road, the plane of Hell that is ruled by Kabraxis where his power is most strong. For a brief moment, Darrick is reverted to a child, confronted by his father. After one of his routine beatings, Darrick had stolen a length of rope and tied it in a noose, intending to hang himself, but finding himself unable to do it. Darrick's father taunts him, eventually putting the noose around Darrick's neck and leaving him to hang. However, with Mat's help once more, Darrick is able to see that this is an illusion created by Kabraxis, and as a man, not a child, armed with Stormfury, Darrick cuts himself free and battles anew with Kabraxis.\nAlthough he is armed with the mystic Stormfury, Kabraxis is an inhuman foe and a formidable adversary. The duel is heated until finally Darrick gains the upper hand and prepares for the killing blow, but Kabraxis warns him that, due to his guilt over Mat and his inner demons created by his traumatic childhood, he will never be pure and that if he kills Kabraxis, he will have to pay a high price. Darrick hesitates only momentarily before agreeing to pay it and beheading Kabraxis. With Stormfury and Kabraxis' head in hands, Darrick reappears in Cholik's church in Bramwell and declares the battle over. With both Kabraxis and Cholik dead, the religion is at an end and the remaining believers are quickly scattered by the demon hunters.\nSome time later, the legend of the religion is dying and the common people are in disarray, having lost their hope. Raithen has disappeared without a trace, and after his battle with Kabraxis, Darrick never hears Mat's voice again, convinced his old friend has finally been avenged and moved on. But in a conversation with Volken, Darrick reveals the price he is paying for Kabraxis' death. Tossing Stormfury aside, Darrick's body begins to mutate and transform, changing into a demonic appearance. Holding Stormfury is enough to revert this change and restore Darrick's human form. Having killed Kabraxis, but not properly banished him, Darrick has become the next portal between the mortal realm and the Black Road. Darrick remarks that he can hear Kabraxis' voice in the back of his head taunting him, and wonders that, if he ever gave up or died, Kabraxis may be able to return once again. Volken, certain Darrick is a good man, promises to kill Darrick only if Kabraxis eventually gains an edge over him.\nIn an epilogue, the pair are walking down Bramwell's harbor when Darrick spots a dying young girl, who had fallen into the water and been crushed between two passing ships. Feeling Kabraxis' demonic power flowing through him, Darrick lays on hands on the girl and is able to heal her to perfect health. At first the surprised townspeople think Darrick is a healer of some sort, but they quickly turn into a lynch mob when he is recognized as the one who killed Buyard Cholik. They are threatened but Volken talks them down by reminding them their false prophet was a demon who intended to enslave them. Beseeching Darrick's help, a line quickly forms of ill and dying people in need of healing. Darrick questions whether this is Kabraxis' plan, as using his demonic powers may actually make their connection stronger, but Volken tells him he has a demon's great power and can do great good with it, should he choose. Darrick then decides to be a force of good, and goes down the harbor healing Bramwell's people, listening to Kabraxis screaming at him in his head as he does."}

He will relentlessly pursue a player and attempt to force him/her into close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, savagely hacking away with his cleaver - which usually ends with the player's sudden &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips.\nThe Butcher's &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; does not allow an inadequately leveled character to face him in fair combat. It is advisable to gain some levels before taking The Butcher on. However, if the player wants to engage him from the outset, there are a number of tactics one can use.\nA common way to defeat The Butcher is to lead him to the set of stairs to level 3 of the Cathedral, get him trapped in between the stairway, and shoot at him with a ranged weapon, like a &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt;, from the other side of the stairway. Know that it will take a lot of shots to finish him off, depending on the character's damage output.\nAnother way is to lead him to a wall with bars. Find one in advance, then quickly walk through that door (if there is one), close it and get along the wall away from it to keep The Butcher in sight on the other side of the bars. He will just wander aimlessly left and right as The Butcher cannot open doors and his AI will not let him reach the opening either. Shoot with a\u00a0bow or\u00a0cast\u00a0spells\u00a0at\u00a0him\u00a0through\u00a0the\u00a0bars.\nFinally, a player can open The Butcher's door and cast &lt;a href=\"Firewall\"&gt;Firewall&lt;/a&gt;, then promptly close it again. The Butcher will walk into the fire and remain there. If you are lucky, he will die from the flames, or at least be severely damaged.\nIf a player seeks to fight The Butcher in melee, one would require 55 &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; to land consistent blows on him while only occasionally taking hits from him.\nHis melee attack is extremely fast and will most likely stun a player before they can attack. With a damage range of 2-20 (on Normal) and a melee speed of almost 1 hit per second, even a &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; will find melee to be largely ineffective, unless that Warrior is better geared (possibly with a 1 handed weapon and a shield) and at a higher level (5 or higher).\n&lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s will definitely want to make use of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Curse\"&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/a&gt; (assuming the spell is available) if they intend on fighting him in an open environment with no protective barriers. If Stone Curse is not available, engaging The Butcher in this environment is highly lethal, unless the player has a very high level differential compared to The Butcher.\nStats.\n&lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; \nImmunities: None \n&lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;: 110 \nDungeon Level: 2 \nDamage: 2-20\nDevelopment.\nThe Butcher's room and The Butcher himself came about late in the development of that in \"Diablo I\". One of the artists had created a very bloody room as the tiles were being laid out for the stage design. Upon seeing the room, the designers started joking about it, and turned it into a butcher's shop. A joke then developed that they had to create a monster called \"The Butcher.\" As such, the developers followed through.\nOriginally, the quest to fight The Butcher was a bit more intricate. His room would be empty upon finding it, and returning to Tristram would trigger new dialogue for various characters. &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, would start speaking in a strange, backwards manner, mentioning a portal in The Butcher's room. Gathering more information on the townsfolk, particularly &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that casting spells inside his room would cause \"unexpected results\". By returning inside his room and casting a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;town portal&lt;/a&gt;, a red portal would appear instead, directed to \"Butcher's Chamber\", which was a mini-level where the player would fight Fallen and skeletons, and The Butcher at the end. This alternate version of the quest, as well the Butcher's Chamber level, are present in the \"Diablo I\" demo, but were removed from the final release of the game.\nUpon entering the lair of The Butcher in the Cathedral, a cinematic was to be shown of him hacking the body of a dead villager and hooking it onto the wall. Accounts differ as to whether this was present in early releases of the game, or simply never included.\nDiablo III.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Anniversary%20Dungeon\"&gt;Anniversary Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", players can fight the Butcher again, and obtain his weapon as a &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; choice, as well as a non-combat &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; version of him:"}

Much like its \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, the Butcher opens the fight with the famous line \"Fresh meat!\". He features very aggressive behavior during the fight, combining rage timers, charges, and dragging players out of reach back to him. He will stomp the ground and charge at the walls, regardless of the flaming tiles.\nThe Butcher appears in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Suffering\"&gt;Chamber of Suffering&lt;/a&gt; in Quest 9 of Act I. Upon defeating him, the player gains access to the room where &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;the Stranger&lt;/a&gt; is kept imprisoned by more zealots. Being an act boss, slaughter of the Butcher is necessary for continuation of the storyline.\nThe combat starts immediately as the player enters the Chamber of Suffering. After a short cutscene, the Butcher is unleashed. The layout of the room is an octangular arena with two Health Pools (upper left and upper right corners). The room is divided into seven segments, each of them counting as a separate Fire Grate (see below).\nAttacks.\nEnrage Timer: On Torment difficulty, the Butcher has a hard enrage timer of 3 minutes. After that time, all fire grates will activate at once and stay that way until the end of the combat.\n&lt;a href=\"Man%20Carver\"&gt;Man Carver&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; variant of The Butcher.\nThe Butcher may also drop &lt;a href=\"Flail%20of%20Carnage\"&gt;Flail of Carnage&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnniversary Dungeon.\nAn alternate (\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\"-styled) version of the Butcher appears in the &lt;a href=\"Anniversary%20Dungeon\"&gt;Anniversary Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, on the second level of the labyrinth, as in the original game.\nHis skillset only consists of two attacks, unlike his Act Boss fight appearance, but in return, both deal much higher damage; the Heavy Smash, in particular, can easily one-hit kill even fully-equipped tanks with hundreds of millions of Toughness on the higher difficulty settings."}
{"id": "46780", "revid": "53345662", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46780", "title": "The Butcher (Diablo IV)", "text": "The Butcher is a &lt;a href=\"super%20unique%20monster\"&gt;super unique monster&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", that can spawn randomly inside s and &lt;a href=\"Cellar\"&gt;cellars&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis design is based on his &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;\"Diablo III\"&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, but with a much less hulking appearance and being smaller in size (but still being larger than the player character).\nThe player can obtain the &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%27s%20Cleaver%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;The Butcher's Cleaver&lt;/a&gt; from killing him, although it's not an exclusive drop.\nIn-game.\nThe Butcher is a powerful and brutal &lt;a href=\"Butcher%20Demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; that has a small chance of appearing inside inside any room within dungeons and cellars. Once he spots the player, he'll grunt his signature \"Fresh meat!\" and will relentlessly chase them until they are killed, or until he's defeated. Whenever the player encounters the Butcher, his theme song will play.\nThere are no player-level restrictions for the Butcher to spawn; he can potentially appear at any level the player character is at. In some cellars he can even be a random objective, which will be completed whether the player defeats him or not (although killing him earns the objective's mastery). He can also spawn while the player is in a party, and can also appear inside &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Dungeon\"&gt;Nightmare Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Butcher will never spawn inside campaign-related dungeons or open world areas. He'll also never spawn more than once in the same dungeon. His spawn rate is random and the player has no control over how and when he can appear.\nIf the Butcher defeats the player, he'll clash his weapons together and teleport out, leaving a pool of blood on the ground. He will also do that if the player manages to escape from him by climbing ladders and getting out of his reach without attacking him for a few seconds.\nAttacks.\nThe Butcher's attack pattern is very similar to his \"Diablo III\" counterpart, while also borrowing some traits from his \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" incarnation. On higher &lt;a href=\"World%20Tier\"&gt;World Tiers&lt;/a&gt; he'll also gain a shield, and will replenish some seconds after depleted.\nStrategy.\nThe Butcher moves and attacks fast, with little to no pauses, leaving little breathing room for the player. He'll prioritize the player character and will generally ignore companions and minions.\nIdeally, the player should attempt to maintain a safe distance from the Butcher, and try to avoid taking unnecessary damage, even if playing a melee-oriented class and / or build. Paying attention to his attack patterns is key, as he is briefly vulnerable if he misses his Headbutt and Sickle Grab. While all of his attacks can be dodged, his Double Swing, however, is very fast and hard to avoid.\nThe Butcher's Mighty Roar is nearly impossible to avoid even at mid-long distances as it covers a massive radius around him; he'll often follow-up with a Sickle Grab to pull the slowed player. Ideally, in these conditions, the player should save their dodge for when the Butcher attempts to hook the character.\nMeeting the Butcher while facing other opponents is very dangerous, especially if the player lacks proper crowd control. However, this can be useful to replenish potions, which will always drop from &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;elite monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nFighting the Butcher while in a party is the safest way to deal with him as the players can split his attention. He'll mostly prioritize the closest player character, so his AI can be conditioned to chase one player or the other.\nOne of the most effective ways to deal with the Butcher, especially when facing him solo, is to use terrain as an obstacle, to effectively \"kite\" him around. Shrine Pillars are particularly useful as the Butcher has to move around them to reach the player, and if they maintain a safe, but relatively close distance from him, he won't use his Sickle Grab, Charge nor Mighty Roar. By running around it in circles and pelt him with attacks.\nThe Butcher is a much harder foe on higher World Tiers due to his ability to gain a shield."}

It is also masochistic, and its own hands are damaged as the result of its torture. It huntes endlessly for fresh meat, apparently preferring it raw.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"Kharazim\"&gt;Kharazim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valla\"&gt;Valla&lt;/a&gt; noted the creature's strength, the latter commenting that the Butcher \"was one of the most powerful creatures I have ever faced.\"\nBiography.\nOrigins.\nThis Butcher Demon was crafted in the same manner as its kin\u2014put together from the body parts of various demons. This Butcher appeared to be particuarly infamous however, coming to the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors of the creature persisted throughout the years, and &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; heard rumors of demonologists trying to duplicate the creature.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Butcher%20Demon\"&gt;Butcher Demon&lt;/a&gt;s were once servants of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, this particular Butcher was a servant of &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, though at the least, acted in a manner that served the Lord of Terror's ends. The creature first made itself known to the people of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; led them into the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; as part of a trap. A horde of demons set upon the townsfolk, the Butcher among them. Wielding a cleaver as large as an &lt;a href=\"axes\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, the creature cut down any who stood against it. Some townsfolk made it back to the surface, but the wounds that the Butcher inflicted left them festering with disease, that even the town's &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; found almost impossible to treat. The slaughter the Butcher carried out strengthened Diablo further, allowing the Lord of Terror to summon more demons to terrorize the countryside surrounding Tristram.\nThe Butcher made his lair in a chamber in the lower levels of the Cathedral. Prior to the return of Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, at least one group of adventurers stumbled across the beast. They had entered the cathedral for loot, but found themselves beset by &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20One%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Imps&lt;/a&gt;, before finally The Butcher himself descended on them. All but one of them were killed, as the only survivor left his friends to die. However, The Butcher managed to inflict a wound on his arm that nearly took it off, leaving Tristram's healer with no choice but to remove the limb.\nThe Butcher met his end at the hands of Aidan, as well as &lt;a href=\"Moreina\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt;. As they approached his chamber, they heard the screams of his victims, and blood pouring out from the door. Opening it, they beheld The Butcher, who grinned at the promise of fresh meat before setting on them with his cleaver. However, they were able to dispatch the beast.\nAfter its death, an &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt; demon called &lt;a href=\"The%20Slayer\"&gt;The Slayer&lt;/a&gt; sought to take The Butcher's place. It sent out &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20One\"&gt;Fallen One&lt;/a&gt;s to find the Butcher's cleaver. However, the Slayer was itself slain before it could find the cleaver.\nDark Rebirth.\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;eight years later&lt;/a&gt;, the Butcher was resurrected within the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nButcher's Return.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Twenty years later&lt;/a&gt;, the Butcher was resurrected in service to the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt;. The demon was encountered by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; deep in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt;, beneath &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt;. In a bid to stop them, &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt; released the creature However, The Nephalem was able to defeat the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; and continue their search for &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;the Stranger&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great Enmity.\nThe Butcher roamed &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nThe Butcher is an optional boss in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo Immortal.\nThe Butcher is a boss in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". It should be noted however that two different Butchers (or rather, Butcher Demons) appear over the course of \"Immortal\". The one fought in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Realm of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; is not the same Butcher that made its debut in \"Diablo I\". The original Butcher however, does appear in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rebirth\"&gt;Dark Rebirth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line.\nDiablo III.\nThe Butcher is the boss of in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". It is the resurrected form of the Butcher from the first game.\nDiablo IV.\nA Butcher appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" as a random encounter. It is apparently the same Butcher encountered in \"Diablo I\" and \"III\".\nHeroes of the Storm.\nThe Butcher is available as a melee assassin hero in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". His gameplay revolves around his trait, called Fresh Meat, where defeated enemies drop meat on the ground, which when collected increases his Basic Attack damage; if the Butcher is killed, he loses meat. This creates a high risk high reward style; however, if the player acquires enough meat, The Butcher won't lose meat on defeat anymore, in addition to gaining additional damage.\nHe can also perform a running charge at his opponents, called Ruthless Charge, where he becomes unstoppable. He is able to heal himself by putting his Butcher's Brand on a target and attacking them. One of his Heroic Abilities, Furnace Blast, references the fire grates that appear during his fight in \"Diablo III\".\nAccording to the developers, from a character fantasy aspect, The Butcher's gameplay of growing powerful and more dangerous over the course of the match, is meant to evoke a feeling of fear to reference his original appearance in \"Diablo\".\nOverwatch.\nA Butcher skin is available for Roadhog in \"Overwatch\". One of his skin specific voice lines is \"Fresh Meat!\""}

A &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, this young, enigmatic Necromancer has a strong, dark personality, and is able to see things which other mortals cannot. \nBiography.\nThe Way of Rathma.\nBefore she was a Necromancer, the girl lived in a village among a group of friends. One day, they explored a tree, where they found a nest of newly hatched birds. The girl found a broken egg on the ground, with a dead bird inside. A man clad in armor approached and placed his hands around the bird. When he removed them, the bird was 'alive,' or more specifically, animated via &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. The man, whose name was Ordan, asked \"do you wish to learn?\" Her friends looked on uneasily, but the girl took him up on his offer.\nWeeks later, the two arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. The girl was given the rank of initiate, and she began her training in the ways of &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;. The years passed, as she learnt the powers of necromancy\u2014raising &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;detonating corpses&lt;/a&gt;, making a &lt;a href=\"Half-formed%20Golem\"&gt;half-formed golem&lt;/a&gt; in one of her early attempts, and reading numerous &lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; from within the Necropolis's library, while also training with blades. Ordan also taught her how to control her emotions. As she entered adulthood, her hair, once formerly a dark black, had become bleached white. \nOne day, Ordan approached her, telling his pupil that there was nothing more that she could learn within the walls of the Necropolis. That wasn't to say that her training was over, and they left the Necropolis, to \"where they were needed,\" according to Ordan. Travelling by land and sea, they arrived at the Necromancer's old village, which had been destroyed by cultists, and its people killed. The cultists attacked them, and Ordan bid his student to raise the dead. She did so, animating the bodies of her former friends, and turned the skeletons on the cultists, killing them. Ordan congratulated her, but told her that next time, she would have to be quicker. The Necromancer silently agreed, and they left the village.\nThe Fallen Star.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Ordan learnt of the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;, which had awoken the dead in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. He bid his student travel there to return them to their graves. The Necromancer sensed a need for their unique power and answered the call on behalf of their order despite leaving with their training incomplete. Now with the rank of acolyte, the Necromancer arrived at &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\n\"The Chosen\" goes unnamed within the &lt;a href=\"The%20Chosen\"&gt;comic&lt;/a&gt; that she features in\u2014her naming in this article is for ease of identification.

Ultimately, her actions were responsible for the emergence of &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Comtessa was tall for a woman, with dead-black hair that, if unbraided, went all the way to her ankles. She had brown skin like silk, and spoke in a musical tongue. She wore a ruby ring as large as a pigeon\u2019s egg.\nBiography.\n&lt;a href=\"Nan\"&gt;Nan&lt;/a&gt; suspected that the Comtessa and her retinue had a routine; to squat in one place for as long as they dared, then leave before too many questions were asked.\nAutumn Meeting.\nOne autumn night, the Comtessa and her retinue arrived at the Big House in the marshes of northern &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. They were apparently unbothered by the cold, and dressed richly for travelers, and as &lt;a href=\"Nan\"&gt;Nan&lt;/a&gt; noted, bereft of horse smells for one who had ridden for so long. The people of the House were enraptured by them. Her retinue addressed her as \u201cComtessa;\u201d supposedly a title in her own tongue. \nThe Comtessa claimed that she and her retinue were travelling through Khanduras on pilgrimage, and hoped to rest at the Big House before continuing onward. She flattered the &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; of the noble family there, who immediately demanded that rooms be made for the company, and their horses fed and watered. \nThe Comtessa did not emerge until late afternoon. The girl showed her around the grounds, the Countess smiling at everything, but refused to enter the chapel (\u201conce you have seen one backwater Khanduras chancel, you have seen them all\u201d). As the days passed, the Comtessa\u2019s demenor shifted. One moment she was languishing and philosophical, the next, laughing like a maenad. She and her retinue slept late, which they claimed was the fashion. Sometimes, until nearly sundown, they would hunt and bring back game. The retinue sometimes played coarse games, tossing the corpses of their kills to one another, feigning to bite the creatures, and at times, taking raw blood from their kills. Sometimes, the Comtessa went with them.\nThe girl lavished gifts on the Comtessa, who in turn gifted her her ruby ring. In exchange, the girl gave her an even larger ring, which even the Comtessa could not help but admire. Nan noted that the Comtessa looked at her lady with \u201cthe calculating glance of a cat with a very plump mouse.\u201d The Comtessa often made fun of her ignorance, or used her as the butt of a joke, but the girl never noticed, as she was so enraptured.\nAfter a fortnight, the Comtessa declared that she and her retinue would leave, as they intended to reach the mountain pass before the winter snows closed it. The girl declared that the pass was already inhospitable, and that the Comtessa and her people should stay until the thaw. The Comtessa smiled and declared that they would hold a party to celebrate the young lady.\nDepartures.\nExactly what happened in the party was a mystery to all but those who attended (the Comtessa, her retinue, and the young girl who was besotted with her). When the girl retired to her chambers before dawn, she was trembling; her dress was torn, her hair was in disarray, and she was grey-faced. In the morning, the Comtessa and her retinue had departed, along with the girl. Furthermore, a number of servants had gone missing.\nThe girl was eventually brought home, confused but unhurt, save a shallow knife slit at the side of her throat. She could not say if anyone had attacked her. Many of the servants, however, never came back. One bloated corpse of a young man was found when the snow started to thaw, his neck broken open, and an expression of horror on his face.\nLegacy.\nExactly who, or what, the Comtessa was remained a mystery, but her actions were felt long after her departure. The girl, who took to calling herself \u201cCountess,\u201d descended into madness, bathing in the blood of virgins before eventually meeting her end."}

She was the ruler of a kingdom, either Khanduras, or a smaller, self-contained kingdom within its (future) borders.\nAs she grew older, she bathed in the blood of hundreds of captives to retain her ebbing youth. It is said that she bathed in the \"rejuvinating &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of a hundred virgins\" alone. Eventually, her wickedness was ended; there is evidence that the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; may have played a role in her downfall.\nThe Countess was buried alive in the castle's tower, as she could not truly be killed. It is believed that her fortune was divided up among the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt;, but that some of it remained in the tower.\nThe Forgotten Tower.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of adventurers&lt;/a&gt; entered the Countess's tower, only to encounter the Countess herself. However, she was slain, and they helped themselves to the treasures within.\nThe Bloodsworn.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;Six years later&lt;/a&gt;, the Countess was resurrected by a group of cultists called the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;, who served as her followers. Furthermore, a &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; shard came into the Countess's possession, which she wore around her neck. The strongest of the Bloodsworn remained in the tower, acting as her protectors.\nThe Bloodsworn set about collecting &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; for her in an effort to restore her to her former glory. The roots of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt; ran through the Dark Wood, feeding her with blood spilt within the forest. As long as it continued to feed her blood, the Countess would not die. The Bloodsworn themselves razed the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blackstone\"&gt;Blackstone&lt;/a&gt; to the ground, gathered the blood of every man, woman, and child, and through some kind of ritual, infused their mistress with it. Yet even this was not enough to restore the Countess fully, and she ordered the Bloodsworn to hasten their efforts, lest they lose her favor.\nThe Countess reappeared to her &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;foe(s)&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fetid%20Swamp\"&gt;Fetid Swamp&lt;/a&gt; via some form of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al projection, where she ordered that &lt;a href=\"Vassarici\"&gt;Vassarici&lt;/a&gt; kill them. She was defeated, but the Countess was unperturbed, stating that the blood of her servants returned to her upon their deaths, so that even her foes' victories hastened her return. She ordered that they flee the Dark Wood before she decided they no longer could.\nWhen Lakrii fed herself to the Blood Rose, her blood was apparently enough to finally fully revive the Countess. From afar, she summoned &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn%20Simulacrum\"&gt;simulacrums&lt;/a&gt; from the pool of blood the monstrosity resided in, to aid in its fight against the hero(es) that were attacking it. However, it was not enough, and the Blood Rose was slain.\nThe hero(es) later stormed the Forgotten Tower. The Countess drove the Bloodsworn forward, but the hero(es) slew them, and confronted the Countess herself, slaying her in turn, and her Worldstone shard retrieved.\nAfter her second death, &lt;a href=\"Jentulf\"&gt;Jentulf&lt;/a&gt; heard the tale of the Countess, and the blood ritual that had resurrected her. Wishing to learn more about her and her methods, he offered a reward for even a single drop of her blood.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nThe Countess is the objective of &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20Tower%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Forgotten Tower (quest)&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", which involves seeking the riches hidden underneath the remains of her tower. She is a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Stalker\"&gt;Dark Stalker&lt;/a&gt; found on the 5th level of the Forgotten Tower in the Black Marsh and must be killed in order to complete the associated quest.\nIf she strays too far from her room, she does not trigger the event that unlocks the &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, so it's detrimental to lure her out. The chest only opens upon killing The Countess for the first time.\nCompared to the other &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; around her, she has a higher chance to drop &lt;a href=\"runes\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt; (see below). The Hell-difficulty Countess is the only monster to drop the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Key of Terror&lt;/a&gt; in the game, which is used in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nBonus:\nOn &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, Countess is always immune to &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nRunes.\nIt is beneficial to repeatedly kill the Countess for &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Rune&lt;/a&gt; hunters as she has a very high chance to drop multiple runes even after the Forgotten Tower quest has been completed. The best Runes possible improve on harder &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt; levels. The best odds of getting multiple runes comes from playing alone; the more players there are in game, the lower her chance to drop more than one rune is.\nIn Normal, she can drop up to .\nIn Nightmare, she can drop up to , though runes above are very rare.\nIn Hell, she can drop up to , though runes above are very rare.\nDiablo Immortal.\nThe Countess is encountered through the Dark Wood questline in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". She appears as an apparition in various locations, referred to as \"Bloodsoaked Woman\" in her text box. She plays an indirect role in the boss fight against the Blood Rose, where she summons Bloodsworn Simulacrums to attack the player.\nShe is ultimately confronted in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of the &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. She is immune to &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;, and will reguarly summon Bloodsworn to attack the player. She has the following attacks:\nShe is also the target of the \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Countess\"&gt;Blood of the Countess&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Queen\"&gt;Sanguine Queen&lt;/a&gt; is her &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; counterpart.\nDiablo III.\nThe Countess is referenced in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" in the flavor text of the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Flight\"&gt;Sanguine Flight&lt;/a&gt; wings.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nThe Countess is referenced in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".

But he grew weary of &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;battling&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s after a time, and he began to secretly conspire with demons in order to forge a peace. The demoness &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; became his greatest ally in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hells&lt;/a&gt;, and many other demons and angels joined his cause. - &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;\"\n2. \"After he gained a following, Inarius stole the sacred &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; and used it to create and conceal a world he called &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Demons and angels alike fled there, and some of them - including Inarius and Lilith - fell in love. Many of these unions resulted in children. They were called the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. - Archangel Auriel\"\n3. \"Inarius was alarmed when he realized that the nephalem had the potential to surpass both angels and demons in power.

Despite the tragedy, I believe the nephalem may yet play a part in resolving the Eternal Conflict. - Archangel Auriel\""}

It was meant to be the receptacle of Kulle's consciousness in the event of his &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The Curator was created through living sand, like a number of Kulle's other creations (e.g. &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s), and possesses its creator's wit and focus, but without the egomania he manifested in his later years. The duplicate was assigned to act as the curator of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle%27s%20Library\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle's Library&lt;/a&gt;, and ensure its continuance, by minimizing &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al decay. Like Kulle's other constructs, it was kept on a tight leash. However, according to the Curator, \"that [being constrained] has never stopped me before.\"\nOver time, the library fell into disrepair. Its central core shut down, and as such, a pair of wards went up that prevented access to certain sections of the library, including Kulle's secret archives. Despite the Curator's efforts, he was unable to breach them, much to his frustration. Additionally, he was unable to leave the library itself.\nNew Arrivals.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the duplicate barred entrance to the library to &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;. He believed the intruder(s) to be thieves, and despite their protests to the contrary, unleashed &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Phantom\"&gt;Phantoms&lt;/a&gt; upon them. After the Phantoms were destroyed, he engaged the intruder(s) directly. He was defeated, and they explained that they weren't thieves, but rather, sought a way to destroy the Worldstone shards. The Curator stated that if Kulle knew of a way, he would have stored the information in his private archives. However, given his weakened state, he couldn't reach that location. He had to regain his strength, and ordered the hero(es) to clear the library of the creatures that infested it. Arriving at a statue that could restore his power, they found that its runes had been removed. He ordered the hero(es) to find them. With the runes restored, he led them to the library's central core, for to restore the library, they needed to bring the core back to life. However, he couldn't reactivate the core, and ordered the hero(es) to obtain Kulle's journal, as it detailed the inner workings of the library. Upon their return, the Curator studied the journal and concluded that the core was comprised of rock animated by living sand. As such, &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; could not reactivate it. Unlike his master, bringing the spark of &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; to artificial creations was beyond his abilities. He ordered them to head to the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Engine\"&gt;Chaos Engine&lt;/a&gt;, which they could use to extract the &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; of life from a golem, and use it to power the core.\nThe hero(es) returned with life essence, and the Curator used it to reactivate the core. With it, the wards that had thwarted the Curator for so long went down, much to his joy. He told the hero(es) to join him in the &lt;a href=\"Archive%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Archive of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;, where they would hopefully be able to discover how to destroy the Worldstone shards they carried. He presented to them a &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; that recalled Kulle's experience in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, when he and &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; had defeated &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. The tome contained Kulle's memories perfectly recorded, able to be experienced directly by any who read the work. They headed into &lt;a href=\"the%20Forbidden%20Archive\"&gt;the Forbidden Archive&lt;/a&gt; to read it. Along the way, the Curator questioned the wisdom of destroying the shards rather than utilizing them, but didn't press further. However, he hoped that the hero(es) would share their story with him.\nThe hero(es) entered Kulle's memories in the tome, where they learnt that only the weapon of an &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; could damage the Worldstone. The Curator explained that Kulle only knew of two such weapons\u2014&lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt;, which was beyond their reach, and &lt;a href=\"Yl%27nira\"&gt;Yl'nira&lt;/a&gt;, currently located in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Namari\"&gt;Temple of Namari&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Bilefen\"&gt;Bilefen&lt;/a&gt;. With the library now under his control, he modified a &lt;a href=\"terminus\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt; to take the hero(es) to the island, near the temple. He gave them permission to come and go through the library as they pleased, and told them to \"try not to die before our next meeting.\" But if they did choose to leave, to do so quickly\u2014he hated long goodbyes.\nAfterwards, the Curator managed to regain control of a number of the library's Golems, but many remained wild and uncontrolled.\nThe Fractured Plane.\nThe Shard-seeker returned to the library with the &lt;a href=\"Sumina%20Glass\"&gt;Sumina Glass&lt;/a&gt;. Like Kulle before them, they sought to enter the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Plane\"&gt;Fractured Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nThe Curator is encountered as an enemy at the start of the Library of Zoltun Kulle &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". It starts by summoning &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Phantom\"&gt;Mysterious Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Guardian\"&gt;Unseen Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.\" Here, it goes under the moniker of \"Mysterious Voice,\" using the same portrait as the &lt;a href=\"Mirrored%20World\"&gt;Mirrored World&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s. He is later fought directly. \nIn this fight, he is immune to &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;, and can &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;. He has the following attacks:\nAfter the boss fight, the Curator becomes an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, and will appear throughout the library at various points in its questline.\nA &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; counterpart for the Curator exists via the &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Shaper\"&gt;Sand Shaper&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nThe Curator, in many ways, is similar to his creator\u2014suspicious, snide, possessed of a dry wit, and possessing the need for both control and knowledge. Unlike his creator, he came to trust his companion(s), and even seemed to develop genuine affection for them.\nAlso like Kulle, the Curator possesses powers of his own, such as sand-based &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; abilities, and the ability to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;. He is also capable of operating Kulle's technological devices."}

It is from here that the first &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; were created. While the khazra eventually spread out from the Citadel, a number of khazra remained inside the structure, trying to practice &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. In comparison to the khazra that spread across &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, these khazra are a throwback to their original forms. They became known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Khazra\"&gt;First Khazra&lt;/a&gt;, distinguishing themselves from their divergent kin.\nThe First Khazra still remained in the citadel by the Great Enmity. They used the powers located in the citadel and the crater it was located in to perform experiments in a bid to resurrect their dark god, &lt;a href=\"Zagraal\"&gt;Zagraal&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nThe Dark Citadel offers endgame PvE content for groups of 2-4 players with combat and cooperative puzzles. Players need to split their forces and simultaneously traverse separate paths. Players are able to earn exclusive appearances by completing The Dark Citadel on top of its weekly reward cache. Each wing of the dungeon has a different flavor and different combination of attacks players need to overcome. A number of &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es feature in the citadel that are designed in accordance with group play.\nWhile inside the citadel, players have access to unique markers/icons that can be slotted into their emote wheel. This can be used to mark points of interest to other players, guide them, etc.\nDevelopment.\nThe traps in the Citadel were iterated from those present in \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Construct\"&gt;Season of the Construct&lt;/a&gt;\". Comments from developers have implied that the Citadel was created first, with the lore being developed later."}

The event allows players to revisit the original 16 levels of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\". It is available for both the PC and &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Evil%20Edition\"&gt;console&lt;/a&gt; versions, added in patch 2.4.3.\nFeatures.\nThe Anniversary Dungeon recreates most of the events, &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Diablo_I_Walkthrough%23The_Cathedral.2FDungeon\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt; of the original \"Diablo\" inside gameplay of\u00a0\"Diablo III\".\nReturning Boss Fights are , , &lt;a href=\"Arch-Bishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Arch-Bishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;The Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;) himself. In addition, every single &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monster\"&gt;Unique Monster&lt;/a&gt; from \"Diablo I\" can be found and killed, though they are mostly just buffed-up regular monsters with no affixes (and only a few have a single affix at their disposal). They always drop &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic Items&lt;/a&gt; of top tier from Diablo I, for example, &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Sword%20of%20Haste\"&gt;King's Sword of Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quarter%20Staff\"&gt;Archangel's Staff of Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Godly%20Plate%20of%20the%20Whale\"&gt;Godly Plate of the Whale&lt;/a&gt; (though at maximum level, these items are of little usefulness).\n&lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt; in Anniversary Dungeon are the same as those in D1, but use the graphical assets from D3 with only slight recolor. Some of them do have their old abilities, and some do not. Those monsters, which do not have a direct equivalent in D3, use graphics of the closest possible match (for instance, &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Demon\"&gt;Winged Demon&lt;/a&gt;s use graphics of &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Talus\"&gt;Winged Talus&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Dungeon is 16 levels deep, divided into 4 sections as the original game is (Catacombs are replaced with &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Corvus\"&gt;nephalem ruins&lt;/a&gt;, Caves with &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Mine\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; and Hell with &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt; visuals). Any character can enter it: there is even an achievement and reward for beating it in one go with a level 1 character. The Dungeon also gives tremendous amounts of &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, on average, a fresh character completing it on &lt;a href=\"Normal%20difficulty\"&gt;Normal difficulty&lt;/a&gt; will acquire level 30 by the end of it.\nAll quests from D1 return, but most have been altered and simplified. For example, &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20Water%20Supply%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Poisoned Water&lt;/a&gt; only involves finding a &lt;a href=\"Resplendent%20Chest\"&gt;Resplendent Chest&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Passage\"&gt;Dark Passage&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the original game, this event gives access to \"all\" of them at once. Unique quest rewards, such as &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ring of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, are dropped in form of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic Items&lt;/a&gt; with unique graphics and text, but hardly any gameplay use at maximum level.\n&lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farnham\"&gt;Farnham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt; appear in their corpse (later ) form. Though they do not provide speech, and do not serve their direct duties, they are all involved in a semi-secret quest line (which replaces the old &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mushroom%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Black Mushroom quest&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Dungeon is accessed via a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Ruins\"&gt;The Old Ruins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, next to the fountain, and is only accessible in Adventure Mode. The zone itself is simply named &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, and all 16 levels of the Dungeon are labeled &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\nRewards for completing the dungeon include &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt; elements (for killing all 4 bosses: &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, and ), as well as:\n&lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; weapons.\nThere are two, modeled after &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%27s%20Cleaver\"&gt;The Butcher's Cleaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wirt%27s%20Leg\"&gt;Wirt's Leg&lt;/a&gt;.\nPortraits.\nTwo portraits are rewarded, angelic and demonic versions of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; orbs.\nPortraits require the player to kill every single Unique monster (40 in total) and to collect all &lt;a href=\"Cultist%20Page\"&gt;Cultist Page&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCultist Pages.\nCultist Pages\u00a0are\u00a0&lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0needed to obtain a Classic Angel portrait from\u00a0The Darkening of Tristram\u00a0event in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAll 7 pages are dropped by &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Priest\"&gt;Temporal Priest&lt;/a&gt;s. Each &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; zone contains exactly 1 priest, and each priest drops a single page.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Cultist%20Page\"&gt;relevant page&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nUnique Monsters.\nBroken down by levels, the unique monster list is (in addition to 4 mandatory bosses):\n\"(*) These monsters will always appear, in every game.\"\nEach level is guaranteed to contain at least one (those who are guaranteed to spawn do not prevent an additional monster from appearing), and statistically roughly 6-7 runs are required to collect all 40 of them.\nSince levels 15-16 always contain all of the monsters listed, they only need to be cleared once.\n&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompleting the Dungeon also rewards a &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Red Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;, that fits into the Helmet slot, reminiscent of Diablo's &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; (into which it will transmog the helmet).\nLoot.\nBesides other loot, that can be found within Anniversary dungeon, there is a guaranteed drop of these &lt;a href=\"magic%20items\"&gt;magic items&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nVisual.\nOne of the biggest things players will notice when entering &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; from Old Tristram is the Pixelated Rendering Effect, distorting much of the game's high details to look dated and old. For PC players, their Status HUD will be changed to look much like &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt; did. Frame rate was also modified to be 25~30 FPS, giving it a choppy animated effect much how animations looked in the older days. Zoom does not work as well.\nAnother large change is the player character themselves. Much like the old game, players will visually move on a hard cardinal 8 directional movement system (player models still face the 8 directions but will still have the fluid full range motions). Monsters will also use the \"8 direction\" rule. Players will also no longer use a running animation, sticking to a walking animation, although it does not have any effect on the actual speed of movement. Console players still have access to the Dodge Roll ability. Since &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt; don't have a walking animation, they will run normally.\nOne of the more subtle changes are things like lighting effects being thinner and dimmer in detailing. Another is the event will ignore the setting \"Display Damage Numbers\", electing to not display the damage you've dealt.\nHovering over loot will display the description in Diablo's classic Exocet typeface.\nAudio.\nMusic while in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; will play &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram's&lt;/a&gt; original town song, while in the Labyrinth will play area specific music, depending what area you're in. While exploring the Labyrinth, gold drops will play a heavier jingle sound. Some elemental attacks have different audio cues, like the Wizard spell &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Blade\"&gt;Spectral Blade&lt;/a&gt; using the \"Thrown Blade\" rune is much quieter.\nAction.\nThis event doesn't change much of the game's playable formula. What ever you've done in the normal game will carry over well into this event. Only a few small additions can be seen in the Labyrinth, like &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; being trapped (upon opening, a small red bolt will come flying at the character) and nearly all &lt;a href=\"barrel\"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt;s being explosive (though they do not harm the player).\nIn an unusual twist, event items obtained from this event (such as &lt;a href=\"Godly%20Plate%20of%20the%20Whale\"&gt;Godly Plate of the Whale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harlequin%20Crest%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Harlequin Crest&lt;/a&gt;) seem to ignore the &lt;a href=\"Smart%20Loot\"&gt;Smart Loot&lt;/a&gt; system, rolling unusual stats and sometimes even against your primary stat.\nAchievements.\nThere are a number of achievements that related to this event. A few are as follows (some may differ between Pc's Achievements and Console's Challenges):\nDevelopment.\nThe original idea for the event began only with the intent to celebrate the anniversary of \"Diablo I\". The idea for the dungeon began with the desire to incorporate \"Diablo I\" music into \"Diablo III\", featuring in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;. Its design has been described as \"scope creeping\" (constantly adding new content into a project). The user interface for the mode was designed by &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Manning\"&gt;Josh Manning&lt;/a&gt; on his own time."}

In the darkness of this level grows &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mushroom\"&gt;Black Mushroom&lt;/a&gt;, needed for completion of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Calf\"&gt;Royal Calf&lt;/a&gt; quest.

Players can earn different titles depending on what type of game was completed. These are judged by &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, soft or &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;, non-expansion or an &lt;a href=\"Expansion%20Character\"&gt;Expansion Character&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; gender (in some cases). \nOnce a title has been awarded, it becomes a permanent feature and can only be changed by earning a new, higher-ranking title.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", titles no longer exist, having been replaced with &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDiablo IV.\nTitles return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". They operate on an adjective/noun principle, in that the first part of a title is a description, whereas the second part is an occupation/individual. The two parts of the title are obtained at the same time, but can be mixed and matched between them. For instance, \"Early Voyager\" and \"Initial Casualty\" are obtained by themselves, but can be arranged to form \"Early Casualty\" and \"Initial Voyager.\"\nTitles can be obtained through a vast variety of activities, which involve completing specific challenges, such as advancing in the campaign, using certain abilities a number of times or under specific circumstances, completing quest chains, exploring the world map, finding &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Lilith\"&gt;Altars of Lilith&lt;/a&gt; or killing a specific number of enemy types; there are also titles that are class-specific and even titles earned through playing a &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; character.\nMuch like in previous \"Diablo\" games, titles offer no in-game advantages or bonuses and are just cosmetic. Equipped titles appear for other players, directly under the character's name."}
