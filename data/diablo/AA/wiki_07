Some may also be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Sands\"&gt;Desolate Sands&lt;/a&gt; in .\nTheir main ability is to spawn new Risen (often two or three at a time, but always in close proximity), though they have both ranged and melee attacks as well. Wretched Mothers are usually encountered in packs with other Risen dead, though they have a tendency to stay in the back of the group and attack from range. Their spawning rate is fast enough to quickly replace losses, so three or more Wretched Mothers can easily create an endless tide of zombies.\nTips and Additional Information.\nTheir unique ability of summoning new Risen makes the Wretched Mothers a priority target. Multiple Wretched Mothers can be encountered in the wilds, and leaving them unattended can result in huge swarms of Risen.\nIt's often best to ignore the weaker Risen and focus on taking out the mothers first. Their melee damage is negligible, but Wretched Mothers will flee from melee combat.\nThe spit-attacks can (and should) be avoided easily, but in a crowd, there will be less space for maneuvering.\nThree of Wretched Mothers have to be killed to complete the bonus objective in the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Fallen%20Star\"&gt;The Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;."}

They were made as he journeyed from &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; and explored the lands of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. At least 42 entries were made\u2014the following excerpts are available.\nEntries.\nEntry 2: Caldeum.\n&lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; was once the proudest city in all of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, the trade capital of the entire world. Caldeum was never seen as the heart of the empire, even though it rivaled &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;, and later &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, in size, and those who called Caldeum their home liked it that way. Even when the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt; erupted, the battles were never tolerated to affect trade in Caldeum, for while politics and magic may be important, trifling with trade is a serious matter. Let Kurast see itself as the center of the world, they would say. We'll keep our free exchange of goods, currency, and ideas, thank you very much.\nBut the pride I once held in this great city has become tarnished and dull. In looking back on it all, now, I would have to say that this rot infecting our city started when a good number of Kurast's nobles fled their homes and took up residence in Caldeum. I have heard all the horrific and unbelievable rumors as to why they fled their great city, but the reasons did not concern us. It was their attitude that held our concern. As relief at being safe from whatever drove them here faded, their mood changed to entitlement and then, ultimately, to arrogance. They had no trouble demanding their \"rightful\" place on the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Consortium%20Council\"&gt;trade consortium council&lt;/a&gt; governing our city, and they were prepared to use their wealth to hire the mercenaries needed to see their ambitions through.\nI was initially dubious when the &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20I\"&gt;emperor of Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; emerged to confront this quickly deteriorating situation. But the charm, leadership, and intelligence that he brought to bear as he quickly resolved the conflict between our council and the Kurast nobles were nothing less than masterful. When the people fully supported him in his role as our emperor, I saw this achievement as nothing short of a miracle. Though we had always been part of the empire of Kehjistan, and therefore under his rule, we had always behaved as if we were a free entity, beholden to no one but ourselves. It truly seemed at the time that catastrophe had been averted, but now it has become all too apparent that it was merely hidden beneath a thin veneer of civility.\nThis veneer began to shed when Emperor Hakan became ill. His influence started to wane, and the mood in Caldeum changed with his health. As he got worse, so did our once fair city.\nWhen he died and his ineffectual &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;child heir&lt;/a&gt; took the throne, Caldeum began to circle the abyss. Our list of ills seems never-ending: the state of our downtrodden and the slums they are forced to live in, our incompetent leadership, the reemergence of the intolerant &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, and their quarrels with our &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; class...I could go on for pages.\nIt is all too much for one to bear, really.\nEntry 3: Encounter with Burrowing Death (part 1).\nAs I was preparing to set pen to paper to begin recording my thoughts at the beginning of my epic undertaking to gather the world's knowledge together in one tome, the hand of providence tapped me on the shoulder. The news that a rogue burrower had killed a citizen just outside the city gave me the wonderful opportunity to see firsthand one of the more disturbing creatures we share this world with \u2013 the savage &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Thresher\"&gt;dune thresher&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago driven away from settled locales to the deep desert wastes of the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;, the dune thresher is rarely seen by city dwellers. Every so often, however, whether due to injury or old age, one of these unholy beasts ventures to the edge of civilization to feast on the frail human animal. When this happens, a professional like &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Burroughs\"&gt;Franklin Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;, the famed guide and hunter, is called in to put an end to the threat.\nFortunately, Burroughs and I, both being men of travel and adventure, have naturally crossed paths before (frequent readers of my works will no doubt remember this grizzled, rough-hewn boulder of a man from my classic, &lt;a href=\"Xiansai%20Chronicles\"&gt;Xiansai Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, I contacted him so that I was able to take part in his quest to rid us of the burrowing nightmare. He acted reluctant at first, but I could tell he was happy to have me along.\nI met up with him at dusk upon the sandy rocks that ringed the &lt;a href=\"Tardein%20Wastes\"&gt;Tardein wastes&lt;/a&gt;. As I approached, Burroughs was kneeling on the black rocks, inspecting something. I looked at the indistinguishable matter he'd been staring so intently at, but I could not identify it. He held up his hand, motioning for me to step lightly. When I asked him what the problem was, he pointed to the focus of his attention and asked if I wanted to end up like that poor fool. I laughed, thinking he was playing one of his jokes on me yet again. Everyone knew that the dune threshers attacked from under the sand, and that we were safe upon the rocks!\n\"Tell that to him,\" he said.\nI looked again, and what I saw turned my stomach. The rocks betrayed the desperation with which the victim had clung to them. Left upon their bloodstained surfaces were strips of skin that had been torn from his hands and fingers.\n\"They'll jump right up onto these rocks and drag you down. An experienced hunter could survive an attack, but someone like you will be lunch if you keep stomping around here, making all that noise.\" He chuckled to himself as he made his way up to his heavily loaded wagon.\nI quickly (and quietly) moved back from the edge of the rocks. And then I heard the screeching. Burroughs had retrieved a large object, a cage of some kind, covered with a black tarp. This cage was the source of the hellish emanations. Thick ropes hung down from somewhere deep beneath its dark shroud. \"That's not far enough,\" he said. As if to prove his point, he shook the cage he was holding. Ever viler screams shot forth, cutting through my head like cold, sharp blades. But they were nothing to the sound I heard next \u2013 the deathly churning of sand that heralded the arrival of the thresher.\n\"Their sound riles a thresher up something fierce. Better get them into the sand before we have company up here.\" With that, he tore the cover off the cage. The shock of seeing what was contained within overwhelmed me immediately. Everything seemed to wash together in a kind of bland, sickening grayness, and my knees buckled.\nEntry 4: Encounter with Burrowing Death (part 2).\nAs I began to fall, Burroughs grabbed me by the scruff of my collar and shook me violently. \"You really want to feed some thresher, don't you, al-Hazir?\" he asked. \"What, haven't you seen &lt;a href=\"scavenger\"&gt;scavenger&lt;/a&gt;s before?\"\nI had indeed seen scavengers: small, burrowing creatures that feed upon carrion. Unlike most animals of this type, however, they are extremely aggressive and will not hesitate to attack those unfortunate enough to encounter them. Scavengers have powerful legs which they use for swift springing attacks, striking at vulnerable faces and throats. Their anatomy bears a striking resemblance to that of the &lt;a href=\"leaper\"&gt;leaper&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; desert, and thus, many researchers classify the two groups as part of the same family of creatures. An ensorcelled (some say &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic) variant is known to have plagued adventurers in the &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; region twenty-odd years ago as well. Scavengers were also the cause of an extremely distressing episode during my youth, which I need not relate at this juncture.\n\"Yep. Burrowers to catch a burrower,\" he said. He then took the lengths of rope hanging from the cage and impaled them on the ground using a heavy pike. He also attached what looked like long knives to the sides of his heavy, scarred boots, and drove the blades into the ground.\n\"You'd better get out of the way.\" And with that, while holding onto the ropes, he undid the latching mechanism on the side of the cage. He then threw it out onto the sand. The cage exploded outward with the scavengers' frantic attempts to escape their confines. I barely had time to wonder how Burroughs had been able to get the collars (that the ropes were attached to) around the scavengers' necks before the vicious beasts had burrowed into the soft ground.\nI was extremely tense by this point. I felt naked and exposed. What insanity had convinced me that coming out here was a good idea?\nI looked out over the wastes in the fading light, trying to detect the telltale horned fins of the thresher cutting through the surface of the sand.\nWith absolutely no warning, the dune thresher violently broke the surface, all three scavengers caught in his horrifying maw. There was a massive explosion of sand as the thresher dove back into the ground with its prize. The ropes immediately snapped taut, and I thought Burroughs would be pulled to his death. I didn't understand how he thought he could reel in a monster that huge, but he wasn't even trying \u2013 just holding on.\nAfter several tense seconds that stretched towards eternity, the rope began making weird jerking motions.\n\"Ah. The little buggers are doing their work.\" He smiled a ghastly smile. \"Shouldn't be long now.\"\nA few more moments of this strangeness passed, and the thrashing of the ropes became less and less. Finally, he began to haul his catch in. When it was partially on the rocks, I could see what had happened. The thresher had swallowed the scavengers whole, and they, in turn, had begun eating their way out of the thresher's stomach before the beast's digestive juices had killed them. One scavenger still clung to life, but barely. It had actually dug itself halfway out of the thresher, clawing at the air as its skin was slowly eaten away. I vomited.\nBurroughs, laughing at me once again as he cut off the beast's triangular head, began lecturing me on the amazing dune thresher: the dynamics of its jutting, angular lower jaw, which cuts a path through the soil; the way this jaw design enables the thresher to swim effortlessly beneath the sand with unimaginable swiftness; and much more that I didn't care to hear just then. I nodded my head weakly and wondered how long it would be before I could politely get myself home and crawl into bed.\nEntry 6: Borderlands.\nAfter my encounter with the savage dune thresher (see Encounter with Burrowing Death, entry 004), one might think it natural were I hesitant to venture into the wastes surrounding Caldeum. Those who have set foot upon the Borderlands' burning yellow landscape and looked out upon its miles of barren sand roiling with terrible wildlife would surely agree with this sentiment.\nIt was not always thus. In years past, I could have ventured forth with no concern for my safety. Though the Borderlands are among the most savage habitats in our world, even these deadly lands were no match for the superior resolve of Caldeum in its prime.\nThe Borderlands were originally devoid of any but the most hardened (some would say crazed) prospectors until the great military city of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Bahadur\"&gt;Lut Bahadur&lt;/a&gt; (literally, \"city of the gate\") was built to keep the &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt; in their cliff dwellings safely away from Caldeum. Lut Bahadur's solitary watch over the desolate wastes came to an end four hundred years ago when precious ore was discovered in the region known as the &lt;a href=\"Stinging%20Winds\"&gt;Stinging Winds&lt;/a&gt;. The town of &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt; was quickly established as the center of all mining in the area, with several other smaller settlements springing up in its wake. When the &lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur oasis&lt;/a&gt; was discovered and a third town was erected there, Caldeum's dominance over the Borderlands was complete. The Borderlands could reliably depend on fresh supplies of food and water from Dahlgur's caravans, protected by the might of Caldeum's &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Guard\"&gt;Dune Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut Hakan II, our young and inexperienced sovereign, has seen fit to withdraw the support of Caldeum from the wastes and leave those who live there to their own devices. Now, no caravan is safe, and refugees from the Borderlands beat against the gates of Caldeum in an endless wave of displaced humanity, desperate for the salvation our city once provided. I have spoken with many of these poor folk at length, and the tales they share would give even the most stalwart adventurer pause. Though their stories of a secret cult intent on raising a demonic army are obviously embellished due to their lack of knowledge pertaining to such things, their hysteria and suffering have convinced me that something terrible indeed stalks the Borderlands.\nEntry 7: The Wizard.\nOwing to my lack of tolerance for those who would use &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; towards their own nefarious ends, many have assumed that I am averse to the practice of the magical arts on a philosophical level. Nothing could be farther from the truth. My quarrel is with those sorcerers who dismiss the ancient traditions and teachings \u2013 teachings that have been honed over millennia in order to preserve respect for authority and the rule of law.\nRecently the youth of Caldeum have fallen prey to the overblown stories of just such a &lt;a href=\"Li-Ming\"&gt;delinquent wizard&lt;/a&gt;. That is correct: I used the uncouth term &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that even the title of a civilized magic wielder is too restrictive for this young upstart. Through my contacts at the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; of the mage clans, I am one of the few who actually know the truth behind the rumors now sweeping our streets regarding this hellion who flaunts her magic irresponsibly.\nThis wizard was sent here to spend her formative years under the tutelage of the best mages in the world. Well, it seems they neglected to teach our wizard manners on her native island of &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt;, for she was a rude and uncooperative student from the very beginning. Originally under the guidance of the &lt;a href=\"Zann%20Esu\"&gt;Zann Esu&lt;/a&gt; mage clan, she was eventually handed over to the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that their strict and unbending discipline would break her anarchic spirit. Yet even the esteemed Vizjerei instructors were unable to rein her in. She was continually being caught seeking out dangerous and forbidden magics, heedless of the consequences to herself or anyone around her.\nAlthough there is no truth to the tales that she actually ventured into the infamous &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Depths\"&gt;Bitter Depths&lt;/a&gt; below the Sanctum, she was caught in the Ancient Repositories, where the most dangerous incantations are housed for the safety of the public. When confronted by the great Vizjerei mage &lt;a href=\"Valthek\"&gt;Valthek&lt;/a&gt; and demanded to account for herself, she brazenly attacked him rather than face the punishment merited by her acts. Exaggerated stories of the battle are already being inflated to mythic proportions by the more rebellious of our city's youth, but suffice it to say that she did not actually best Yshari's most powerful mage in single, honorable combat. The details of the encounter remain unclear, as Valthek has yet to regain consciousness, but it has been verified by reliable sources that she relied on trickery and deceit to bring the great man low. I have also been assured that the extensive property damage was chiefly the result of Valthek's magical prowess, not the upstart wizard's. As to where she is now, no one rightly knows, for she fled the city immediately after the encounter.\nIt is not my goal to alarm, but I find this situation disturbing. We now have a rebellious wizard, young and inexperienced, wandering the world, dabbling in powerful magics she does not understand. Those wiser than you or I determined long ago that certain schools of magic were too dangerous and forbade their practice. It is those magics that this wizard seems determined to explore \u2013 magics centered on manipulating the primal forces from which reality is constructed. Imagine, a headstrong nineteen-year-old youth, able to warp time itself to her will! The thought is truly terrifying. It is my honest hope that this self-styled wizard chooses never to return to Caldeum.\nEntry 8: The Skeletal Undead.\nThe &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; are a pox upon our world, yet no one sees fit to look into their existence and find a way to rid us of them once and for all. How long until we are confronted by the terrifying specter of an undead army of skeletal warriors raised by some crazed sorcerer or would-be demigod? Do not let the scarce reports of skeleton attacks lull you into assuming we are safe; we are never safe from these unholy legions. They are coming, mark my words.\nDespite the fact that &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s seem mischievous or imbecilic, they are nothing to scoff at. We should neither dismiss them from our consideration, nor ignore the problem they represent. It is far past the time for serious inquiry into their exact nature. Since I am overly qualified on many subjects pertinent to this area of inquiry, apparently it falls to me to rectify this lack of understanding. After completing many months of long, arduous study, I now present the information I have gleaned from my research into these unholy monstrosities.\nContrary to what I had assumed, a reanimated skeleton is actually constructed from bits and pieces of any number of different skeletons, not a single one. Their diverse composition gives them the ability to form and reform, and makes them easily summoned, permitted there is adequate raw material at hand. Still, this is not to say that a skilled &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; could not call forth a cadre of skeletal warriors to do his bidding anywhere he chooses. He merely requires less effort to construct a skeleton army in a graveyard than in the middle of a forest.\nFurthermore, I have come to believe that a skeleton's intelligence is limited by the power and scope of the spell used in the creature's creation. Theoretically one could have a single astute skeleton servant or a rather dense army of a hundred for the same expenditure of magical energy. I am at a loss to explain the average skeleton's somewhat ludicrous mental predisposition, however. Perhaps the implausibility of its own existence makes the skeleton think it hilarious to hide in a barrel, cackling intermittently for some three hundred years until a victim happens by?\nIn contrast to the other undead horrors our world has been plagued with \u2013 namely the mindless &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and the pack-hunting &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s \u2013 skeletons are much more dangerous as a whole because of their ability to be organized and directed. Based on the evidence, it takes only slightly more energy to imbue skeletons with enough intelligence to use shields to defend themselves and their allies. These \"&lt;a href=\"shield%20skeleton\"&gt;shield skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s\", as I like to call them, are alarmingly common, though not as numerous as a basic skeletal warrior.\nIf my aforementioned points do not convince the skeptic of the gravity of this issue, consider the case of the &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Summoner\"&gt;skeletal summoner&lt;/a&gt;. This advanced skeletal warrior is specifically created with a higher intelligence that gives it the ability to replenish the undead ranks as needed. Yes, adding summoners to the unholy, undead mix results in a nauseating recipe for a self-sustaining army, capable of renewing itself in perpetuity so as to fulfill whatever diabolical ends its master called it forth to pursue.\nIt should be apparent to all intelligent readers that any madman needs only the raw material of skeletal remains to create these armies of the undead. The obvious solution is to disinter the graveyards and begin burning the skeletons posthaste. Only then can we be certain that we have removed this deadly threat from the arsenal of those who would do us harm.\nEntry 9: Khazra.\nThe &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; (colloquially known as \"goatmen\") were long thought to be natural inhabitants of our world, akin to the &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt; \"panther-men\" tribes of the desert and mountain regions, but I have recently discovered evidence revealing that nothing could be further from the truth. The history of the khazra is much more complex and disturbing than has been previously imagined.\nAccording to ancient carvings that I have succeeded in translating, the khazra were originally human, part of the &lt;a href=\"umbaru\"&gt;umbaru&lt;/a&gt; race found in the thick &lt;a href=\"Torajan%20jungles\"&gt;Torajan jungles&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Teganze\"&gt;Teganze&lt;/a&gt; region of the eastern continent. At some point in the distant past, the five clans that would come to be known as the khazra migrated to higher elevations and began developing along different lines than the clansmen they left behind. They lived in relative peace and began the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to a farming one. This state of affairs changed dramatically when they encountered the Vizjerei about two thousand years ago (if my translations prove to be correct).\nThis was the height of the Mage Clan Wars, and even the mighty Vizjerei mage clan was showing signs of stress brought about by the prolonged struggle. A faction of the Vizjerei resolved to construct an army using demon-possessed victims, and the peaceful umbaru clans seemed to fit the Vizjerei's needs. It is unknown how the clans first came into contact with the Vizjerei, but within the span of a decade or so, some of the future khazra clans had turned from their peaceful existence to all-out warfare with the Vizjerei. This was surely the result of seeing their brothers being painfully transformed into savage goat-like creatures by the Vizjerei.\nThough they were primitive by the standards of the Vizjerei, the umbaru clans held the powerful mages at bay through familiarity with the terrain and sheer ferocity. But this state of affairs could not hold forever. As decades of savage warfare took their toll on the umbaru's culture and minds, the clans began to search for any means to prevail over their enemies. In fact, they lost sight of anything else.\nExact details on what transpired next are scarce, but I have ascertained that at some point during the next two hundred years they decided to use the Vizjerei's strength against them. To this end, the clans actively sought to capture a mage to do their bidding. Eventually they succeeded in violently coercing one of their captives to help them not only gain control over their transformed clan mates, but to have themselves transformed as well in order to fully drive the Vizjerei out of the Teganze.\nTheir strategy worked, but it was not without its price. They found themselves bound in servitude to the demon &lt;a href=\"Zagraal\"&gt;Zagraal&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their cursed power (note that I neither endorse nor dismiss theories of a \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hell&lt;/a&gt;\" by the use of the term demon; it is simply used here in its original intent: to describe a being of malevolent or loathsome origin). They became furious marauders, driven to raid villages and caravans to sate their bloodlust and procure sacrificial victims for their demonic master. This is also when they became known as khazra, which roughly translates as \"demon\" or \"devil\" in the umbaru tongue.\nAfter years of this terror, their previous brothers, the umbaru of the lower Teganze, sent their sacred &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; warriors to eradicate the khazra's threat to the region. Filled with otherworldly power, the witch doctors cut a swath of destruction through the khazra until they confronted Zagraal himself. In a now-legendary battle, the valiant heroes fought to the last man before finally bringing Zagraal down.\nThe khazra continued to wage war on humanity, but without a source of demonic power to draw from, they became weak. Despite a slight unexplained resurgence twenty or so years ago, their fury steadily drained from them until they became the sluggish and muddled beings we know today.\nAddendum: While researching the various hostile wildlife that adventurers regularly encounter in their work, I have been informed that the khazra have regained some of their lost vim and vigor and are once again ferociously attacking humans. As of this writing, such reports remain uncorroborated by reliable sources.\nEntry 10: The Fallen Ones.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20One%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;fallen ones&lt;/a&gt; are a unique breed of true demonic origin, one of the few that I've been able to conclusively verify through sources other than the ancient Vizjerei tomes in my possession. (How I came by said tomes will, of necessity, remain my secret.)\nAs my readers are well aware, early Vizjerei writings are often little more than self-serving propaganda aimed at whitewashing heinous deeds committed by the mage clan. For instance, we now know that the goatmen were unwitting human victims of an ancient Vizjerei power struggle (see entry 009 for more detailed information on the khazra's tragic history), whereas the ancient Vizjerei texts would have us believe that they were actually demons - lieutenants of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, no less!\nThrough diligent cross-referencing with other manuscripts in my vast library, however, I have ascertained that the Vizjerei depiction of the creatures known as the fallen ones is factually correct.\nTo quote volume 5 of the &lt;a href=\"Demonicus%20de%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Demonicus de Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;:\nFallen Ones (NANUS IMPROBUS)\nAs hard as it is to believe, the fallen ones were once exalted demons of the Burning Hells. They served as &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;'s hands, performing acts that he would not, could not involve himself in. They were the instrument of Azmodan's first failed attempt to usurp power from &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and his brothers, and after that failure, the fallen were subjected to the full wrath of Diablo. They were twisted into small, ridiculous imps, in contrast to their previously powerful forms. Moreover, if they expected Azmodan to reverse their condition, they were sadly mistaken. The infuriated Azmodan held them responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;' continued reign, and so he left the fallen in their new bodies, where their degradation would serve to amuse him for all eternity. Their failure provided him with the information he required to succeed in dethroning Diablo and his brothers - the event now known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;\" - but that fact did nothing to soften his heart toward the fallen.\nWhen unleashed upon our realm by their master, Azmodan, these impish terrors display a tendency to swarm like flesh-hungry locusts, and they have been known to tear apart a sleeping village in minutes. Small of stature and simian in appearance, these creatures possess surprising strength and unnatural agility. Other than feasting on human flesh, the only act that gives these unspeakable horrors pleasure is breeding; hence the tendency to encounter them in large packs.\nHowever, due to their small size, cowardice appears to be one of the chief features of this species. They quickly retreat when one of their brethren falls in battle.\nFallen ones display no obvious tendency towards greater organization beyond their predisposition to swarm. This is fortunate for &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, for they are so numerous that if they were to band together in large numbers, they might easily overwhelm a small city.\n\"Through further research, I have identified five distinct types of fallen:\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Imp\"&gt;IMPS&lt;/a&gt; - \"These are the commonest of the fallen family of demons. They are the stereotypical fallen ones in look and behavior: small, red, swarming, bloodthirsty, and cowardly.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;SHAMAN&lt;/a&gt; - \"Fallen shaman priests lead camps of fallen. I have also heard it rumored that they possess the ability to raise imps from the dead!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Lunatic\"&gt;LUNATIC&lt;/a&gt; - \"These enraged, oversized fallen creatures are bloated seemingly to the point of bursting, an impression buttressed by the fact that these insane demons rush their intended victims and then stab themselves until they explode. A more fitting name could not be found for these maniacal beings.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Overseer\"&gt;OVERSEER&lt;/a&gt; - \"The fallen overseer drives his smaller impish charges into a frenzy with his ape-like leaping and growling. An overseer among a group of fallen is a dangerous thing, as the cowardice that usually characterizes them is overwhelmed by fear of their much larger brethren.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Hound\"&gt;HOUNDS&lt;/a&gt; - \"These slobbering abominations are commonly found among groups of the fallen and are utilized as guard animals, beasts of burden, or even food by their demonic masters. These beasts are loyal to a fault, regardless of the abuse heaped upon them.\"\n\"I suspect the existence of at least two other types of fallen, but I will need to conduct further research before I reveal my theories as to the ultimate familial structure of these fiends.\"\nEntry 13: Witch Doctor.\nMost believe the fearsome witch doctor of the umbaru race a legend, but I have seen one in battle with my own eyes. And it was difficult to believe, even then. He dispatched his opponent with terrifying precision, assaulting his victim's mind and body with elixirs and powders that evoked fires, explosions, and poisonous spirits. As if these assaults were not enough, the witch doctor also had at his command the ability to summon undead creatures from the netherworld to rend the flesh from his enemy's body.\nI came upon this rare display as I ventured deep into the interior of the dense Torajan jungles that cover the southern tip of the great eastern continent, in the vast area known as the Teganze, with the goal of seeking out the tribes that reside there. This area is extremely secluded, and heretofore unseen by foreign eyes. I was fortunate to befriend the witch doctor I saw in battle, and, through him, his tribe: the &lt;a href=\"Tribe%20of%20the%20Five%20Hills\"&gt;Tribe of the Five Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe culture of the umbaru of the lower Teganze is fascinating and perplexing to those hailing from more civilized walks of life. For instance, the Tribe of the Five Hills frequently engages in tribal warfare with both the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20of%20the%20Seven%20Stones\"&gt;Clan of the Seven Stones&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tribe%20of%20the%20Clouded%20Valley\"&gt;Tribe of the Clouded Valley&lt;/a&gt;, but these are matters of ritual and not of conquest. I had heard tales that these wars are waged in order that the victors may replenish their supply of raw materials for the human sacrifices that their civilization revolves around, and when I timidly asked my hosts more about this topic, I must admit their laughter made me fear for my safety. However, through stumbled attempts at communication of such complex topics as what constitutes heroism and honor in their society, I gathered that only those taken in battle are considered worthy of the ritual sacrifice, much to my relief.\nUpon further discussions with my hosts, I discovered that these tribes define themselves by their belief in the Mbwiru Eikura, which roughly translates to \"The &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Unformed Land&lt;/a&gt;\" (this is an imprecise translation, as this concept is completely foreign to our culture and language). This belief holds that the true, sacred reality is veiled behind the physical one we normally experience. Their vitally important public ceremonies are centered upon sacrifices to the life force that flows from their gods, who inhabit the Unformed Land, into this lesser physical realm.\nThe witch doctors are finely attuned to this Unformed Land and are able to train their minds to perceive this reality through a combination of rituals and the use of selected roots and herbs found in the jungles. They call the state in which they interact with this other world the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Trance\"&gt;Ghost Trance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlongside the primacy of the belief in the life force and the Unformed Land, the second most sacred belief of the tribes is their philosophy of self-sacrifice and non-individuality, of suppressing one's self-interest for the good of the tribe. This idea, so foreign to our culture, struck me as something I wished to delve into much more deeply.\nUnfortunately, there was intense social upheaval among the tribes due to an incident involving their most current war (inasmuch as I could discern in the ensuing bedlam), and the charged atmosphere warranted my quick departure before I could ask anything further of my hosts\nEntry 16: New Tristram.\nWe have all heard the tales associated with Tristram. The very mention of its name brings to mind images of undead monstrosities, demonic possession, &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;monarchy&lt;/a&gt; driven to lunacy, and, of course, the greatest legend of all: the Lord of Terror unleashed. Although many now claim that a peculiar mold upon the bread or perhaps a fouling of the water drove the populace mad with visions, I have seen too much in my varied travels to dismiss such stories out of hand. It is within this context, then, that I have to say my journey to what is now called \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;\" was somewhat of a disappointment.\nNew Tristram has been in existence for several years, though the exact date of its founding is unclear. Originally simply a collection of merchants looking to profit on adventurers and travelers drawn by legends of riches within the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;old cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, it slowly set down roots and became an established town. As soon as the cathedral was looted bare, however, the adventurers and travelers stopped coming, and New Tristram found itself in decline. The town is now comprised mostly of depressing shacks; the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Calf%20Inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; is the only building that looks even the least bit habitable.\nBefore I took my leave of this dreary place, I was cornered by an eccentric &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;old man&lt;/a&gt; who seemed to have an endless supply of anecdotes and folksy wisdom to impart. He went on about there still being much of value deep within the cathedral in the form of tomes of ancient origin and wisdom. I will have to take his word for it, for I must admit that while I did explore the burnt remains of the \"old\" Tristram, I lacked the intestinal fortitude to do much more than take a few hesitating steps within that infamous cathedral of legend.\nEntry 17: Tristram Cathedral.\nAfter seeing the remains of Tristram for myself, I felt the need to search out further information on what it was about the corridors and dungeons underneath its old cathedral that held such mystique.\nOriginally built as a &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; monastery sometime around 912 (see my entries pertaining to ancient mystical traditions for more information on the secretive Horadric order), the building was later converted to a Zakarum cathedral. Legend has it that the original monastery was built over the vault where the mythical Diablo was imprisoned, and that his supposed release led to the horrors we all now associate with the name Tristram.\nIn order to shed light on the many mysteries of the old cathedral, I sought out an old adventurer who had braved its ancient passageways, which were said to lead to the Hells themselves.\n\"We'd all heard about the weird goings-on in Tristram, but we were drawn by the prospect of getting our hands on some of that loot we heard they were bringing up by the cartload.\" He paused thoughtfully for a moment and scratched the stub where his left arm had once been. \"It ever strike you as strange that wherever monsters are stirring up trouble, that's where you'll find the most treasure? Why can't there ever be a big haul in a safe place?\" Obviously he was attempting to ease his tension by making light of the whole event.\n\"When we got to Tristram, we took our time before we got down to the business of actually going into the cathedral. Town had a &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;nice inn&lt;/a&gt;, if I recollect. Truth is, there was something evil coming out of that old church: you could feel it. Now, me and my mates, we didn't want to admit we were scared, so after we ran out of excuses to avoid it, we made our way inside. And let me tell you, I never smelled death like I did in that place. Once inside, we were set upon by the undead,\" and he paused to see if I would laugh in disbelief at this.\nWhen I didn't, he continued, \"That's right, undead. I've faced the undead several times, but you never get used to it. You think you're prepared, but there's just something that sticks in your gut, this horrible feeling. Your hands get slick with sweat, and your sword is hard to grasp correctly...you really doubt your sanity in being down there, facing something like that. And the stench is unimaginable. But we were pulling ourselves through \u2013 I had started to come out the other side, where you start to ease into that unsettled feeling and use it to drive yourself forward.\"\nIt was at this point that his mood noticeably darkened. I found myself easing a bit closer so as not to miss a single detail.\n\"Then it started to go wrong. We began encountering these, these dark...things...imps or demons...or fallen, I think they're called. There were so many of them, all horns and flashes of red, attacking us from all sides. I don't think you could ever really be prepared for something like that. We got disoriented, which was easy to do. It was so dark...\n\"And then we heard this...this horrid voice that I can only describe as the sound of a saw ripping through bone.\n\"I can't even recollect what he was saying. I was so terrified I don't think I could understand it, but he kept repeating it, over and over.\" The adventurer shuddered at the remembrance.\n\"He was this &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;bloated thing&lt;/a&gt;...and ...and there was blood, and bodies \u2013 everywhere I turned, some new horror confronted me. And suddenly he was on us; we couldn't shake him. &lt;a href=\"Jeremy\"&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; fell first, and then I ran. I admit it: I ran, left my fellows to die. I couldn't face that thing; it was all just too horrible. He hit me with a glancing blow as I fled, but even that was enough to take my arm almost clean off. I had to have a &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; finish the job...\"\nAt this point he trailed off, lost in whatever regrets he has endured to this day.\nEntry 20: Gnarled Walkers.\nAs beautiful as a walk through the Tristram wilderness is, with its lush fields and picturesque rivers, the air seems to take on an otherworldly foreboding as one approaches the fishing village of &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;. My search to catalog the weird, the fabulous, and the all-too-often-dangerous inhabitants of our world had led me there. I hoped to find a guide who could bring me safely into the &lt;a href=\"Festering%20Woods\"&gt;Festering Woods&lt;/a&gt; and back, for I had come to see for myself the strange creatures that are the \"&lt;a href=\"gnarled%20walker\"&gt;gnarled walker&lt;/a&gt;s\".\nWhat then, you may ask, is a gnarled walker? Is it simply an ensorcelled walking tree \u2013 a wood wraith \u2013 or is it something more? Does it truly live? These are the questions I sought to answer as I strode into the village of Wortham that bright day, which had somehow turned dark and dreary while my attention was elsewhere. But the few people I encountered in Wortham were a taciturn lot, unwilling to answer my inquiries.\nAs I inspected my way around the moribund town, it was impossible to ignore the fact that the bridge I hoped to take to the Festering Wood had been destroyed, burned beyond repair. My questions about this circumstance went unanswered. I likewise found it odd that there seemed to be only elderly people in the village, with the exception of one beautiful young woman whose father was quite insistent I keep my distance from her. Though he was rude on this point, I found him to be a rather sociable sort once convinced I was not interested in his daughter. He introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20DeSoto\"&gt;Pablo DeSoto&lt;/a&gt;, and as luck would have it, he was very knowledgeable about several topics in regards to magic and the object of my search.\nAccording to Master DeSoto, the Festering Woods derives its name from the fact that everything in it seethes and roils with evil intent: even the ground itself has been known to rise up and devour a person. When pushed further in regards to the gnarled walkers specifically, he pontificated at length as to their true nature. He maintained they are vile mystical creatures from another realm who can only sustain their existence in our world by sapping life energy from men or animals. These heinous beings have shifted their appearance to that of trees, thereby luring their prey close so as to consume it whole and enrich their reserves of dark power. These beastly things move ponderously, and some are known to exude a foul stench that poisons their victims. Master DeSoto is certain the origin of the walkers, and of the Festering Wood itself, can be traced to the foul doings of necromancers, who he claims are responsible for much of the evil that has befallen our world. He expounded in full to me his theory that the \"whole Diablo incident\", as he called it, was tied up in their dark arts as well.\nRegardless as to whether that is the truth of the matter or not, I felt fortunate that I was unable to find a guide to bring me into the Festering Wood. Upon hearing of what transpires there, I have decided it is far better suited to the adventuring temperament than my own.\nEntry 25: Barbarian.\nIn my journey to catalogue the various denizens, civilizations, and fauna of our world, I have traveled far and wide, but never before have I been struck with such dismay as when standing upon the ramparts of the ancient fortress of &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. I came to see firsthand the barbarians, those near-legendary, immense, relentless, dual-wielding furies of combat dwelling upon their sacred &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstead, I stand here looking at a mountain that has been torn asunder by some extraordinary force. The sight, I must confess, is incomprehensible. Yet what I see before me cannot be denied.\nWhat truly happened here? Where are those &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;majestic warriors&lt;/a&gt; of old?\nThough they were once misunderstood as simple, bloodthirsty invaders, the long and noble history of these proud people is now rightly acknowledged. And therein lies the greater tragedy here, for those of us familiar with the nobility of the barbarians remember too what they call their \"vigil\", the concept that lay at the very heart of their culture. The barbarians consider it their sworn duty to protect Mount Arreat and the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;mysterious object&lt;/a&gt; within. They believe that if they fail to uphold their duty to the great mount, or are not given a proper burial upon its slopes, they will be denied a true warrior's death, and their spirits shall roam the land without honor for all eternity.\nIf there are any barbarians left alive, they must truly be without hope. Perhaps this is the genesis of the rumors of monstrous things reported to resemble the barbarians in size and ferocity, but that are in reality nothing more than unreasoning, inhuman beasts. Could the destruction of not only their home but also their very beliefs have actually brought this magnificent race so low?\nEntry 32: The Monk.\nThe last weeks of autumn had settled upon &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, and the first breath of winter had crept into the air. As night fell and the sun dipped below the horizon, I was all too grateful to take refuge in a tavern. As I entered, I noted a certain tension in the room. Despite the hour, it was not busy, with only scattered, small groups huddled at the tables around the edges of the room. The benches at the center of the room were empty except for one man.\nThe man seemed ignorant of the cold. He was dressed like a beggar, wearing little more than an orange sheet wound around his body, leaving half of his chest exposed. A garland of large wooden beads hung around his thick neck. His head was completely shaved, with the exception of a wild bushy beard. Then, recognition struck me: upon his forehead he had a tattoo of two red dots, one larger than the other. As any informed student of the peoples and cultures of this world must also realize, this man was one of the &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monks of Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, the secretive and reclusive holy warriors of the country.\nI had heard countless fantastic stories about the monks, tales that were surely the beneficiary of significant embellishment. The monks\u2019 skin, the accounts said, was as hard as iron, impenetrable by the blade of any sword or by the point of any arrow, and their fists could break stone as easily as you or I would snap a twig. Though the unassuming man before me seemed miles away from what I had heard and read of the monks, I approached cautiously, sliding down onto the bench across from him, eager to take his measure. He beckoned me forward with a small wave of his hand.\n\"Ah, a soul brave enough to sit with me. Come, friend.\"\nFood was placed before me, but I had little hunger for it, focusing instead on recording the details of the monk's life. He told me of his belief in the existence of a thousand and one gods, gods he believed could be found in all things: the fire in the hearth, the water in the river and the air that we breathed. Pretty enough for a story, perhaps. But any reasoned individual must surely, as I did, scoff at such a view of the world as little more than superstition. He went on to describe his intense mental and physical training, his unending quest to hone his mind and body into an instrument of divine justice. Though I do wonder for what need his thousand gods would require a mortal man to implement their will. When I asked him why he did not carry a sword or, indeed, any weapon at all, he simply replied, \"My body is my weapon.\" Then raising his hand and tapping his forehead, he added, \"As is my mind.\"\nMost unexpectedly, I would be treated to a display of this mastery.\nA group of men approached our table, knocking my book to the floor and shoving me out of the way, producing knives and other weapons as they advanced. They were focused only on the solitary figure of the monk seated across from me. I scrabbled beneath the table, having an inkling of what was to come. I watched as at some unseen signal, they attacked.\nWithout rising from his seat, the monk met the first man's lunging slash, grabbing his wrist and tossing him carelessly over his shoulder, throwing him into a table with a loud crash. The suddenness of the monk's attack momentarily stunned the men, and as they stood there, he rose.\nThat was when chaos broke out.\nThe monk was a fluid mass of restrained energy, meeting every attack with hardly a moment's distress. He fought with hands and feet in a way I had never seen before. In my days, I have witnessed my share of drunken bar brawls, but this was something else altogether. The sound of bones crunching with each of his strikes mixed with something I could not quite believe: the monk was laughing as he fought. One by one, he dispatched his foes until only one remained.\nThat one picked up a chair and hurled it toward the monk. The monk swung his arm forward and struck the incoming projectile, meeting the solid oak of the chair with his closed fist. The wood broke apart, splinters filling the air as the shattered pieces of the stool fell harmlessly to the ground around him.\n\"You don't fool me, demon,\" the monk spat. He pulled his arms back to his sides, then extended his hands before him and began to chant. A nimbus of white light appeared around his head, growing larger and more intense until it completely encompassed the monk\u2019s body. He roared, and the light blew outward. As it washed over the other man, his skin peeled away, revealing a red-skinned demon beneath and threw the creature through the front doors of the tavern.\nThe monk hurtled forward, but his individual movements were too fast for my eyes to track. It seemed as though there were seven of him raining blows upon the demon from every side. Staggered, the demon stumbled. The monk grabbed the demon by the neck, grinning as he pulled his free arm back, crackling energy glowing on his open hand. He shoved his palm forward, and when it struck the demon, its body exploded: muscle, skin and bones tore apart, and the smell of burning flesh filled the air.\nI would not have believed it if I had not seen it with my own two eyes. It seems the stories of these peerless warriors might not have been as exaggerated as I first thought.\nEntry 35: The Demon Hunters.\nI have just returned from my travels on the edge of the frozen wasteland known as the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;, a once-beautiful place forever changed by some great calamity in its history. Now, only ruined cities and bleak landscapes remain, no place for any living thing. I was headed for the village of &lt;a href=\"Bronn\"&gt;Bronn&lt;/a&gt; for the night, but when I arrived, I found a scene of devastation such as I had never seen before. I should have fled at the first sign of danger, but my curiosity drove me forward. Most of the town's buildings had been burnt to their foundations, and a few charred timbers were the only sign of where they had once stood. Ash choked my lungs. There were bodies strewn everywhere, many dismembered and some even half consumed. The city was abandoned.\nOr so I thought.\nFrom the husk of the inn, one of the few buildings still standing, monstrous, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Berserker\"&gt;gray-skinned creatures&lt;/a&gt; burst forth, shouting in some infernal tongue. They were masses of misshapen flesh, of sinewy muscle made for battle. Helpless, I stood frozen as they drew close. The one in the lead seized me by the front of my cloak and lifted me from the ground, its claws tearing through fabric and skin. Its breath was hot on my face, and I was assaulted by the putrid smell of rotten flesh. Its mouth yawned wide, and I saw rows of sharpened teeth, yellowed and stained with blood. I thought only of the shame that my voice would be silenced, never to illuminate another of the wonders of our world for you, my loyal readers.\nA sharp sound whistled by my ear, and a &lt;a href=\"Crossbows\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; bolt sprouted from the eye of the beast before me, spraying my face with its burning blood. It howled an inhuman cry of pain and threw me to the ground, grabbing at the quarrel. The other creatures scanned for this unseen attacker, and I was forgotten for the moment. From the ground at their feet, I tore my head around to see where the bolt had come from.\nThat was when I saw a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunters\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Valla\"&gt;girl&lt;/a&gt; could have been no more than twenty. She emerged from the shadows cast by the setting sun and wasted no time in dispatching the rest of my attackers. Her hands worked twin crossbows, launching a glowing arc of flaming bolts over my head, blanketing the hulking monsters. Every shot found its mark in one of the horned beasts, felling the lot of them. From the corner of my eye, I saw more of the savage brutes sneaking up on her from behind. My voice froze in my throat as I tried to scream a warning. I needn't have worried: she was not unaware. The hunter reached into her belt and rolled a trio of strange metal spheres into their path. The monsters looked down just as the contraptions exploded into light and flame, stunning them. It gave her enough time to round on them, her crossbows dispatching them one by one.\nWith a last look over the town, apparently satisfied that no danger remained for her, she came forward, shaking her head sadly. There was a look of profound disappointment on her face as she returned the crossbows to her sides, hidden by the folds of her cloak.\n\"No survivors,\" she said bitterly.\nThey call themselves the demon hunters, a group of fanatical warriors sworn to a single purpose: the destruction of the creatures of the Burning Hells. The demon hunters number in the hundreds and make their home in the Dreadlands so that they can live and train without the interference of any nation that would worry over having such a fearsome group camped within its borders (though at any time over half are dispatched across the world like this girl, seeking hellspawn). There is something in all demon hunters that gives them the strength to resist the demonic corruption that would drive lesser men to madness. They hone this power, for their resistance to this taint enables them to use the demons' power as a weapon. But their mission and their power are not all that bind them together.\nThat night, the girl told me of her life, about how, as a child, the demons had descended upon her town. She had watched as demons destroyed her home, setting her village to the torch. They murdered everyone she knew and stole from her everyone she loved. She should have died with them, but she fled, hiding from the hellspawn for days until she was found by a demon hunter who saw the strength in her and took her in as one of their own. Each and every demon hunter, she told me, has a story like this.\nThey are the survivors, and they are searching for vengeance.\nEntry 39: The Unburied.\nSomething is dreadfully wrong. Fear is in the air; I can feel it. I was but days out of Tristram when I saw a screaming &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;ball of flame&lt;/a&gt; rip across the sky. Surely enough, soon after witnessing this harbinger of doom, I stumbled upon a badly mangled traveler. He was barely able to spit out the tale of the cursed monstrosity responsible for his broken body as his life drifted away. He called his killer \"the &lt;a href=\"unburied\"&gt;unburied&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMonths ago, when I wrote of the undead blight upon our land, I thought them the gravest of threats. But they are nothing compared to the new undead creature described to me by this poor fellow.\nHe was a law officer of sorts, a local guard out looking into the depraved handiwork of a crazed individual, the sort we seem to be seeing more and more of in these dark days. When the guard happened upon a mass grave dug by this sick fool, a massive, horned, disgusting behemoth was digging itself out. The dying traveler described this loathsome beast \u2013 or, as he termed it, the unburied \u2013 as being comprised of bloated parts from many fetid, rotting corpses, with a multitude of disfigured heads and slobbering fanged mouths. He was fortunate that day, but when he returned with several men to help him deal with the creature, they found to their horror that the undead spawn was too much for even their combined efforts. They fought valiantly to the last man, sacrificing themselves to keep the beast from rampaging across the countryside and taking who knows how many innocent lives. He was the last survivor, and before he passed on, he proudly told me that they were successful in eradicating the foul unburied creature.\nBeing born out of pits of human misery, these beings feed on human suffering. Wherever bodies are dumped together unceremoniously, the unburied may rise. I cannot help but wonder if this be some sort of cosmic justice for our inhumanity to our fellow man. But what is the catalyst? What animates these things? What makes them so horrendously different from the run-of-the-mill zombies or \"normal\" skeletal undead?\nSome days I truly feel that the end of humanity must be at hand. Certainly our world is home to assorted disturbing and unsettling creatures, but every dawn seems to bring news of more wretchedness we must endure as a people. The darkness is coming, my friends: mark my words.\nEntry 41: Archivist.\nIn my writings, I have recounted stories of the barbarians and their endless battles with the demons of the frozen north, and devoted pages to the wizards of Caldeum who harness the primal forces of reality. But the might of these heroes is nothing compared to the power of the archivists of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. These brave souls wade into battle wielding tome and quill, armored not in ensorcelled plate or links of chain, but in the knowledge of generations past. These archivists fight not only for our future, but for our past as well. \nI first encountered an archivist in the ruins of the great city of Travincal. While exploring one of the long-abandoned temples, I was drawn by the flickering of faint torchlight through a distant doorway, and then, as I crept nearer, by the sound of a voice. There was a feeling in the air of danger near at hand, an electricity that made the hairs on my neck rise. I inched forward, breath caught in my throat, grateful for the safety of the hallway's long shadows. Then I saw him. \nHe was surrounded, the looming shapes of his foes bearing down upon him. His hair was unkempt and frazzled, his calloused hands cut and stained. But he had an air of supreme confidence, of a submerged violence that threatened to explode into being. He leapt forward, his hands grabbing for the leather bindings of his nearest enemy.\nThe archivist's eyes searched for an opening, a weakness. His hands wrenched suddenly about his adversary and a sickening crack pierced the still air. Its spine broken, the book lay unmoving in the archivist's now gentle grip. As he lifted its lifeless form into the dim light, the pages of the ancient tome fell open, the secrets of the text laid bare. I remember the words he read, the religious fervor of his voice: \"Here begins the first chronicle of the life of holy &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt;, prophet of Zakarum...\" And on the shelves that stood all around him, tome after tome waited. I have the utmost respect for the archivists, these warriors of myth and legend. We know their names: &lt;a href=\"Alimet%20Two%20Quills\"&gt;Alimet Two Quills&lt;/a&gt;, master of illumination with both left and right hand; &lt;a href=\"Morienne%20the%20Scrivener\"&gt;Morienne the Scrivener&lt;/a&gt;, a midwife whose poetry stole the hearts of kings and brought tyrants to tears; and &lt;a href=\"Salazar%20Cid\"&gt;Salazar Cid&lt;/a&gt;, the Master Transcriber of &lt;a href=\"Gea%20Kul\"&gt;Gea Kul&lt;/a&gt;, whose bombastic penmanship is known in all the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. But these are only a chosen few. The members of their honored fraternity are many, and their numbers grow every day. In the dark days that I fear are yet to come, much will be decided by sword and axe, with steel and spell, but I believe that in scroll and tome our survival lies.\nEntry 42: Marked by Cultists.\nI knew the &lt;a href=\"cultist\"&gt;cultist&lt;/a&gt;s had found me when I saw the bloody, curved knife stabbed violently into my door this morning. I have spent months trying to ease the fevered imaginings that have tormented me since that encounter a scant few months past, but to no avail. And now they know who I am.\nThere is an absolute and oppressive darkness to be found only in the deep wilderness at night. Thus, when I saw the distant light of fire while making my way through the thick Tristram forest, I welcomed the company of fellow travelers. As I approached, however, something even darker than the unlit forest crept over me. So horrendous was this feeling that I thought to turn away until the sound of chanting reached my ears and drew me onward. I thank whatever gods blessed me with the presence of mind to stop short of entering that unholy place whence the sound originated. Instead, I sought out a well-hidden vantage point from which I could look upon the frigid clearing that seemed violently torn from the depths of the forest.\nThat was when I first saw them, the dark cultists, arrayed in a circle. Their torches lit the macabre proceedings in a pallid light that danced over their garish rune-covered robes. I had heard tales of these hooded cultists and their depraved rituals, and I must admit to some curiosity upon seeing them. As their chanting droned on, I thought to make my escape lest they see me, but my attention was riveted by a pale, vacant-eyed supplicant being led forward. I do not know if he was of limited mental capacity, lost in religious mania, or simply drugged, but he was definitely not sound of mind as he knelt in the center of the thrumming circle.\nThe chanting stilled as the leader, face shadowed by a heavily gilded hood, stepped forward and began to intone a ritual in some indecipherable tongue. A large, thickly muscled and leather-masked cultist draped a black, eyeless hood over the victim's head before pulling a foot-long spike from his sash. My mind searched for any possible use for this cursed nail when I noticed the immense stygian hammer grasped in his other hand. With one swift motion, he raised it above his head and drove the spike into the supplicant's back with fierce intensity. I almost screamed... but the victim made no sound.\nAs another spike was readied, I knew I could watch no more. I trembled with the thought of those nails being driven into me should I be caught. I averted my gaze as I heard the revolting squish of another spike sunk into willing flesh. My eyes fell on the robe of the lead cultist. The intricate runes woven into his robe undulated and swirled in sickening movement. As I watched, horrified, I could feel my sanity crumbling away. I began to back away from the wicked tableau, forcing myself to move slowly while my mind screamed for me to flee with abandon. When I could contain myself no longer, I broke into a full run, not caring what sound I made. I ran until I collapsed. And then, as soon as I was able, I staggered to my feet and ran some more.\nNot long ago, I wrote of my disappointment that New Tristram lacked the palpable dread its reputation led one to expect. I wish that I had not tempted fate with my quick words. Disappointment is much preferable to stark terror, and terror was what I stumbled into that night.\nSince returning home, I have been feverishly researching those demon-enthralled cultists in an effort to ease my mind, to assure myself that I had not actually seen what I had, but every whispered, frightened tale only deepens the chill that has seized me. I do not know which of my actions alerted them, but my worst fears have been realized. I have been marked.\nThis is the last known writing of Abd al-Hazir. Known for his compilation of weird and wonderful facts about our unique world, he has unfortunately been missing since late last year."}

Xazax appears to work with Galeona\u00a0in order to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; even though they both have different goals to fulfill. He is the one responsible for helping Galeona\u00a0in\u00a0locating\u00a0Norrec and the armor of Bartuc by using the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tolos\"&gt;Tolos&lt;/a&gt;, one of Malevolyn's former captains, as a sacrifice to summon a &lt;a href=\"Dreamer\"&gt;Dreamer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0who, in turn, showed them the way.\nAfter discovering that Norrec is capable of summoning demons, Xazax becomes paranoid and almost kills Galeona\u00a0when she questions his latest disappearance. Xazax, unable to kill Galeona\u00a0due to their pact, yet, still seeking to get rid of her decides to personally figure out if Agustus Malevolyn is truly worthy\u00a0of the title of \"&lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Warlord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;.\" The demon disguises as one of Malevolyn's soldiers and leads him into the desert where he is attacked by &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Maggot\"&gt;Sand Maggot&lt;/a&gt;s. Malevolyn, nonetheless, summons a crimson sword using the helmet of Bartuc and slays the predators. This impresses Xazax, who decides\u00a0that Malevolyn would be a worthy contender for the title of Warlord of Blood, and more importantly, a good servant for his master\u2014Belial.\nXazax manipulates Malevolyn into distrusting Galeona\u00a0which eventually causes her to escape and seek the\" &lt;a href=\"Norrec%20Vizharan\"&gt;\"fool\"&lt;/a&gt;\" wearing the armor. Xazax then sways the general with the promises of the great destiny awaiting him if he is willing to undertake the tasks required to achieve it. The demon offers his new proclaimed Warlord an army of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; completely under his service, however, the price is all of Malevolyn's army.\u00a0The general is first slightly disgusted\u00a0by the idea, yet, the dream of conquering all of Sanctuary erases any doubt from his head. Xazax later offers\u00a0Malevolyn a hellish double-edged dagger which the latter uses to sacrifice all of his soldiers in return for an army of hell from Belial.\nGaleona is later killed by &lt;a href=\"Norrec%20Vizharan\"&gt;Norrec Vizharan&lt;/a&gt;, who is under the possession of Bartuc's armor, but Xazax remains on the mortal plane for reasons unknown. The mantis demon finds and stabs Kara, taking Norrec with him in order to reunite the armor with the helmet. To his surprise, however, the armor chooses to fight on Norrec's side against Malevolyn. Later during the fight between Norrec and Malevolyn, &lt;a href=\"Kara%20Nightshadow\"&gt;Kara Nightshadow&lt;/a&gt; stabs Xazax in the back with her ivory dagger, leaving a wound that would not heal, as well as casting a spell upon Xazax that produced illusions of angels and demons, forcing him to run in fear.\nAs he runs through the Desert trying to escape the illusions, he realizes one voice that he hears is real. Turning around, he manages to utter \"Diab-\" before screams of terror are heard. This presumably is the Lord of Terror, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, who found and killed him. This end event sets the book just before the &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo_II\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" arrive in &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nAppearance.\nHow Xazax is described in \"Legacy of Blood\":\n\"And looming over him, the demon Xazax surely represented a sight capable of instilling such horrific fear. More than seven feet in height, Xazax resembled most a preying mantis, but a mantis only as Hell could create. A mad mix of emerald and crimson colored a body upon which pulsated great golden veins. The head of the demon looked as if someone had peeled off the outer shell of the insect, seeking the equivalent of a skull beneath. Oversized, yellow, pupilless orbs stared down at the puny mortal and mandibles wider than a soldier\u2019s head \u2013 with smaller yet equally savage ones nearer the actual mouth \u2013 opened and closed with terrible eagerness. A stench like decaying vegetation pervaded the area surrounding the monstrous creature and even began permeating the tent.\"\n\"The middle appendages, skeletal arms with three-fingered claws, reached out with lightning speed, dragging the petrified officer near. Tolos finally tried to scream, but the demon spat first, covering his victim\u2019s face with a soft, sticky substance.\"\n\"Xazax\u2019s main appendages rose high, two jagged scythes ending in needle-like points.\""}

Though his goals were often aligned with the forces of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, some did not think that these ends could justify his foul means.\nThe Prime Evils.\nXul allied with a group of &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;fellow heroes&lt;/a&gt;, and pursued the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a vessel for the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Lord of Terror&lt;/a&gt;. It culminated with the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, but also much loss, including the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, which Xul beheld with his own eyes before its end.\nDespite the warnings of the &lt;a href=\"Horadric\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; scholar &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; as to what the event might portend for &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes disbanded and returned to their homes and families, though Xul, at least, was aware of the Worldstone's significance, and the sacrifices that had been required to end the threat &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption had posed. Despite this, Cain would look favorably upon Xul in later years.\nApprentices.\nNow a master necromancer, Xul returned to the Priests of Rathma cloaked in foreign garb. He chose to mentor an apprentice, a promising student named &lt;a href=\"Mehtan\"&gt;Mehtan&lt;/a&gt;. Mehtan looked favorably upon his master and continued to seek to preserve the &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Xul took &lt;a href=\"Lethes\"&gt;Lethes&lt;/a&gt; as an apprentice. However, their relationship was strained, and Lethes believed that Xul was jealous of her, seeking to suppress her potential. Xul, in return, noted that Lethes had a disregard for life, and taught her at least one \"painful lesson.\" Eventually, Lethes abandoned the Priests of Rathma. She would later claim that Xul had attempted to kill her, but could not (or would not) do it.\nImmortal.\nWortham.\nLethes was able to gain a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, which she used to raise the dead \"en masse\". He sent one of his &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Wortham%20Chapel\"&gt;Wortham Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, where, speaking through the skeleton, he talked to Deckard Cain, informing him of the situation.\nAshwold Cemetery.\nXul caught up to Lethes in Ashwold Cemetery, where he found her torturing a &lt;a href=\"Bramden\"&gt;member&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wortham%20Guard\"&gt;Wortham Guard&lt;/a&gt;. She revealed that she was seeking the power of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, and wanted to know the location of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Asylla\"&gt;Queen Asylla&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb. She summoned &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; minions to cover her escape, as the creature attacked Xul. He was aided by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, whom he thanked for their aid. He headed after Lethes, while leaving them to tend to the wounded guard.\nXul found the body of Asylla's &lt;a href=\"Handmaiden%27s%20Spirit\"&gt;handmaiden&lt;/a&gt;, killed by Lethes. He was joined by the heroes he had encountered earlier, before summoning the woman's &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;. The handmaiden revealed that she had been tortured into revealing the tomb's location, before Lethes had killed her. She in turn revealed its location to Xul and the heroes. Xul told the heroes to pursue Lethes, while he remained to ensure that the handmaiden's body was properly interred.\nXul caught up with the heroes at &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Manor\"&gt;Ashwold Manor&lt;/a&gt;, having traced a surge of energy to the structure. There, he and the heroes discovered necrotic barriers errected by Lethes, along with a trio of Golems. He ordered the heroes to destroy the Golems in order to lower the barriers.\nXul confronted Lethes outside the manor, where she was summoning Asylla's spirit. They engaged in a battle of wills, with Xul trying to disrupt Lethes's summoning (Lethes herself was inside the summoning circle, and apparently immune to harm). She intended to use Asylla's spirit as a conduit to gain ownership of Leoric's soul, and through it, the power &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; had left behind. Xul's allies arrived, and while they were able to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Lethes%27s%20Simulacrum\"&gt;simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; Lethes summoned, they couldn't harm her. Xul ordered them to enter the manor and slay Leoric, which in doing so would break the tether.\nThe hero(es) were successful in breaking the tether, but outside, history repeated itself, as Xul found himself unable (or unwilling) to kill Lethes. She, however, was perfectly willing to wound him and flee. The hero(es) returned, and Xul told them what happened. He refused to be tended to and sent them off in pursuit of his former apprentice. Xul followed after them, arriving in time to see Lethes explode in a torrent of blood. However, he was skeptical that she was dead, stating \"no body, not dead.\" He knew that the Lethes the hero(es) fought was a simulacrum, able to appear more lifelike than normal due to its posession of a Worldstone shard. He resolved to follow after her, and thanked the hero(es) for their trouble.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nXul is the canonical representative of the Necromancer in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo Immortal.\nXul appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in the Ashwold Cemetery questline. He briefly appears in Wortham at the end of its questline. In the beta, his role was taken by &lt;a href=\"Lyra\"&gt;Lyra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marion\"&gt;Marion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kalin\"&gt;Kalin&lt;/a&gt;, though they are replaced by Xul in the game's final version.\nXul's lines will sometimes differ if the player is a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nXul appears as a male representative of the 'Necromancer' class in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhile some his abilities are original (namely Cursed Strikes and Spectral Scythe), his kit is inspired by the \"Diablo II\" Necromancer. His Trait, &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Skeleton\"&gt;Raise Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, named after the ability of same name, automatically summons an skeleton whenever a minion near Xul dies; &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt; is referenced, in a way, as whenever one of his summoned skeletons die, they explode. Other abilities include &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Nova\"&gt;Poison Nova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Skeletal%20Mage\"&gt;Skeletal Mages&lt;/a&gt; (both being Heroic Abilities), as well being able to cast &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Armor\"&gt;Bone Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison\"&gt;Bone Prison&lt;/a&gt;. Xul is also able to apply &lt;a href=\"Curses\"&gt;Curses&lt;/a&gt; on hit (namely &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt;, and/or &lt;a href=\"Weaken\"&gt;Weaken&lt;/a&gt;) through a variety of talents that affect his Basic Abilities. Among his talents, he can learn &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spear\"&gt;Bone Spear&lt;/a&gt;, and also has a upgrade to Poison Nova called &lt;a href=\"Andariel%27s%20Visage\"&gt;Andariel's Visage&lt;/a&gt;, referencing the helm of the same name.\nHe carries a &lt;a href=\"kris\"&gt;kris&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"scythe\"&gt;scythe&lt;/a&gt;. His outfit is based on his armorless design in \"Diablo II.\" His appearance is slightly different from that in \"Diablo II\", possibly result of his age. One of his skins, Bone Visage, has Xul clad in full bone armor and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Helm\"&gt;bone helm&lt;/a&gt;."}

An enigmatic figure whose very existence is debated, he has supposedly interacted with &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s on various occasions.\nBiography.\nThe Sin War.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Taramis\"&gt;Taramis&lt;/a&gt;, Yaerius tried to bring the tenets of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; to humanity during the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Kabraxis&lt;/a&gt; prevented him from doing so.\nThe Founding of Zakarum.\nThe Zakarum faith found its origins with &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Xian\"&gt;Xian&lt;/a&gt; ascetic. According to popular belief, Yaerius gave Akarat the tenets of what would become the Zakarum faith. The &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; appointed Akarat to be the prophet of these new teachings, and bade him take the word to the people of all lands.\n&lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and some members of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; dispute(d) this claim however. Cain believed that what Akarat had seen was an echo of &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice at the end of the Sin War, something that some &lt;a href=\"mystic%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;mystic&lt;/a&gt;s have seen while in meditation. Thus, Akarat had experienced this phenomenon and ascribed it to an angelic being, \"Yaerius\" translating as \"son of light\" in his native language.\nRecent Events.\nIn more recent times, a &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the wastes of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, claiming to have been visited by Yaerius. She said that he had entrusted the &lt;a href=\"Spaulders%20of%20Zakara\"&gt;Spaulders of Zakara&lt;/a&gt; to her so that she could deliver them into the hands of men, so that the Crusaders might triumph. &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; concluded that whatever the truth of her claims, the spaulders were indeed crafted by &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;ly hands."}

It is found in the &lt;a href=\"Zeleny%20Lowlands\"&gt;Zeleny Lowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nYelesna is a mining town, with entrances to its north, south, west, and east. A river borders the town's east, over which runs a bridge. It has a town guard (or something similar). Life is hard, what with the dangers outside the town, and the mining itself is dangerous work. Magistrate &lt;a href=\"Oleksii\"&gt;Oleksii&lt;/a&gt; runs the village.\nThe town practices capital punishment, but hangings were originally rare. After the town became host to a &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Penitent\"&gt;Knights Penitent&lt;/a&gt; garrison however, hangings became a weekly occurrence. \nHistory.\nAt some point, the Knights Penitent established a garrison in Yelesna. They trained the town guard, and attempted to recruit new members. While many resented the presence of the Knights, the truth was that Yelesna would not be able to survive without the garrison, even if its people were too proud to admit it. Many complained to Magistrate &lt;a href=\"Oleksii\"&gt;Oleksii&lt;/a&gt;, but he brushed their complaints aside.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights stockpiled supplies in the town in preparation for a long winter. Later that year, there was a reported &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; sighting, which led to the town's &lt;a href=\"Windfall%20Hollow\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; being closed. Rumors spread throughout the townsfolk, some guessing (correctly) that it was because of a demon, others that it was &lt;a href=\"werewolf\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt;. Unable to work, many of the townsfolk drank and gambled in &lt;a href=\"the%20Hog%27s%20Head\"&gt;the Hog's Head&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile carrying the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; that contained &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; passed through Yelesna. Violence was the result, as neighbors slaughtered each other over trivial slights."}

Their bond was so deep that when Akarat left Xiansai she accompanied him, and remained his steadfast companion on all of his travels throughout &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, Nahantu, and the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Akarat Came to Nahantu.\nYsevete and three other Dedicants of Akarat (&lt;a href=\"Adavin\"&gt;Adavin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Istabela\"&gt;Istabela&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guilla\"&gt;Guilla&lt;/a&gt;) traveled with Akarat when he journeyed to Nahantu. When they arrived, they found the land was twisted by Hatred, and it felt like the jungle itself was seething at their presence. Despite the overwhelming corruption, Akarat and his followers were able to use the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; within them to see the Light within Nahantu, and knew they must help cleanse the evil that had consumed it. Akarat and Ysevete were able to sense something else, the Spirit Realm, which Akarat believed was due to his mother and Ysevete's father being from Nahantu.\nDuring their first night in Nahantu, Akarat and the Dedicants were beset by Hate-twisted beasts, and Ysevete fought with a golden mace which had a head shaped like the sun. They were rescued by an &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; warrior named &lt;a href=\"Tusega\"&gt;Tusega&lt;/a&gt;, and offered to help him find his missing brother. The next day, the party set forth to find Tusega's brother, and to their dismay he, and the family he had sheltered with, had all been mercilessly slaughtered. Akarat convinced Tusega to join them in their quest to heal Nahantu, and they began using the Light to purge the Seeds of Hatred that plagued the land.\nFor eight days, Akarat and the Dedicants had fasted and listened to the Light within them, before setting out into the jungle once more. They arrived at a glade which was not any of their maps, and which the locals called Nahantu's Gift It was here that Akarat discovered the Spirit Realm. After Akarat discovered the veil that separated &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; from the Spirit Realm, they spent many fortnights studying this new realm before Akarat became the first living body to cross the veil into the realm. Ysevete and the others eagerly wished to explore the Spirit Realm and Akarat taught them how to enter it, but this would prove to be a fatal distraction as the Seeds of Hatred began to regrow around Nahantu and Akarat and the Dedicants had failed to notice.\nAkarat and the Wolf.\nWhen he first entered Nahantu, Akarat had sensed that there was a \"final enemy\" responsible for the corruption of the land: Mephisto. Ysevete's close relationship with Akarat had allowed her to sense there was something troubling him, but he had refused to explain as he felt it was his burden to bear. Akarat had learned much of the Spirit Realm and those that dwelt within it, and eventually a &lt;a href=\"spirit%20guardian\"&gt;spirit guardian&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ah%20Bulan\"&gt;Ah Bulan&lt;/a&gt; told Akarat that Nahantu was in peril again and the only way to stop the Seeds of Hatred would be to defeat their maker. Akarat kept this a secret from the Dedicants, and instructed them to construct the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Light\"&gt;Vault of Light&lt;/a&gt; which would be a bastion that stood in both Sanctuary and the Spirit Realm, a safe haven for all those who sought the Light, and a place of safety against evil.\nOn the eve before the Vault of Light was completed, a great celebration was had by the Dedicants, but Akarat knew what he must do, and delivered his Valediction in which he warned against Hatred and reminded his followers that the Light was within all of them. This speech left Ysevete unsettled and concerned for her friend, and though her fellow Dedicants returned to their merriment, she began keeping watch over Akarat.\nBefore dawn, Akarat rose and ventured off into the rainforest, with Ysevete following unseen. Ysevete was ashamed for doing it, but she kept hidden as Akarat purged the Seeds of Hatred and healed the wildlife, though she would have readily helped if needed. Akarat continued deep into the jungle, where the evil was so oppressive that Ysevete nearly turned back in fear if not for the Light, and she watched as Akarat entered a dark cavern. Ysevete knew that within that cave would be the origin of Nahantu's blight, and she feared for Akarat's safety as she had never felt evil of such strength, which burned her heart and mind with Hatred.\nAkarat and the Bloodied Wolf, Mephisto's astral form, stood face to face, and when the Wolf talked its words left Ysevete paralyzed in agony. The pain was not as much as the mental suffering from knowing she had failed to stand by Akarat, though some would later believe that the Light had kept her back so she could bear witness to Akarat's sacrifice.\nNahantu itself trembled as Akarat and the Wolf went to battle - trees fell, rivers changed their course, and animals cried out in mass. Akarat knew he fought a deathless foe, and so rather than fighting to his last breath, he made sure that Mephisto would not go undefeated. Akarat lured the Wolf into biting him, and when it did he embraced it and unleashed all the Light within him in an unforgiving splendor, as if the sun itself had descended from the skies and was now in the cave. The Light burned the Wolf, searing the flesh from its now-charred bones, and it fled down into the depths of Hell when Akarat's strength wore out and he couldn't hold it any longer. The Wolf had never felt such pain, nor such fear, and this memory led to a festering hatred of Akarat and Nahantu.\nYsevete rushed to Akarat's side, and as he died he smiled in joy at the sight of his beloved friend, a smile which remained on his lips even in death. Ysevete carried his body back to the Vault of Light, and she and the other Dedicants were overwhelmed with grief and a sense of failure. The Dedicants questioned as to how they could best honor Akarat's sacrifice, and Ysevete was enraged when it was proposed they should write scriptures to spread his teachings. Tusega and &lt;a href=\"Jualin\"&gt;Jualin&lt;/a&gt; proposed that they could put Akarat's teachings within fables, songs, stories, and art so that they would be spread and passed down from generation to generation as the old stories of Nahantu were. Ysevete objected because Hatred could corrupt anything except the Light, and, with all the other Dedicants against her, put aside the conflict so that they could see to Akarat's burial.\nDawn of the Spiritborn.\nWhen it was time for Akarat to make his final crossing into the Spirit Realm, it was under the watch of his most devoted followers, Ysevete included. Ysevete had decided that they should entomb Akarat in the Vault of Light, where he would be safe from those who would desecrate his body. The body was brought over into the Spirit Realm, and they finished the construction of the Vault of Light around him. The tomb was protected with wards and spells cast by Istabela, and Ysevete was the last to leave before it was sealed up, having spent much time alone in her sorrow.\nBack in Nahantu, Ysevete's cries of sorrow reached the Spirit Realm and were met with support from the spirits. She would go on to form the basis of the &lt;a href=\"Spiritborn\"&gt;Spiritborn&lt;/a&gt; culture using the tenets she and Akarat created. The Spiritborn continued to follow these tenets millennia after her &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Church had twelve &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s originally to detect corruption within the populace. The number of inquisitors increased as the influence of the Prime Evils spread. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Priest\"&gt;priesthood&lt;/a&gt; itself took on the role of judge and jury, and sent out the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Zealot\"&gt;Zakarum Zealot&lt;/a&gt;s to play the role of executioner to any who were considered corrupted. Additionally, the Church has utilized at least two &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; orders\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Protectors%20of%20the%20Word\"&gt;Protectors of the Word&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;Hand of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;. The former has long been defunct, while the latter collapsed under the weight of the Zakarum's corruption. The &lt;a href=\"Soldiers%20of%20the%20Faith\"&gt;Soldiers of the Faith&lt;/a&gt; acted as bodyguards for the Church's highest-ranking members.\nTomes of the religion include \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Visions%20of%20Akarat\"&gt;The Visions of Akarat&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Holy%20Scriptures%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;The Holy Scriptures of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;\".\nA test had to be taken to become a priest of the faith. This test could be taken as early as the age of fourteen. Followers of the faith can make the \"sign of the Light\" in the air.\nZakarumites have a negative view of the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, and have traditionally used any excuse they could to hunt them down. The blood &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; persists as a sign of woe for the most superstitious Zakarum faithful. Children born under it are often considered cursed and cast out, lest it spread.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, the church tried to have its own\ncurrency accepted as the new &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; standard. However, it gained little acceptance.\nZakarum architecture is distinctive and refined. Zakarum structures are adorned with ornate details, and are often accompanied by elaborate statuary. Relics are usually found inside Zakarum estates. Zakarum churches bear a common design\u2014twin towers that pierce the sky, scale-tiled roofs. Inside the church is stain-glass windows, each twice as tall as a man, each of their images taken from Zakarum scripture. These include &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, the latter either devouring unbelievers, or fleeing a priest. &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;Zayl&lt;/a&gt; considered such imagery evidence that the Zakarum hierarchy considered it imperative to remind its faithful as to what happened to those who did not follow the faith exactly as preached.\nTenets.\nLooking at available sources, Zakarum's tenets can be summarized as such:\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nZakarum has its origins in &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt;, an ascetic who claimed to have been visited by the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yaerius\"&gt;Yaerius&lt;/a&gt;, who revealed to him the teachings of what would form the basis of Zakarum. These teachings stressed the necessity of resisting all things evil, and embracing, with total devotion, the Light. The angel appointed Akarat to be the prophet of these new teachings, and bade him take the word to the people of all lands.\n&lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; had his own views on this event however. In his mind, what Akarat had really seen was an echo of sorts of &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;'s final sacrifice, an act that some &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;mystics&lt;/a&gt; have been reported to have seen. He believed this act echoed throughout space and time, and can only be seen by those deep in meditation. Thus, Cain believed that Akarat had witnessed the phenomenon himself and interpreted it as the being Yaerius, \"Yaerius\" translating as \"son of light\" in his own language. Whatever the truth of the matter, Akarat now had the fundamental belief that humans were powerful vessels of light, and that all should seek their \"inner light\" in order to live good lives.\nSpread.\nAkarat's philosophy spoke directly to the common man, and the people of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; embraced it. They sent disciples throughout &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; to spread the word and Akarat went himself, spreading the Word through Kehjistan's ancient cities. Over time, a number of disciples flocked to Akarat's side. In reality, Akarat never set out to create an organized religion, but simply wanted to spread word of the wonderous things he had seen so that people could live with goodness in their hearts. At some point (accounts vary on the date), Akarat disappeared into the jungles of Kehjistan, content that he had spread his word to as many people as he could. He was never seen again.\nOver the following years, Akarat's ideals were carried on and preached in the streets of Kehjistan's cities by a devout few. Akarat had never given a name to his beliefs, for he had never intended them to become an actual institution. But nonetheless, the term \"Zakarum\" came into use in this period, a term used to describe those who followed the ideals of Zakara, or \"inner Light.\" With the use of such a name, it was clear that the followers of Zakarum were becoming an organized group.\nRise.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231009\"&gt;11th century&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; were engaged in a hunt for the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, who had been banished to the mortal realm in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;. With the capture of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and the binding of the Lord of Hatred in a &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, the Horadrim turned to the Zakarum believers, who were at that time, still a small and humble order. &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, who had an affinity with the faith's monks, believed that they were the only individuals who could be trusted with guarding the soulstone and entrusted it to them. As the Horadrim continued their hunt for the Primes, the Zakarumites set about building a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; in which they could safeguard Mephisto's soulstone. It was in the jungles of Kurast that they thus founded what would be known as &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;. This humble place of worship would later grow into a massive temple city at the heart of eastern civilization.\nThus, Zakarum grew even more. Popular religious leaders soon sprung up, endorsed by the new church, and within half a century Zakarum was the dominant order of faith and binding political force in the East. As the religion of Zakarum took hold in the East, they encountered many enclaves of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic followers. Some of these were fully corrupted, and easily identified, but many were under subtle demonic influence, and appeared to be noble and good. With this, the Zakarum codified their beliefs and created a religious hierarchy composed of differing offices.\nThe Crusades.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23Mid-Twelfth%20Century\"&gt;mid-twelfth century&lt;/a&gt;, after the Church of Zakarum had gained prominence in the East, the Church decreed that the visions of Akarat would be spread throughout the known world in order to redeem the masses. Thus, the Church selected a group of its most charismatic and devoted priests and sent them on a mission to proselytize the people of the West.\nUnfortunately, the Church had not prepared these men for the rigors of travel nor the hazards of the world. The priests who survived their missions recounted tales of harsh weather, inadequate supplies, attacks from bandits and even encounters with horrible monsters. To ensure the success of future missions, the Church set about training holy warriors, Paladins, to accompany and safeguard their missionaries. In practice, these \"&lt;a href=\"Protectors%20of%20the%20Word\"&gt;Protectors of the Word&lt;/a&gt;\" proved to be more successful at converting the native peoples than the Priests that they were assigned to defend. Impressing the locals with daring deeds, powerful weapons, and martial prowess was far more convincing than the condemnations of a soft-spoken monk. However, once the Word had been spread to every major city of the West, the \"Protectors of the Word\" faded from public view.\nSome decades later, Paladins were again called into service. During the height of the &lt;a href=\"Time%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Time of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, the Church commenced a second campaign of conversion. This time, however, the inconvincible were deemed evil. The &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Inquisition\"&gt;Zakarum Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; spread through the lands like a tempest, laying waste to all suspected of demonic possession or corruption. Leading this crusade was a new generation of Paladins, known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;Hand of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;.\" These cavaliers of righteousness swept through the lands, expunging the taint of demonic contamination wherever they found it.\nIn the midst of this bloody crusade, a rebellion arose within the ranks of the Paladins of Zakarum. The rebels condemned the methods of the Inquisition, proclaiming that the new Order of Paladins should protect the innocent, and that the evil corruption was rooted in their forebear's failure. They resolved to fight the true source of corruption, the Prime Evils. And so, these rebellious Paladins left their Zakarum brethren and ventured west.\nWith the end of these crusades, Zakarum had spread to almost every corner of the world, with few regions untouched by its influence. At the height of its power, Zakarum was considered an empire in its own right.\nCorruption.\nBy the 13th century, tensions existed between Westmarch and Khanduras, as the priests of Zakarum began to preach their foreign dogma in Khanduras whether they were welcomed or not.\nBy this same century, Mephisto had succeeded in corrupting the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, and the body became a mockery of its former glory. Mephisto's corruption stemmed back at least two centuries, but now, the Lord of Hatred had control of the Church. He had been able to overcome the soulstone enough to have the Zakarum priests to work spells to shatter the soulstone into seven shards, breaking the mystic seal and freeing him. The &lt;a href=\"Que-Hegan\"&gt;Que-Hegan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim&lt;/a&gt; proved immune to his corruption, so Mephisto had the priesthood slay and dismember him. The priest &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;Sankekur&lt;/a&gt; became the new Que-Hegan and consequently, Mephisto's embodiment on the mortal plane. The corrupted High Council fashioned the &lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Orb\"&gt;Compelling Orb&lt;/a&gt; to control the rest of the Zakarum faithful and used their powers to conceal the lair of their master. Years passed, and eventually, &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; was sent west to reawaken &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; in Khanduras. This was in the company of &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, declaring himself to be king. That &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; was chosen by Lazarus to be his seat of power was no coincidence, as it was here that Diablo was sealed beneath the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo was freed and arrived in &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt; in the form of the Dark Wanderer, alongside &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, possessing the body of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;. By this point, many of Zakarum's Paladins and their commanders had been corrupted by Mephisto's influence. However, there were still those in Travincal who had not been corrupted, for all the good it did them. Reportedly, when the Wanderer arrived, many of the temple's defenders fell prey to overwhelming fear and fled the complex altogether. Additional reports suggest that many more turned on each other, further decimating Zakarum's ranks. Regardless, Diablo and Baal freed Mephisto, who took Sankekur's body as his own.\nHowever, the Wanderer had been pursued by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, who fought their way into Travincal, killing demons, corrupted zealots, and the High Council's members. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would later reflect that it was unlikely that any of the heroes gave thought to the fact that they were toppling the world's greatest religion. Regardless, they made their way to Mephisto and slew him.\nReorganization.\nThe revelations of Mephisto's corruption nearly destroyed the faith. The church moved its headquarters from Kurast to the &lt;a href=\"Saldencal\"&gt;Saldencal&lt;/a&gt; in Caldeum. Under the leadership of a new Que-Hegan, &lt;a href=\"Dirae\"&gt;Dirae&lt;/a&gt;, the Zakarum faithful began nursing their wounds and mending their reputation. Of note, the Zakarum faithful in Westmarch further distanced themselves from their eastern breathren, hastening a process that had been going on for some time. The church had always held great sway in Westmarch, even allowed to operate under its own laws within its churches, but with the revelations of Mephisto's corruption, Zakarum lost any influence over the affairs of state in the country. Zakarum has been held responsible for many of the world's ills, and the year of its founding has even been counted as one of the &lt;a href=\"Bleaked%20Years\"&gt;Bleaked Years&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20I\"&gt;Hakan I&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor of Kehjistan, the Zakarum priests were forced to find a new heir to the throne. Through a series of elaborate rituals (possibly a spectacle for the sake of appearances), they determined an impoverished infant in the north was Hakan I's spiritual successor. After the priests' rituals were complete, they employed the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, to retrieve the child. They dubbed him &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt; and installed him on the throne despite his scant years. Caldeum immediately fell into decline.\nOver two decades later, Zakarum was still recovering from the effects of Mephisto's corruption and the actions of the heroes that defeated the Lord of Hatred. The Zakarum remained an intolerant organization and remained based in Caldeum, where it quarreled with the city's &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; class.\nThe Great Enmity.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s genocide, a power vacuum developed within Sanctuary. The Zakarum was among those who rose to fill it. However, they ended up being confined to &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, and even then, years of decadence and corruption caused the faith to fall apart and lose the hearts and minds of the people who lived in the region. The church desperately tried to gain that faith back, but found little success. Based on artwork found in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Light's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Penitent\"&gt;Knights Penitent&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; waged war against Zakarum at some point. Zakarum's forces were apparently defeated.\nDespite their setbacks the tenets of the faith endured. Isolated Zakarum structures continued to function independently from the church proper."}

Zebulon had launched a reformation of the Church, seeking to align it with its more ascetic and humble origins. Despite the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20High%20Council\"&gt;Zakarum High Council&lt;/a&gt;, Zebulon's movement gained support from the populace. The Council long sought to undo his efforts, made no headway.

The archbishops manipulated the new Que-Hegan into launching a stricter system of worship, with harsh punishment for non-conformists. Missionary work took on martial overtones. The church began a purge of various sects of the faith, and brutally suppressed other religions such as &lt;a href=\"Skatsim\"&gt;Skatsim&lt;/a&gt;. Non-believers were judged as corrupt, and subjected to horrific interrogation and \"purification\" techniques.\nDuring the Inquisition's height, the Church launched a campaign of conversion against the West.

The experiments were overseen by &lt;a href=\"Orbei%20Monastery\"&gt;Orbei Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, which demanded updates on the experiments. They concluded with the development of a more powerful form of Cage, which was able to successfully kill the creatures. Karamat's Reach was sealed, and the Cages were confiscated.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231247\"&gt;1247&lt;/a&gt;, a group of these Paladins broke away from the Church, unwilling to continue the Inquisition's heinous methods. The rebels condemned the methods of the Inquisition, proclaiming that the new &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Paladins\"&gt;Order of Paladins&lt;/a&gt; should protect the innocent, and that the evil corruption was rooted in their forebear's failure. And so, these rebellious Paladins left their Zakarum brethren and ventured west. However, the number of Paladins who broke away from the Inquisition were still outnumbered by those who remained, who continued to propagate the horrors of the Inquisition until the movement finally faded away. Years later, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; wrote that he considered the Inquisition to be one of the darkest periods of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; history."}

It is female-dominated, and its members are referred to as &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es.\nLore.\nA mysterious and enigmatic people from the East, the Zann Esu are renowned for their strictly female caterie of magicians. They are on a quest for the \"perfect\" &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; in its purest form. They feel that the other disciplines of magic are haphazard, and have instead chosen to focus strictly upon &lt;a href=\"elemental%20magic\"&gt;elemental magic&lt;/a&gt;. They mold the base elements into whatever magical forms they need - threatening all other magic disciplines with obsolescence. In order to achieve perfection in these elemental transmutations, they choose only those daughters of Sanctuary with the highest level of attunement to the magical elements. The Sorceresses believe that it is through the search for perfection that they will attain ultimate purity and ascend to their destined role as the most powerful mages in Sanctuary.\nAthletic, affable, and self-assured, Sorceresses hardly seem like scholarly bibliophiles hidden away from civilization. Sorceresses possess many of the same skills as the male members of Mage Clans, but excel at the use of elemental magic. Like most &lt;a href=\"mages\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;, they consider melee combat vulgar, and use magic almost exclusively to fight their enemies.\nHistory.\nThe female mage clan of Zann Esu is one of the oldest of the ancient clans, although little is actually known about them. They stem from the followers of &lt;a href=\"Esu\"&gt;Esu&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins.\nCenturies ago, the fourteen powerful covens of Esu &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es convened for the first time in generations. What they discussed is not known, but the witches left behind their former lives and, as a group, disappeared into the &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Eastern jungles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe exact location of the original Zann Esu community is a mystery. Until recently, their only contact with the outside world occurred during recruitment missions. Once every seven years, the Zann Esu visit certain families across &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. These families have only one thing in common - they each have a seven-year-old daughter. Always good-natured and polite, the Zann Esu visitors meet the girls, ask a few questions and then leave. A select few of the girls are visited a second time and offered apprenticeships. The families of those chosen enjoy good fortune for many years.\nRecent History.\nFor centuries they studied in secret, perfecting their art and biding their time until the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Emergence of Evil&lt;/a&gt;. Then, it was decreed, they would face their greatest challenge, either proving the purity of their magic or fading from existence. With &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s awakening in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, the Zann Esu &lt;a href=\"oracle\"&gt;oracle&lt;/a&gt;s decreed that the time of the Emergence was at hand. The destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; would be the great test of their clan. Accordingly, Sorceresses were seen throughout Sanctuary, doing battle with the minions of evil wherever they were found. &lt;a href=\"Isendra\"&gt;One of their number&lt;/a&gt; joined a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; that slew the Prime Evils.\nAfter this, along with the other four Mage Clans, the Zann Esu came together in the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;."}

Zatham accused the Elders of punishing misdeeds unevenly between Inari and Lilin. Events came to a head when &lt;a href=\"Morwith\"&gt;Morwith&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 one of the Elders of the Lilin, stole the Pathstone and abandoned the island with other Lilin who shared her view. &lt;a href=\"Ymuthrus\"&gt;Ymuthrus&lt;/a&gt; became the island's new &lt;a href=\"Prevailing%20Wind\"&gt;Prevailing Wind&lt;/a&gt; and ordered that any Lilin who had ever advocated fleeing the Cradle was to be executed. His edict shocked his fellow Inari, but only Zatham spoke out against it. \nFor his 'crime', Ymuthrus insisted Zatham judged in the rite of &lt;a href=\"Purity%27s%20Penance\"&gt;Purity's Penance&lt;/a&gt;. It did not kill Zatham, but burned the eyes from his face. Ymuthrus then permitted him exile. \nThe Bride.\nAngered by this betrayal, Zatham sought a means to get his vengeance \u2014 to bring destruction upon his once home. It has been an accepted fact amongst the residents of the Cradle that outsiders would bring destruction, so Zatham sought one that would help him achieve his goal. He later crossed paths with the &lt;a href=\"Bride%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Bride of Hell&lt;/a&gt;, and they came to an agreement \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;shard&lt;/a&gt;, for the destruction of the Cradle.\nTerror's Tide.\nWhen the Cult of Terror was close to breaching the &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint%20Battlement\"&gt;Stormpoint Battlement&lt;/a&gt;, Zatham came to the defenders aid, killing half dozen cultists without breaking a sweat. After they let him in, he asked the &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Kenton\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; for a way into the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Prison\"&gt;Abandoned Prison&lt;/a&gt;. The commander refused, so Zatham began to plan a strategy to attack the cult and stop their advancement to the prison.\nLuckily, &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;another adventurer&lt;/a&gt; came to Stormpoint's rescue, also looking for a way into the prison. Grateful for the assistance, he told the Shard-seeker to stop the cultists from advancing through the sea while he would go after their aerial reinforcement. After that, he jumped through a portal to go after the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Terror\"&gt;Howling Terror&lt;/a&gt; as it was flying by.\nZatham met the Shard-seeker again in the Warden's office just after a &lt;a href=\"Deepstrider%20Behemoth\"&gt;sea behemoth&lt;/a&gt; captured a &lt;a href=\"Fern\"&gt;little girl&lt;/a&gt; in its rampage over its &lt;a href=\"Woodruh\"&gt;master's&lt;/a&gt; death.

Unfortunately, the boy drowned before he could be saved.\nAfter rescuing them, they were attacked by cultists; which was a distraction for &lt;a href=\"Akinees\"&gt;their leader&lt;/a&gt; to steal the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; shard.\nDestruction's Wake.\nReturning Home.\nThe Shard-seeker and Zatham pursued the Cult of Terror to &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt;. Zatham revealed to his companion that the island was once his home. Upon entering the island, they bore witness to the affliction that had ravaged the island, twisting many of its people, fauna and flora.\nThey caught up to the Bride of Hell as she attempted to sync her shard to the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20of%20Life\"&gt;Fire of Life&lt;/a&gt; using one of the obelisks scattered around the island. Luckily, the Fire rejected her and killed the cultists accompanying her in the backlash. As they confronted the Bride, she taunted them and teleported away. When Zatham tried to inspect the obelisk, he was also rebuffed, and the Fire of Life reanimated and fused the &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s of the Cultists into &lt;a href=\"Limb%20Sower\"&gt;a monstrosity&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation. \nAfter defeating the monster, Zatham and his companion confronted &lt;a href=\"Rhyn\"&gt;Rhyn&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Lilin\"&gt;Lilin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sanctifier\"&gt;Sanctifier&lt;/a&gt; that was captured by the Cultists). Zatham asked after his mother, as there were few more knowledgeable about the land than she. Rhyn didn't know where she was, but was able to cast a spell that would lead to her. Zatham asked his companion to find her.\nThe Shard-seeker returned with &lt;a href=\"Tarzoine\"&gt;Tarzoine&lt;/a&gt; (Rhyn's mother) and after a short exposition on the island, she directed them to the &lt;a href=\"Exiles%27%20Repose\"&gt;Elders'gathering place&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the island. Their journey went with little problems, apart from a brief confrontation with the Bride of Hell and having to protect themselves from the agitated defenses of the island they arrived at the Exiles' Repose.\nThe duo interrupted a meeting at the Exiles' Repose, and the Shard-seeker was bound by the Conservators. Zatham, unable to contain his fury, killed them and attacked Ymuthrus, but failed to kill him. Another elder called Geherit spoke for them.\nIn-game.\nZatham is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". He was introduced in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Unexpected%20Reinforcement\"&gt;Unexpected Reinforcement&lt;/a&gt;\", and accompanies the player for most of the quest line of \"&lt;a href=\"Terror%27s%20Tide\"&gt;Terror's Tide&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Falling%20Towers\"&gt;Age of Falling Towers&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Destruction%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Destruction's Wake&lt;/a&gt;\". After betraying the player, he's the second boss of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Creation%27s%20Husk\"&gt;Creation's Husk&lt;/a&gt;\". He attacks with the following:\nPersonality and Traits.\nZatham was originally a very upright man who stood against evil, even when it is done by the law. His banishment from Ancients' Cradle left a mark on him, and led him to become obsessed in his pursuit of vengeance (which he saw as \"justice\" for the unjust acts done to him). \nHis vengeance didn't dim his desire to uphold justice and wipe out evil. Even after agreeing to work with the Bride he still killed terror cultists whenever he saw them harming innocents. He couldn't bring himself to kill &lt;a href=\"Geherit\"&gt;Geherit&lt;/a&gt;, who he saw as truly being a good person, and even planned to betray the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt; after their deal was completed."}

He carries the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; skull of &lt;a href=\"Humbart%20Wessel\"&gt;Humbart Wessel&lt;/a&gt; in his pouch for company and for aid in times of need, along with an ivory &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt; crafted from &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt; sealed to Zayl's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;. Zayl would later go on to become one of the first of Tyrael's reformed &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Kingdom of Shadow.\nZayl was first introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Kingdom%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;The Kingdom of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;\" as a support role or secondary character. Though there is a significant amount of character development throughout the novel/book, he is often seen from the point of view of the protagonist.\nMoon of the Spider.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Moon%20of%20the%20Spider%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Moon of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;\", Zayl is the main character, and much more information about his character is released from his own perspective. Zayl does not seem to have a personal connection to Trag'Oul, as &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sin%20War%20%28novels%29\"&gt;\"Sin War\" trilogy&lt;/a&gt;. He is also shown to have a compassionate/emotional side behind his cold exterior.\nStorm of Light.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; took on the mantle of the Aspect of Wisdom, he soon discovered the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; were being quickly influenced by the corruptive essence of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. With his fellows &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s standing against him, Tyrael sought to hide the Black Soulstone on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. To this end he went about reforming the Horadrim, selecting various mages, warriors and scholars for the task of stealing the Soulstone and hiding it from both Heaven and Hell. Zayl was one of the first of this renewed Horadric Order, and would provide critical support in the raid on Heaven. Not only would he forge a satchel strong enough to contain the corruptive influence of the Black Soulstone, but he also awakened his hidden &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; powers and saved fellow Horadrim, &lt;a href=\"Jacob\"&gt;Jacob&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Staalbreak\"&gt;Staalbreak&lt;/a&gt;, though Zayl would lose an arm in the process. After the heroic efforts of the Horadrim, Tyrael relieved Zayl and the others so they might recuperate from their injuries and the influences of the Black Soulstone.\nReaper of Souls.\nZayl entered the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Marsh\"&gt;Blood Marsh&lt;/a&gt; after he sensed a deep imbalance within the area. He came to heal the land. He was encountered by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; launched their assault on Sanctuary. Zayl told the Nephalem about how he helped steal the Black Soulstone from Heaven, but wasn't in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Tomb of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; when Malthael came to obtain the artifact. &lt;a href=\"Humbart%20Wessel\"&gt;Humbart Wessel&lt;/a&gt; stated that Malthael wouldn't have succeeded if Zayl was there, but Zayl just told him to be quiet. He told the Nephalem of his goals, and they told him of their own goal to slay &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;. He told the Nephalem that if she was slain, it would take time for equilibrium to be restored.\nDeath Legacy.\nAt some point after the Reapers' attack, Zayl took &lt;a href=\"Cyrik\"&gt;Cyrik&lt;/a&gt; as a student.\nIn-game.\nZayl appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; randomly in the Blood Marsh or &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Drowned\"&gt;Path of the Drowned&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Act%20V%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". He usually has only one dialogue option, \"The Bog,\" but has another option when playing as a &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; as a companion. His arm appears intact, despite the loss of it in \"&lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Light\"&gt;Storm of Light&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

When surrounded by his enemies, a Paladin versed in this skill sets upon his adversaries with the zealous fervor of many times his number. \"\nGeneral Information.\nZeal is a sequence of rapid blows with substantial bonuses to &lt;a href=\"attack%20rating\"&gt;attack rating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;, and damage. The first strike lands on the targeted enemy, and subsequent blows hit any enemies adjacent to the Paladin.

This is usually accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Fanaticism\"&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt;, which boosts damage and attack speed. Zealots are very good at Player vs Monster gameplay, but are poor at Player vs Player fighting, although it can be done if high end or specialized equipment is used.\nStat Point Distribution.\nStrength: Higher damage is a good thing for the Zealot most of the time, but at the very least, increase it enough for equipment requirements.\nDexterity: Although a higher &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Attack Rating&lt;/a&gt; can't be argued, most Zealots find it better to have enough for 75% chance to &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, or just enough to satisfy their equipment requirements.\nVitality: Even the most offensive-oriented Zealot is a melee hero. As such, he \"needs\" to be able to survive in close-combat, lest he wind up as a useless asset against the minions of Hell. For that reason, it is recommended to dump points here after satisfying Dexterity and Strength requirements.\nEnergy: Zeal is one of the cheapest skills in the Paladin's repetoire at a fixed cost of 2 Mana per use. As such, Zealots often let their equipment provide the Mana needed.\nSkills.\nPrimary skills.\nZeal can be used with the faster 2-handed weapons as well, but this is not recommended. In this case, Holy Shield is nearly useless, and the build becomes incredibly offensive-oriented. Although it is risky (the Paladin will take a lot of damage) and the only gain of this version is higher damage output, the two-handed Zealot can survive because Zeal cannot be interrupted, and even a fairly low amount of Life Steal will be sufficient to restore the Paladin's hitpoints rapidly.\nUtility skills.\nGiven that the Zealot has little need for a maxed out skill after finishing Zeal, Fanaticism and Sacrifice at the bare minimum, players have some freedom to spend the rest of their skill points on what they desire.\n&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Shock&lt;/a&gt; all offer the Paladin elemental damage that he can make use of, but later on, if he needs such assistance, &lt;a href=\"Vengeance\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; may wind up being a better choice. Resist Fire, Cold, and Lightning, in addition to synergizing with Vengeance, all passively increase the Paladin's max resistances through synergies. Redemption is a useful aura to have, both for mana and health regeneration, and to prevent monster resurrection. Vigor is useful for trekking through large areas or for corpse retrieval. Meditation is useful for party play among mana-starved allies, while Salvation is useful for allies with less magic resists.\nPoints Left Over.\nEach character is capable of earning 110 Skill points if all the quests that reward said points are done, on all difficulties. The Zealot can certainly have points left over, especially if he uses Two-Handed weaponry.\nEquipment.\nFor any viable Hell Difficulty Zealot, there are three attributes which are considered almost necessary for a melee character to finish the game: Some amount of &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cannot%20Be%20Frozen\"&gt;Cannot Be Frozen&lt;/a&gt; and stacking &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;. Once these attributes are built to a proper level, the player can then work on some of the other attributes that will help make his Zealot more effective. Some (but not all) of these things would be Life/Mana Leech, Increased Attack Speed, Faster Hit Recovery, Increased Block and Faster Block Rate.\nThe list below has many items a player may never see or be able to manufacture. In this case, it will not hurt to look over the more inexpensive items to obtain the attributes to make the character durable enough to finish the game.\nHireling.\nAlthough many players just solo with Zealots, Hirelings can certainly increase the survivability of any character if maintained properly. Typically, most choose the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Act 2 Defensive Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; in Nightmare Difficulty (the \"Holy Freeze Merc\") or the Offensive version (the \"Might Merc\"), but the others have plenty of potential if geared properly. The Helmet and Armor are standard choices, the only thing that would vary are the weapons. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Act 3 Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; with cold attacks used to be popular, but are rare now, due to many monsters being immune to their attacks. Although &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarian Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are quite rugged, they can be overcome by large mobs. On the other hand, if properly equipped, he can definitely play a major factor in increasing the character's survivability. The &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt;s should not be counted out either, although without particular gear, her ability to assist in later stages of the game diminishes by quite a bit. Although the weapons vary, the armor and helmet choices are mostly stock, with some variation in regards to armor."}

Zebulon urged the faith to align itself with its more ascetic and humble origins. His efforts were well received by the people, and it sparked a surge in independent worship, secularism, and mysticism. The orthodox bishops of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20High%20Council\"&gt;Zakarum High Council&lt;/a&gt; viewed this as an erosion of their power, but they were unable to keep Zebulon in check.

He stole from his brothers and sisters until his pockets jingled. Then he scampered across the black sky, spilling jewels in his haste to escape. Most of them stayed where they were, becoming stars, but some blazed to the ground, shattering into a million pieces. He was caught and banished from the heavens until he returned every stone. A thousand stories began that day, each more preposterous than the last. Other stories speak of Zei fooling emperors, seducing river goddesses, and traveling the world as a &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Shen\"&gt;humble jeweler&lt;/a&gt;. Another legend spoke of Zei being chased by the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Lords of Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Zei climbed to the top of the sky, and when they mocked him, Zei planted a kiss on the blushing cheek of the dawn, and leapt\u2026 \nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Zei%20and%20the%20Thirty%20Tiger%27s%20Tales\"&gt;Zei and the Thirty Tiger's Tales&lt;/a&gt;\", Zei was stripped nude and tied to a stake upon a bonfire, but he still \"had more tricks than the ocean has secrets.\" In \"&lt;a href=\"Zei%20and%20the%20Night%20of%20Unbridled%20Debauchery%20\"&gt;Zei and the Night of Unbridled Debauchery &lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;'s wife offered Zei an emperor's ransom in precious jewels, or a night of unbridled debauchery. In the text of the story, this was, for Zei, \"not a choice at all.\"\nIn addition to legends about Zei, many songs were composed in his honor as well. One dealt with him being found by the peacock queen in the tree with her three sisters.\nBecoming Mortal.\nEven though Zei was the greatest thief in the world, his skill unmatched, he desired to claim his greatest victory: to steal from &lt;a href=\"Dirgest\"&gt;Dirgest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; god of desire. The thief aimed to take what the god valued most: his wife &lt;a href=\"Liria\"&gt;Liria&lt;/a&gt;, goddess of the second moon in the sky. Even though she was hidden high in the heavens by Dirgest's jealousy, Zei waited patiently for an opportunity to claim her. Since Dirgest could not keep Liria at his side at night, the thief climbed silently into her heavenly palace when Liria's path was behind the Silver Moon (the one she did not personify).\nZei easily charmed her: Liria was lonely, and Zei was full of life. Zei did not do this out of love, though, for he merely wanted to be known in legends as the one who stole from a god. The two spent a perfect night together, and when Liria woke up at dawn, the only reminder of Zei's presence was a gift: a precious &lt;a href=\"ruby\"&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; on her neck. Zei's conscience was calm for taunting Dirgest: he rather felt proud. However, Dirgest, enraged and shamed, decided not to take away Zei's life, but instead took his joy by killing everyone Zei had ever held dear, and in the end, slew Liria.\nZei eventually defeated Dirgest, trapping the demon in the very same ruby Liria once wore, and taking his place as one of the Xiansai gods. He carried the gemstone as an eternal reminder of what has happened. However, as the ruby was flawed, it allowed Dirgest to drain life out of the wearer. In the end, Zei could not bear this burden anymore, and cast off his divinity, becoming mortal once again, eventually turning into an old man.\nSome legends say Zei also crafted a &lt;a href=\"Zei%27s%20Stone%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;special gem&lt;/a&gt; to torment fleeing enemies, while other legends claim he never even existed.\nUnearthed Ruins.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Shen\"&gt;Covetous Shen&lt;/a&gt; finished telling the tale about Zei, he asked &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; to accompany him to &lt;a href=\"Unearthed%20Ruins\"&gt;Unearthed Ruins&lt;/a&gt; to find the famed jewel imprisoning the soul of Dirgest. During this journey, the Nephalem actually had a chance to see for themselves that the legend was at least partially true: the jewel's room was real, as was its guardian &lt;a href=\"Vekriss\"&gt;Vekriss&lt;/a&gt;. The jewel, however, was found shattered.\nUpon defeating the demon, Liria's imprisoned spirit was liberated, and (like Vekriss) she asked if Shen was Zei returned. Shen, his voice sounding nothing like usual, replied that Zei was but a long dead myth, yet he himself, a humble jeweler, was glad to see her face one final time. After Liria passed on to her afterlife, Shen went silent, only saying later that he had to find Dirgest no matter the cost.\nTrivia.\nCovetous Shen.\nIt is strongly implied, though never outright stated, that Zei and &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Shen\"&gt;Covetous Shen&lt;/a&gt; are the same individual.

It resembles the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Command\"&gt;Battle Command&lt;/a&gt; skill from the previous game, but only affects the Barbarian.\nIn-game.\nLike all Tactics skills, Battle Rage is an instant cast, and can be used at any time, including while on the move or while performing any other attack. However, unlike &lt;a href=\"Threatening%20Shout\"&gt;Threatening Shout&lt;/a&gt; and , it only affects the Barbarian, and costs &lt;a href=\"Fury\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt; instead of generating it. To compensate for this, this skill is effectively a passive buff to the Barbarian's offensive capabilities, as it has a powerful duration of effect even without the Inspiring Presence passive skill.\nUnlike similar skills of other classes, Tactics shouts are not mutually-exclusive, and may be combined with each other.\nDevelopment.\nIn the days before the pre-expansion patch for \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", the Into the Fray rune actually provided a chance for the Barbarian's Critical Hits to generate 15 Fury, in addition to any Fury that was already generated by the hit. While it was meant to allow Barbarians a way to deal damage without having to make use of a Primary skill, it ultimately proved too powerful for game balancing reasons, especially when combined with the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Berserker\"&gt;Wrath of the Berserker's&lt;/a&gt; Thrive on Chaos rune. With the aforementioned combination in effect, the Barbarian was a virtually \"unstoppable\" force. Nothing short of killing the Barbarian very quickly could put an end to their otherwise very long blood-thirsty reign over the minions of Hell."}

Infuriated, Uldyssian unleashed his raw power on the vines, utterly destroying the plants in an unrelenting sea of fire that turned grasslands surrounding the Grand Cathedral in a scorched wasteland.\nIt was then that the Cathedral's main army of &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s, led by the war maiden &lt;a href=\"Oris\"&gt;Oris&lt;/a&gt; - who was in reality possessed by the High Priest &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt; - rode towards the Edyrem. The Inquisitors were blessed by their Prophet with holy fervor and zeal making them even more dangerous foes. The battle was fierce and the Edyrem were hard-pressed to maintain their position. Inarius 'aided' his army by creating a hail of icy spikes, pelting both his own and Uldyssian's forces. This only served to infuriate Uldyssian further, who then single-handedly destroyed the remaining Inquistor army.\nIt was then that Inarius himself appeared. Inarius and Uldyssian clashed in what was to be an epic duel, utterly destroying the Grand Temple in the process. The Edyrem were not given a rest however -\u00a0 both the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; and the Infernal Legions arrived on Sanctuary, pinning the humans between the colliding forces. The Edyrem made a brave stand, battling Angel and Demon alike, however Serenthia and Achillios, Uldyssian's closest friends are both killed in battle with angels.\nAfter a long fight, Uldyssian managed to overpower Inarius, and with\u00a0another awesome display of force, Uldyssian banished the Hosts of Heaven and Hell back to their realms, utterly impotent against the might of the fully realised Nephelaem.\u00a0The rest is brief, as the area around Uldyssian begins to tremble, shake and crumble, spreading rapidly to encompass the whole world.\u00a0Uldyssian attempts to prevent this distruction and fails, now realizing\u00a0that his power has begun to grow so immense that it too now threatens Sanctuary.\u00a0His rage and loss causing his unleashed powers to lash\u00a0at the world and his humanity itself being consumed in his approach to something like godhood. In a final, desperate attempt, Uldyssian reaches out and pulls his power back into him from everywhere, halting the destruction of the world momentarily. The power within his form however was much, much greater than when he initially unleashed it, beyond the ability for him to contain within himself anymore. Uldyssian struggles to find a place where he may safely release this energy without harming the world. Trag-Oul provides guidance, and after using his new might to being back Achillios and Serenthia, Uldyssian leaves and releases his power fully, bending his vast\u00a0power to adjust and reset the change he himself had wrought on the Worldstone that allowed him to ascend so quickly. Uldyssian dies, the final change he enacts causes the power of the nephalem ripping the world apart to fade harmlessly.\u00a0\nIn the Aftermath, the Edryem had won, in a sense;\u00a0The forces of Heaven and Hell were banished, and a sufficent majority of the Angiris Council had been convinced by Uldyssian's sacrifice to spare Sanctuary. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; agreed to not attempt to act on the plane in a sort of stalemate.\u00a0However all the Edryem are wiped of their memories, a provision of the stalemate being that humanity must be 'taken back to the beginning' and lose their gained Nephalem power with another alteration to the Worldstone.\u00a0Only Mendaln was spared from this fate. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; himself tells the Edyrem that Uldyssian \"will be remembered\" as the one who ended the Battle of the Golden Path, as the savior of his world and his people."}

Players may opt into an 8v8 contest by speaking with the &lt;a href=\"Battleground%20Captain\"&gt;Battleground Captain&lt;/a&gt;. Heroes are chosen to attack or defend by the game.\nHeroes on the attack need to go through three phases: in the first one, slay &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s; in the second one, escort at least one of the two &lt;a href=\"Zealous%20Idol\"&gt;Zealous Idol&lt;/a&gt;s; in the third one, destroy the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Heart\"&gt;Ancient Heart&lt;/a&gt;, the source of their enemy's power. Defenders need to prevent the attacking team from destroying or escorting their objective before the time expires or score 65 kills to thwart the assault. Each player has a Resonance rating, which factors into the mode's matchmaking. However, in instances where there are fewer players queuing for a Battleground match, a player may still be paired against players with higher Resonance than their own\u2014this ensures players can reliably find a Battleground match within a reasonable amount of time.\nWhen calculating the points a player receives from completing a Battleground match, both that player\u2019s individual score and the average score of their team will now be considered.\nTo enter, the player's character must be at least &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 55. Players are rewarded with materials, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, experience, battle pass progression, and the chance of getting Legendary items.\nPlayers who cancel Battleground matches on the Match Found screen will incur a penalty that increases upon each offense. A player\u2019s first infraction will result in a 5-minute queue penalty, meaning they will be unable to queue for a Battleground match for the next 5 minutes. A second infraction results in a 30-minute queue penalty, and a third infraction will make the player unable to queue until the next daily reset occurs.\nIn the Battleground (including &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Exile\"&gt;Rite of Exile&lt;/a&gt;), damage dealt by players is subject to a 50% reduction.\nBadges.\nIn each match, players can earn badges for the following:\nEach badge is awarded to one player in each team. For the members of the losing team, each badge reduces the number of points lost by one.\nRewards.\nPlayers can reach certain ranks by accumulating enough points. Reaching a new rank awards the previous rank's reward of &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%27s%20Key\"&gt;Aspirant's Key&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Flowing%20Shard\"&gt;Flowing Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be earned once per rank per season. Furthermore there is a reward of &lt;a href=\"Reforge%20Stone\"&gt;Reforge Stone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Normal%20Gems\"&gt;Normal Gems&lt;/a&gt; that is awarded at the end of the season, and a weekly reward that is based on the current leaderboard position. It is impossible to lose major ranks (e.g. Gold to Silver or Legend to Gold) by losing points.\nWeekly Rewards.\nThe position only considers players of the same division (Hell/Inferno) and class.\nHistory.\nThe Reforge Stone rewards on ranking up (as opposed to the end of the season) were introduced in the season starting Oct 06 2023.\nOriginally Battleground was closed between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. This was changed in the update. The same update made it impossible to lose major ranks (e.g. Gold to Silver or Legend to Gold) by losing points.\nOriginally the leader board for Battleground displayed the win rates of players. This was removed in the update without announcement and therefore without explanation.\nIn the update, the respawn time for defenders was linked to the progress of the Zealous Idols.\nIn the update, the above respawn time was increased as the idols get closer to their goal.\nOriginally the damage reduction was 30%. In the update, this was changed to 40%. \nIn the update, it was changed again to 50%.\nThe update reduced the score loss at Gold and Legend ranks.\nIn the update, a cooldown was added to the Request Raid Leadership button.\nThe update added the compensation points for players who earned badges, and made the badges to be given out to each team instead of across the two teams."}

Their farm was situated close to a Zakarum cathedral, and many times the priests would come to the farm, demanding tithes for their holy works. Every time her father would refuse, as he was not a follower of the Zakarum faith. On what would be the priests' last visit, an argument broke out, the priests declaring that he would regret his defiance.\nNot long after that, the farm came under attack by &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, Bay and her family would always hide whenever they passed by, and the creatures did not seem to notice them. This time however, they did. The creatures attacked, setting the farm alight, killing Bay's mother. Her father tried to ward the creatures off with a pitchfork, but he was killed in turn. Bay was saved however, by a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Hale\"&gt;Hale&lt;/a&gt;, who slew the creatures. He buried her parents, and offered to give her sanctuary in the Zakarum. Bay took him to the Zakarum cathedral, wondering if her father had listened to the priests, perhaps he'd still be alive.\nArriving at the cathedral, they were granted entry. Bay was frightened by the cathedral's grim interior, and the wall carvings that depicted all manner of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Hale explained that it was a representation of the evil the Zakarum combatted, an assertion repeated by the cathedral's &lt;a href=\"Curate%20%28Character%29\"&gt;curate&lt;/a&gt;. He declared that he would take Bay into the church, and teach her in the ways of the Zakarum. Hale departed to his assigned quarters, while Bay was taken to the depths of the cathedral to be sacrificed. She called out for Hale, and he burst into the chamber before the ritual could be completed. The curate revealed that they, and Zakarum as a whole, were in service to &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, and Bay would be sacrificed to him. Hale cut his way through the priests, but couldn't reach Bay and the curate in time. He &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed away with Bay, declaring that Bay's &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; would please the Lord of Hatred."}

Before charging, they pause for a moment, pawing with one forelimb, and snorting a great plume of steam before rocketing straight ahead, and subsequently hitting the player. One can dodge this attack by simply moving out of the beast's way (it charges at the point where player was when the Beast starts preparation), but if it hits, it will cause high &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage, brief &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;.

He lorded over the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Realm of Lies&lt;/a&gt; in Hell, and was mentored by &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelial led his forces during the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, but never led an army directly, instead operating from the shadows.\nThe Dark Exile.\nThe Lesser Evils came to be discontent with the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s' focus on &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, furious that the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt; had been apparently abandoned. In the midst of this period, Belial and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; saw a chance to overthrow the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; and take control of Hell for themselves. Belial manipulated Azmodan into making war against the Prime Evils.\nThe two Evils made pacts with their brethren, assuring them that &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity would not stand in their way in the course of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; had their doubts at first, afraid that they would fall in the coming conflict. Belial however, kept them in the fold. The civil war that followed was bloody, but it concluded with the Prime Evils being &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;banished&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne account states that as the fires of battle died down, Belial and Azmodan began to argue over which of them held higher authority. The pact they had made dissolved and the two took up arms against each other, polarizing the factions of Hell along with them. Others say, however, that there was no falling out, and that the two began conspiring to subjugate all life to their will. In truth, Belial and Azmodan did wage war, claiming entire realms as their own. By the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Azmodan had held the advantage in the Hells' civil war for a while. \nAround this point in time, word reached &lt;a href=\"Xazax\"&gt;Xazax&lt;/a&gt; of Diablo's awakening and the possible return of the Prime Evils to Hell. If they did so, Xazax knew Belial, his master, would fall, and consequently, he himself as well. He convinced Belial to authorize a plan to aid the mortals &lt;a href=\"Augustus%C2%A0Malevolyn\"&gt;Augustus\u00a0Malevolyn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Galeona\"&gt;Galeona&lt;/a&gt; in retrieving the armor of &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;. Belial agreed, even sacrificing his own minions in Malevolyn's attack on &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, as a new Bartuc in his service could give him an edge against Azmodan, and would be a useful servant in the event of the Prime Evils' return to Hell. Unfortunately for Belial, Xazax failed in his task. Fortunately for the Lord of Lies, however, only Diablo made it into Hell, and the Lord of Terror was cast down by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; of mortal heroes before he could take back control of Hell.\nThe Order.\nAfter the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, Sanctuary was left open to demonic invasion. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; came to believe that Belial and Azmodan were preparing for such an invasion. In truth, by &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, Belial was already working his machinations on Sanctuary. He vested his time and effort into &lt;a href=\"Garreth%20Rau\"&gt;Garreth Rau&lt;/a&gt;. An orphan with a spark of &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; legacy in his blood, Rau was twisted by the Lord of Lies, becoming a powerful dark mage in servitude to Hell. Belial manipulated Rau into believing that he was the descendant of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; (a lie, as Tal Rasha had no children), and that during the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt; had used demonic magic to trick Tal Rasha and forced the soulstone upon him, in an effort to spare his own life. Garreth Rau's personality and memories were overwritten with the persona of the Dark One, an insidious and jealous mage. The Dark One founded the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;second order&lt;/a&gt; of Horadrim, though twisted by Belial's deceit. Belial planned to use Rau and his followers to build an army on Sanctuary, and after conquering the mortal realm, use it to launch an invasion against Heaven itself.\nBelial ordered Rau to find &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;; a ward of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. He reminded Rau of the 'treachery' of Jered Cain, and claimed that his descendant, Deckard, carried demonic blood in his veins. He ordered Rau to lure Leah to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tower\"&gt;Black Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and take revenge on Cain.\nCain made it to &lt;a href=\"Gea%20Kul\"&gt;Gea Kul&lt;/a&gt;, and talking through &lt;a href=\"Egil\"&gt;Egil&lt;/a&gt;, Belial mocked him. He tormented Cain with memories of his &lt;a href=\"Amelia%20Cain\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain%20%28The%20Order%29\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s were being tortured in Hell. That all of Cain's life was a lie. Cain was bombarded by Belial's lies, experiencing great mental anguish, but the &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mikulov\"&gt;Mikulov&lt;/a&gt; killed Belial's host, breaking the demon's connection.\nLeah was abducted by Rau's servants and brought into the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Tower\"&gt;Dark Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Such was her latent magical ability, Rau and Belial planned to use her 'lifespark' to not only awaken an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army from &lt;a href=\"Al%20Cut\"&gt;Al Cut&lt;/a&gt;, but summon Belial into the mortal realm.\nBelial's plan was foiled by Cain and his allies. Despite possessing overwhelming power, the Dark One succumbed to Cain's resourcefulness. In the final confrontation, Belial began to manifest himself from Rau's body, but when he saw Leah, he was caught offguard, recognising &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; within her, commenting \"I know that face...\" Charges that Cain had set earlier went off and causing the Black Tower to collapse. Beholding Rau, Cain could see that he was fighting for control. With a single, strangled cry, Rau threw himself out of the window, into the sea.\nBelial was enraged at his loss, but he received pleasing news, that of the imminent birth of a &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;boy&lt;/a&gt; (within the next five years) who would become emperor of Caldeum. He planned to use the child as a means to take over &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheater Macabre.\nBelial influenced the playwright &lt;a href=\"Marlowe\"&gt;Marlowe&lt;/a&gt; to write a &lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Exile%20%28Play%29\"&gt;stage play&lt;/a&gt; depicting the accounts of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;. Marlowe realized he was being influenced and tried to burn the manuscript. However, it was stolen by his rival, &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Drest\"&gt;Samuel Drest&lt;/a&gt;. Drest finished the play, which served Belial well\u2014his story would live forever in the hearts of men. Drest was regarded as a mad playwright and got hanged.\u00a0According to &lt;a href=\"Malchus\"&gt;Malchus&lt;/a&gt;, this would serve Belial just as well, as it would increase interest in the stage play.\nThe End of Days.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, Belial and Azmodan ruled half of Hell each, though both had set their sights on Sanctuary. By this stage, while not necessarily enemies, they were still \"more rivals than allies.\" The two demons nonetheless came to share the same goal of subjugating humanity into their fold.\nTaking Caldeum.\nAt some point, Belial either possessed or impersonated Emperor &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt; of Caldeum. Exactly when this occurred is unclear, though Caldeum's decline began as soon as Hakan took the throne, and an unnatural drought gripped the region in the years leading up to &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;. In this year, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; were formed. Belial's &lt;a href=\"Deceiver\"&gt;Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s either replaced the Guardsmen, or formed the bulk of them from the outset. The &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; also served him, possibly providing slaves.\nHakan withdraw the support of Caldeum from the wastes and leave those who live there to their own devices. Caravans became vulnerable to attack, and refugees streamed towards Caldeum, beating against the gates. With the Borderlands devoid of protection, this allowed the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; and Belial's &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to roam the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt; unchallenged. Hakan II, becoming increasingly paranoid, ordered all of his staff to leave the city, lest they be thrown off the walls. Through his host, Belial now controlled Caldeum.\nLiar's End.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, the Coven attempted to retrieve the shards of &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt;, which had fallen from the &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;s alongside &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt; failed to retrieve it, thwarted by the actions of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. Belial was displeased with her failure, and 'suggested' that she and the Coven set a trap at the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. It failed, and Belial once again made his displeasure known. However, his spies had managed to apprehend &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;; a companion of The Nephalem. In truth, Maghda's failures were somewhat academic, as he had sent her into the desert to lure The Nephalem away from Caldeum.\nThe Nephalem was granted an audience with Hakan. As Hakan, Belial stated that he had been informed that The Nephalem was behind the massacre at Alcarnus, and revealed that the Imperial Guard had captured their 'spy,' &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;. He left the Guard to deal with The Nephalem as he left, stating that he detested violence. He later contacted The Nephalem via a projection, claiming that he (Hakan) was being controlled by the Imperial Guard, but would find Belial and deliver him unto The Nephalem. By this point, Belial was aware of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. Belial feared its power, as he knew that the original &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s had been used to imprison the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, and that he could be similarly trapped.\nThrough the projection, Belial once again contacted The Nephalem in Caldeum's aqueducts, instructing them how to make their way through them. However, by this point, The Nephalem was skeptical of \"Hakan's\" ability to find Belial, and &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; later sensed that Belial had been in the aqueducts before them.\nStill using his projection, Belial appeared to the Nephalem for a third and final time when they entered the &lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Archives of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;. He told them that he had found Belial's identity, and would lead them to him. He told them that Belial had noticed their actions and was growing nervous, but in the meantime, The Nephalem was to focus on the Black Soulstone.\nAfter the Nephalem retrieved the Black Soulstone, Belial became desperate, raining meteors down upon Caldeum and forcing an evacuation of the city. When the assault ended, The Nephalem confronted Emperor Hakan II where they revealed that they knew he was Belial. The demon lord commended them for their cleverness, but told them that Azmodan knew of the Black Soulstone's existence, and that even if they defeated him, Azmodan would exterminate humanity. He then proceeded with a threefold attack, first with his minions, then personally fighting and finally transforming into an illusion of a giant, monstrous version of himself. Despite his vicious attack, he was slain and imprisoned within the Black Soulstone, ending his reign of tyranny over Kehjistan.\nReaper of Souls.\nBelial's essence remained in the Black Soulstone, briefly merging with &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s to become a singular &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; during the Lord of Terror's assault on the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. With Diablo's defeat, the essences of the Great Evils were returned to the Black Soulstone, their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s screaming for release. The artifact was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; and Diablo set free, still retaining the essence of Belial and the other Evils. Eventually however, Belial's spirit was able to break free from Diablo, just as all the other Evils.\nWhen the Black Soulstone was destroyed, shards of the artifact containing the essences of the Great Evils wound up in Sanctuary. Belial's &lt;a href=\"Dregs%20of%20Lies\"&gt;shard&lt;/a&gt; was obtained by &lt;a href=\"Tilnan\"&gt;Tilnan&lt;/a&gt;, who wondered if the shard came from Belial's true form, or if such a thing even existed.\nReign of Enmity.\nBelial was active during the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;. He spread his lies to make Sanctuary ever more fractious.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dregs%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Dregs of Lies&lt;/a&gt; fragment can be obtained in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Of the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;Soul Shards&lt;/a&gt;, it represents Belial.\nBelial appears in \"Diablo III\" during the final quest on the &lt;a href=\"Act%20II%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;2nd Act&lt;/a&gt;. It is divided into three phases. The battle starts immediately after entering the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;, after a short cutscene. Fighting arena is moon crest-shaped.\nPhase 1: Even if you defeat me....\nBelial does not take part in phase 1, opting instead to call in the troops. He'll summon a large, yet, a limited amount of &lt;a href=\"Deceiver\"&gt;Veiled Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Magus%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Veiled Evokers&lt;/a&gt; to challenge the player. Both types retain the snakeman ability to vanish and then re-appear. Snakemen spawn timely, not upon the death of their comrades.\nPhase 2: I will not be undone!\nAfter the snakemen prove to be fairly ineffectual, Belial himself drops down into the throne room to battle the player. In this phase, he has relatively little health (for a boss), and Snakemen are still spawned during this phase (but not for the first 30 seconds, so it is possible to finish Phase 2 without them even appearing), dropping a good amount of &lt;a href=\"health%20globe\"&gt;health globe&lt;/a&gt;s. Belial himself has a few abilities in phase 2:\nPhase 3: The true vision of the Lord of Hell.\nWhen Belial is whittled down to below 25% of his total HP in Phase 2, the final phase begins after a brief delay. In this phase, Belial gains full (and greatly increased) &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;, becoming immobile, incredibly large (the entire inner edge of the platform counts as part of his body for targeting purposes), and will drop Health Globes every time he suffers 10% damage, not every 25%. He replaces his normal abilities with new ones:\nIn this phase, the Lord of Lies is immune to nearly \"all\" forms of &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;control impairment&lt;/a&gt;. As such, only directly damaging him will suffice. This hampers the capabilities of heroes who make use of items such as the &lt;a href=\"Haunt%20of%20Vaxo\"&gt;Haunt of Vaxo&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it is recommended to build characters with this in mind.\nA hero with a &lt;a href=\"Xephirian%20Amulet\"&gt;Xephirian Amulet&lt;/a&gt; may have quite the laugh watching as Belial tries to harm them; with that equipped, Belial is little more than a hardy obstacle, perhaps more so than even &lt;a href=\"Ghom\"&gt;Ghom&lt;/a&gt;, even after the enrage. The only real damage that remains is his Fist Slam, which will only prove to be enough to kill a hero who has, to put it bluntly,\" \"pathetic degrees of &lt;a href=\"Toughness\"&gt;Toughness&lt;/a&gt; and healing compared to the difficulty.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Torment Difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, Belial has a hard enrage timer of 3 minutes, at which point he will continuously use his Meteor Strike, covering the entire platform at once (impossible to dodge) until combat ends. It \"is\" still possible to kill him past this enrage timer (especially with &lt;a href=\"Xephirian%20Amulet\"&gt;Xephirian Amulet&lt;/a&gt;), however, it is very difficult.\nOther.\n&lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; is represented in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Chess\"&gt;Diablo Chess&lt;/a&gt;\". He takes the position of the rook.\nPersonality and Traits.\nBelial advocates the notion that perception is reality, and it is his sole purpose to dominate reality. He does not lie simply for the sake of lying, but rather to deceive with the intent of controlling others' perception of what is real. He relishes the moment his victim realizes they've been deceived, that moment of nakedness and betrayal. If Belial hs a weakness however, it is that he is often trapped within the intricate webs of his own machinations.\nTyrael described Belial as desiring power above all other things and that his thousand schemes are designed toward his ends.\nBelial was never content with his place in Hell, and always desired more power.\nAbilities.\nBelial is a master of artifice and intrigue. It is debatable that if Belial even has a \"true form, unlike his demonic breathren.\nEven from beyond Sanctuary, Belial could influence the thoughts of mortals. Able to shift their beliefs and 'truths.' Rau reflected that Belial's power was \"so immense, it was like looking into the sun,\" feeling 'thought tendrils' extending from Hell, and weaving themselves through his mind. In battle against The Nephalem, Belial rained fire down upon Caldeum and could apparently influence (the perception of) reality itself."}

Some or all belt slots have number hotkeys available (1-8 or 1-4) for quick use of the items in the slots. \"Diablo II\" added the ability to expand the initial four slots by equipping better &lt;a href=\"belts\"&gt;belts&lt;/a&gt;, providing more space and a mechanism to replenish slots automatically.\nBelt slots represent the concept of a \"utility belt\" with multiple items strapped to it for quick access.\nBelt slots did not return for subsequent games, which significantly reduced the emphasis on consumable items.\nDiablo.\nIn the first game, 8 belt slots are available, used with keys 1-8. Another hotkey uses health or mana potions chosen automatically, first from the inventory and then from the belt. Belts themselves are not an obtainable item type in this game.\nDiablo II.\nThe second game reduced the number of hotkeyed slots to four, used with keys 1-4. However, in addition to the \"bottom\" four belt slots showing in the interface most of the time, additional rows or levels of belt slots can be obtained with &lt;a href=\"belts\"&gt;belts&lt;/a&gt; equipped, with higher quality belts providing more additional rows. Replacement items can then be queued up in additional slots \"above\" the main four, which \"fall\" one by one into the hotkeyed slots when the previous item in that slot is consumed.\nA player may have one to four rows of belt slots with each row providing space for four items, and lengthening the queue of replacements for each slot by one. For example, with three rows of belt slots total, the player has 12 slots total, and may have a health potion prepared in slot 1 with two more prepared \"above\" it. Pressing 1 three times would consume all the potions, at which point that slot would be empty.\nThe number of rows available depends on the currently equipped &lt;a href=\"Belts\"&gt;belt&lt;/a&gt;, with the number of belt slot rows generally increasing with item level. &lt;a href=\"Plated%20Belt\"&gt;Plated Belt&lt;/a&gt;s are the first available belt that provides 4 rows of belt slots."}

The high priests of his tribe gifted him the dogs &lt;a href=\"Chena\"&gt;Chena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Owaze\"&gt;Owaze&lt;/a&gt;.\nDoubtwalker.\nThe Heretic.\nIn his first &lt;a href=\"Igani%20Bawe\"&gt;Igani Bawe&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Hills%20of%20Mist\"&gt;Hills of Mist&lt;/a&gt;, Benu headed out alongside ten other Witch Doctors of his clan, as they partook in the contest with the &lt;a href=\"Tribe%20of%20the%20Clouded%20Valley\"&gt;Tribe of the Clouded Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tribe%20of%20the%20Five%20Hills\"&gt;Tribe of the Five Hills&lt;/a&gt;. He was oversawn by &lt;a href=\"Ungate\"&gt;Ungate&lt;/a&gt;. They confronted and incapacitated &lt;a href=\"Zuwadza\"&gt;Zuwadza&lt;/a&gt;, a Witch Doctor of the Five Hills. Before they could engage in battle, they were interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Nazeebo\"&gt;another Five Hills Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed that Igani Bawe was unnecessary, that the spirits did not seek bloodshed between the Umbaru. Benu and his kin were enraged at such words, and Benu lunged at the interloper. A bolt of energy sent him hurtling back. The Witch Doctor asked that Zuwadza be spared. In response, all of the Seven Stones Witch Doctors charged. All of them were killed in an instant bar Benu. The Witch Doctor warned him of his approaching kin, that if found, he would be killed. Benu responded that he would have been proud for such a death, but the Witch Doctor didn't indulge him. Benu fled in shame, but was haunted by his foe's claims that the Igani Bawe was the will of the priests, not the spirits.\nBack in his village, Benu was brought before the priests of the clan. They did not fault him for his actions, but &lt;a href=\"Guwate%27ka\"&gt;Guwate'ka&lt;/a&gt; ordered him not to speak of the event to anyone. As he walked with Guwate'ka, he watched as captives of the Igani Bawe were sacrificed, per Umbaru custom. The tribe celebrated, yet Benu remained uneasy, as the Witch Doctor's words echoed in his mind. It was not so much the words themselves that bothered him, but rather that he had been cursed by them. Walking away from his village, Benu engaged in a &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Trance\"&gt;Ghost Trance&lt;/a&gt;, viewing the spirits of those recently slain in the Igani Bawe. He could tell that something was wrong, that the Unformed Land was not what they expected it to be. They offered him a warning\u2014\"beware.\"\nDoubts.\nOne week later, another Igani Bawe was declared, for the priests claimed that the spirits demanded the war in response for the actions of the heretic Witch Doctor. Rumors abounded concerning the heretic, but Benu dismissed them as nothing more than hearsay. And yet he remained uneasy; gone was his fervor for the Igani Bawe, replaced instead with unease for what he had seen of the spirits. He sensed as Guwate'ka entered a Ghost Trance, the spirits clawed away at the veil of the physical world, coming to take revenge for the lies they had been told. Heading away from the ritual, he met &lt;a href=\"Adiya\"&gt;Adiya&lt;/a&gt;, wife of Guwate'ka. She led him away from the village, before telling him of the words of the spirits. There was honor in life, not in the Igani Bawe, and the spirits claimed that he walked two paths. One side, forever a child of the Seven Stones, seeking a grace the high priests can never give. The other, a wildfire, unforgiving and bright, bringing newness and life to these stagnant jungles. Tomorrow, she said, he would be made to choose. She went on to say that she could not say which path was correct, but that the spirits believed that the Umbaru were no longer unique or worthy of celebrating. She further said that the high priests claimed that they communicated with the spirits daily, but that they only glimpsed the Unformed Land in passing. That the Igani Bawe was a means of control over the Umbaru. She bid him farwell, warning him of tomorrow's events.\nAs the Igani Bawe came, Benu forged on ahead, hoping that solitude would grant him clarity. He heard a voice, and found that it belonged to Adiya, though she saved him from an enemy Witch Doctor by killing his foe. She told him that the Unformed Land awaited all Umbaru, that Igani Bawe was an unnecessary ritual. Benu came around, believing her, and 'solidifying' the moment by kissing her. However, the moment was interrupted as they were captured by those of the Tribe of the Clouded Valley.\nThe pair were led back to the tribe's village, Benu not feeling elated at the prospect of sacrifice as he might have otherwise been before learning the truth. At the village, they encountered &lt;a href=\"Edwasi\"&gt;Edwasi&lt;/a&gt;, who had also been taken prisoner. As Edwasi was sacrificed, Benu noticed that the tribe's manner of celebration was identical to his own clan's, but now, it seemed devoid of any substance. To escape, Adiya suggested that they become &lt;a href=\"kareeb\"&gt;kareeb&lt;/a&gt;, an act that was unspeakable. More lies, she claimed, and when they came to be escorted, they barged through their captors. The Cloud Valley Umbaru made little effort to stop them, unable to comprehend why they would not be willingly sacrificed. Adiya opened the jars containing Edwasi's organs, bidding that he consume them, to become a god. Benu hesitated, remembering the heretic\u2014he had taken lives, but only as a means of self-defence, and in effort to save his master. Benu found that he could not consume the organs, for the Tribe of the Clouded Valley was not his enemy. He sought to enlighten, not dominate them. Enraged, Adiya cast &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; into Benu, nearly killing him. He engaged in a Ghost Trance, and communicated with a spirit directly.\nThe spirit told him the truth. The same truth the heretic had known, that the Unformed Land was not what the priests claimed it was. It was not a perfect world, but entering it did not require the Igani Bawe. The spirit revealed that Adiya was not a kareeb, but rather a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, one drawn to the jungle as she had sensed his doubt. Eating Edwasi's heart would have done nothing, only made him an outcast, filling him with doubt the shame. All the while, Adiya would have been there. Benu admitted that he had rejected her offer, for he knew he had to teach the Umbaru the truth. The spirit was satisfied. Benu was now a teacher. Now, all he had to do was banish Adiya. Returning his mind to the physical world, Benu saw Adiya in her true, horrific form. She was engaged in battle with the Tribe of the Clouded Valley, easily shrugging off their attacks. Benu succeeded in killing her, but at the cost of his own life.\nLegacy.\nLess than a week passed before another Igani Bawe was held. Benu's fight against the demon spread, how he had given his life to save the Tribe of the Clouded Valley. Yet rumors persisted that he had defied the rites of Igani Bawe, that he had even been a kareeb. The high priests of the Seven Stones spoke of the spirits' anger over these events. Although they deemed Benu a hero, they claimed that the presence of the demon had sullied the ritual war. As the priests engaged in a ghost trance, Benu spoke to them directly, telling them they were blind. Only a few remained in the trance, the others believing they had angered the spirits. Only a few remained, and by the end, only one Witch Doctor listened to his words. But Benu was satisfied. It might take years, but someday, he would guide the Umbaru to enlightenment.\nAt some point, Benu's tale reached the ears of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Tyrael\"&gt;recorded it&lt;/a&gt;. Reportedly, Benu continued to whisper to Witch Doctors from the Unformed Land, imparting wisdom and guidance."}

Strongest of his companions, he was red of hair and beard; friendly around the cookfire, but full of ferocity when roused to anger. He traditionally hunted with an &lt;a href=\"axes\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; and throwing hatchets.\nBiography.\nThe Hunt.\nIn the early days of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, during the time of the Firstborn, Bersarik rode in the company of &lt;a href=\"Corvik\"&gt;Corvik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helgrotha\"&gt;Helgrotha&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gratian\"&gt;Gratian&lt;/a&gt;. He was the strongest of the four. No &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; could escape them, and the four were as close as &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;-kin. While their prey met &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, neither they nor any other nephalem had died in these early days.\nOne night, Bersarik had a dream, in which he made a spear from a cypress tree, and hurled it from the top of a tower in the golden city where he and his companions dwelt. The spear flew high and true, over the mountains and into the vast &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;green steppes&lt;/a&gt; beyond. When Bersarik awakened, he dwelt on the dream's meaning, before going to speak for his companions, declaring that they would hunt &lt;a href=\"aurochs\"&gt;aurochs&lt;/a&gt; beyond the mountains. \nAfter three days of preparation, they left their home, and travelled into the lands of the north. Whilst in the mountains, they were attacked by flying creatures similar to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Hawk\"&gt;Blood Hawk&lt;/a&gt;s. The creatures were slain, and they continued their journey. Reaching the steppes, they tracked the aurochs' trail. Gratian once again expressed doubt, and doubt even touched Bersarik. Regardless, they tracked the herd for five days before coming across them. They planned to separate one from the herd.\nThe plan worked, initially, and they cornered their prey, but they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Ahduma\"&gt;Ahduma&lt;/a&gt;, the aurochs' queen. She charged Grattian, who was too stunned to move. Bersarik threw his great axe at the oncoming beast, but it glanced off one of her horns. He then took up Helgrotha's &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; from the ground, and as he hurled it, he remembered his dream. The spear struck Ahduma in what would have been a kill for a lesser being, but such was the thickness of her hide, it bounced off. Gratian was killed, and Ahduma fled with the aurochs they had tried to kill.\nBersarik and the others were shocked, for in these early days, death was an alien concept to the nephalem. After standing in silence, they realized that they were no different from the beasts that populated Sanctuary, that they too, could be slain. As &lt;a href=\"the%20moon\"&gt;the moon&lt;/a&gt; rose, Helgrotha declared that she would go to the place where death could not find her. She gave her friends a parting embrace, and departed into the darkness.\nA short time later, Bersarik declared that he would hold their makers to account for making them mortal. Telling him that &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were more powerful than Ahduma, Corvik took out her knives, and reached into Gratian with her fingers and blades. She searched for the secret place where he had carried his death with him, but could not find it. Defeated, she instead fashioned his splayed bones and cords into a &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, Bersarik watched as long as he could, until he could no longer endure it, thereafter watching only with his ears. When Corvik finished her work, she presented Bersarik the sword, which she named &lt;a href=\"Severian\"&gt;Severian&lt;/a&gt;. The blade frightened Bersarik more than Adhuma had, and it seemed to quiver in his hand. Nevertheless, he thanked her, and asked Corvik what she would do when they departed. She answered that \"there are questions I would put to death. But first, I must find the camp of our hunter.\"\nBersarik didn't know what she meant by that, nor did he want to. Looking at Corvik, stained in Gratian's blood, Bersarik suspected that she had already traveled some distance down a very different road from he. Regardless, they bid their farewells.\nTo Meet One's Maker.\nBersarik's journey took him over the steppes, and across many lands. Along the way, he spoke to Severian as if it were a companion at his side. He recounted his memories of Gratian, voice his sorrow at his friend's death, and hissed with rage and hatred over the matter. The sword reacted to his tears and words alike, tempering the bone-blade until it was stronger than iron. Eventually, he reached the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, and Bersarik wavered in his resolve at the sight of it, for he had rested little on his journey. Nevertheless, determined to confront &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, he headed for the first of its many gates, where he met &lt;a href=\"Kalmor\"&gt;Kalmor&lt;/a&gt; on the road, a fellow nephalem. \nAt first, Kalmor was friendly, but quickly sensed that something was amiss. Realizing that Bersarik intended violence against his makers, and refused to let him pass. The two came to blows, and as Bersarik's axe met Kalmor's sword, Kalmor pleaded with Bersarik to lay down his weapon. Bersarik refused, even though he knew Kalmor had the advantage, for while his journey had weakened him, while Kalmor was at full strength. For half a day, they battled, until Kalmor ripped the axe from Bersarik's hand. In desperation, Bersarik drew Severian, but it seemed to balk in his hand, as it had not been designed to fight nephalem. Kalmor then struck a blow with Bersarik's own axe, cleaving him from shoulder to breastbone, exposing his beating heart.\nThe wound shocked both &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, as never before had one nephalem given injury to another. In his dying breaths, Bersarik told Kalmor not to be sorry. He had not heeded Gratian's warnings, and thus, in punishing him, Kalmor had given Gratian justice. He entrusted Severian to Kalmor, and took his last breath.\nLegacy.\nKalmor was shocked by what had happened, as Bersarik's death had demonstrated that the nephalem could, in fact, die. He lay Bersarik to rest in the ground, and put Bersarik's axe upon the cairn he erected for him. He kept Severian as Bersarik had asked, now able to understand why Bersarik had come to this place, and was able to understand some of his foe's anger. Ultimate, Bersarik's death would trigger Kalmor's assigned mission to slay Corvik and Helgrotha.\nHelgrotha mourned Bersarik. Though she knew not of his death, she was aware of the effects Grattian's passing had on him. She named a &lt;a href=\"Bersarik%20%28Bear%29\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; after him; not to honor his namesake, but to mourn it."}

It will also increase the damage done by the monster. \nThis spell is based on Magic element, so monsters resistant to Magic will have a 50% chance of ignoring Berserk. Monsters &lt;a href=\"immune\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to Magic are immune to this spell. All Super Unique, Unique and quest monsters are immune to Berserk.\nThe effect is \"permanent\", and damage buff \"does\" apply to attacks made against players, so frenzying a monster that is closer to the player than to other monsters can be reckless. \nPlayers do not receive &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; for monsters killed by a Berserker.\nDamage Buff: 20-30% + (1% x Spell Level)\nLore.\n\"The use and control of the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al forces of &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; have many manifestations, almost all of which involved channeling this &lt;a href=\"ether\"&gt;ethere&lt;/a&gt;al energy into concentrated and focused forms, such as the many spells related to &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; experimented and mastered the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; powers, they discovered that nearly any forces could be controlled and reshaped or re-oriented, including mental and bodily energy.\"\n\"With this understanding, they soon created spells to influence the thoughts and actions of other creatures. The most aggressive of those magics caused a target creature to gain a burst of great strength and go mad with rage. Frenzied with blood lust, the creature willingly attacks any nearby living being, whether friend or foe. Entities with natural evil intent and weak minds tended to fall under the influence of this spell easily, and the Horadrim had great success using this maddening incantation to incite &lt;a href=\"Demons\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt; and other foul creatures of blackness to blindly attack one another during the heat of combat. A warning to novices seeking to use this dangerous spell: the fury of an affected creature knows no bounds, and if not careful or safely distant, the caster of this spell may very well end up being the target of the berserk creature's rage.\""}

Barbarians built this way dish out massive magic damage with each hit, can override physical immunities, and aren't affected by &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;. The downside is that Berserking brings Defense to zero, and leeching life/mana is impossible due to the fact the damage is magical. Given the damage potential with this build, however, one can certainly work around this handicap.\nThere are two primary styles or sub-builds for the Berserker:\nStat Point Distribution.\n&lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;: Enough to wear endgame gear. Calculate this amount ahead of time.\n&lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;: Shielded: enough for max block, non-shielded: nothing (if using 2-handed maces) or just enough for equipment (other 2-handeds)\n&lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;: Everything else, especially for non-shielded varieties.\n&lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;: While Berserk can kill off the effectiveness of Mana Steal, it still leaves little excuse for points here if the Berserker wishes to be at his best. As such, most leave this to equipment.\nSkill Point Distribution.\nWhat to Max.\n&lt;a href=\"Berserk\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt;: The skill you're revolving around.\n&lt;a href=\"Combat%20Masteries\"&gt;Weapon Mastery&lt;/a&gt;: Damage booster that's affected by +skill equipment, unlike synergies. Choose a weapon type first, obviously.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20Orders\"&gt;Battle Orders&lt;/a&gt;: More health and mana is a good thing. A staple skill to any Barbarian.\n&lt;a href=\"Howl\"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt;: Another synergy for &lt;a href=\"Berserk\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt;; can be useful to scare feeble monsters away. Vital for a non-shielded build, where you put several points into this early on and enjoy howling away not-so-feeble monsters for breathing space.\nWhat You Need.\n\"Note: The following skills require only one point to be utilized.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Increased%20Speed\"&gt;Increased Speed&lt;/a&gt;: This is entirely optional, but wholeheartedly useful.\n&lt;a href=\"Natural%20Resistance\"&gt;Natural Resistance&lt;/a&gt;: More resistance, less damage. Also optional if you're going to have max resists with your gear instead.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Skin\"&gt;Iron Skin&lt;/a&gt;: See shout.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20Command\"&gt;Battle Command&lt;/a&gt;: Raises the entire party's skills by one.\nSkill Point Allocation.\nShielded.\n105 Total Skills\n6 Total Pre-Requisites\nEnd Result: 111 Skill Point Total (impossible to achieve, see below)\nThe order in which to max your important skills is as follows.\nThese are vital. Your Weapon Mastery and the &lt;a href=\"Howl\"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt; synergy should have alternating points in them. Again, Weapon Masteries will give damage to your &lt;a href=\"Berserk\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; skill with plus to skills while synergies won't, so the Mastery is significantly more effective in that regard; however, &lt;a href=\"Howl\"&gt;Howl&lt;/a&gt; gives 10% magic damage, while the Mastery gives only 5% physical damage but also an attack rating/critical strike boost. Which one you max is your personal preference.\nNon-Shielded.\n106 Total Skills\n4 Total Prerequisites\nEnd Result: 110 Skill Points Total (impossible to achieve, see below)\nFor a non-shielded build, put several points in Howl early on and practice using it for crowd control; at high levels of Howl even high-level monsters get scared. Use it to disperse a minion crowd and kill the boss or superunique while your merc picks off each of the minions. As soon as you can get &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Orders\"&gt;Battle Orders&lt;/a&gt; pump that instead of Howl. As soon as you can get both &lt;a href=\"Berserk\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; and pump them both (pause pumping Battle Orders in the mean time); when you have both Berserk and War Cry to about 5~10 levels start using them and distribute your skill points between your four main pump skills (Berserk, War Cry, Battle Orders, and Howl); prioritize Berserk and War Cry but don't neglect Battle Orders, and give the occasional point to Howl to keep it sharp against high-level monsters. When Berserk, War Cry and Battle Orders are maxed, start maxing Howl and your weapon mastery.\nEquipment.\nWeapon:\nShielded:\nNon-Shielded:\nArmor: Armor choices are somewhat limited as your defence is lowered to zero with each attack, effectively nullifying any defence bonuses from your armor no matter how high. As such Damage reduction would be a better attribute to look for in armor choices.\nHelm: &lt;a href=\"Arreat%27s%20Face\"&gt;Arreat's Face&lt;/a&gt;. No exceptions.\nShield: Nearly mandatory for some varieties of this build. Note that if you \"do\" use a shield for blocking, make sure to increase both &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;ing and &lt;a href=\"Faster%20Block%20Rate\"&gt;Faster Block Rate&lt;/a&gt; - it's more dangerous to have 75% blocking if it takes you 7 frames to block, than to have 0% blocking (no shield) if it takes you 5 frames to recover from hits. Not using a shield frees up stat points for vitality; since hit recovery only triggers if the damage dealt is larger than a particular percent of your life, you may prefer to accept small amounts of damage that won't put you into hit recovery than to sacrifice 7 frames to block it. is the best choice, or go with for more damage.\nGloves: &lt;a href=\"Steelrend\"&gt;Steelrend&lt;/a&gt; for more damage, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Drainer\"&gt;Soul Drainer&lt;/a&gt; for dual leech, &lt;a href=\"Dracul%27s%20Grasp\"&gt;Dracul's Grasp&lt;/a&gt; for the leech, strength and &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt;. Note that neither leech nor life tap work with &lt;a href=\"Berserk\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; itself; you'll only use it when you either or &lt;a href=\"Concentrate\"&gt;Concentrate&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoots: &lt;a href=\"Gore%20Rider\"&gt;Gore Rider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sandstorm%20Trek\"&gt;Sandstorm Trek&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"War%20Traveler\"&gt;War Traveler&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelt: &lt;a href=\"Verdungo%27s%20Hearty%20Cord\"&gt;Verdungo's&lt;/a&gt;. String of Ears and are alternatives.\nAmulet: &lt;a href=\"Highlord%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Highlord's Wrath&lt;/a&gt; for more attack speed and the &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Strike\"&gt;Deadly Strike&lt;/a&gt; option; for more skills/resists. For dexterity-less non-shielded builds, prioritize a rare amulet with good AR boosts.\nRings: Dual &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos%27%20Wedding%20Band\"&gt;Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt; rings or just one with a &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Frost\"&gt;Raven Frost&lt;/a&gt;. For dexterity-less non-shielded builds, prioritize a rare ring with good Attack Rating boosts.\nTips and Tricks.\nPlayer vs. Player.\nBerserk can one-hit-kill players, also, as resistance against magic damage is extremely difficult to acquire. Just don't try to duel using a non-shielded variety as Howl doesn't work on players. If you're using Enigma, teleport close to your enemy and let loose. Generally stay away from Hammerdins because they deal in high magic damage as well. However, if your attack rating is high enough, you can teleport as close as possible to a casting Hammerdin and wipe him out with one shot before he manages to kill you."}

After players rescue &lt;a href=\"Anya\"&gt;Anya&lt;/a&gt; from her icy prison, Anya tells them the last remaining elder of &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt;, has willingly sided with &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for the demon's mercy. Nihlathak even provided Baal with the &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Relic of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to enter &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20Keep\"&gt;Worldstone Keep&lt;/a&gt; unhindered by &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients\"&gt;The Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Anya then tasks the player with slaying Nihlathak and opens a portal to his hiding place, &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak%27s%20Temple\"&gt;Nihlathak's Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe quest is completed after Nihlathak has been dealt with. Upon returning to Harrogath, Anya rewards the player with personalizing an item of his/her choosing.\nTips and additional information.\nThis quest, unlike most, is not required, and extremely deadly on &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. Many players choose to skip it past Normal, especially if they are playing &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;. Another reason not to finish this quest is that once done, Anya won't open the red portal in a game you create on that difficulty level, unless the Halls of Pain waypoint is left deactivated (in which case the red portal will remain). The red portal will disappear permanently if the waypoint is activated and the quest is completed. This can be a drawback for players who want to farm &lt;a href=\"Pindleskin\"&gt;Pindleskin&lt;/a&gt; for magic items.\nEnter the portal and proceed into Nihlathak's Temple. Fight your way through the three levels below the temple known as the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Halls of Anguish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Halls of Pain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Vaught\"&gt;Halls of Vaught&lt;/a&gt;. The last level has a constant design; four hallways spreading from the entrypoint and leading to a room. In one of these rooms you'll find &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt;\non a raised dais surrounded by Minions. What makes Nihlathak exceptionally dangerous on higher difficulties is his &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt; spell that can instantly kill players with ease. If players seek to mitigate the damage done by Corpse Explosion they should stack up on &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; Resistance. It might be better, however, to wholly avoid Corpse Explosion by luring the minions away from Nihlathak before killing them. &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; attacks are also useful as frozen enemies shatter on death, leaving no corpse. After the majority of the minions has been dealth with players should focus on Nihlathak. Be warned that he has the ability to summon additional minions, so it's best to kill him as fast as possible.\nNihlathak himself isn't that hard to kill. See the &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; article for more information and tips on how to defeat him. Upon death Nihlathak's skeleton bursts forth from his remains, hovering above the ground before being pulled down into the earth through fiery fissures.\nAfterwards return to Harrogath for your reward. Anya will personalize an item for you: you can give Anya any item of your choosing (including &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;unique items&lt;/a&gt;). You then get it back with your character's name added before the item's name."}

Knaak&lt;/a&gt; and published in 2006.\nDescription.\nSince the beginning of time, the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic forces of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic hordes of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; have been locked in an eternal conflict for the fate of all Creation. That struggle has now spilled over into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; -- the world of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to win mankind over to their respective causes, the forces of good and evil wage a secret war for mortal souls. This is the tale of &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;the Sin War&lt;/a&gt; -- the conflict that would forever change the destiny of man.\nThree thousand years before the darkening of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Diomedes\"&gt;Diomedes&lt;/a&gt;, was a simple farmer from the village of &lt;a href=\"Seram\"&gt;Seram&lt;/a&gt;. Content with his quiet, idyllic life, Uldyssian is shocked as dark events begin to rapidly unfold around him. Mistakenly blamed for the grisly murders of two traveling missionaries, Uldyssian is forced to flee his homeland and set out on a perilous quest to redeem his good name. To his horror, he has begun to manifest strange new powers -- powers no mortal man has ever dreamed of. Now, Uldyssian must grapple with the energies building within him -- lest they consume the last vestiges of his humanity.\nSummary.\nThe angel &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; was the Commander of the Heavenly Hosts. Tired of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt; between angels and demons, Inarius sought to abandon the High Heavens luring angels who thought likewise to follow him. Rogue demons who were also tired of the eternal conflict allied with Angel Inarius, and together created Sanctuary. Inarius stole from the energies of creation to build the Worldstone which kept Sanctuary cloaked and hidden from the view of the High Heavens and the Burning Hells. With this, Inarius and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; (Mephisto's daughter) procreated &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt; and other children, the firstborn...known as the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nLilith betrayed Inarius and attempted to use their children against the High Heavens. Inarius, however, killed many of their children. The remaining ones became depowered when Inarius altered the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; to not just keep Sanctuary hidden, but also to depower the Nephalem into mere mortals. The descendants of the firstborn became Humans as centuries passed. Lilith was not dead as Inarius thought, and returned to awaken the dormant powers of Humans by choosing a farmer with potential ... Uldyssian ul-Diomed. Through deception, Uldyssian was hunted and accused of assassination of members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Triune\"&gt;Church of the Triune&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Uldyssian in his quest awoke others unleashing a chain reaction of hundreds of human mortals with unbelievable powers who followed him unquestionably as a leader and teacher.\nUldyssian discovered his legacy and Lilith's deception backfired ending in her apparent demise and the destruction of the Church of the Triune. The Triune taught humans about the spirits of Mefis, Dialon and Bala (standing for &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;). Its leader was the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; ... no other than Mephisto's son &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt;. The Cathedral of Light was led by the Prophet ... secretly Angel Inarius in human form. Uldyssian was caught between both forces seeking to either destroy him or possessing him. For whoever got such prize would set the balance between victory over the High Heavens or the Burning Hells."}

You will find a \"Gravedigger\" digging near the partial hull of the ship. He will say, \"Be careful... This ship is cursed by demons! We should be safe as long as we don't disturb it...\" Several Fallen Lunatics will come up from the ground - one will instantly explode and kill the Gravedigger, the rest will attack you; when he dies, the Gravedigger will randomly drop one of the pages of the ledger.\nTo find the ledger pages, go through the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt;'s east gate. There are two locations that the black ship may spawn, both almost immediately outside of the gate. The first is the first couple of rock piles southeast of the gate. The second is directly south of the gate, along the western cliffs of the map.\nThe spawning of this object is random, so if you are farming, you may need to reload the game a few times (Leave Game -&gt; Resume Game) to find any of the pages. Not only is the spawning of the ship instance random, but the page number that drops in this instance and location random. For instance, one person could get page 8 the first time, while another could get page 23. Additionally, it is possible to get the same page multiple times, even before attaining all six.\nLedgers.\n4\"\"Damn, I always thought that being a first mate would be more exciting.

Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness. Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree. Gazing back at us were piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.\"\n\"Page 15:\"\n\"Both Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin stood poised, guns leveled at the bristling overgrowth at the base of the swaying trees.

It only makes sense that such demand should exist with all of the able-bodied hunters, trappers and fur-traders off giving their lives so valiantly in the name of the Alliance.\"\n\"Page 23:\"\n\"The hunters were now the hunted. I led the party toward the sea, hoping the shoreline would provide refuge from the Raptors. In our haste we had drifted too far north, to a precariously high elevation. The mistake was made. The fault was mine. We stopped just short of a sheer cliff, the Raptors just a few paces behind.\"\n\"Page 42\":\n\"Later that night we sat quietly around the campfire, knowing our lives had been saved by a bizarre twist of fate. Such are the risks of the big game hunter. We toy with fate by delivering it. Yet each of us, at some point, will face fate's razor sharp teeth.

Unlike the other &lt;a href=\"Soulstones\"&gt;Soulstones&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Soulstone was intended to hold the souls of many beings, &lt;a href=\"angels\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; alike, and in particular was capable of trapping all seven of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;. In this it was successful, but backfired when &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; used the artifact to make himself the singular &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;, and further backfired when the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; seized the stone and altered it in order to use it as a weapon to destroy all humanity.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; were tasked to capture the Prime Evils and imprison them in the three original &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; was charged with bearing the artifacts. The search was long and arduous, but eventually, all three of the Primes were imprisoned. Kulle, however, was left a broken man, and the Horadrim did not hear of him until reports reached them that he had built an &lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; below the sands of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt; believed that Kulle had become obsessed with soulstones, and so was attempting to create one of his own\u2014the Black Soulstone, capable of harnessing the essence of many &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Containing these essences, filled with rage, hope, fear, and valor, Kulle would use the soulstone as a substitute for his own black and empty heart. Tyrael would later conclude that Kulle must have studied the original three soulstones during the Dark Exile, hence his ability to create the Black Soulstone; a \"profane simulacrum\" of the original soulstones. Its construction remains a mystery, though Deckard Cain uncovered stories of Kulle forging the Black Soulstone from the bones of fallen magi. Another tale claimed Kulle extracted his own blood and crystallized it into the Soulstone.\u00a0\nThe Black Soulstone was created to be an improvement over the original three, but it was flawed, and could not hold essences for long. By his own account, Kulle created the soulstone to ensure that humanity could rise above the shackles of Heaven and Hell. After all, the soulstones containing the three Prime Evils still remained in Sanctuary itself, and if not for Tyrael, the forces of Heaven would have wiped out humanity long ago. He believed that he could help mankind unlock its &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; birthright and enter a golden age. Regardless of intent, the Horadrim feared that as a result of his experiments, he might effectively become immortal. They killed Zoltun Kulle, separating his head from his body and draining his blood.\nReturn of the Stone.\nCenturies after his death, Zoltun Kulle was resurrected by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to defeat the last two lords of Hell, &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for guiding the adventurers to the Black Soulstone. Thanks to the witch &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 who had learnt of the stone's existence at the same time of Diablo's awakening in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and had marked the spiritual essences of the other Evils into the stone \u2014 the souls of the five already defeated &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; (the Lessers &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; and the Primes Diablo,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;) had been drawn into the Black Soulstone the moment it was finished.\nKulle, upon realizing what has happened, attempted to keep the soulstone from his former allies. However, he was defeated, and the stone used by &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; to imprison the sixth of the Great Evils, Belial. The now unstable stone, writhing with the essences of six Lords of Hell, was carried by Leah to &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which had fallen under attack by &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;. Leah tended to the stone within the keep as the battle raged, commenting that the stone was getting hotter. She could hear the Great Evils whispering to her from inside. Adria warned her that the Evils were seeking to escape, and that only Leah's power could keep the stone from breaking apart.\nThe stone was used to imprison the final Evil, Azmodan, who had failed in his siege. Soon, however, Adria showed her true colors and allegiance: Leah had been bred as a vessel for Diablo, and the essences within the Stone were channeled into her, giving rise to a new Diablo, combining all seven essences into a singular Prime Evil.\nDespite this, the Nephalem were able to defeat Diablo. As his body fell from Heaven and disintegrated, the Black Soulstone was seen falling through the clouds below.\nThe Corruption of Heaven.\nThe Black Soulstone remained in Heaven, still containing the Seven Evils. Since it was a man-made object, Tyrael did not know if he could destroy it, and, given its different nature from the previous soulstones, was unsure if that was a wise course of action. While the &lt;a href=\"Luminarei\"&gt;Luminarei&lt;/a&gt; guarded the artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; debated over its fate. &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt; wanting to destroy it, &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; wanting to seal it, &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt; paralyzed by indecision. Tyrael, the only one able to see what the stone was doing to the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s, insisted that it be hidden on Sanctuary, but was rebuffed. All the while, the soulstone's corruption spread, even tainting the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnwilling to let it remain in Heaven, Tyrael, with the aid of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, absconded with the artifact and took it to Sanctuary to hide it from both demons and angels.\nThe Reaper of Souls.\nWith the aid of the Horadrim, the stone was to be placed in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Tomb of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;. While the Black Soulstone was being put into place, &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; revealed himself, having taken on the Aspect of Death. The Horadrim were killed (except\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt;) and Tyrael was incapacitated, leaving Malthael free to take the Black Soulstone for himself. Tyrael was able to retrieve a sliver of the artifact, which fell off when Malthael took it.\nMalthael fundamentally altered the Black Soulstone in order to use it as a massive soul trap that could drain demonic essence from all creatures in a single plane of existence. By the time &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; made it to the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; once stood, Malthael had released the soulstone into Sanctuary with the intent of using it to tear the demonic essence from every human in the world, killing them by tearing their bodies and souls apart. The two did battle, and in a last-ditch bid to defeat his foe, Malthael summoned the Black Soulstone back into the fortress and shattered it, embedding its shards into his body and taking on the power of the Prime Evil. After his defeat, Malthael's body disintegrated, Diablo was released, still containing the essences of the other Evils. Eventually however, each of the Evils broke away from Diablo.\nThe Soul Shards.\nWhen the Black Sousltone was destroyed, a number of its shards containing the essences of the Great Evils wound up in Sanctuary. These \"&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;Soul Shards&lt;/a&gt;\" contained great power, and were sought after by &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. "}

The quest is completed after all Council Members have been slain.\nQuest Information.\nObjective: Kill all the &lt;a href=\"Council%20Member\"&gt;Council Member&lt;/a&gt;s of Travincal\nQuest Giver: &lt;a href=\"Ormus\"&gt;Ormus&lt;/a&gt;\nInitiation: \"You have done well, my friend. Your courage and valor are an inspiration to us all. But now, the time has come to face the ones repsonsible for the evil that has stifled our land. You must destroy the High Council of Zakarum! Long ago, these elders were charged with the stewardship of Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, who was imprisoned in the Guardian Tower . Through the generations, these pious men slowly fell more and more under the sway of Mephisto's malevolent power and the Council became a mockery of their former glory. It is Mephisto's Hatred that has corrupted Zakarum and turned its devout followers into paranoid fanatics. That is why you must travel to the temple city of Travincal and slay the Council. Once they are gone, Mephisto's hold over this land and its people will be broken!'\"\nThe High Council of Zakarum.\n&lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;'s design is constant, that is, the area is always the same, unlike most parts of the game. The Council is here consistently from gameplay to gameplay.\nThe Council can be located in the main temple of Travincal. It consists of six normal &lt;a href=\"Council%20Members\"&gt;Council Members&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href=\"Super%20unique\"&gt;Super unique&lt;/a&gt; council members: &lt;a href=\"Ismail%20Vilehand\"&gt;Ismail Vilehand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toorc%20Icefist\"&gt;Toorc Icefist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geleb%20Flamefinger\"&gt;Geleb Flamefinger&lt;/a&gt;. All of them are capable of magical and physical attacks, they can heal each other and other monsters and can cast &lt;a href=\"Hydra%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes they are accompanied by common Travincal units like &lt;a href=\"Zealot%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Zealots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heirophant\"&gt;Heirophant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Lord%20%28Vampire%29\"&gt;Blood Lords&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the pools in front of the temple usually harbor multiple &lt;a href=\"Tentacle%20Beast\"&gt;Tentacle Beast&lt;/a&gt;s, so be warned.\nWhile battling the High Council it is advised to keep moving - staying in one spot for too long increases the chance of being ambushed by Hydra-spells. &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; Resistance helps mitigate damage taken from the Council's spells. Players can try and lure one or two Council Members away from the temple and separate them from the others. It would be best to clear the area surrounding the temple before attempting this strategy, however.\nReward.\nThere's a high probability that these Council members will drop &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic Items&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to large sums of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. Also, one of the Super Unique council members drops a &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items\"&gt;Quest Item&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Flail\"&gt;Khalim's Flail&lt;/a&gt;; the last piece needed to fulfill &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Will%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Khalim's Will&lt;/a&gt;. Once armed, it must be used to break the &lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Orb\"&gt;Compelling Orb&lt;/a&gt;, which is in the same temple as the Council.\nOnce this quest is completed, all Zealots will flee from the player if the player draws near to them. With the &lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Orb\"&gt;Compelling Orb&lt;/a&gt; destroyed, the player gains entrance into the &lt;a href=\"Durance%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Durance of Hate&lt;/a&gt; and should prepare for the battle with the &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;Act Boss&lt;/a&gt;, Mephisto."}

It also has a fixed rate of fire, thus working better with &lt;a href=\"Fade\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=\"Burst%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Burst of Speed&lt;/a&gt;. Blade Fury relies on &lt;a href=\"attack%20rating\"&gt;attack rating&lt;/a&gt;, but it does not provide any AR bonus.\nThe damage listed on the skill is treated as +min/max damage that ignores the 3/4 (or 3/8) penalty, rather than added straight onto the final damage like the character screen implies, so it does receive bonus from STR, DEX and off-weapon Enhanced Damage. The \"Damage +x\" mod on &lt;a href=\"Grief%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Grief Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; and some other weapons do not work with Blade Fury. If the assassin is wielding a claw, &lt;a href=\"Claw%20Mastery\"&gt;Claw Mastery&lt;/a&gt;'s damage and critical bonus is applied, but attack rating bonus is not. Many of these are not correctly displayed on the character screen.\nThe assassin can utilize this skill along with a weapon that has good &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; to safely dispatch adversaries too dangerous to approach (such as &lt;a href=\"Extra%20Strong\"&gt;Extra Strong&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Cursed\"&gt;Cursed&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Lightning Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; unique monsters). It is possible to make a viable character build around this skill, which focuses on off-weapon Enhanced Damage from auras and equipment to effectively boost damage.\nThis skill is very different from most other skills in the game. Nearly every other skill provides a +% enhanced damage to your attack, and off-weapon +% enhanced damage is added to the skill-based +% enhanced damage before being multiplied with the weapon damage. This skill adds a + damage to your attack, then is then multiplied by off-weapon +% enhanced damage. If you want to build an Assassin around this skill, you want to put as many +% enhanced damage jewels in your helmet, armor, and shield as you can, hire a Might mercenary, then pump this skill to maximum.\nSkill Progression.\nMinimum Mana to Cast: 3\n+3/4 Weapon Damage"}

Raw iron is hardened and made resilient, forged into weapons of honor and power. Most mortal swords are patterned after the blade first wielded by Bul-Kathos himself. Balancing offense with defense, it is the perfect weapon for the defense of Mount Arreat in the coming apocalypse. All Barbarian warriors learn the secrets of steel at an early age, yet few truly master the deadly elegance of the sword. Those few who do often disdain all other weapons. \"\nGeneral Information.\nBlade Mastery is one of the first Barbarian passive weapon mastery skills. It improves the Barbarian's fighting skills when wielding a sword (either &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt;) or a &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince Barbarians can wield &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20Swords\"&gt;Two-Handed Swords&lt;/a&gt; with one hand when choosing to dual wield or pair with a shield, Blade Mastery is usually the Mastery of choice when deciding which to put points on, although the other Masteries are certainly useful in their own right.\nTwo-handed swords possess a decent attack range, allowing the user to stray back further and still connect on hits. Even when wielded one-handed, two-handed swords have higher average damage output than most one handed weapons, rivaled only by the slower &lt;a href=\"Hammers\"&gt;Hammers&lt;/a&gt;."}

Unlike other traps, additional Sentinels do not effectively stack with each other, so single-target damage is low, and a single trap will often function just as well as five. \nHowever, unlike other traps, the damage dealt by Blade Sentinels scales with melee damage; additional damage equal to 3/4 of the user's Weapon Damage is added to this skill. Furthermore, while the Character Screen does not display it correctly, bonus damage given by the skill itself is also boosted by off-weapon damage bonuses, including Strength and Dexterity, as well as auras, passive skills, and other sources of damage, like Fortitude or Phoenix. \nThis makes Blade Sentinels an effective way for an assassin to deal damage to multiple enemies at once, especially in circumstances where standard sources of splash damage are rendered ineffective. A fire assassin, for example, might normally be slowed by a pack of fire immune monsters; Blade Sentinel can help the assassin to kill them more rapidly, for a relatively low skill point investment. \nAn important note is that Blade Sentinels function well with poison charms, but poorly with Venom. Dealing small amounts of damage to multiple targets can result in most damage dealt simply being regenerated away. Even a single poison charm can prevent this regeneration, allowing damage to accumulate over time, with a single Sentinel easily capable of poisoning entire groups of enemies. Venom prevents this, capping poison duration at 0.4 seconds, allowing enemies to regenerate, often more than the damage provided by Venom.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 7\n+3/4 Weapon Damage"}

A young Barbarian learns to use both hands independently of each other, striking simultaneous blows at separate targets. As his talent grows in this skill, he attacks with increasing control and accuracy. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nDouble Strike allows the user to strike quickly at two different enemies (or one enemy twice, if only one is in range).\u00a0Double Swing basically doubles the Barbarian's\u00a0total\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt;, as well as chances of threatening targets\u00a0with &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; etc.\u00a0\nWhile this skill is quite powerful (it can be effective even in &lt;a href=\"Hell%20difficulty\"&gt;Hell difficulty&lt;/a&gt;), it is often overshadowed by the similar yet stronger skill, especially when synergy skills are considered. However, some players may opt to continue using Double Swing as their main form of offense, if the reduction of attack speed is too much, or the increased speed causes increased confusion or lag. The two skills can be used in conjunction as well, though if this is to be the case, it's not recommended to place more than a couple points into Frenzy, as the benefits per stack drop sharply after the first two hits.\nAt default level, it costs 2 Mana to use Double Swing. As the Barbarian puts points into this skill, the Mana cost levels off, eventually reaching 0. This negates any problems with a Mana shortage, making Double Swing a 'free, upgraded' version of the Barbarian's basic Attack that he can switch to should he need to strike quickly to regain his Mana using &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Steal\"&gt;Mana Leech&lt;/a&gt;. As Mana cost listed gives two attacks, cost per hit is even lower."}

Sometime later, he made a pact with a &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; (who was in the guise as a God of Retribution). His &lt;a href=\"Vitalya\"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt; warned him against using the power of a Chaos God. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt; with the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; shardss, Skarn promised Dravec to reunite him with his brother if he could bring a Worldstone shard to him. Dravec raided the Sanctified Earth Monastery in search of the Worldstone shard that was stored there, but couldn't find it, even after forcefully interrogating his master. In a fit of rage, he killed Vitalya.\nDravec was exiled from the &lt;a href=\"Veradani\"&gt;Veradani&lt;/a&gt; for that crime, and the &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt; sent monks to hunt him down. Dravec fled Zavain for a time, but later returned, now allied with the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cult of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;. The cult made a base in the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; chapel within the &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Valley\"&gt;Misty Valley&lt;/a&gt;; as its residual &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; kept &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28monster%29\"&gt;nightmares&lt;/a&gt; away. Meanwhile, Dravec laired in a cave within the Misty Valley. During this period, he learnt a lot of infernal lore and profane texts.\nAt the end it was all a trick. Instead of resurrecting Tayev, Skarn fused the brothers' &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s together, creating a new &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Souls\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDravec is the major antagonist for the storyline quests of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt;.

It is a devastated place where demonic incursions are commonplace, and the energies of Creation have warped the land and creatures. \nHistory.\nThe Northern Steppes.\nThe Northern Steppes were inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Children of Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt;, known to the people of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; as the \"Barbarians.\" Theirs was primarily a nomadic and tribal culture, though they had a few permanent settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;. The Northern Steppes were a harsh environment and its denizens adapted to it as such, dedicated in their vigil of guarding the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Barbarians' vigil came to an end with &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s , however. Although the Lord of Destruction was eventually defeated, he had succeeded in his goal of corrupting the Worldstone. To prevent mankind from being corrupted, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; was forced to destroy the powerful artifact. He succeeded, but the resulting explosion tore &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; asunder, reducing the Steppes into a smoldering wasteland. \nThe Dreadlands.\nWith the destruction of Mount Arreat, dust and ash rained over the Steppes and the Barbarians were left divided and scattered, robbed of the heart of their culture in an instant. The entropy of Hell itself became part of the landscape.\nOver the years, the situation worsened as &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic corruption ran rampant, threatening both Man and beast. Demonic incursions became commonplace, insects and animals were twisted into new forms, and bandits and outcasts roamed the land.\nSometime after the Worldstone's destruction, the Dreadlands suffered an outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Plague\"&gt;Rage Plague&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, all that is left of Barbarian civilization in the Dreadlands are the rubbles of their settlements and scattered fortifications.\nIn the years that followed the Worldstone's destruction, a new group would arise and make the Dreadlands their home: the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunters&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of survivors of demon attacks and sworn to destroy the creatures of Hell. They chose the Dreadlands as their home due to both the abundance of demons giving them plenty of opportunities to hone their skills, and the need to live and train without the interference of any nation that would worry about such a group camped within its borders.\nNotable Locations.\n\"Main article: "}

His reputation gave &lt;a href=\"Elzix\"&gt;Elzix&lt;/a&gt; pause, ensuring the man would never try to cheat him.\nDrognan ran a shop in Lut Gholein, known for its arcane wonders.\nThe Secret of the Vizjerei.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Drognan was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt;; one of his fellow Vizjerei. Drognan believed that he'd perished in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, but clearly, Jazreth had survived. However, he seemed insane, so Drognan dismissed much of what he said. However, he was able to talk his way into Lut Gholein's palace, and no-one saw him afterwards. He feared that Jazreth had found something in the palace that had led to his doom.\nTroubles arose in the desert after the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt; came to Drognan, seeking his advice. Drognan advised him to close the port and put the town under strict watch. However, this didn't stop a creature from entering the city and killing a number of people, even after being confined to the sewers. Jerhyn and &lt;a href=\"Fara\"&gt;Fara&lt;/a&gt; discussed the matter, and from his studies, Drognan concluded that the creature was &lt;a href=\"Radament%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;Radament the Fallen&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrognan greeted a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; who were in pursuit of the Dark Wanderer. They slew Radament, passing on the details to Drognan. He concluded that Radament had been intent on reviving his own mummified corpse with the flesh of the living; a very unusual state of affairs for an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. He wondered if there was a greater power at work.\nAfterwards, an eclipse occurred, plunging &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; into unnatural darkness. Drognan's research led him to discover that a similar eclipse had occurred several hundred years ago; that desert dwelling snake-demons had errected an altar, which caused the sun to go black. He believed that both eclipses were the work of &lt;a href=\"Claw%20Viper\"&gt;Claw Viper&lt;/a&gt;s. In this, he was correct, and the heroes were able to restore light to the land by slaying the creatures.\nAfter this, Drognan told the heroes of his research into the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tomb of Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;. While he was unsure of the tomb's location, he believed that a clue could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. He told the heroes to speak with Jerhyn, stating that he might be aware of a secret entrance. They gained entrance, and encountered The Summoner, whom Drognan recognised as Jazreth. He suspected that he had been possessed by &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit, and told the heroes to put an end to his tortured existence.\nThe heroes were able to use clues found in the Sanctuary to find the Tomb of Tal Rasha. However, they were too late, as Diablo had already freed &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. He told the heroes to travel east to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDrognan is a non-player character who resides in Act 2, in the town of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;.

They also have access to earth and storm &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Different skills utilize different forms. Storm magic persists on the battlefield, so players able to unleash torrents of lightning, wind, and rain before shifting forms to ravage foes.\nA unique class mechanic of the Druid is the chance to deal &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt;s with any Earth skills, reducing the enemy &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; by a flat percentage of their total (not current) health, although its effect against &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; and other players is reduced.\nAnother mechanic used in many Druid skills is Vulnerable debuff, an inversion of Fortified. While Vulnerable, the enemy takes 30% additional damage from attacks. Vulnerable lasts until the enemy loses the specified amount of Life from any source, not expiring over time and stacking the Vulnerable damage (but not the damage bonus) from multiple applications.\nUnlike \"Diablo II\", Druid has no skills that exist purely to transform in and out of the various Forms: instead, each skill can only be cast from one (sometimes two, but not any) form, shifting to it before cast without any extra action. Once shapeshifted, the Druid remains in that form for 3 seconds or until a different action forces them to shapeshift again. The three forms are human, &lt;a href=\"Werebear\"&gt;Werebear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Tur%20Dulra\"&gt;Tur Dulra&lt;/a&gt;, Druids can find four animal spirits here, each of which provides a boon. Players can have one boon from each spirit, and two from one of them. Eventually, a fifth animal spirit boon is unlocked.\nDevelopment.\nThe Druid was not originally going to be a playable class in \"Diablo IV\". The developers reversed course after seeing a piece of concept art. \nWhen designing the class, the developers cut out &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; magic and replaced it with storm and earth magic, as it was felt that the use of fire didn't feel right for a class that was meant to be in tune with nature."}

Kin to the s, they make their home in &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nCulture.\nDruids do not value urban centers in the same way as the &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt;. They instead dwell in great stone towers (called 'Druid Colleges'), which are scattered across the land. However, Druid villages still exist, and agriculture is practiced. Furthermore, the Druids have a number of coastal settlements, where the people's culture revolves around fishing. Bold Druids who believe the seas are their birthright plumb its unfathomable depths. The successful return more powerful, while those who fail leave treasures for the next.\nA reserved people, Druids generally maintain a calm and reflective demeanor, but the members of this order are not to be trifled with. Given their shared ancestry with the Barbarians, they possess great physical strength. While the Druids branched off from the Barbarians, they do not pay homage to them.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;'s estimate, in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, there were at least 500 high-ranking Druid &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s watching over and guiding much of Druidic culture. Druids are willing to do anything to protect their way of life, including risking their own humanity by awakening the beast within. It has been indicated that the Druids of old were much more savage than those of more recent centuries.\nDruids practice &lt;a href=\"divination\"&gt;divination&lt;/a&gt;. Under the stars and new &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;, devotees often see new patterns in the night sky, hinting at things yet to come.\nMany druids revere the raven for its cleverness, loyalty, and foresight of dangers to come. This stems back to the belief that when &lt;a href=\"Vasily\"&gt;Vasily&lt;/a&gt; first taught under the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Oak\"&gt;Great Oak&lt;/a&gt;, a raven perched upon the tree to listen.\nAbilities.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"T%C3%BAr%20D%C3%BAlra\"&gt;T\u00far D\u00falra&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest of the Druid Colleges, stands the magnificent oak &lt;a href=\"Gl%C3%B3r-an-Fh%C3%A1idha\"&gt;Gl\u00f3r-an-Fh\u00e1idha&lt;/a&gt;. This tree is the most revered source of the Druids guidance and teachings. Under its branches, for centuries, the Druids hone not only their powerful arsenal of natural magic, but also the martial skills they have retained from their Barbarian forefathers. From a young age, Druids study their arts and hone their union with nature in the colleges of their people, which are scattered throughout their homeland.\nThe Druids shun the use of traditional &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, or Dubhdroiacht, as they call it. Living by the &lt;a href=\"Caoi%20D%C3%BAlra\"&gt;Caoi D\u00falra&lt;/a&gt;, a philosophy that exhorts oneness with the natural world, they instead practice a form of magic based in their close bond to nature. Through this intimate kinship with the world of Sanctuary, a Druid has the power to command fire, earth, and the winds. This includes the ability to summon lightning, and to call such a bolt is a momentous occasion for a young Druid. Those that survive seldom forget their first.\nDruids are so tied to the natural world that they can call upon the aid of animals and even plants to help them in battle. Druids are friends to the animals of the wilds and can call upon them to aid in his struggle. They can also use their heightened rapport with the animals to change the shape of their own body, drawing on the strengths and abilities of their woodland companions to better serve their cause. The most astounding Druid ability is that of shapeshifting, allowing them to manipulate their flesh and form to take on the characteristics of the beasts they have sworn to protect. Their &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Barbarian kin&lt;/a&gt; (or at least the &lt;a href=\"Henknoc%20Tribe\"&gt;Henknoc Tribe&lt;/a&gt; believe(d) that their ability to form bonds with animals is an ability latent to the Druids' &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. However, throughout their history, the Druids have always fought back against an encroaching wilderness.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nIn the ancient tome of the Druids, the \"&lt;a href=\"Sc%C3%A9al%20Fada\"&gt;Sc\u00e9al Fada&lt;/a&gt;\", it is written that &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt;, the great and ancient king of the Barbarian tribes, had a mysterious but trusted confidant, who was only referred to as &lt;a href=\"Fiacla-G%C3%A9ar\"&gt;Fiacla-G\u00e9ar&lt;/a&gt;. This man is sometimes described as Bul-Kathos's close friend, and at other times, he is referred to as his brother. Whatever the source of their relationship, their bond was strong, and together they shared the secrets of the ancients: of the mysteries below the peaks of &lt;a href=\"Mt%20Arreat\"&gt;Mt Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, of the venerated task put to their people to protect those mysteries, and of the prophecies regarding the dark times ahead. They both agreed that, in order to fulfill their sacred trust, their people must devote themselves to nothing save that charge. However, they disagreed on exactly how the people could best do this. Bul-Kathos believed that only by bringing the tribes together and training them in strict martial discipline could the tribes faithfully concentrate on their goal for generations to come. Fiacla-G\u00e9ar, on the other hand, believed that only through obtaining a spiritual oneness with the land they had sworn to protect could the people truly appreciate the importance of their role.\nBoth agreed the other's philosophy had merit, and so around the time Bul-Kathos united the tribes, Fiacla-G\u00e9ar gathered together a small group consisting of the tribes' greatest warrior-poets and shamans and mysteriously retreated into the forests surrounding the area known as &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;. There he and his people created the first of the Druid Colleges, huge mortar-less stone towers, covered in vines and safely hidden beneath the leafy canopies of the dense forests. They have dwelt there ever since, forging a new way of life for themselves. They created a new culture and language, cutting themselves off from their Barbarian cousins and their ways, vowing not to return to the Steppes of Mt. Arreat until the time of the &lt;a href=\"Uileloscadh%20M%C3%B3r\"&gt;Uileloscadh M\u00f3r&lt;/a&gt;, the final battle between the men of the world and the demons of the Burning Hells.\nHere, in preparation for the impending conflict, he taught his people the Caoi D\u00falra, a way of thinking that holds harmony with the natural elements of the world, its plants and animals, as the heart of its most intrinsic beliefs, for they are the personification of the very world that the Druids have sworn to protect. Not only was Caoi D\u00falra the basis for their system of values, but through its study and practice, the Druids learned to bond with the natural entities of Sanctuary. This bonding was so absolute that eventually they discovered how to talk to the plants and animals, and these beings taught them all the secrets of the natural world. They taught them methods to call animals from far away, how to summon sentient plants from the earth, ways to change their own forms to share the strengths of their animal cousins, even, to a limited extent, techniques to control the weather. The Druids continued to hone themselves to be the world's last line of defense when the time of the great conflict came.\nEven at the height of their powers, the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt; never dared enter Scosglen, for fear of the wild and the savage powers its inhabitants wielded. Yet there are a number of tales from the Druids' ancient days that speak of formidable &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s encroaching on Scosglen, only to be turned back or killed by the power of the Druids.\nThe Mage Clan Wars.\nThe Druids apparently played a role in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, one that soured their relationship with their Barbarian cousins. The Druids were thus banished from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and their powers kept a secret in Barbarian lands.\nUileloscadh M\u00f3r.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, the Druids believed the final conflict be at hand. Lashing out in fury at the recent insurgence of denizens of the Burning Hells, and at the Leathdhiabhala (demonic corruptions of the very creatures they have vowed to defend), the Druids at last emerged from their forests, marching toward their final stand against the minions of Chaos. One of their number returned to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to aid &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; in its defense against &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, allying with a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;. The Lord of Destruction was defeated, but at the cost of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Simultaneously, the Druids defended their own lands from Baal's forces.\nThe Great Enmity.\nIn the decades after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, dark times descended upon the Druids. &lt;a href=\"Khazra\"&gt;Khazra&lt;/a&gt; rampaged across Scosglen, slaughtering farmers mere feet from the torchlight of their towns. The people huddled together, hoping their numbers would keep them safe, but the moment they left the safety of civilization they found themselves lost and surrounded by these feral nightmares. Those on the coast fared no better, as the coastline was overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the danger, the Druids of the coast continued to fish in the Frozen Sea.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, Druids had settled in &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;. They retained their practice of the Old Ways and their reverence of nature, but remained in perpetual conflict with the &lt;a href=\"nangari\"&gt;nangari&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nThe is a playable class in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", introduced in the game's .\nDiablo III.\nThe Druid was considered for inclusion in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" per the 'hero pack' concept, but the first hero was chosen to be the .\nDiablo IV.\nThe is one of the confirmed classes for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Druid culture as a whole is expected to be explored in the game, at least for those on the coast.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nThe Druid is under consideration for inclusion in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nNotable Druids.\n\"Main article: \""}

Vegetation is rare, and what vegetation there is consists of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus\"&gt;poplar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haloxylon_ammodendron\"&gt;saxaul trees&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Steppes are an incredibly dangerous place to live, and only the most ruthless or most desperate call them home.\nA variety of beliefs exist(ed) in the Dry Steppes. These include elements of wind worship (e.g. \"wind favor you\") ancestor worship (e.g. \"Ancestors keep you\"), and polytheistic worship (e.g. \"oh gods\"). Some believe that spirits haunt the Steppes, calling out to the living through the &lt;a href=\"Crag%20Song\"&gt;Crag Song&lt;/a&gt;. Old folklore in the Steppes states that &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; bones ward off curses. In the past, some willingly offered themselves to the pools of &lt;a href=\"the%20Boiling%20Plains\"&gt;the Boiling Plains&lt;/a&gt; as an act of ritual suicide. The Steppes' conception of an afterlife involves/involved \"the plains beyond.\" In ancient times, a being known as the &lt;a href=\"Grinning%20One\"&gt;Grinning One&lt;/a&gt; was worshipped.\nTerrifying effigies are a common sight in the Steppes, built as offerings to appease great evil. To dress oneself in their image is to invite their fury.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThe Dry Steppes gave rise to native civilization(s). They were once ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Overseers\"&gt;Overseers&lt;/a&gt;; a line of slaver kings who ruled out of &lt;a href=\"Guulrahn\"&gt;Guulrahn&lt;/a&gt;. Even long after their end, their relics remained spread across the Steppes, leaving suffering in their wake.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; established a presence in the region. The Zakarum architecture was more distinct and refined than the native one, and in addition to &lt;a href=\"Orbei%20Monastery\"&gt;Orbei Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, established a number of storage and keep-sake areas. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; marched across the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Crusade\"&gt;Zakarum Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and set sail from &lt;a href=\"the%20Scarred%20Coast\"&gt;the Scarred Coast&lt;/a&gt;. By this point, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; roamed the coast, and the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s did what they could to cull the undead. In the end, they only served to add to the undead's number.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Inquisition\"&gt;Zakarum Inquisition&lt;/a&gt;, the church had effectively annexed the Steppes (or at least part of them), and the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;Hand of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; oversaw the &lt;a href=\"Dindai%20Flats\"&gt;Dindai Flats&lt;/a&gt;. \"Heresy\" was rooted out through violent means, much to the anger and grief of the locals. In some cases, entire villages were left in ruins, and it appears that some of the locals were converted to worship of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, willingly or otherwise.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, a splinter group of the &lt;a href=\"Oxen%20Tribe\"&gt;Oxen Tribe&lt;/a&gt; made their way into the Steppes. The city of &lt;a href=\"Ked%20Bardu\"&gt;Ked Bardu&lt;/a&gt; grew around their encampment. Similarly, with Zakarum having collapsed, the town of Jirandai was built on the ruins of Zakarum's old empire.\nThe Great Enmity.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, the Steppes were ravaged by war due to the power vacuum &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; created when he decimated Sanctuary. The Zakarum's storage sites and keep-sakes were laid to waste, and Orbei Monastery fell into ruin.\nMany years ago, the &lt;a href=\"Cannibals\"&gt;Cannibals&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the Steppes and spread their terror into lands beyond. Conflict engulfed the Steppes as s and &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Steppewardens\"&gt;Steppewardens&lt;/a&gt; fought against the Cannibals. The conflict did not end in the Steppes' favor, as the Cannibals remained present in the Steppes, and remained in perpetual conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Crane%20Tribe\"&gt;Crane Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther groups still operated within the Steppes, trying to win the hearts and minds of the people living there. With &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;'s return, the darker side of mankind became more dominant, and many in the Steppes gave into it, giving into the darkness for more power and turning to cannibalism. The &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;, which now served Lilith, marched across the Steppes and took a number of unfortunates and brought them to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Civo\"&gt;Mount Civo&lt;/a&gt;, where they were slaughtered. Others willingly joined the Triune, as the cult promised an escape from their suffering. The Triune also burnt trading caravans.\nAt/around the time of Lilith's return, the situation in the Steppes was further deteriorating. In the north, wasp attacks caused farmers to flee their fields and enter &lt;a href=\"Farobru\"&gt;Farobru&lt;/a&gt;. In the west, bandits blocked the pass to the south of &lt;a href=\"Ked%20Bardu\"&gt;Ked Bardu&lt;/a&gt;, which meant that merchants stayed inside the city. &lt;a href=\"Guulrahn\"&gt;Guulrahn&lt;/a&gt; fell to the Cannibals, the survivors fleeing to Ked Bardu. &lt;a href=\"Jirandai\"&gt;Jirandai&lt;/a&gt; managed to keep the Cannibals at bay, but at heavy cost, and rumors spread of secret Cannibals lurking in towns.\nRecent Events.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Malignant\"&gt;Malignant&lt;/a&gt; spread to the Dry Steppes after Lilith's defeat, encroaching on &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s with each passing day. was entrusted by &lt;a href=\"Cormond\"&gt;Cormond&lt;/a&gt; to hold them at bay while he searched for a cure. The &lt;a href=\"Malignant%20Tunnels\"&gt;Malignant Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; in the Steppes were cleared out by the Wanderer, and ultimately, the Malignant were wiped out.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Zir\"&gt;Zir&lt;/a&gt; ordered the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Seekers\"&gt;Blood Seekers&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; forces to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Harvest\"&gt;conquer&lt;/a&gt; the Dry Steppes.\nIn-game.\nThe Dry Steppes are one of six main geographic areas that can be explored in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDevelopment.\nInitially, the Steppes were conceived as grasslands. The decision was made to add dark rocks that complement the pale blonde and rusty grasses. To help provide extra visual interest in the region, the Environment Art team created a salt flats biome.\nNotable Locations.\n\"Main article: \nRegions.\nThe Dry Steppes are divided into the following major regions:"}

Sand Sharks) are a type of Beast &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Dune Thresher is an elusive being with a tremendous capacity for bloodshed. It lurks beneath the sands, rising up to seize prey in its jaws and rend the body until it is but sinew and gore. They travel beneath the sand similar to how a fish might travel through water. The churning of the sand is a telltale sign of their presence. They cut through the sand using their jutting, angular lower jaw, which allows the Thresher to swim effortlessly beneath the sand with unimaginable swiftness. They are attracted to noise from the surface, which is how they detect their prey. \nIt is a misconception that standing on rocks will keep one safe from a Dune Thresher. In reality, the creatures are capable of jumping up and pulling their prey off rocks to their death.\nThreshers are said to find &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20the%20Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Essence of the Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; to be irresistible.\nHistory.\nDune Threshers were driven away from settled locales to the deep desert wastes of the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt; long before the present day. Consequently, Dune Threshers are rarely seen by the city-dwellers of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. However, every so often, whether due to injury or old age, a Dune Thresher will venture to the edge of civilization to feast on &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. When this happens, a professional hunter is called in to end the threat.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nDune Threshers are encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Windswept%20Sands\"&gt;Windswept Sands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt; zone in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo III.\nDune Threshers are encountered in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", albeit only in areas where there is sand. The &lt;a href=\"Moontooth%20Dreadshark\"&gt;Moontooth Dreadshark&lt;/a&gt; is the only exception, for it lurks in the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20of%20Caldeum\"&gt;Sewers of Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;).\u00a0\nNormally they move very quickly underground, making only their bladed spines visible at surface (hence the Sand Sharks name). In this form, they are harmless, but are also impervious to damage. From time to time, they emerge from beneath the sand, delivering quick and damaging melee attacks with their jaws. The main danger is their ability to burrow at will, making you unable to damage them continuously. This is especially irritating if they also have a Shielding affix. They may not burrow 4 seconds after emerging, and can spend 3 seconds burrowed in combat.\nTheir toughness is slightly above average, but killing them may take a lot of time, especially if they are an Elite pack. Also avoid being killed by the elite affix long-lasting abilities while the Threshers are hiding below."}

New features have been implemented, such as seamless floor transitions, as well as transition scenes. These are scenes that allow the developers to connect two different tile-sets together in the same dungeon, while keeping it randomized. Dungeons are designed to feel congruent with the world, that these are structures that exist for a reason. Their aesthetics reflect the zone they're found in (sand-filled dungeons in &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; for instance).\nOver 150 dungeons feature in the game. Some dungeons are tied to the game's main storyline, others to side quests. However, the majority of dungeons are self-contained in terms of plot. Some \"mini dungeons\" exist that are only one room. Some dungeons are story-exclusive, and can only be played once.\nCompleting a dungeon grants the player &lt;a href=\"renown\"&gt;renown&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s become dungeons after being cleared out the first time. After completing the game's main quest, players will gain access to \"Nightmare Dungeons.\" These are remixed versions of dungeons, filled with stronger &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s, new objectives, and other afflictions. Upon completion, each dungeon grants the player an &lt;a href=\"aspect\"&gt;aspect&lt;/a&gt;; each aspect is unique to the dungeon it is found in.\nDungeons are solitary experiences, though may be completed as part of a party. Each dungeon has a recommended &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the game's zone map, dungeons are marked by an iron gate icon.\nDevelopment.\nThe dungeons in \"Diablo IV\" were developed by the \"dungeon team.\""}

They are instanced, four-player experiences. Each dungeon has a specific number of &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; and a selection of &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es. They are designed to be completed quickly, and are intended for groups of players, though can be completed solo. They are expected to take players 10\u201315 minutes to complete (in reality they can be done in a few minutes). Multiple difficulties are available. Each boss has items unique to their loot table.\nDungeons can be queued from anywhere. A &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; is located at the end of each dungeon. Dungeons have a chance to drop a &lt;a href=\"set%20item\"&gt;set item&lt;/a&gt;, with a guaranteed drop after at most every 7 runs if using the Random Dungeon finder.\nDungeons feature a damage statistics tracker that shows the breakdown of damage done per skill.\n&lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; zones are regarded as dungeon in some respects, though are practically just single boss arenas and don't use many of the mechanics associated with the dungeons described on this page (which are sometimes referred to as daily dungeons to be specific).\nRandom Dungeon.\nThe Random Dungeon feature allows entering into any dungeon that is looking for a party. It can be found by opening the Party Finder from the menu (not by opening the party view using the icon next to the character portrait). It can also be opened from the Codex, but only if there is no &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Points\"&gt;Battle Point&lt;/a&gt; reward to claim, as the Claim button replaces the search button. When accepting the party, the Random Dungeon entry animation crossfades into the entry animation of the dungeon chosen, and then the dungeon loads. Completing a dungeon via Random Dungeon adds a pity counter that guarantees a &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Item&lt;/a&gt; after at most 7 dungeons. The counter will only appear if there was no set item dropped using the normal drop mechanics, and is reset to zero after a set item drops in either way. A set item drop from the chest (as opposed to the boss) will not reset the counter.\nWarp to Final Boss.\nStarting with the &lt;a href=\"Splintered%20Souls\"&gt;Splintered Souls&lt;/a&gt; update, a portal may appear during a dungeon. This instantly warps players to the final boss, but the boss will be stronger than regular. It also increases rewards and &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s may spawn. This modifier was called \"Greed's Spoils\" in the patch notes but this name is not used in the game, instead the popup window has the label \"Warp to Final Boss\" under the icon.\nChallenge Dungeon.\nThe Challenge Dungeon option (available at Inferno I or higher) increases the difficulty of the dungeon for the chance of better rewards. There is a weekly reward containing a &lt;a href=\"Set%20Item\"&gt;Set Item&lt;/a&gt; for clearing a Challenge Dungeon, and the drop rates for regular rewards is increased.\nMonsters have 300% more Life and deal 200% more damage in Challenge Dungeons. Additionally, one or two of the following modifiers are applied:\nHistory.\nTristram Cathedral and the Random Dungeon feature were added in the September 21 2023 update.\nThe update added the ability to vote to kick a player from Random Dungeons.\nThe damage tracker was added in the update.\nChallenge Dungeons were added in the update."}

Under the watchful eye of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; Brotherhood, Mephisto was moved to a secure location - he was imprisoned beneath the Guardian Tower in Travincal. The &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; were charged with safeguarding the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; acting as his jailors.

The previous &lt;a href=\"Que-Hegan\"&gt;Que-Hegan&lt;/a&gt;, a sage known as &lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim&lt;/a&gt;, proved to be incorruptible. An outraged Mephisto ordered the now corrupt priesthood to slay Khalim and scatter his remains. After that, &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;Sankekur&lt;/a&gt; was appointed by the demon lord to become the new Que-Hegan. Mephisto then ordered the priests to shatter his soulstone, freeing his infernal spirit. The Lord of Hatred then drove a shard of his soulstone in the left palm of each High Priest, with the largest shard piercing the hand of Sankekur. Over time, Sankekur would become the host of Mephisto's vile spirit. The &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Tower\"&gt;Guardian Tower&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Temple of Light, turned into the Blackened Temple. Mephisto ordered the Zakarumites to make human sacrifices in his name - a vile deed of which the evidence can still be found within the Durance.

Duriel exacted a heavy toll upon his foes, savouring in the screams of the wounded. However, the heroes were able to overcome and slay Duriel.\nThe Black Soulstone.\nDuriel was the second of the Great Evils that &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; marked for absorption into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. She approached him with fear, knowing that if he failed and he imprisoned her in his domain, she could look forward to years, possibly decades of torture before being granted the peace of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. However, when she found Duriel's soul, there was no confrontation. Duriel witnessed Diablo's vision of the End of Days and rejoiced. Even if he would be a 'passenger' to the Lord of Terror, the destruction Diablo would wreck would bring him indescribable pleasures. Thus, Adria marked his soul, using a circle formed from her own blood. The wounds would heal quickly, she reflected.\nDuriel's vision came to pass, as over 20 years after his defeat, Duriel became merged with Diablo, now the sole Prime Evil. After Diablo's defeat, all the lords of Hell were returned to the Black Soulstone, their souls screaming for release. The stone was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to defeat &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, but he was defeated, and Diablo freed, still containing the essence of Duriel and the other Evils. At some point, Duriel became free of Diablo, regenerated and came to reside in Sanctuary.\nThe Great Enmity.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; entered the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Realm of Hatred&lt;/a&gt; through the Hell Gate located beneath &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, she summoned Duriel with one mission; to ensure that didn't follow her into Hell. Duriel laired in a &lt;a href=\"Foul%20Cistern\"&gt;cistern&lt;/a&gt; near the gate. There the Wanderer, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Donan\"&gt;Donan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; encountered him, and at the end, he fell before the Wanderer's might.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nDuriel is the &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; of of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". He is located in &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, which can be accessed after using the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Staff%20%28item%29\"&gt;Horadric Staff&lt;/a&gt; on the orifice found in the real &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering the Chamber, players immediately encounter Duriel, who yells, \"looking for &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nDuriel has a unique item named after him, &lt;a href=\"Duriel%27s%20Shell\"&gt;Duriel's Shell&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"cuirass\"&gt;cuirass&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that being an insect-type demon, it is his moulted shell and not his real carapace.\nDuriel can drop &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Essence%20of%20Suffering\"&gt;Twisted Essence of Suffering&lt;/a&gt; when killed in difficulty.\nStrategy and Other Additional Information.\nDuriel is perhaps the toughest boss in \"Diablo II\", largely due to the circumstances under which he is encountered: in a very small room with a fairly low-level character.\nDuriel is extremely fast despite his size and is exceedingly strong as well. He has an aura around him (&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, which can be learned by &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; as well) that periodically freezes the player(s) and any mercenaries, slowing movement speed. The combination of his freezing aura in addition to his speed and strength makes Duriel a difficult boss to conquer. It should be noted that Holy Freeze is not affected by &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold Resistance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cannot%20Be%20Frozen\"&gt;Cannot Be Frozen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thawing%20Potion\"&gt;Thawing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s will not offer any protection either, but the latter are extremely useful for reducing the amount of damage Duriel deals, which is largely Cold-based. Make sure to wear equipment with Cold Resistance and, before entering the boss chamber, drink a large number of Thawing Potions; while the +50 Cold Resistance and +10 maximum Cold Resistance effect won't stack, the duration of the effect will.\nDuriel can be a very hard boss due to the fact that there are no exits in his room. As soon as players enter his chamber, they are confronted by Duriel and the only option of escape is Town Portal scrolls. As said before, Duriel's speed and freezing aura make it hard to outrun him, and the very small size of the chamber makes it difficult to keep away from him for more than a couple of seconds. After the player kills Duriel the first time, on the second playthrough they can lure Duriel to the big chamber for more room to fight him. It's wise to bring as many minions as possible and a &lt;a href=\"Hireling\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; in order to buy you some time. Though it usually only takes a few swipes (sometimes just one) for Duriel to kill any minion or mercenary, it should at least give you enough time to open up a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Using &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; attacks against Duriel will slow him down significantly. If possible, attack from range, though Barbarians, Paladins and other melee classes will probably have to face Duriel in close combat. However, Duriel also has a charge attack he uses against characters out of melee range that can only be prevented by making the character (or their mercenary/minion) stand close enough to Duriel. \nDuriel can also use Smite as an attack that stuns players and knocks them back, which can be quite annoying to deal with as he will sometimes chain the knockbacks together until you hit a wall and can not be knocked back any further. If he does, and if you somehow manage to survive the onslaught (and are a melee character), it would be wise to stick close to the wall while fighting him.\nMost classes will fight Duriel the way they would fight against any other monster. &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es might have to take extra caution as at this stage of the game, your stats will be low in the areas required for heavy equipment.\nAssassin's Burst of Speed ability makes an Assassin a more potent combatant against Duriel as with this ability activated, Assassins can usually outrun Duriel and perform hit-and-run tactics. Coupled with a combination of &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Strike\"&gt;Tiger Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cobra%20Strike\"&gt;Cobra Strike&lt;/a&gt;, players can heal themselves from Duriel's attacks. Assassins could also rely on traps and Burst of Speed, especially if the player will specifically build an Assassin class specialized in Traps.\nAfter Duriel has been slain, the chamber will be violently shaken and explosions occur on all sides, illuminating the chamber. Some sort of maggots and snails appear from Duriel's torn body; they won't do any harm and can be squished underfoot. A wall collapses and players can move on to explore Tal Rasha's inner chamber.\nStrategy for the Necromancer.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Duriel%20Necro%20Strategy\"&gt;Necromancer vs Duriel&lt;/a&gt; \"\nStrategy for the Sorceress.\nRecruit a mercenary (if the player hasn't already) and open a Town Portal as soon as you enter the room. While your associate fights Duriel, make sure to be near enough and use &lt;a href=\"Static%20Field\"&gt;Static Field&lt;/a&gt; to rapidly bring Duriel's health down, though the skill will become less efficient the lower his life gets. Also note, in it will have no effect below 33%, or below 50% in . Be sure also to give the hireling rejuvenation or healing potions to extend his time in combat, escaping to town when the mercenary is about to die. If a player provides the mercenary with a good spear and good armour, they may see Duriel go down at first attempt in difficulty. Also, it's good to have a few points invested in Static Field... as it is an elemental version of &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt;, and will work on any monster that is not &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to Lightning.\nStrategy for the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany people have problems in facing Duriel at normal in solo mode, at level 21-22 around, with Amazon with a bow. Hire an &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Act II Merc&lt;/a&gt; (possibly the defensive one) and use Full Rejuvenation potions to heal him (you can farm Rejuvenation potions in easier levels and then cube them) while you keep shooting Duriel from sufficient distance. As long as you are able to keep your merc alive, you can continue to shoot him. If the mercenary dies, try to escape with Town Portal and come back again. If you have a really good bow, you should be able to do it with only 4-6 Full Rejuvenation Potions.\nStrategy for the Paladin.\nWith this build, when you meet Duriel, you should only do the following:\nIt is simple, taking no more than a minute. Just wait for him to die, and take care to heal yourself appropriately. Use any hireling of your choice, and if possible, provide him/her with a weapon that adds additional Fire and/or Lightning attacks.\nDiablo III.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Remnant of Pain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", representing Duriel.\nDiablo IV.\nDuriel returns as an enemy in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHis appearance is slightly altered compared to his \"Diablo II\" incarnation: he is less insect-like and more reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Ghom\"&gt;Ghom&lt;/a&gt;, with a fanged vertical maw in place of a stomach, more bestial and less insectoid jaws, and his crest now faces forward, in addition to the quills on his shoulders and a smaller crest at the back of his head. He also lacks the secondary pair of short, useless arms on his toroso.\nHe is fought in the &lt;a href=\"Foul%20Cistern\"&gt;Foul Cistern&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, and he attacks with a shoulder slam that inflicts knockback followed by an overhead slam, digging from area to area, and claw swipes. He will launch corrosive poison orbs, and he will also grab players with the mouth on his torso, chew on them, and then toss them away. He cannot be damaged while he is underground. When he takes a large percentage of damage, he will go berserk, making his attacks faster and more lethal, in addition to moving faster, and he will stop digging.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Duriel\"&gt;Echo of Duriel&lt;/a&gt; is able to be summoned. &lt;a href=\"Paingorger%20Gauntlets\"&gt;Paingorger Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; are Duriel-themed &lt;a href=\"gloves\"&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nBy all accounts, Duriel loves to torture and inflict pain. However, he does not seem to care what the pain means to the recipient. He appears to love the music of their screams, and their agony on a sensual level. Even demons are subjected to his torment.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, Duriel considers himself a master of pain but is only interested in physical torment rather than mental anguish. Many writings suggest that if Duriel were not in a position to inflict pain on a victim, he would subject himself to excruciating pain and be sated. According to Duriel himself, however, \"the anticipation of pain is often more exquisite than its fruits.\""}

{"id": "10402", "revid": "175135", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10402", "title": "Duriel Necro Strategy", "text": "Strategy for the Necromancer.\nThis is a guide for any kind of a ranged necromancer build.\nThis is possible on any difficulty, but hardest to do it on is in normal because you will NEED &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison\"&gt;Bone Prison&lt;/a&gt; for it to work. To do this well, you don't need any kind of mercenary or a summon, but a cold Iron Wolf or Rogue will help your bone prison last longer. What you need to do is just imprison Duriel as soon as you enter the room, so that he is around the middle. He must not be too close to you as his melee attack has a decent range. If you want to, you can cast iron maiden on him so he gets damaged if he attacks the prison, but not recommended as his AI doesn't let him do that, not even on hell difficulty. Once he is in the prison, just teeth/bone spear/bone spirit/range him till he dies, recasting bone prison every few seconds so he doesn't accidentally break it or so it doesn't run out of time. You will need a fair share of mana potions and the fight will take you a total of 1000-1500 mana with a fully synergized bone spirit on hell.\nThis guide is for a typical (skeleton) &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; against Normal-difficulty Duriel.\nA Necromancer with at least some summons (and a golem) is perfectly capable of going through Acts I and II without spending a single stat point in the process, since summons are effectively extra life points, are very cheap compared to how much damage they can do, and make it unnecessary for you to get better weaponry and armor. You will probably get to the entrance of Duriel's Lair somewhere around level 21, and if you conserve these points you should have 100 free attribute points. Save these for after your first encounter with Duriel, because you will want to know how to place your attribute points. (You'll probably want to have added 40 points or so into vitality.) The objective is to allow yourself to be defeated in the first engagement and gauge your need for the various attributes, and to get a \"sense of proportion\". You will actually get around to taking on Duriel at another time.\nIf you don't have all these extra attribute points, you'll have less flexibility but it does not mean that it will be impossible.\nBefore you enter Duriel's Lair for the first time, open a Town Portal in the staff chamber. That way you won't need to worry about running right into Duriel upon your return via portal. When the actual battle begins, however, you will want to open a portal up the moment you enter the Lair and then just stay put, going through at a moment's notice.\nSo try it! Take on Duriel with whatever skills and weaponry you have. Things you should note while fighting it:\nThe conclusions you should gain from this experience are:\nAnd now, how to defeat Duriel...:\nNo Need for Items.\nAdditional Defense and Attack Rating won't be of much help. Why? Because although Duriel's stats say that it does 19-25 damage per hit, in battle it'll feel like it's doing around 60-180 damage with every hit as it keeps using a Charge attack and attacks incredibly fast. Defense only reduces the chance you'll be hit, and given Duriel's high Attack Rating your Defense won't come close to compensating. Even a shield that states 28% Chance to Block really only has around 7% chance to block and so isn't very useful either (the key is to stay out of harm's way).\nAs for attacks, you will want to be using Bone Spear rather than any other weapon, so don't bother with Attack Rating boosters. After all, if you get killed you'll lose your weaponry. This eliminates any need for higher-end items, so you shouldn't need higher Strength or Dexterity.\nSo don't make getting additional life, cold resist, or defense - for yourself, your mercenary, or your minions - your top priority. None of that will help you for more than a second. You will, however, need to have at least 100 life somehow (perhaps using attribute points) so that you can survive at least one attack and cast Town Portal.\nYou shouldn't need to be equipped with any items at all! Be self-sufficient on skills alone.\nThat said, the first-time-around items you should be getting are:\nYou won't be needing potions either, because as was mentioned earlier, if you're using potions you'll die before they take effect (Duriel hits much harder than potions can recover) and using Full Rejuvenation Potions will be a total waste. Instead, you'll want to be using a Blood Golem for true defense.\nSkills.\nIt is advisable that you have at least the following skill points:\nAll of these are skills that either are prerequisites for other skills or are going to be useful in the long run anyway. This adds up to 11+, when you're on level 21, so you should have around 10 free skill points to add where you find them necessary. The ones that are useful for the fight against Duriel are Blood Golem and Iron Maiden, and to a lesser extent Skeletal Mage, Raise Skeleton, Bone Spear.\nFamiliarize yourself with the effects of Blood Golem and Iron Maiden. Iron Maiden returns 200% damage. With 200+ life, a Blood Golem is in this situation twice as useful as a Clay Golem because it has twice as much life as a Clay Golem, with 100+ life, which means that a Duriel under an Iron Maiden curse loses twice as much life killing a Blood Golem as it would killing a Clay Golem, and in boss battles time is everything. The \"blood transfer\" aspect isn't much of a handicap because if Duriel ever gets to you you're dead in 1\u20133 seconds anyway. Make sure you can cast Iron Maiden in a split second with near perfect precision - practice with using it on your Blood Golem in your battles in the Tomb of Tal Rasha until you can do it effectively. Practice summoning a new Blood Golem and then casting Iron Maiden right next to it in the same second; get a new mouse if your old one is unreliable; this will come in very useful in the boss battle. The idea is to have a Blood Golem always in the front line and taking the damage\nHotkey your Blood Golem, Iron Maiden, and Town Portal buttons right next to each other and practice using them early. The last thing you want is to accidentally select the wrong spell while in battle. If you have Bone Spear, set it as your primary attack (left click option) instead of a weapon because Bone Spear will always hit, you won't last long enough to run out of mana and you don't want to fight melee anyway.\nThe skeleton minions are only truly viable the first time you fight Duriel because after that you won't have any corpses to work with. So you'll want to conserve every skeleton mage you have, and you can be sure all your skeleton warriors will die in the first engagement, one hit each. You can use Unsummon (from the right-click option menu) to get rid of skeleton magi until you're left with all cold and poison magi, which are the types you want (one to slow Duriel down and one to deal damage). Don't bother putting more than 3 points into Skeleton Mage; they're a minor contribution at best.\nMercenary.\nMake sure you have a mercenary with you. It should be one of the following:\nPreferably a weapon with a fast attack rate and one with +X Poison Damage. You can get +X Cold Damage with a Sapphire and you can get +X Poison Damage with an Emerald. The cold damage is irrelevant; however, slowing Duriel is going to be useful considering how fast it is. The poison damage is the most effective of all the gem varieties and damage over time is no problem. The idea is to do as much damage as you can as fast as you can before you get killed, because you certainly can't do much to avoid damage. Don't bother equipping anything expensive for your mercenary outside of a good weapon - even an armor with 100 defense will be of little use.\nFighting Duriel, Part I.\nThere are two phases to fighting Duriel. In Phase 1, you are going in for the first time (or, second time after the first visit mentioned earlier), complete with your mercenary, your Blood Golem, three Skeletal Magi and at least one Skeleton, and with your items. Before you enter the Lair, you open up a Town Portal. (If you want to, move away slightly from your starting place, by no more than a few meters, so you aren't with your back to a wall, but make sure you are never the closest to Duriel.) Your minions should take up positions on your corner of the room.\nThe moment Duriel appears in vision - which will be in 1\u20133 seconds - cast Iron Maiden at it, \"leading\" the casting of the curse so that Duriel is affected by it. You will need to re-cast Iron Maiden every dozen seconds or so - DON'T forget to re-cast it! While your forces are all attacking Duriel, your Skeletons and Blood Golem will close with the enemy. Duriel will take out any non-mage Skeletons you have in 2\u20135 seconds and then proceed to eliminate your Blood Golem in 1\u20133 seconds more. During this time you can add your Bone Spears to the fray if you feel you are ready. However, your top priority is to summon a Blood Golem the instant the previous one dies so that you always have a Blood Golem on the field and keeping Duriel away from you. Every time you repeat the cycle - you summon a Blood Golem and Duriel kills it - Iron Maiden shaves 400 life off of the 4000-life Duriel. This cycle will happen roughly every 2 seconds, so you will really need to pay attention to perpetuating the cycle as opposed to attacking Duriel with Bone Spear, which does roughly 50-80 damage over the course of the cycle. Keep things in perspective - keeping a Blood Golem out on the field is far more damaging to Duriel than constantly streaming Bone Spears at it. You will need to use your mana potions if you don't want to end up mana-drained.\nHowever, summoning Blood Golems is not a perfect art, and so in 2-4 Blood Golems Duriel will have wiped out everything else you have or otherwise have gotten to you. At that point you will only have 1\u20133 seconds of life left, so make the most of it with a final Iron Maiden (your Bone Spears will be slower because you'll be alternatively stunned and chilled whenever Duriel attacks). Then you'll die. If you haven't shaved off at least 1/5 of Duriel's HP by this time, you're doing something wrong.\nThe good thing about fighting Duriel is that the good guy (you) gets to come back to life and continue on.\nFighting Duriel, Part II.\nIn Phase II, you rush back through Lut Gholein, summoning a Blood Golem and resurrecting your Mercenary in the process before rushing back through the Town Portal. If you had cast the Town Portal in the True Tomb of Tal Rasha, you will be able to back-track and summon more minions from the corpses. Remember, a few cold skeleton mages will buy you lots of valuable time against Duriel.\nIf you had cast the Town Portal from Duriel's Lair, you will enter back in Duriel's Lair. The first order of business upon re-entry is always to open up a new Town Portal, because if you don't, you won't be able to continue the fight after you're defeated. The next thing to do is to cast Iron Maiden on Duriel. The third would be to summon a second Blood Golem, since by this time 2\u20133 seconds will have elapsed and your first Blood Golem would be pretty much dead. In between the periodic summoning of the Blood Golem, do try to get in a few more hits with your Bone Spear. You won't survive for more than 20 seconds but if you are able to get Duriel to slay 2-3 Blood Golems - and don't forget to cast Iron Maiden - that's another 800-1200 shaved off its life. Then you'll die again.\nAnd again. And again. (...)\nAnd then, Duriel will die. It may take as many as ten rounds to accomplish the feat, but the rewards are very much worth it.\nAfter you've defeated Duriel, make looting, getting to Tyrael, and \"Save and Exit Game\" your first order of the day to ensure that you won't have to go through all that again.\nConclusion.\nOn the Normal difficulty, Duriel can be killed with ease. Despite that this page describes Duriel as a difficult boss, it's actually a pretty easy and manageable battle on Normal (albeit not the same on Nightmare and Hell). And the above guide is probably more accurate if describing Duriel on Nightmare/Hell.\nThe following skills on bold are required, others are just a prerequisite:\nThe following strategy will be used\nIt should take 3 visits at most to kill Duriel on Normal\nTrivia.\nBone prison and bone wall can save you from getting killed, giving you a chance to cast a Town Portal."}

As such, any item worn proves virtually useless, since they are lost once the player dies until the corpse is reclaimed. This strategy is for Sorceresses on levels 21 or above, by which time she should have several points in and one in .\nIt is strongly recommended that the Sorceress casts a Town Portal outside the chamber, since running right into Duriel is something very unfavorable. This of course kills any chance of returning into the town and taking time to refill potion belts and heal herself, but it is very most likely that she will be killed at least once, which empties the belt save the last patch, and therefore it is better to enter the safety outside for time to recast Town Portal outside and face Duriel again.\n deals massive damage in relatively low levels. It is best for the Sorceress to have reached at least level 23 (which she is in fact likely to have after going through the Arcane Sanctuary and the six fake Tombs of Tal Rasha), making the Fire Wall at around level 3 or 4, which deals a staggering damage of around 180. Though it is likely to be lost on death, a staff that provides bonus to Fire Wall will help incredibly. Duriel is very strongly resistant to Cold damage, making Cold-based attacks nearly futile other than to slow him down.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;hireling&lt;/a&gt;'s sole purpose is to exist as a meat shield while the Sorceress stays back in relative safety and casts Fire Wall. Upon the hireling's death, Duriel will instantly charge at the Sorceress, who must respond by swiftly casting a fire wall in front of him (which will very likely damage him due to his size) and ing to the other side. She must be very quick on this, since if she allows herself to be struck she will be stunned and yields around 1.5 seconds (that feels like some five seconds) which is more than plenty for Duriel to finish her off. If she has traveled far enough, Duriel may in fact be confused and try to search for her nearby, which can buy her slightly some time to drink potions and half-refill the belt. One round of this is in fact likely to have damaged Duriel severely, taking down his life by around 10% to 15%. However, it must be noted that from the second round she lacks a hireling, which steals any time one would have bought for her.\nContinue this Fire Wall and Teleport until either the Sorceress is killed or her controller is quick enough to actually defeat him on the first encounter. If the former, she should take another mercenary as a meat shield and reenter the portal and cast another.\nUpon reentering the Chamber, the Sorceress may like to reclaim her corpse before turning to Duriel again, especially if she was holding any staff that boosted Fire Wall. Continue the casting Fire Wall and Teleport until Duriel is finally killed.\nAlternative strategies may be using &lt;a href=\"Static%20Field\"&gt;Static Field&lt;/a&gt; spell (not 1st level, a few more to have enough range) which really hurts non-lightning immune bosses eating average 10% of his life per blast (assuming he's in range), paired with hasted shoes (+10% is enough). After hitting him hard to 30%-50% of his health (should be about the time your mercenary falls), start spamming or - Duriel will fall swiftly,\nBring some &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation%20Potion\"&gt;Rejuvenation Potion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt;s and make sure you've opened the portal first.\nAnother Strategy, if you have a lot of points in the charged bolt skill, is to use it as fast as you can while wearing increase cast rate rings. You will get more hits this way, and can cast town portal in Duriel's room and use a mercenary to block. Oddly the charged bolts are more effective than lightning or chain lightning or most other skills.\nAdvantages.\nDuriel's unholy aura freezes the Sorceress and her hireling, but does not stop her from teleporting far away. As such, she is more likely to last much longer than any other class. Her spells, especially Fire Wall, are incredibly damaging even at lower levels, making them very effective even against stronger bosses, and especially Duriel who will suffer most due to his size.\nStatic Field is actually more damaging than Fire Wall in first few shots, but later wanes in strength. When that happens, switch to Nova.\nDisadvantages.\nThe Sorceress has no minion to summon, unlike most other classes who usually possess at least one type of summon. As such, her only cannon fodder is her hireling, buying her only a short time.\nWarning.\nNever, ever, ever confuse the keys between Fire Wall and Teleport. If she uses Fire Wall instead of Teleport, she may give away enough time for Duriel to butcher her. If she actually makes the rather comical mistake of using Teleport instead of Fire Wall, Duriel will see this as indicating the Sorceress having suddenly been kicked out of her mind in fright of his huge stature and amuse himself by hacking at her with his trademark wicked grin on his face. Therefore, never make the mistake of confusing between the two spells.\nThe lightning way is far safer since it takes only very little time to severely hurt Duriel, so a levelled &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; should buy enough."}

Prior to patch 2.4.3, each dye was a one-use bottle. As of the said patch, each dye is applied by &lt;a href=\"Mystic\"&gt;Mystic&lt;/a&gt; and no longer sold by vendors. \nA dye can change the color of an item's textures. As of patch 2.0., even &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; items can be dyed. Dying an item changes the color of armor or even makes it invisible (literally dying it into \"transparent\" color). There is a total of 22\u00a0different dyes, including two dyes that are only available to players who bought the Collector's Edition. &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; does not reset the coloring, using the applied color for any item model you transmogrify the painted item into.\nThe dyes were first mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt; during an interview following Gamescom 2010.\nNew dyes were originally unlocked by reaching new difficulties, but now they are just more expensive for more rich colors. Dyes cannot be purchased from vendors; no monsters, standard or Act Boss, can drop them. There are also restrictions on what dyes can be used on: due to bracers, belts, and jewelry\u00a0not making an appearance on the hero, they are impossible to dye, no matter the item rarity. Oddly, weaponry and shields possess immunity to being dyed as well. In addition, each item has a set of textures that can and cannot be dyed, for example, armor will always have a yellow trim, no matter which color you apply to the changeable texture.\nNote that dropped rare items are initially dyed with a random color.\nGold prices of each dye are fixed, from 360 to 5040. More expensive dyes become available as players progress towards the maximum level, most expensive dyes (5040 gold) becoming available by level 55-60. In pre-2.0 version of the game, it was tied to &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nAchievements.\nThere are a few achievements related to dyes. They are listed below:\nList of Dyes.\nMost of the time, the color of the bottle and the name of the dye reflect the true color it applies, with some exceptions. Dyes are listed below, from cheapest to most expensive:\nCut Dyes.\nThere were originally two more dyes, removed from the game before release:\nDiablo IV.\nDyes return in \"Diablo IV\". The system allows players to change the color palette of their armor pieces, such as changing silver to gold or replacing a white cloth for a black cloth, etc.\nEach part of the armor can be dyed, including the helmet, chest, gloves, legs, and boots. Players can dye each piece with a different color palette, or apply the same palette to all of them.\nDevelopment.\nThe game's dye system was challenging to implement because materials such as metal do not allow themselves to be dyed with inappropriate colors when they follow PBR (physically-based rendering) rules. To address this, the developers added data to armor that identifies specific material types and tells the dye system what color goes on what material, such as leather, fabric, metal, and other specific surfaces. The result is armor that is dyable in a range of colors that still feeling grounded and realistic."}

The feature was quickly made available year-round for all characters.\nGameplay.\nThe Echoing Nightmare is an endgame activity, where players fight within the memories of &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; who fell in a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;.

Only one player is required to transmute a Petrified Scream to open an Echoing Nightmare in a multiplayer game. Similar to a boss encounter, all players in a multiplayer game must accept a prompt to enter. While within an Echoing Nightmare, the difficulty scales as players progress in the encounter. Players can progress faster by defeating &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s quickly. The monsters inside a Nightmare don't drop &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, items, or &lt;a href=\"health%20globe\"&gt;health globe&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnce a Nightmare is complete, players receive experience, and a chest appears containing &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Gem\"&gt;Gem&lt;/a&gt;s, and a special &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt;, the . The Whisper of Atonement will already have a level up to 125 corresponding to the number of waves defeated during the Echoing Nightmare. Unlike other gems, the Whisper has no direct effect and cannot be &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed into items, but it can be used for other &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; recipes, and is meant for &lt;a href=\"augment\"&gt;augment&lt;/a&gt;ation.\nChallenge details.\nThe Echoing Nightmare is also the name of the zone in which the challenge takes place, which can have one of a handful of relatively small layouts. Each layout has four &lt;a href=\"Pylon\"&gt;Pylon&lt;/a&gt;s around the perimeter: Speed, Conduit, Channeling, and Power. The works normally to extend Pylon duration here. s obtained before the event starts also remain in effect.\nAs more waves are cleared, many monsters begin to be &lt;a href=\"Molten\"&gt;Molten&lt;/a&gt;, and periodically green meteors fall from the sky, forcing the player to keep moving. While in the Nightmare, Molten explosions deal Physical rather than Fire damage, so they cannot be bypassed with . &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s spawn periodically as well.\nThe challenge can continue past wave 125, but there is little to no benefit to continuing further, since the maximum level the reward can drop with is 125. For maximum reward, the Nephalem must \"clear\" wave 125, so they will be \"on\" wave 126 or above.\nThe Nephalem can die in the Echoing Nightmare, which ends the event immediately, even if they resurrect right away. This death is \"real\" for &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; characters. The entry portal disappears and &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used during the event, but simply ceasing attacks will quickly cause the Overwhelmed bar to fill up, at which point all remaining monsters die immediately. The Nephalem can still die from explosions just after being Overwhelmed.\nObjectives:\nOpening the reward chest grants experience and drops substantial loot, and the event closes 30 seconds afterward. The amount of loot is well above most chests or even &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt; guardians, so a large amount of free inventory space is recommended. The entry portal reappears once the fighting is done, and can be used without starting the ending timer, before opening the reward chest.\nTips.\nIt is best to use the Pylons on later waves when the player is under the most pressure. is highly recommended to extend their effect. To maximize success chance, the player may even seek out shrines beforehand, using the to receive their benefits during the entire event.\n also have their normal effect, so removing them beforehand may be preferred. However, the resulting &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Monster\"&gt;Rare Monster&lt;/a&gt; pack is unlikely to be more overwhelming than the waves already attacking, and they will drop their normal loot, which can be retrieved after the event is over. (Their power scaling may be based on the current &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt; setting rather than the current Nightmare Tier/wave.)\nEquipment and skills can be swapped out while in the Nightmare, although of course it is safer to activate the desired &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; ahead of time.\nDevelopment.\nInspiration for the Echoing Nightmare came from &lt;a href=\"Orek\"&gt;Orek&lt;/a&gt;'s words regarding &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s: \"many Nephalem have stood where you are now, but few succeeded in overcoming the trials.\" The Nightmare explores what happened to the Nephalem that did not succeed. The event bears a resemblance to the design of the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Realm of Trials&lt;/a&gt;, which was formerly required to unlock &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s: Both challenged players to defeat rapid waves of monsters, with the level of the reward increasing with the waves defeated.\nThe Echoing Nightmare was initially launched in April 2022 as a &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;-specific gameplay element for Season 26, \"The Fall of the Nephalem\". Midway through the season in May 2022, it was announced that Echoing Nightmares would be a permanent feature of the game available year-round."}

Whatever the truth of its origin, Rayek discovered that the tree was holding back a powerful &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; (apparently &lt;a href=\"Izilech%20the%20Mishappen\"&gt;Izilech the Mishappen&lt;/a&gt;) but was growing weaker by the moment. Meeting with a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, he suggested that they use the &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; on the tree.

The tree was torn open by Izilech's entrance into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The hero(es) woke up, and realized that they had been unconcious. Rayek explained that according to the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, all trees could see their &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;s. Apparently, the Einfrinn Tree had given them a vision of the future, and its own death in said future (the moment of Izilech's emergence). To avoid the outcome the Tree had foresworn, Rayek suggested using the tree as a personal gateway, to fight the demons before they were ready. To do this, they would have to build up the power of the Helliquary, in order to open the tree's portal.\nSometime later, a &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Slag\"&gt;red boulder&lt;/a&gt; crashed beyond the Wolf Gate.

During her youth, Eirena and her sisters were the servants of a &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;. She secretly read her master's spell books and taught her sisters what she learned, though the first spells they learned were nothing more than tricks. Once she miscast a &lt;a href=\"charm%20spell\"&gt;charm spell&lt;/a&gt; and Sister &lt;a href=\"Lysa\"&gt;Lysa&lt;/a&gt; was fawning over her for weeks. Ignorance and bliss ended, however, when she and her sisters learned that their master had begun to summon &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon learning this, the sisters waited until their master and other mages joined together in a ritual to summon a greater demon. Knowing of the mages' evil, Eirena and her sisters used their magic to kill the mages before they could complete their ritual. The mages, however,\u00a0 cursed them with their last breaths, and it seemed that they, too, would fall. But when Eirena awoke, she found &lt;a href=\"the%20Prophet\"&gt;the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; standing over her. Her life hung by a thread, but the Prophet used his powers to heal her and her sisters. He commended them on their deeds, and offered to train them further. They accepted, and at the age of thirteen, Eirena slew her first demon.\nHer group was called the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Hand of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. The Prophet himself, however, foresaw a great disaster that would occur &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;fifteen hundred years&lt;/a&gt; in the future. Eirena and her sisters pledged their lives to preventing the tragedy. The sisters\u2019 pledges were far from mere words, and the Prophet placed the entire sisterhood in a &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al slumber to preserve them until the appointed time. A time where they would aid a hero of the future.\nAwakening.\nShadows in the Desert.\nWhen Eirena awoke from her deep sleep, she found herself in a &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;land&lt;/a&gt; vastly changed from the one she remembered. Her sisters were dead, and the Prophet was nowhere to be found. Additionally, there were gaps in her memory, due to the Prophet's absence (his presence having spell-bound her as per the nature of the spell). Despite the shock of her situation, Eirena's focus was clear, and she gave herself over to the new age in the hope that she could discover its salvation.\nEirena spent days searching for the hero. She searched for her fellow sisters, and found the closest two in their chambers; dead, their bodies mutilated, the wounds bearing traces of demonic magic.\nEirena encountered &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. She warned them that the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; guarded the roads here, and would slay any who attempted to pass. She was able to unveil the Coven's mirages. After defeating the Coven at the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, she told The Nephalem of The Prophet and her order, and that she had been awakened to prevent the Lords of Hell from invading Sanctuary. The Nephalem welcomed her aid.\nThe Nephalem was allied with a group that included &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, a fallen &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; of Justice, and &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, adopted niece of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. She helped them navigate the desert and remained with the group. She could sense something odd about Leah, but was not sure exactly what. Still, she hoped that they would become firm friends. In contrast, Eirena was wary of Tyrael\u2014she knew him to be an angel the instant she beheld him. Yet in her mind, Man did not deserve his aid, especially in light of everything he had given up to aid them. They were later joined by Leah's mother, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;. Through the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to imprison the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; \nPrime Evil.\nAzmodan was similarly imprisoned by The Nephalem during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Siege of Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. However, Adria betrayed the group and turned the soulstone onto Leah, revealing that she had been bred as a vessel for &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; to be reborn as the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;. Eirena was wracked with guilt over her inability to perceive Adria's treachery or what had been lurking with Leah, but refused to give up the fight.\nThe fight itself entered the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, with Diablo leading an assault that would determine the fate of all Creation. During the battle, Eirena came across a dying angel. Even though he was in great pain, he stretched out to give Eirena an old document\u2014centuries old, even older than herself. By the time she reached his body however, his spirit was already gone.\nWith the aid of the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;, Eirena was able to translate the document. It had been written by an angel who saw great promise in humanity. An angel that she realized was the Prophet himself. She did not know whether the angel she had seen was the Prophet himself though, and the writings made it clear that the Prophet had operated in absolute secrecy. Her companion told her that she would have to find her own path in the world, and to that, Eirena agreed. And with the defeat of Diablo, she was free to do so.\nReaper of Souls.\nOver the course of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion and subsequent travel to &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;, Eirena started to hear the voices of her long lost sisters. Eventually she located the source \u2013 Sister &lt;a href=\"Lysa\"&gt;Lysa&lt;/a&gt;. After encountering Lysa, Eirena learned the truth \u2013 the Prophet chose Eirena to be the one to fight the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; after her sleep with all the other sisters given the choice of leaving the Sisterhood or sacrificing their lives to ensure Eirena survived until the End of Days. All of the Enchantresses agreed, save Lysa: furious that she was not the one chosen, she bargained with demons and attempted to kill her sisters in their sleep. The sisters, who woke up amidst the demonic horde, sacrificed their lives to protect Eirena, still in slumber, just as The Prophet predicted. Many years later, Lysa used the captured souls of her slain sisters to lure Eirena, now awakened and fighting at &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;'s side, to her trap in the &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Lair of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter fighting Lysa to her death, Eirena decided to continue the Prophet's work by assembling a new sisterhood. Rather than sleep for centuries, the new order would pass knowledge from generation to generation for as long as it took to fulfill their purpose.\nIn the last stages of the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt;, with considerable prompting from the Nephalem, confessed his feelings to Eirena, albeit in a roundabout way. Eirena took his suggestion to \"continuing their adventure together, at his side\" literally, stating happily that she was eager to do so and that she loved him as dearly as her Sisters.\nDisciples of Sanctuary.\nHaving long been studying and observing The Nephalem, Kormac, Eirena, and Lyndon formed the &lt;a href=\"Disciples%20of%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Disciples of Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, continuing to fight against the minions of Hell.\nGameplay.\nEquipment.\nIn battle, Eirena offers ranged support, largely spells channeled through staves and other magic implements to disorient her enemies and protect her allies. Her illusionary magic doesn\u2019t deal a tremendous amount of damage; instead, it focuses on twisting and warping the minds of others. Eirena\u2019s unique equipment \u2013 enchantment focuses associated with scrying and hypnotism, like eyes and mirrors \u2013 recalls the ancient mysticism of her order, providing her with potent increases to her abilities.\nUnlike Kormac and Lyndon, who fight with their weaponry, Eirena attacks with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;s, always dealing &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; damage, and therefore benefits from equipment with bonus to Arcane damage dealt.\nAvailable equipment:\nSkills.\nAs she gains experience, Eirena learns skills that help her better disable and disperse attackers (knocking them back, slowing them, or increasing the amount of damage they take), as well as more utility spells and protective enchantments that improve your defenses, increase the rate of your attacks and defense both against melee and projectile attacks. Her Disorient skill is potent enough to interrupt abilities of the bosses (up to and including Act Bosses), Charm allows taking control of \"anything\" lesser than a Boss (she can even use Elite monster's affixes against their former allies) and Focused Mind and Erosion give a significant damage boost.\nQuotes.\n\"Upon hiring the Enchantress\"\n\"When the Player gains a level\"\n\"Upon training\"\n\"Upon equipping with an item\"\n\"Upon noticing a rare monster or a champion pack\"\n\"Upon defeating a rare monster or a champion pack\"\n\"Upon taking damage\"\n\"Upon a near death\"\n\"Upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Ruins\"&gt;Forgotten Ruins&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Sands\"&gt;Desolate Sands&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Upon entering &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt;\"\nPersonality and Traits.\nEirena\u2019s mastery of enchantments and steely bravery in battle belie her youth. She can seem distant at times, but it is not her intent; she has speculated that part of her distance might be due to lingering effects from the sleeping spell. Vivacious, Eirena is quite naive and childish at times, but appears to have kind and compassionate personality: she even shows some degree of pity to &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; cultists (saying that it must have been great sorrow that drove them to join a cult), and is worried about saving innocents (even more than &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt; is). However, her compassion ends when it comes to demonkind. \nEirena dislikes the dark and is not fond of rain.\nEirena came to regard &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; as a surrogate elder brother/sister. The hero didn't mind, but told Eirena not to ask him/her for advice about men. Not a problem in one sense, as while Eirena sometimes thought about marriage, she decided it wasn't for her. Perhaps for this reason, Eirena failed to notice that Kormac was in love with her, something which surprised The Nephalem, given that Kormac's bumbling feelings were rather obvious. Eirena herself was aghast at the revelation. Her feelings to him were fraternal."}

By all accounts El'druin is a unique weapon, capable of cutting through any foe or substance in existence. However, some believe that the blade's edge cannot pass through or harm any being of righteous intent. The sword can destroy &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic seals.\nAdditionally, the sword has the ability to generate a small shield of some kind and protect its wielder from corruptive forces that would otherwise harm other &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt;. It also appears to have a degree of sapience. Only those with a righteous heart can wield the blade, and will not aid its user if used in anger. It carries &lt;a href=\"Lightsong\"&gt;angelic resonance&lt;/a&gt;, and is large enough to be carried with two hands.\nEl'druin, in a sense, is part of Tyrael himself. It is tied to his being, regardless of what form he takes, whether it be &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; or mortal. Even if Tyrael were to somehow become a full fledged human, El'druin would remain tied to him.\nEl'druin can sustain a mortal, allowing them to survive without food or water. It can purge mortals of corruption.\nA replica of El'druin hangs above the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Courts%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Courts of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nTyrael wielded El'druin throughout the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, but lost it when he was forced to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nSplintered Souls.\nAfter the Worldstone was destroyed, El'druin resided in the &lt;a href=\"Gully%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Gully of Madness&lt;/a&gt;, waiting for those brave enough to seek it. &lt;a href=\"The%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;The Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;\u2014guided by Tyrael's spirit, located the sword but were unable to wield it. El'druin rejected them, as their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; had been poisoned by destroying shards of the Worldstone. At Tyrael's urging, they carefully bundled the sword and took it out of the gully.\nCrucible of Justice.\nAfter returning from the Dreadlands, the Shard-seeker was still unable to wield El'druin, as the sword continued to reject the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; due to their corruption. With the sword in hand, the Shard-seeker travelled to the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Isles\"&gt;Cold Isles&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse their impurity, and therefore, be worthy to wield El'druin.\nSword of Justice.\nEl'druin ended up in Aranoch and was tracked down by &lt;a href=\"Shanar\"&gt;Shanar&lt;/a&gt;, who had followed its angelic resonance. She was ensnared by the blade and while it sustained her, forced her to stand guard over it until the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Jacob\"&gt;Jacob&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point afterwards, El'druin called the mortal &lt;a href=\"Jacob\"&gt;Jacob&lt;/a&gt; to its resting place. Jacob took up the blade himself and utilized it against his foes.\nReturn to Tyrael.\nWhen Tyrael returned to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; after reforming his essence, twenty years after the Worldstone's destruction, he summoned El'druin to his side. At this point in time, it still belonged to Jacob, who was left despondent at the sword's disappearance. But after Tyrael renounced his angelic status and descending upon Sanctuary as the Fallen Star, El'druin shattered into three pieces as he fell, and the three pieces landed in a &lt;a href=\"Khazra%20Den\"&gt;Khazra Den&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Misery\"&gt;Fields of Misery&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Temple\"&gt;Drowned Temple&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Festering%20Woods\"&gt;Festering Woods&lt;/a&gt;, and in the fishing village of &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;. Because El'druin was tied to his being, Tyrael's physiological capabilities diminished and most of his memory was lost. While searching for the pieces of the sword, Tyrael's allies made an enemy of the evil witch &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Coven\"&gt;Dark Coven&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to claim the sword for her master &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sword was made whole once more by the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; arts of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, his last act before succumbing to the wounds he suffered during his torture at the hands of Maghda and the Coven. When the hero rescued the mortal Tyrael from the Coven and returned the sword to him, both his mind and body were restored, and he wielded the weapon from that moment forward. Tyrael notably used El'druin to shatter the demon gate at &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and to destroy the demonic corruption barring the heroes' path to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt; and their final confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, when attempting to seal the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; away, Tyrael was forced to use the sword against &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, now the Angel of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the sword had no effect, as Malthael's actions were deemed to be righteous , and/or because Malthael existed in a state between life and death and could not be harmed by physical beings.\nIn-game.\nEl'druin is featured as a quest item in the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Crucible of Justice&lt;/a&gt; update of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

It was built by an ancient society as a combat trial to test the prowess of its warriors. The portal of the Elder Rift leads to a place not on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Though it contains creatures and terrain that appear native to Sanctuary, the combinations of the two are discordant, with creatures appearing in the wrong habitat.\nAccounts from adventurers that braved the rift say that their journey abruptly ended after facing a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;powerful entity&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 a kind of simulacrum of some known horror from Sanctuary.\nHistory.\nThe Elder Rift pre-dates the founding of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, where it was recovered from the Heart of &lt;a href=\"Corvus\"&gt;Corvus&lt;/a&gt;. Its existence was known of, but for much of the city's history, the Rift was apparently inactive. By &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, however, &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Mages\"&gt;Royal Mages&lt;/a&gt; had made a breakthrough in the activation of the device involving &lt;a href=\"crests\"&gt;crests&lt;/a&gt;. Permission was given to merchants to sell crests to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to enter the Rift. Unfortunately, every adventurer who entered the Rift failed to survive the experience. This changed with a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; who entered the Rift, survived, and brought tales of the treasures and horrors they'd encountered to &lt;a href=\"Jondo%20Mouren\"&gt;Jondo Mouren&lt;/a&gt;. Overjoyed, Mouren declared that business would boom once word of the treasures inside the Rift spread, unworried by the countless adventurers he'd previously sent into the Rift to die.\nGameplay.\nThe Elder Rift is similar to &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Using &lt;a href=\"crest\"&gt;crest&lt;/a&gt;s, players can stack up modifiers for the Rift to amp up the challenge \u2013 and the rewards. The Elder Rift can yield both runes and &lt;a href=\"legendary%20gems\"&gt;legendary gems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Orb\"&gt;Eternal Orb&lt;/a&gt;s also act as modifiers.\nOverview.\nThe Elder Rift is a replayable dungeon that can be completed in a few minutes.\nFading Embers\nMirrored Jewels.\nDuring certain limited-time events, Mirrored Jewels can be activated before entering the Elder Rift. Typically this can be done only once per event period. When activated, all Legendary Gems dropped in that run drop an extra copy. The extra copy is always bound and has random quality for 5-star Legendary Gems.\nMirrored Jewels was available during the following intervals:\nPriority Drop Rates.\nWhenever a new 5-star Legendary Gem is released, there is a window of 3 weeks during which a setting can be enabled for Elder Rifts that increases the drop rate of the new Legendary Gem, making it drop 50% of the time a 5-star Legendary Gem drops.\nDuring certain limited-time events, Priority Drop Rates can be activated before entering the Elder Rift. This allows you to select exactly 8 5-star Legendary Gems. There is a limit of 900 rift attempts with the selection enabled. The counter increases for every crest used, even Rare Crests, which have no chance to drop the selected gems. The effect of using this feature is described in a conflicting manner in different sources: the patch notes claim that every 5-star gem has a 60% chance to be one of the one of the 8 selected, while the in-game description states that their drop rates are increased by 150%.\nAnother type of altered drop table is the exclusion drop pool, where a certain number of gems (e.g. 8) can be chosen and those gems will not drop at all. This was used for the event between October 16 and November 6, 2024.\nWith the launch of &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shattered Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, a modified drop pool was available between December 13, 3 a.m. and January 8, 2025, 3:00 a.m., where players could choose 15 each of 1-star, 2-star and 5-star Legendary Gems, and only those would drop."}

Note that a single tick of damage occurs with two zaps, not one.\nThe target can be hit even if it is blocked by other enemies, but Electrocute cannot bypass walls and terrain. After it hits the first target, it jumps to another enemy within 20 yards of the previous target, dealing same damage, then jumping to the third victim, making a total of 2 jumps (3 enemies per cast). Cannot jump back to the initial target or to the target that has already been hit by this particular arc. Electrocute counts as a Signature Spell and therefore costs no &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power\"&gt;Arcane Power&lt;/a&gt; to cast.\nAs Electrocute hits instantly, it is the most accurate basic spell, and can be considered to be the best for Arcane Power generation.\nHitting a ground will not extend the spell any further (making firing blind useless), and the lightning will not jump to nearby enemies. In return, placing LMB on the target and holding it will cause the Wizard to continuously cast Electrocute on that target, even if the cursor is no longer aimed at that enemy, until LMB is released.\nAlso note that since Electrocute instantly hits a designated location or enemy, and does not continue to move further, it does not count as a &lt;a href=\"missile\"&gt;missile&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore bypasses &lt;a href=\"Missile%20Dampening\"&gt;Missile Dampening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; spheres.\nDevelopment.\nElectrocute\u00a0was a Storm spell in early development stages. It was introduced in the trailer for the Wizard, and subsequently detailed on the official website. A spiritual sister to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, Electrocute fires lightning from the Wizard's fingertips, electrocuting up to two of her enemies. It is a very fast spell, and if it strikes a critical hit it will\u00a0&lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0opponents.\nIn a gameplay video at BlizzCon's Diablo III panel, the use of runes was demonstrated on Electrocute: a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Multistrike%20Rune\"&gt;Multistrike Rune&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0made Electrocute hit far more enemies, increasing its similarity to Chain Lightning, and a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lethality%20Rune\"&gt;Lethality Rune&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0caused it to create a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nova\"&gt;Nova&lt;/a&gt;-like explosion when killing an enemy with the spell.\nPrior to Patch 2.1, it was the only Signature spell that could not change the damage type.\nBefore patch 2.0.4., it was the most popular Arcane Power regeneration spell, as due to bug, it restored double the amount when combined with &lt;a href=\"Prodigy\"&gt;Prodigy&lt;/a&gt;."}

Sometimes, the term is meant to exclude &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Damage\"&gt;Magic Damage&lt;/a&gt;, and each game has defined the elements slightly differently. &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;Immunity&lt;/a&gt; can protect both monsters and heroes from specific elements. In some games Elemental Damage Bonuses can be obtained to increase damage done with a specific element.\nArcane and Holy count as one damage type for the purpose of &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt;, presumably due to the extreme rarity of monsters dealing Holy damage. In \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", they are collectively labeled &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Damage\"&gt;Magic Damage&lt;/a&gt;, a catch-all category for magical (non-Physical) damage that isn't one of the classic element types or Poison.\nDiablo III.\nIn\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", each &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; deals damage of a specific type, which may change based on the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Rune\"&gt;Skill Rune&lt;/a&gt; selected. Each &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;'s skills use only four or five of the different types, for instance, only Fire, Cold, Lightning and Arcane for &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s. Many items can roll increased damage for all skills of a specific damage type, normally\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bracers\"&gt;Bracers&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Amulets\"&gt;Amulets&lt;/a&gt;. The total bonus is listed under Offense on the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt;'s details tab (as of Patch 2.0.6). A &lt;a href=\"Smart%20Loot\"&gt;Smart Loot&lt;/a&gt; drop for a class will only roll the damage types that class can use.\u00a0The \u00a0rotates through \"each\" damage type fit for the current class, augmenting one for 4 seconds before switching to the next. The extends a character's best elemental skill bonus to all skills.\n&lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt; always roll +(A-B)-(X-Y) Elemental Damage (any one of the seven types, with Physical indicated by not stating a type explicitly) as a Primary Magic Property, meaning that each attack will add that amount of damage to the base weapon damage. Generally, bonuses to the damage of an attack are based only on the skill and rune used, but numerous effects also look at added weapon damage, such as &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Exposure\"&gt;Elemental Exposure&lt;/a&gt;, , , the , and &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt; death animations. As in the previous game, added &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; damage also grants a chance to &lt;a href=\"chill\"&gt;chill&lt;/a&gt; on hit, and at lower levels added Cold damage may be slightly less to balance the extra effect.\nMany skills and effects require a specific damage type to be used or grant bonuses to one type. It is a popular tactic to stack bonus damage of one type and choose skills and runes of the same type to boost all damage done, leading to &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s with that type's name, e.g. \"Arcane build\" or \"Fire build\". Even these builds may use some \"off-type\" runes, when secondary effects like &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; or stat buffs are more important than raw damage.\nDefenses.\nWhile there is no inherent distinction between Physical and non-Physical damage, several defensive skills and effects do draw a distinction between those categories, and most monster melee attacks are Physical. Resistances work the same between all types, including Physical, except that Holy damage uses Arcane resistance, presumably due to there being very few monsters that deal Holy damage. Characters can achieve immunity to a non-Physical type with one of five Legendary &lt;a href=\"amulet\"&gt;amulet&lt;/a&gt;s (with Holy/Arcane on the same amulet).\nOnly a couple of &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt; state they have complete immunity to a single damage type, although it is actually about 85% resistance, and applies if either skill or added weapon damage types match the \"immunity\". There are no other permanent elemental resistances or immunities among monsters."}

This Assassin build is often called the Phoenix Strike Assassin as the majority of the skill points are used to build up its damage potential.\nAttributes.\n&lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;: Sufficient to wear desired gear.\n&lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;: Sufficient to wear desired gear.\n&lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;: Remaining points.\n&lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;: Should be left at base.\nTactics.\nEarly on, invest any spare points (that aren't needed for prerequisite skills) into Fists of Fire. Pump up to 3 charges and use normal attack (or, at your option, Dragon Talon or Dragon Claw) to release. Until Phoenix Strike this is your main attack tactic.\nWhen monster mobs become scarier, use Cloak of Shadows to reduce pressure. If you invest into Mind Blast, use it when each member of the mob is scary by itself.\nOnce you've reached level 30, start pumping Phoenix Strike. This changes the way your game is played, so pay attention!\nOnce Phoenix Strike is more than level 3 or so, change your command setup: use the right-click skill assignments to assign Phoenix strike and normal attack (or Dragon Talon/Dragon Claw) to adjacent skill keys. Your attack tactic is now: keep the right mouse button pressed, enable Phoenix Strike, approach monsters, hit using Phoenix Strike, switch to normal attack/Talon/Claw, release, switch to Phoenix Strike and hit, switch to normal attack and hit, and so on. Basically, you are alternating between Phoenix Strike and normal attack (releasing 1-charge Phoenix Strikes) to set up a stream of meteors on monsters. You will need to practice this to gain proficiency in quickly switching skills. Note that changing the speed of your attack (i.e. increases in Burst of Speed if you use it, or changing items with different Increased Attack Speed or Weapon Speed Modifiers) may throw your rhythm off, so practice this a little when changing equipment.\nAgainst fast but cowardly easy-to-kill opponents such as demon imps and leapers, build up 2 charges of Phoenix Strike before releasing. This slight change in rhythm also requires practice, as you may have gotten used to triggering the meteors (which are of little help against quick-moving opponents due to the delay before they fall).\nAgainst mixed mobs of fire immune and lightning immunes, use another rhythm that triggers meteors and lightning alternately. Again, you need to practice this new rhythm, but experience with the two earlier rhythms should be helpful.\nFinally, when mobs become even scarier, use the time under Cloak of Shadows to build up 3 charges of Phoenix Strike, so that monsters are frozen while you are setting up meteors and lightning against them.\nThus, starting at Nightmare, your attack method is like this:\nClaw Selection.\nThis guide recommends a hitting claw focused on improving your hit accuracy with +Attack Rating (based on character level) and similar. The main purpose of this is to achieve 95% chance to hit. High hit probability allows for more reliable and controllable selection of which charge you will end up releasing; in practice, anything below 90% will cause you to misfire the wrong charge quite often.\nThis generally means sacrificing additional damage modifiers and getting accuracy modifiers that improve your attack rating and/or reduce your opponent's defense rating (the Eth rune in particular). This is generally a good tradeoff since Phoenix Strike is quite powerful when fully levelled and synergized; dealing negligible damage while charging up is not an issue if a two or three triggerings of Phoenix Strike will kill entire groups of monsters anyway.\nNote that using a 3-Eth Greater Talons is quite powerful, as this is almost equivalent to a +300% bonus to your Attack Rating. Such a claw would be very accurate but have very little damage, which we make up for by consistently releasing the desired Phoenix Strike charge. Phoenix Strikers are very tempo-based, and once you have the rhythm in muscle memory, it is very hard to break it in case a charge-up or release misses.\nPhoenix Strike becomes even more powerful when +skills are involved. Thus, using a second claw with +3 Martial Arts (or at least giving +3 Phoenix Strike) gives a substantial boost to damage that is further improved by your synergies.\nThe main drawback of a dual-claw setup versus a claw and shield or a non-claw and shield is the lack of resistances and additional defense that are easily provided by the shield. This is partially mitigated by the excellent crowd control skills of the Assassin - Cloak of Shadows and Mind Blast - so you should generally use them to compensate for the relatively lower defenses of the Elementalist. That said, using a shield instead of a utility claw is certainly viable, and opens you to the possibility of using a powerful non-claw weapon, such as a Crescent Moon Rune Word Phase Blade.\nBlock may be something you need to avoid rather than encourage. Blocking means your rhythm may get thrown off; some builds may even completely forgo the use of Shadow Master or Shadow Warrior in order to keep Weapon Block at level 0.\nPhoenix Strike vs. Fists of Fire/Claws of Thunder.\nIn order to maximize the crowd-killing potential of the individual-element skills, you need to fully charge up to 3 charges before releasing. In contrast, you do \"not\" want to fully charge up Phoenix Strike before releasing it. This means that against Fists of Fire, you can release two Phoenix Strike meteors in the same time that you charge up 3 charges of Fists of Fire and release it (assuming single-weapon setup and normal attack to release). A similar argument holds against using Claws of Thunder - you can release 4 Phoenix Strike lightning chaos in the same amount of time as 3 fully-charged Claws of Thunder. At high levels of Phoenix Strike, the fire and lightning tend to stick around longer than high levels of the individual-element skills.\nNote that a dual-claw setup makes things \"worse\" for the individual-element skills. The elemental claw attacks will always swing both weapons at a slightly higher speed than normal attack, while Phoenix Strike will always just use your primary weapon (which is always the one above the gloves). Although swinging both weapons is slightly faster than two Phoenix Strikes with one weapon, to get the third charge of an elemental claw skill you need to perform both swings again, which makes you even slower compared to Phoenix Strike.\nPhoenix Strike vs. Blades of Ice.\nAssuming a weapon and shield setup, the 3-charge Phoenix Strike takes just as long as the 3-charge Blades of Ice. This makes Blades of Ice a viable alternative to Phoenix Strike for the purpose of freezing opponents. In particular, Blades of Ice \"assures\" that non-cold-immunes within a small radius are frozen, whereas nearby monsters might occasionally be between the missiles released by the 3-charge Phoenix Strike.\nHowever, note that if you are using a dual-claw setup, Blades of Ice is slightly slower to reach 3 charges than Phoenix Strike, again because the elemental claw attacks always swing both weapons. Dual claw setups let you get +3Martial Arts +3Phoenix Strike on both weapon slots, which makes for really high-level Phoenix Strike attacks. Also, using just Phoenix Strike reduces the number of skill keys you need to switch between.\nNormal Attack vs. Dragon Finishers.\nYou will probably put one point in each Dragon finisher skill just for Dragon Flight, so you might as well use one of the Dragon finishers. However, note that speed can still be better with normal attack rather than a Dragon finisher.\nDragon Talon is relatively slow on the first kick - to reach 7 frames for the first kick, you need a significant Increased Attack Speed investment. In contrast, with Burst of Speed at a respectable level, Greater Talons or Runic Talons, and 20% Increased Attack Speed on gloves, 7 frames on a normal attack is easily achievable even untwinked. If you have dual +3Martial Arts claws, this makes a one-point Dragon Talon reach level 7 - meaning two kicks, which requires 10 frames to complete - this makes you even slower at throwing meteors around.\nDragon Claw is always two swings. Although both swings are slightly faster than two normal attacks, remember that a normal attack only needs one swing to complete. At its fastest, Dragon Claw requires 10 frames. It does have an AR bonus and two chances to trigger the Phoenix Strike, which might be an acceptable tradeoff (sacrificing some speed for some reliability).\nDragon Tail knocks back, and is also a kick (which again is generally slower than max-speed normal attack). The knockback may or may not hinder you; against slow small opponents, it might kick them out of the way of the incoming meteor, but most opponents will re-engage you by the time it falls, maybe.\nIn contrast, normal attack has the same speed as Phoenix Strike (assuming a weapon and shield setup or dual claws where both claws have the same Weapon Speed Modifier and Increased Attack Speed), which can greatly help with the rhythm of attacks.\nNormal attack also has the significant advantage of not requiring any mana, letting you throw more Phoenix Strike meteors before drinking a potion.\nThe only major disadvantage of normal attack is the lack of attack rating boost. Using Hsaru's Boots+Belt or Angelic Amulet+Ring can give you some nice additional attack rating, as would pumping points into Claw Mastery if you're using claws, and hiring a Blessed Aim mercenary (Normal Act 2 Offensive mercenary).\nIn general:\nPhoenix Strike Charges.\nThe guide recommends that, against mixed groups of fire and lightning immunes, you should alternate between the fire and lightning charges of Phoenix Strike. This is primarily because the lower charges have a faster attack sequence and higher damage compared to repeating the full ice attack.\nIn general, the third Phoenix Strike charge is almost always a \"utility\" trigger, useful for stopping opponents rather than damaging them.\nHireling.\nAlthough many players solo with their characters, Hirelings can certainly increase the survivability of any character if maintained properly. Typically, most choose the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Act 2 Defensive Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; in Nightmare Difficulty (the \"Holy Freeze Merc\") or the Offensive version (the \"Might Merc\"), but the others have plenty of potential if geared properly. The Helmet and Armor are standard choices, the only thing that would vary are the weapons. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Act 3 Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; with cold attacks used to be popular, but are rare now due to many monsters being immune to their attacks. Although &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarian Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are quite rugged, they can be overcome by large mobs. On the other hand, properly equipped, he can definitely play a major factor in increasing the character's survivability. And the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt; should not be counted out either, although without particular gear her ability to assist in later stages of the game diminishes by quite a bit. Although the weapons vary, the armor and helmet choices are mostly stock, with some variance in regards to armor."}

Elias continued to dive into Horadric lore, and become increasingly fearful of the realization that with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; destroyed it was only a matter of time before the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; invaded Sanctuary once again. And this time with most of the nations still recovering from the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s remaining in Heaven, that Hell would most likely succeed with no force left to oppose them.\nThis led Elias to delve deep into solutions to this problem, pouring over tomes hundreds of years old until he discovered two important figures from Sanctuary's history. The first &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, the First &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Lilith, his mother, daughter of Mephisto and partial creator of Sanctuary.\nHe brought his findings and concerns to Lorath, as well as continuing with research into taboo magic and subjects. He rationalized that there was no price too high to protect humanity, and delved deeper into the dark. Lorath rejected this, asserting that there were certain lines they could not cross. Eventually Elias, frustrated that Lorath wasn't willing to do whatever it took to protect Sanctuary was given an ultimatum, and left the Hordaric order behind. However, he didn't leave without first gathering the final information he needed to locate the temple of Rathma, where he hoped to find power to help fight against Hell.\nSummoning Lilith.\nEventually, he did find the temple of Rathma, and after spending some time reading through perhaps the wisest being on Sanctuary's writings came to two more discoveries. One was that in every single history and record, the only being that ever stood against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; was Lilith, opposing the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. And that even though she had tried to use humans to her own ends, she also seemed to have a true desire to thwart both Heaven and Hell and protect Sanctuary from their grasp. Elias, who had always been a seeker of truth, came to the see Lilith as the only being in Sanctuary who could truly protect it. He also learned that she, unlike the other Evils, could not reform in Hell, as her being had been banished to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; thousands of years before.\nElias made a decision that humanity would no longer be at the mercy of Hell or Heaven ever again and that Lilith was the best chance of making Sanctuary strong enough to be free of both forever. However, he didn't know if he saw any true \"good\" in Rathma's writings about Lilith's nature, so realized he needed a failsafe. He found this in Rathma's ability to create immortality. By hiding a piece of himself, in this case the tip of his finger, and using Rathma's incantation, one could simply reform if they ever died. This guarantied that if Lilith was hostile, or did something unpredictable he could simple revive as long as this piece still existed. He hid this piece of himself in Rathma's temple beneath the waves and set out for the means to summon Lilith.\nEventually he found his answer. Elias traveled to the \"&lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;Tree of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;\", a primordial force in the swamps of Sanctuary that would grant its vast knowledge in exchange for the head of the person who asked the question upon their death. Elias, knowing that he could not die, was the first person to \"cheat\" the Tree of its payment, asking it how he could summon Lilith back from the Void to Sanctuary. After getting his answer, he left the Tree behind, setting out on the next phase of his plan.\nElias realized that there must be those like-minded individuals in Sanctuary and that it's people needed a figure to rally behind. Inarius had, by this point, escaped Hell and began telling about prophecy that he would drive a spear of light into hatred's heart and bring humanity with him to Heaven, and started to rebuild his &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Elias, knowing Inarius served only himself, set out to recreate the force that had once worshipped the prime evils, and Lilith, &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Triune\"&gt;the Triune&lt;/a&gt;. This cult grew with shocking speed as he began spreading the word that the \"Mother of Sanctuary\" would come and save humanity, as well as &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;elevate humans&lt;/a&gt; above both angels and demons, as it was her plan from the very beginning. What he - and everyone else for that matter at the time - did not know was that Mephisto, who was reforming in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Realm of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;, but still had part of his power residing in Sanctuary in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, was subtlety turning the cult to his side and control.\nElias now had the army and support needed, as well as a failsafe, to summon Lilith to Sanctuary. Determined to stand beside her as Sanctuary's champion, he traveled to an ancient chapel in &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Dark%20Portent\"&gt;Halls of Dark Portent&lt;/a&gt;, which housed the gateway to the Void. In disguise, Elias enticed three men: &lt;a href=\"Fionn\"&gt;Fionn&lt;/a&gt;, a thief from &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelwa\"&gt;Gelwa&lt;/a&gt;, a from the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Symon\"&gt;Symon&lt;/a&gt;, a scholar from Hawezar, who were searching for &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; in an underground chamber. During the search, Elias was chased and apparently killed by &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s. When the scholar discovered an old summoning formula, Elias appeared in the chamber and killed &lt;a href=\"Fionn\"&gt;Fionn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gelwa\"&gt;Gelwa&lt;/a&gt; starting the summoning ritual. Then convincing &lt;a href=\"Symon\"&gt;Symon&lt;/a&gt; to \"surrender\" to his thirst for knowledge, had the scholar say the words and summon &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; in bloody ritual. The ritual succeeded and Lilith returned to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nDusk on the Mountain.\nLater, Elias was present when Lilith corrupted a church of villagers in &lt;a href=\"Nevesk\"&gt;Nevesk&lt;/a&gt;. She ordered him to go to the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and finish his preparations.\nThe Making of Monsters.\nIn the Dry Steppes, Elias traveled through &lt;a href=\"Abahru%20Canyons\"&gt;Abahru Canyons&lt;/a&gt;."}

They may referred to as Elites, or by the specific variety of empowerment they have, such as Champion status. Most Elite Monsters have some form of color coding and formatting around their names or models in the game world, and many exhibit extra &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Skill\"&gt;Monster Skill&lt;/a&gt;s compared to normal monsters of their type.\nThe most well-known Elite Monsters include:\nAdditionally, these count as Elites:\nNote that an Elite's summoned creatures (for example, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s raised by &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Summoner\"&gt;Skeletal Summoner&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Vessel\"&gt;Corrupted Vessels&lt;/a&gt; summoned by &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;) generally do not count as Elites.\nDiablo III.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" has several gameplay mechanics related to \"elites\".

's primary bonus applies to all monsters, but since it accumulates with each hit done to an enemy, it is really designed against elites and especially bosses, which require many more hits than other opponents.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s, elites drop &lt;a href=\"progress%20orb\"&gt;progress orb&lt;/a&gt;s which significantly increase the speed to complete the rift.

In a general context, \"primary stats\" refers to any/all of the three primary stats. The remaining \"core stat\" is &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; (except in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\"), which is not a primary stat for any class.\nEarly games.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" do not have designated primary stats. Many attributes are most influential in their role filling requirements - for &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, and for spells in the first game - not their direct combat impact. In \"Diablo II\" especially, &lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt; simply increases &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;, rather than directly increasing combat effectiveness, so many spellcasting characters actually have Strength as their highest non-Vitality stat.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", each class has one of three primary stats: &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; (, ), &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; (, ), or &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (, &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;, ). Each of these grants defensive bonuses to all classes (&lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt;), but grants a direct 1% increased damage per attribute point to characters for whom it is a primary stat.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Smart%20Loot\"&gt;Smart Loot&lt;/a&gt; system causes most items dropped for a character to have primary stat bonuses matching their class, although items with no primary stat bonus appear as well. It is impossible for an item to have two random &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; that improve different primary stats. When a primary stat and a specific &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;class skill&lt;/a&gt; are boosted by the same item, the two will always match.\nCrafting options like &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; recipes \"never\" give a primary stat meant for a different class from the current character. Enchanting can be used to replace a non-matching primary stat with the one matching the current character, but it cannot be used to add a second primary stat to an item. &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; Points can improve the primary stat and &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;, but no other &lt;a href=\"core%20stat\"&gt;core stat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDiablo IV.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" has a stat for each class that directly increases damage like in the previous game, but each class also has additional core stats that provides other benefits, increasing the diversity of the attribute mix desired by different classes. The latter attributes could be called primary stats as well, or secondary stats, although this should be distinguished from the non-core stats which are also called secondary stats."}
{"id": "109", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=109", "title": "Prime Evil", "text": "The term Prime Evil is one with several definitions:\nEach of the Primes is incorporeal on the mortal plane, due to the events of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;. For any of the Three to take physical form, they must take a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; host. Over time, the presence of the Prime will twist the host into a grotesque simulacrum of the Prime's physical form. If the simulacrum is destroyed, the Prime is again rendered incorporeal, though can leave behind remnants of the shell. When weakened, they've been known to take the forms of strange animals: a one-eyed owl (Baal), a wingless bat (Diablo), or a &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Wolf\"&gt;wounded wolf&lt;/a&gt; (Mephisto).\nHistory.\nAnu and Tathamet.\nAt the beginning of time, there existed a single, near-perfect entity called &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;. Anu desired to purify itself of all darkness within itself and cast out its darker half. This dark essence congealed and formed the seven-headed dragon and creature called &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;. For aeons, Tathamet and Anu battled against one another endlessly until they unleashed the totality of their power. In the end, both were vanquished, leaving only their fractured essence behind. As Tathamet's body formed the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;, each of its heads became a greater demon. The three dominant heads became the Prime Evils, while the remaining heads became the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;. The three Prime Evils collectively established themselves as the leading power among the Burning Hells. These were &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Terror, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Hatred ,and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Destruction\u2014the first of all the Evils of Hell, and the most powerful. They endeavoured to maintain a strict rule over the demons of Hell, each powering one another\u2014as terror leads to hatred, hatred leads to destruction. However, their unity was fragmentary at best and while Mephisto functioned as their leader (by virtue of him being the eldest), he would pit his brothers against one another if it suited his purposes.\nThe Great Conflict.\nAs Tathamet had given rise to the Burning Hells and its rulers, so too had Anu given rise to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;. The result was the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, fought over the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Being the eldest and strongest of the Evils, the Three Brothers were responsible for many victories against the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Although even they were never able to breach the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, the Three were justly feared by enemies and subjects alike.\nThe Sin War.\nThe Great Conflict came to an end when the Worldstone mysteriously disappeared. Millennia later however, the Prime Evils would discover what the stone had been used to create\u2014&lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt;, Mephisto, Baal and Diablo were made aware of the existence of humanity. Sensing the latent power of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; within them, they reasoned that if turned to their side, Man might make a powerful ally. So it was that the Three founded the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;, adopting the namesakes of Dialon, Spirit of Determination, Mefis, Spirit of Love and Bala, Spirit of Creation. The Triune carried out mass sacrifices of humans in their name.\nThe rogue\u00a0&lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to counter the influence of the Three, founded his &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;own religion&lt;/a&gt;, thus beginning the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. It ended with a truce between Heaven and Hell, that humanity be free to choose between light and dark.\nThe Dark Exile.\nThe events of the Sin War created a rift between the Prime Evils and Lesser Evils. The Primes had kept humanity's existence a secret from their Lesser Evil counterparts, and the Lesser Evils were frustrated with the Primes' fixation on humanity, and perceived abandonment of the Great Conflict. Thus began a sequence of events that led to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, as Hell erupted in civil war between those loyal to the Prime Evils, and those loyal to the Lesser Evils, led by &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;. Despite annihilating a third of the rebels, the Prime Evils were defeated and, weakened and bodiless, were banished into the mortal realm. \nThe banishment of the Prime Evils from Hell to the mortal plane also left them incorporeal. In other to acquire a physical form, they required a body for their spirit to possess. Over time their demonic presence twisted the victims human flesh into grotesque simulacrums of their physical form.\nAzmodan believed that with the Primes trapped in the mortal realm, Heaven would be forced to shift their attention, which would allow Hell to seize the opportunity to strike. But in truth, the Dark Exile had been masterminded by the Prime Evils themselves. The fallen angel &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; told them of the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s and how they could be corrupted. Through the soulstones, they could corrupt the Worldstone, and through it, humanity as a whole. The Prime Evils would be imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, but it was to their long-term benefit. Mephisto would corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;. Baal shattered his soulstone, but the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; willingly became his mortal host where he could contain the demon himself. Diablo was the last to be imprisoned, and buried in the catacombs of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. It was during this time that Diablo learnt of a method to combine the Seven Evils into a single being. It was an idea he would put into practice much later...\nThe Return of the Three.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;Hundreds of years&lt;/a&gt; after their imprisonment, the Primes returned to wreak havoc in the mortal realm. Diablo was the first to be released, taking control of the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;. Taking on the guise of the Dark Wanderer, he headed eastward and employed Andariel once more to derail any would-be pursuers. Despite the efforts of a group of mortal heroes and the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; himself, who had been imprisoned by Duriel, he succeeded in freeing Baal from his prison tomb. The pair crossed the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, where they reunited with Mephisto, in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere, the Three devised their final stratagem. Diablo would cross over into Hell, where he would rally the legions of Hell still loyal to the Three. Baal would head north to corrupt the Worldstone, thereby enslaving all of mankind and its nephalem potential to their will. With an army of nephalem as their vanguard, the Primes would quickly overwhelm Hell's traitorous legions and re-establish their rule. It was also here that their plan began to go awry. The heroes defeated Mephisto, who had remained behind to destroy any opposition to their plan, and imprisoned him in his soulstone. In Hell, they confronted Diablo and did the same. Upon the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Anvil of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, both of these soulstones were destroyed and (in theory) sent into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, there was Baal. Although he successfully corrupted the Worldstone, he was defeated soon afterwards. Tyrael destroyed the Worldstone to prevent humanity from being corrupted, and in the resulting destruction, Baal's body was obliterated. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; believed that his spirit was sent into the Black Abyss to join his brothers.\nThe Prime Evil.\nThe Prime Evil was the combination of all the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; into one being. Twenty years after Baal's defeat, the witch &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, who had been in league with Diablo, sought out the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. With it, she was able to contain the essences of five of the Great Evils (&lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;).\nDiablo had engineered a gambit to finally defeat the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. While he was gaining control over &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan's&lt;/a&gt; mind, he conceived a daughter with the witch Adria, named &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;. Twenty years later, the last Lords of Hell &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; began their invasion of Sanctuary in search for the Black Soulstone with the intent of becoming the Prime Evil themselves. Belial took control of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; while Azmodan began mustering his forces at Mount Arreat. A group of Nephalem heroes under the guidance of Adria, Leah and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; resurrected the renegade Horadrim mage Zoltun Kulle, the creator of the Black Soulstone, to complete it. The heroes were forced to battle the traitorous Kulle, who attempted to use the Soulstone for himself and reign over Sanctuary. They later liberated Caldeum from Belial and finally confronted the Lord of Lies and captured his spirit. The heroes then turned their attention to Azmodan, who began his invasion from Mount Arreat and besieged &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. After a long fight against his armies the heroes confronted Azmodan and battled the Lord of Sin. They were victorious and Azmodan's essence was captured by the soulstone. Adria then betrayed the heroes and performed a ritual to use Leah as Diablo's vessel. Diablo (or Tathamet reborn) and his forces assaulted the High Heavens and shattered the Diamond Gates with the intent of corrupting the Crystal Arch. The heroes fought against the Prime Evil and defeated it, saving Sanctuary and the High Heavens. However, they were unsure if the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; had been truly defeated.\nThe Three Brothers.\nThe Prime Evils comprise the Three - the Demon Lord brothers and absolute rulers of Hell:\n&lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Hatred, is the eldest brother. He was originally captured by the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; in the deserts near the city of Lut Gholein, the same place in which Baal was captured. He was moved to Kurast and imprisoned inside a Soulstone, and was kept locked inside the Guardian Tower beneath the temple city of Travincal. His eventual corruption of the regional religious heads almost ensured his release, except he was eventually defeated by the pursuing adventurer. Being the Lord of Hatred, he is the most intensely evil brother, whose greatest weapon is his victims' irrational hatreds.\n&lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Destruction is the last brother in the storyline of the Diablo games to be vanquished, and also the middle brother. He was captured in the deserts of Aranoch, at the site where his elder brother Mephisto was incarcerated earlier. He was the only one of the Prime Evils to escape the pursuing adventurer. He raised an army of demons and minions and attacked the barbarian homelands of the north, laying siege to the capital city, Sescheron, and finally besieging the last city, Harrogath. He was stopped by the pursuing adventurer and eventually defeated. Being the Lord of Destruction, he is known for his unsparing and annihilating characteristics.\n&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Terror, is the youngest brother. He was responsible for the enslavement of mankind with violent images of bloodlust and terror; his prime weapon being the victim's fear. He was originally defeated under the labyrinths beneath Tristram but corrupted the hero who slew him and sought out his brothers, but then was defeated in Hell, by the pursuing adventurer. The aura of the Lord of Terror is the most fearsome among angels and demons alike. "}

She made it her goal to be a nuisance to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; cloister in her hometown.\nBiography.\nThe Mountebank gathered hundreds of written indulgences from the cloister of Miettevin by posing as a priest. She scattered them in the street, spurring anger against the faith's profiteers. Later she infiltrated the church's reliquary to steal the jawbone of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alavaine\"&gt;Saint Alavaine&lt;/a&gt;. She did this by having herself delivered to the church's cellar in a wine barrel. She poured the barrel into the reliquary as she ran, and left red bootprints in the nave.\nThis earned her the enmity of the local church, and the temple knights chased her to &lt;a href=\"Fogswell\"&gt;Fogswell&lt;/a&gt;, where they flanked her on both banks of the river. She dove into the water as they loosed their arrows, and a stray broadhead cored her through the hand. She also gained a nemesis in the form of the paladin &lt;a href=\"Gurdannel\"&gt;Gurdannel&lt;/a&gt;. He challenged her to a duel, and she accepted for it to be held at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Foot%20of%20the%20Uxbers\"&gt;Frozen Foot of the Uxbers&lt;/a&gt;. She delayed her arrival twice, and snow stranded Gurdannel's entourage, ruining his reputation.\nThe Mountebank later set the church's cloister on fire, using only a pitch and cotton-wrapped pipe. As she watched from the hills, Gurdannel caught her and ran her through, though she leapt to her &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; with a smile. She fell to earth near the town square. Stolen indulgences fluttered about her like feathers. Once townsfolk recognized her &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt;, they killed Gurdannel.\nLegacy.\nPrior Niv's death sparked a violent upheaval and revolution that led to the exile of the faith from Miettevin. A statue was built in her honor in the square where she died.\nIn-game.\nPrior Niv is referenced in the item-text of \"&lt;a href=\"Untouchable%20Mountebank\"&gt;Untouchable Mountebank&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"item%20set\"&gt;item set&lt;/a&gt;."}

PC, or Proc Rate)\u00a0refers to the probability to trigger an effect, such as &lt;a href=\"Stun%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;. The word \"proc\" means an effect has been activated.\nProc Coefficient has range between 0 to 1. For example, &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Spike\"&gt;Glacial Spike's&lt;/a&gt; freezing effect has a proc coefficient of 1, meaning it has a 100% chance to freeze a monster when it hits.\nDiablo III.\nAll skills have a Proc Coefficient between 0 to 1, which controls the effectiveness of certain \"on hit\" mechanics which might be applied when those skills are used. If the impact of the effect is measured by a number such as an amount of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt;, that number is multiplied by the Proc Coefficient to determine the final effect - for example &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Cause\"&gt;Holy Cause&lt;/a&gt; heals 1% of total Life per hit with a skill if its Proc Coefficient is 1.0, but only 0.5% of total Life if it's 0.5. If the effect is binary, such as a chance to &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; on hit or other &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;, the chance to trigger on a hit is multiplied by the Proc Coefficient - for example a skill with a Proc Coefficient of 0.3 will turn a stated 10% chance on hit into an actual 3% chance per hit per target.\nGenerally, Proc Coefficients moderate the effectiveness of:\nThey do not apply to:\nWith many modern character &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s defined by Legendary and Set items which increase damage of skills rather than dealing their own damage, Proc Coefficients are less significant now than before the expansion and its various patches. However, some set mechanics are still affected by Proc Coefficient, and many older Legendary powers may be relatively uncompetitive in part due to Proc Coefficient effects as well as overall strength.\nTypically, basic attacks and skills that can only hit one target have Proc Coefficients equal or very close to 1, meaning affects will trigger (\"proc\") on (nearly) every hit. Some skills, usually those that deal damage independently from the player's actions, like &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s, have a proc coefficient of 0, meaning the skill will never trigger \"on hit\" effects. &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Over%20Time\"&gt;Damage over time&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and area of effect\u00a0skills generally have low proc coeffients, but since they can hit many targets at once, or the same target many times in succession, this balances the overall impact of the effect to be similar to that of a one-target skill.\nThe Proc Coefficient only affects special effects, not straight attack damage output. &lt;a href=\"Area%20Damage\"&gt;Area Damage&lt;/a&gt; and many other effects also ignore it. The type or speed of &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; does not affect Proc Coefficient either.\nThe &lt;a href=\"internal%20cooldown\"&gt;internal cooldown&lt;/a&gt; of some items or skills is a different way to limited a power from being too strong, which may be designed into the power as an alternative or in combination with Proc Coefficient. \nDiablo IV.\nThe current state of Proc Coefficient is unknown in Diablo IV. Before it was removed, the &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Power\"&gt;Ancestral Power&lt;/a&gt; stat increases the chances of all 'on hit' effects. Although not above 100%, it effectively boosted the Proc Coefficient and the probabilities of all possible procs."}

Three or four orbs are dropped normally, and a fifth drops when the Reaper seal of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked in &lt;a href=\"season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;al play. They make killing &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;Elite Monsters&lt;/a&gt; a reliable tactic for clearing rifts, and consequently some strategies focus solely on elites.\nThe orbs appear in the game world and must be collected by moving close to them. &lt;a href=\"Affix\"&gt;Item bonuses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; points improving the \"Gold and Health Pickup radius\" also apply to progress orbs, and the Reach seal of the Altar of Rites allows near-automatic collection (within 60 yards). Using in Rifts leverages the progress orb mechanic by generating extra elite packs from &lt;a href=\"Pylon\"&gt;Pylon&lt;/a&gt;s - these packs drop the same amount of progress orbs as any other elite pack.\nRegular progress orbs drop from the last &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Monster\"&gt;Champion Monster&lt;/a&gt; of a pack, or from a &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Monster\"&gt;Rare Monster&lt;/a&gt; even if its minions are \"not\" killed. However the extra orb from the Altar of Rites Reaper seal only drops when the full pack is killed \"including\" minions, much like the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe progress orbs of the two types of rifts work the same, although Nephalem Rift orbs are golden orange, while Greater Rift orbs are purple. Both are slightly hazy looking and have skulls in the center, presumably representing the essence of the elite monster(s) killed.\n&lt;a href=\"Health%20Globe\"&gt;Health Globe&lt;/a&gt;s and progress orbs bear some resemblance as proximity-collected objects that appear upon defeating powerful monsters. However progress orbs have a much more strict and predictable pattern within the gameplay, and they have completely different benefits. Special powers or bonuses work only on one or the other and not both, with the exception of Pickup radius increases. \nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", s appear in the &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Rift\"&gt;Challenge Rift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rift\"&gt;Elder Rift&lt;/a&gt;."}

According to other sources, Hades took inspiration from the combat of the \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Arkham_Wiki\"&gt;Batman: Arkham&lt;/a&gt;\" games. It would be a Gothic, challenging dungeon crawler, utilizing a third person over-the-shoulder camera rather than the series's traditional isometric design. It has also been described as a roguelike with a permadeath system for every run. Perks accumulated by the character in their run would be transferred to the next created character. The game would feature cooperative multiplayer.\nDevelopment.\nWork on Project Hades began after the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" and the cancellation of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20King%20in%20the%20North\"&gt;The King in the North&lt;/a&gt;\". The original mandate was for &lt;a href=\"Team%203\"&gt;Team 3&lt;/a&gt; to create a \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;,\" regardless of what form such a game would take. The project was overseen by &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Mosqueira\"&gt;Josh Mosqueira&lt;/a&gt;, who prototyped the concept. At the time, Mosqueira was seen as \"Blizzard's golden boy,\" and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; wanted him to create a fourth \"Diablo\" game as quickly as possible.\nAfter years of working on the \"Diablo\" series, Mosqueira wanted to try something completely new. He gathered a few artists and designers and began conceptualizing the game.\nFrom 2014 until 2016, Hades was Team 3's main project, developed alongside a handful of patches and light content updates for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". However, Team 3 ran into difficulties almost immediately. One of the problems was its combat system. While it took after \"Batman: Arkham\", those were singleplayer games, and it was hard to transpose it into a multiplayer game. For instance, in \"Arkham\", a time dilation mechanic features\u2014how would this affect two characters? Tean 3 designers began to wonder whether this was really \"Diablo\" anymore, and it was such a departure from the prior games, some at Blizzard thought they might not even end up calling it \"Diablo IV.\"\nAnother issue was the game's use of staff. Hades only required a small subset of Team 3, and the remaining developers found themselves with little else to do. A few of them began calling themselves \"Team Summer Camp\" in an echo of what had happened at &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt; many years earlier. People would arrive at work, play \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", have lunch, head home, etc. As some of the \"Summer Camp\" team moved to the Hades team, the pressure grew on Mosqueira to make decisions so they'd have something to do. However, Mosqueira became harder to track down, coming in to the office only two or three days a week, which hampered some of the designers\u2019 progress as they waited for feedback.\nMosqueira announced he was leaving Blizzard in July, 2016. When a group of Blizzard executives and lead designers came to evaluate the progress of Hades, they left unimpressed. Believing that the project wouldn\u2019t be feasible without Mosqueira, they decided to cancel it. Diablo IV would have to start from scratch. When asked in 2018, Mosqueira refused to comment on the project.\nThe cancellation of Hades led to Team 3 splitting between two projects. The first was \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Necromancer\"&gt;Rise of the Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;\", which they hoped would act as a short-term solution for fans hungry for more \"Diablo\" content. The second group began worked on &lt;a href=\"Project%20Fenris\"&gt;Project Fenris&lt;/a&gt;. As Project Hades had never been publicaly announced, this led to a lull in \"Diablo\" releases, leading some fans to wonder why the franchise appeared dormant. "}
