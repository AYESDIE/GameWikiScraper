They wield axes, polearms, swords, and magical staves to attack their enemies.\nLore.\nKhazra are half man, half goat, and have been seen in many regions of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Walking upright as men, with heads of horned goats, they tread upon cloven hooves and are skilled with weapons of war. Distrustful of humans, khazra are no strangers to abhorant acts. They are cunning, working together to form organized clans that accomplish the desires of their devilish commanders. Their strength is immense and some of the more powerful clans are rumored to guard the lairs of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;'s more renowned demons. Indeed, many khazra have pledged themselves to their demonic masters. Some clans find serving Hell controversial, but khazra &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Augur\"&gt;augurs&lt;/a&gt; coax their kin into demonic subjugation.\nKhazra are incredibly strong and agile, and their archers are known for the power and accuracy of their &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt;. Fleet of foot, they may try to evade an unwary foe and then attack from a different angle. It is believed that to earn their powers they once held mock wars in Hell for the entertainment of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. However, if true, this is not the same for the mortal realm, as they prefer to slaughter the innocent rather than each other.\nKhazra &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; is similar enough to that of humans that it can be used in sacrificial rituals. Their sense of smell is strong enough to sniff out prey.\nOld folklore in the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt; states that &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; bones ward off curses.\nThe khazra that remained in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Citadel\"&gt;Dark Citadel&lt;/a&gt; (known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Khazra\"&gt;First Khazra&lt;/a&gt;) are a throwback to their original forms, while the khazra who spread across Sanctuary are divergent biologically.\nClans.\nThere are several known \"clans\" of khazra, each given a different gift from a demonic patron. Known clans include the:\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe khazra were once thought to be natural inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. However, ancient carvings discovered by &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; tell the tale of the origins of the khazra.\nThe khazra were, part of the &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; race found in the thick &lt;a href=\"Torajan%20Jungles\"&gt;Torajan Jungles&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Teganze\"&gt;Teganze&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Estuar\"&gt;Estuar&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in the distant past, the five clans that would come to be known as the khazra migrated to higher elevations and began developing along different lines than the clansmen they left behind. They lived in relative peace and began the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to a farming one. This state of affairs changed dramatically when they encountered the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. At the height of the conflict, a faction of the Vizjerei resolved to construct an army using demon-possessed victims, and the peaceful Umbaru clans seemed to fit the Vizjerei's needs. Within the span of a decade after making contact with the Vizjerei, some of the future khazra clans had turned from their peaceful existence to all-out warfare with the Vizjerei. al-Hazir speculated that this was the result of their brothers being transformed into goat-like creatures by the Vizjerei. \nThe first khazra were created in a structure that would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Citadel\"&gt;Dark Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The Vizjerei desired the khazra to be mindless, loyal weapons, but they turned out to have more initiative than first thought. As decades of savage warfare took their toll on the Umbaru's culture and minds, the clans began to search for any means to prevail over their enemies. To this end, the clans actively sought to capture a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; to do their bidding. Eventually they succeeded in violently coercing one of their captives to help them not only gain control over their transformed clan mates, but to have themselves transformed as well in order to fully drive the Vizjerei out of the Teganze.\nTheir strategy worked, but it was not without its price. They found themselves bound in servitude to the demon &lt;a href=\"Zagraal\"&gt;Zagraal&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their cursed power. They became furious marauders, driven to raid villages and caravans to sate their bloodlust and procure sacrificial victims for their demonic master. This is also when they became known as khazra, which roughly translates as \"demon\" or \"devil\" in the Umbaru tongue. The first khazra generations spent their years gleefully slaughtering every Vizjerei they could find.\nAfter years of this terror, their previous brothers, the Umbaru of the lower Teganze, sent their &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s to eradicate the khazra's threat to the region. Filled with otherworldly power, the Witch Doctors cut a swath of destruction through the khazra until they confronted Zagraal himself. In a now-legendary battle, the valiant heroes fought to the last man before finally bringing Zagraal down.\nThe khazra continued to wage war on humanity, but without a source of demonic power to draw from, their strength diminished. The Vizjerei attempted to hide their true nature through their writings, claiming they were servants of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the khazra spread across Sanctuary, while a number of khazra remained in the Dark Citadel. The khazra who remained here bore more in common to the original khazra forms, while the khazra who spread across Sanctuary underwent divergent evolution (or a similar process).\nRecent History.\nIn the 13th century, the khazra had a number of resurgences. Around the time of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s awakening in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, the khazra of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, once confined to only the darkest of labyrinths, ventured out to attack human encampments. However, this upsurge in activity ended, and they returned to their diminished state.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;sundering of Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, the Moon Clan Khazra at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt; were subdued by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cult of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;. By &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, they were used to attack &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Sentinel's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, as a distraction in their ploy to steal a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; that was kept in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctified%20Earth%20Monastery\"&gt;nearby monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, another upsurge of khazra activity occurred. They ferociously attacked humans, and it appeared that much of their former ferocity had been regained. Casualties were higher than anything ever recorded. With the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;, the khazra in the hills near &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; were sent into a frenzy, causing them to go on a rampage, slaughtering all in their path.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, khazra were among the &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s afflicted by &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;'s curse of Malignancy. They were counted among the &lt;a href=\"Malignant\"&gt;Malignant&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Goatman%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Goatmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goatman%20Archer\"&gt;Goatman Archer&lt;/a&gt;s are encountered as enemies. Classified as &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, they are encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs\"&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; area of the game, and are represented by the Flesh, Stone, Fire, and Night Clans.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Goatman%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Goatmen&lt;/a&gt; return. They are encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Act%20I%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Act%20II%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; acts of the game, and are represented by the Moon, Night, Blood, Death, and Hell Clans.\nDiablo Immortal.\nGoatmen feature in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" as beast enemies. They are largely based on their \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" incarnations, and are represented by the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Clan\"&gt;Ice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Clan\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; clans. New Goatmen enemies include the &lt;a href=\"Goatman%20Berserker\"&gt;Goatman Berserker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Augur\"&gt;Hellfire Augur&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nGoatmen return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", this time classified as &lt;a href=\"animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;. Only two clans feature in the main game, the Moon and Blood Clan. Ice Clan khazra appear in the &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;-only &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Sescheron\"&gt;Ruins of Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rifts\"&gt;Nephalem Rifts&lt;/a&gt;, are classified as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and have a white color scheme, but are otherwise identical to Moon Clan khazra.\nUnlike previous games, \"Goatman\" is the monster group descriptor rather than the designation for individual khazra. New sub-types are introduced in the form of spearmen or \"impalers\" (ranged attackers) and shaman (casters), with the classic Goatmen becoming warriors. The Moon Clan features in &lt;a href=\"Act%20I%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt;, while the Blood Clan appears in &lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the exception of Shaman, khazra are usually encountered in large numbers and are especially dangerous in mixed groups.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Morthanlu\"&gt;Lady Morthanlu&lt;/a&gt; is a non-combat pet available to players.\nTypes of Moon / Ice Clan Khazra.\n&lt;a href=\"Goatman%20Brute\"&gt;Brutes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Clan%20Warrior\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt; are melee Moon and Ice Clan khazra, respectively. Armed with &lt;a href=\"axes\"&gt;axes&lt;/a&gt;, they have average strength and attack in close combat. If a Brute makes it to a &lt;a href=\"Khazra%20Drum\"&gt;Khazra Drum&lt;/a&gt;, he will make all nearby khazra more resilient and powerful, but slow them down significantly.\n&lt;a href=\"Goatman%20Impaler\"&gt;Impalers&lt;/a&gt; are armed with throwing spears. Their attack speed and &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; pool is smaller than their Brute counterparts, but they deal considerable damage from afar.\n&lt;a href=\"Goatman%20Shaman\"&gt;Shamans&lt;/a&gt; attack by launching erratically moving Frozen Orbs that explode for &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; damage on impact, hitting a large area and &lt;a href=\"Chill\"&gt;Chill&lt;/a&gt;ing enemies within. At point blank range, they attack with their staves. Ice Clan Shamans are identical, except they use &lt;a href=\"piercing\"&gt;piercing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; attacks instead.\nTypes of Blood Clan Khazra.\n&lt;a href=\"Goatman%20Mauler\"&gt;Maulers&lt;/a&gt; are the Blood Clan equivalent of Brutes, distinguished by their larger size and extra head. Their attacks inflict &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;, and they can enter Berserk mode, in which they deal more damage and move faster, but the effect ends after a short time.\n&lt;a href=\"Goatman%20Impaler\"&gt;Impalers&lt;/a&gt; also become two-headed and attack much faster.\n&lt;a href=\"Goatman%20Shaman\"&gt;Shamans&lt;/a&gt; (aka Sorcerers)\u00a0gain a Fireball attack and can temporarily shield allies from damage.\nDiablo IV.\nKhazra appears as enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". They are one of the game's \"monster families.\"\nHeroes of the Storm.\nKhazra appear in the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//heroesofthestorm.wikia.com/wiki/Battlefield_of_Eternity\"&gt;Battlefield of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; map in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", taking the place of siege giants. Their appearance is of Moon Clan Impalers.\nTrivia.\nOrigins.\nThe nature of the khazra has changed over time with each installment of the core series, as reflected in the article's lore section. In \"Diablo I\", the khazra were listed as creations of Baal, residing within Hell. In \"Diablo II\", the khazra were listed as mutations (half human, half goat), and as residing within the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. In \"Diablo III\", the origins of the khazra were given as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, though retaining the demonic influence through Zagraal. It was also at this point that the term \"khazra\" was introduced as the proper name of the species. However, the discrepancy is explained in-universe, as a case of intentional misinformation from the Vizjerei.\nKhazra lore is further muddied in \"Diablo Immortal\", where they appear in the game's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Do43vT-Ms_0E\"&gt;Cycle of Strife&lt;/a&gt; trailer. Here, ancient &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Immortal\"&gt;Immortal&lt;/a&gt;s battling khazra and other demons. This is either an error (as the khazra were formed after the Mage Clan Wars, according to current lore), or indicative that the original group of Immortals were formed and/or were active well after the Sin War.\nIn \"Diablo IV\", the backstory of the khazra remains mostly congruent with the events mentioned in \"Diablo III\", with the Dark Citadel revealed as their point of origin in the context of the Mage Clan Wars."}

She convinced them to escort her back to her campsite. Upon reaching there, she immediately tried to open the chest, but found it locked. She convinced the adventurer to fetch the key from Cyrille back in the swamp, but didn't show much concern for Cyrille himself. After the adventurer returned with the key the chest was opened.

Many enemies in mode are immune to fire, making Holy Fire ineffective. Also, Kinemil's Awl is a two-handed sword. Since Paladins, unlike s, cannot wield two-handed swords with one hand, they would be deprived of a &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.

His reign lasted 1000 years, and his empire was marked by its attrocities, including &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, the grisly sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; relatives, and cursed longevity rituals for the benefit of aristocrats and the king, who presented himself as a living deity. His subjects in turn saw him as a god. At one point, a thousand individuals were sacrificed to him. \nFahir punished his rivals by twisting them\u2014or family members, into flesh-construct servants in a mockery of various animals. As more people recoiled under his brutal rule, he began reshaping some of his vassals into \"better servants\" as a show of his \"magnanimity\".\nAfter his death, Fahir's subjects celebrated. He was &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;entombed&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; abominations sealed with him, and his treasures were swept beneath the sands. To ensure that his deeds would not be repeated, his subjects split his &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;scepter&lt;/a&gt; into three pieces and buried beneath the sands, with the staff's head buried alongside Fahir himself. However, this apparently stymied his people's attempts to appoint an heir. A consequence of this or not, his former subjects slaughtered each other to claim what was once his. \nThrough some means, Fahir re-emerged as an undead skeletal monstrosity. Many adventures entered his tomb, seeking to retrieve the scepter, but none succeeded. Fahir met his end at the hands of a new &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, who slew him. In his last moments, Fahir called out for &lt;a href=\"Segithis\"&gt;Segithis&lt;/a&gt; to defend him. To this end, Segithis smashed through the tomb wall, bound him in web, and whisked him away. Segithis was slain, but in his last words, told his foe(s) that Fahir was beyond their reach. Searching the area, the hero(es) couldn't find Fahir's remains.\nIn-game.\nKing Fahir, Monarch of Shassar serves as a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in the Tomb of Fahir dungeon in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

The &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; had entrusted an &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; of great power to the Barbarians, and they kept it safe. Kanai was one such guardian, and would be the last to bear the artifact. He called it his \"greatest treasure.\"\nKanai at some point claimed &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Scorn\"&gt;the axe&lt;/a&gt; of the demon &lt;a href=\"L%27Anzuul\"&gt;L'Anzuul&lt;/a&gt;, which was buried with him.\nKanai was much loved by his people. Prior to his death, he was considered to sit upon the &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20Throne\"&gt;Immortal Throne&lt;/a&gt;, an honor that had only ever been bestowed upon two others, including &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt; himself. However, this did not come to pass, for in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Sescheron\"&gt;Siege of Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;, Kanai led his people in the defense of the city against &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; in a maneuver that turned out to be suicidal; the city was lost, and Kanai with it. Despite Kanai's death, his spirit remained in the &lt;a href=\"mortal%20realm\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt; due to the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. He was thus doomed to stand eternal vigil over his home and greatest treasure and awaited powerful and honorable individual to whom he might pass on his task. Such an individual came in the form of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon death, even though he was not crowned king yet, Kanai was placed upon the Immortal Throne. &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt;, if taken to this location, will remark how unusual that is.\nIn-game.\nKanai's spirit is seen in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Sanctum\"&gt;Elder Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", as players seek out Kanai's Cube. His body, almost intact, can be found sitting on the Immortal Throne, and &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Scorn\"&gt;Kanai's Scorn&lt;/a&gt;, the signature weapon of the Chief Elder, can be found nearby in a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Chest\"&gt;Mysterious Chest&lt;/a&gt; during March of each year.\nThere is a special event surrounding Kanai in March of each year. When approached in March (and March only), he will awaken, leave his body, and open the portal to &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Stomping%20Grounds\"&gt;Kanai's Stomping Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, fighting hordes of &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Bovine\"&gt;Infernal Bovine&lt;/a&gt;s alongside the Nephalem during the &lt;a href=\"Udder%20Cowlamity\"&gt;Udder Cowlamity&lt;/a&gt; event.\nIn combat, he uses a special stomp attack that creates a lava pool similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ring%20%28other%29\"&gt;Hellfire Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Once the battle is over, he will depart and enter his body again.\nDevelopment.\nKanai's effects were designed by &lt;a href=\"Neal%20Wojahn\"&gt;Neal Wojahn&lt;/a&gt;.

Five difficulty levels are available, the number of raids available each day equals the difficulty number. The players in the raid have 30 minutes to defeat four bosses; as each boss dies, the others get stronger. The possible bosses are Moloch, Voracity, Balazos, Coldsnap, Siegebreaker and Fallen Matriarch. No more than 12 players may fight a given boss at a time, but players may fight multiple bosses over the course of the raid.\nCompleting the Ordeal bestows the Immortals powerful loot including 15 &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%27s%20Key\"&gt;Aspirant's Key&lt;/a&gt;s and a faction-wide buff called \"Blessing of &lt;a href=\"Daedessa\"&gt;Daedessa&lt;/a&gt;,\" which increases rewards for &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rift\"&gt;Elder Rift&lt;/a&gt; runs for every non-Shadows player on the server, and allows them to obtain &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Chest\"&gt;Blessed Chest&lt;/a&gt;s. Riches and equipment from Elder Rift runs those players complete contribute to an Immortals vault, which gets handed out to Immortals at the end of the week. If not refreshed successfully before it expires, the Blessing of Daedessa instead is bestowed upon the Shadows.\nAt the end of the event, the Builder's Gifts (&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt;) are distributed in a lottery system, over 4 rounds. The first round offers items for the 4 primary armor slots while the second offers 2 main hand and 2 off hand slot items; the third and fourth rounds offer one item for each of the 6 types of slot. Each item is represented by a floating model of the corresponding equipment slot surrounded by a large circle. Players must stand in the circle for a chance to get the item. After a 60-second countdown, a random number is rolled for every player, and the player with the highest number in each circle gets a randomly-generated item for their class. A single player can receive multiple gifts. A player who doesn't stand in any of the circles will not receive any gift in that round.\nHistory.\nOriginally Essentia was required to open Kion's Ordeal. This requirement was dropped in the September 21, 2023, update; now the number of ordeals that can be opened each day is tied solely to the Immortals' Dominance level."}

It is said that only after achieving a state of sound body and mind can one bring peace in the style of the order.\nThe Knights almost always wear &lt;a href=\"helms\"&gt;helms&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that this is because they would go blind if they were to look directly upon &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. Those who serve as knights are promised to bathe in the glory of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their service. Knights are paid wages, but all knights are obliged (or at least expected) to tithe to the Cathedral. Their dead are cremated.\nThe Knights would often cry \"Inarius!\" in battle. &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; suspected that the Knights would continue to do so even after the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;'s death.\nThe Knights were among the remorseful devotees that undertook a pilgrimage across &lt;a href=\"Serac%20Glacier\"&gt;Serac Glacier&lt;/a&gt;.

Based on artwork found in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Light's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that the Knights Penitent waged war against &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; at some point, emerging triumphant. \nThe Knights once patrolled the woods around &lt;a href=\"Margrave\"&gt;Margrave&lt;/a&gt;, lighting braziers to ward off evil. A garrison was sent to &lt;a href=\"Yelesna\"&gt;Yelesna&lt;/a&gt;, where they helped train the local guards, but implemented draconian laws on the townsfolk.\nThe Knights Penitent marched on &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; itself under the command of &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. A small group of knights remained in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%20%28Fractured%20Peaks%29\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt; to \"keep the faith.\"\nThough the Knights Penitent held the upper hand against the demons as their patron went to confront &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, even able to slay an &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;, everything went wrong after Inarius was killed by his former lover. With their leader and patron dead, the Knights' faith and resolve faltered as the demons renewed their assault. Without their leader, the Knights Penitent quickly became overwhelmed even as Prava attempted to remind them of their faith and continue fighting but was swarmed by the demons herself. Ultimately, the Knights were slaughtered with no apparent survivors. When arrived in Hell in their pursuit of Lilith, they found only a scant few knights still alive but were left maddened by their horrific losses while Prava herself was still alive, albeit wounded, and managed to escape back to Sanctuary .\nThe Knights continued to function after the &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of Inarius, but were left in a pitiful state. &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; noted that the Knights at &lt;a href=\"Kor%20Valar\"&gt;Kor Valar&lt;/a&gt; continued to march, assemble, and train within its walls, though were weighed down with the burden of their failure. As the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Harvest\"&gt;Blood Harvest&lt;/a&gt; intensified, the Cathedral refused to engage the &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s.

The knights have since become a largely secular order, more focused on defending Westmarch from physical rather than spiritual harm. They are led by a knight commander. The &lt;a href=\"Duncraig%20Cross\"&gt;Duncraig Cross&lt;/a&gt; is awarded to nobles who lead knights in defense of the realm. The Knights have their own coinage.\nMost of the &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt; serve as elite Knights of Westmarch, and ultimately owe their authority to &lt;a href=\"Daedessa\"&gt;Daedessa&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThe Knights of Westmarch were founded after &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, and were in service to the realm by the time King &lt;a href=\"Korsikk\"&gt;Korsikk&lt;/a&gt; came to the throne. At some point, the Knights battled against the &lt;a href=\"Veradani\"&gt;Veradani&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Knights used the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Cathedral\"&gt;Zakarum Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; as their headquarters before they became a more secular order.\nRecent History.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;1263&lt;/a&gt;, the knights defeated the forces of &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, who had ordered an invasion of Westmarch. An infantry charge by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20of%20Khanduras\"&gt;Royal Army of Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; caught some knights off-guard, but the battle was still a solid victory for Westmarch.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; Church was revealed, the knights, eager to diminish their connections with such corruption, absorbed the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Paladins\"&gt;Order of Paladins&lt;/a&gt; into their ranks.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, a branch of the Templar under the command of Lord &lt;a href=\"Norlun\"&gt;Norlun&lt;/a&gt; took control of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Cathedral\"&gt;Zakarum Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, renaming it the \"Church of the Holy Order.\" They quickly established a sense of authority over the capital's citizens, even if they possessed no official standing. Tensions quickly developed between the Templar and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. While some knights defected to the Templar, most remained true to their own order. The Zakarum Cathedral had once been the Knights' base of operations, and the slight of the Templar taking it as their own had not gone unnoticed.\nThe Knights came to believe that the Templar were planning a rebellion against King &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever the truth of the matter, they made their move in the early hours of the morning. Under the command of General &lt;a href=\"Torion\"&gt;Torion&lt;/a&gt; and Commander &lt;a href=\"Barnard\"&gt;Barnard&lt;/a&gt;, the plan was to make a show of overwhelming force, and to keep hand-to-hand combat to a minimum. Ideally, the people of Westmarch would wake up and have no idea as to what had occurred. Unfortunately for the Knights, their force was discovered, and combat began in the streets. Eventually, the Knights fought their way into the cathedral, by which point, the Templar had the disadvantage, as they were also under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;. However, most refused to surrender, and vicious fighting raged in the cathedral's underground chambers. Eventually, Lord &lt;a href=\"Norlun\"&gt;Norlun&lt;/a&gt; cast down his weapon and the remaining Templar surrendered.\nIn total, the Knights lost eleven knights in all, including Commander Barnard."}

{"id": "8054", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8054", "title": "Knockback", "text": "Knockback\u00a0is an element of gameplay and a type of &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; effect, usable by both players and monsters.\nThe general concept is forcibly moving the target backwards on a successful hit. This makes the target leave the melee range and be briefly unable to perform any action (while moving).\nGeneral rule is that Knockback does not work on most &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt;. If a weapon or item has the Knockback modifier, any hits that landed upon a target will knock the target back a certain distance. If the target is against a wall or another obstacle, it will not be knocked back. The distance is set so multiple knockback modifiers have no effect. The target must be hit to knock it back, missing will do nothing.\nKnockback can be either helpful or detrimental, depending on the situation your hero is in. If, for example, the hero is a ranged physical attacker, such as the Amazon, or a Throwing Barbarian, Knockback is helpful because most monsters will not be able to reach you, leading to surviving many fights without the need for healing. On the flip side of the coin, if the character is a\u00a0, Knockback may be a bit more annoying, as your specialties lie in fast, powerful melee strikes. Knocking said enemies into a wall can remedy this, and in addition, causes their hit recovery animations to begin, effectively 'stunlocking' with no ability to retaliate. With some\u00a0\"really\u00a0\"bad luck, the same thing can be done to players by enemies.\nDiablo.\nIn the original &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;\"Diablo\"&lt;/a&gt;, players could have obtained the items with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28magic%20suffix%29\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0suffixes, which causes each successful hit to push the victim back. With a high enough degree of &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt;, it allows for keeping the enemy from approaching the hero, making ranged characters nearly invulnerable to attacks of single melee monsters. For melee heroes, however, it could easily backfire, helping the ranged enemies escape the player.\nThe spell also knocks back enemies but does not work against some Super Uniques.\nSome enemies could use this trait as well: for example, the &lt;a href=\"Horned%20Demon\"&gt;Horned Demon&lt;/a&gt;s' and some &lt;a href=\"Goatmen\"&gt;Goatmen&lt;/a&gt;'s charge, or &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s attacks. This could be countered by standing against a wall.\nDiablo II.\nKnockback was greatly expanded in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". In addition to the Bear affix on items, it was built into some skills, such as &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;' . Many monsters also have this ability, or at least special attacks with it, such as &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s wave spell.\u00a0\nKnockback\u00a0is also a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Special%20Modifier\"&gt;Special Modifier&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nAlthough Knockback works on most monsters in the game,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Act%20Bosses\"&gt;Act Bosses&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monster\"&gt;Uniques&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0possess full immunity to it.\nDiablo Immortal.\nKnockback is no longer an affix on items in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", but a side effect of specific attacks used by either the player or monsters. Knockback has an added effect of interrupting any charged or channeled skill, even skills that have activation animations. Interrupted skills go into &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, as if they were used. Most large monsters (eg &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Golem\"&gt;Guardian Golem&lt;/a&gt;) have inherent immunity to knockback. Knockback has 3 animations, with each having slightly different effects;\nDiablo III.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, Knockback can be found on items (as an X% chance to Knockback on hit) or is in-built into skills as either a guaranteed consequence of a damaging hit or as a chance of such.\nMonsters can have a Knockback trait (see the respective article) that gives them a chance on any damaging attack (including other affixes) to send the player flying, throwing them backwards a random distance and &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt;ing them down for a short time.\nSome monsters have a guaranteed Knockback for some attacks, such as &lt;a href=\"Death%20Maiden\"&gt;Death Maiden&lt;/a&gt;s' whirling blow. For the balance purposes, players cannot be knocked back more than once every 6 seconds. Monsters build up the Hard crowd control resistance as they are continuously knocked back (flat 40% per knockback), but instead of reducing effectiveness of subsequent Knockbacks, they simply become &lt;a href=\"immune\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to it at 65% or higher and until it drops back.\nSkills that apply knockbacks continuously, such as &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hole\"&gt;Black Hole&lt;/a&gt;, can bypass this resistance if they already knocked a monster back successfully this particular cast. These skills increase the crowd control resistance by 20% per knockback instead of 40%.\nIn Diablo III, Knockback can push the target through other enemies (or allies), but not through impassable terrain and not through walls. Unless stated otherwise, Knockback does not add &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; and Slow. However, while flying, a knocked back target cannot perform any active actions (unless those are specifically stated to be usable while stunned, such as &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Skin\"&gt;Diamond Skin&lt;/a&gt;), effectively being paralyzed. Attacking a target in flight is possible, but can be challenging in terms of aiming.\nEquipping &lt;a href=\"Krelm%27s%20Buff%20Bracers\"&gt;Krelm's Buff Bracers&lt;/a&gt; will render player immune to both Stun and Knockback.\nThere is even a special type of Knockback called Knock Up. This does not move the target, but leaves it paralyzed (and vulnerable) for a very brief time. Another special type of Knockback is pulling the target\u00a0\"to\u00a0\"the attacker (sort of reversed-knockback, like the Vortex monster affix). Pulling enemy back also stops if they hit a solid wall, but can pull them through other enemies.\nObviously, for the purpose of effects that require the target to be standing still or moving for a certain time or distance, Knockback\u00a0\"does\" count as movement.\nMonsters whose animation does not imply they can normally move (such as &lt;a href=\"Rockworm\"&gt;Rockworm&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Scavenging%20Tunneler\"&gt;Scavenging Tunneler&lt;/a&gt;s) are immune to Knockback. However, the mere of fact of the monster being immobile does not make them immune to Knockback: for example, one can kick a &lt;a href=\"Summoner%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Summoner of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; from its own summoning circle. Also Knockback has no effect on very large creatures, such as &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Golgor\"&gt;Colossal Golgor&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Punisher\"&gt;Punisher&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDiablo IV.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;, Knockback returns as a Crowd Control effect used by both monsters and players.\nAn additional mechanic is added as a subtype of Knockback: \"Knock Down\". It pins the enemy to the ground, briefly paralyzing them, but does not count as &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;, and does not necessarily push the enemy away."}

In his teens, Korlic rescued a small child from a horde of giant spiders. The child turned out to be the son of a chieftain of an enemy tribe. Without thought or worry Korlic returned the boy home. While some say it was an act of stupidity, others say it was an act of courage. Regardless, it brought about an end to the conflicts between the two tribes.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"the%20Ancients\"&gt;the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; summoned Korlic it was through the tribe's seer, his wife. She told him the Ancients had called upon him to protect that which must not fall, to protect &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. The honor was such that Korlic could not speak. Seeing this, his wife turned to the people of Henknoc and shouted, \"my husband, your chief, has been chosen by the Ancients to guard sacred Mount Arreat. In honor of this joyous occasion we shall celebrate until his departure.\" And they celebrated, for three days until Korlic left. On the final day, Korlic named his successor. He was the young boy, now a man, who Korlic had saved from the giant spiders so long ago. Korlic knew he would rule fairly and justly over both tribes. Finally, with all his worldly deeds complete, he ventured to the top of Arreat to begin his otherworldly quest of protecting the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; for all eternity.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nKorlic appears in the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Passage%20%28Diablo%20II%20quest%29\"&gt;fifth quest&lt;/a&gt; of \"\". His main skills focus on &lt;a href=\"Leap%20Attack\"&gt;Leap Attack&lt;/a&gt;, making him quite fast and very hard to target, and therefore is usually the last to be defeated. This can also be backed up by the fact that he uses . To counter his leaps, it is best to cast a lasting area-of-effect skill right on the player's feet and swiftly move away as he lands, so that this deals damage when he hits the ground.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Korlic can be summoned by the 's &lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Call of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nDiablo IV.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", Korlic can be summoned via &lt;a href=\"Arreat%27s%20Bearing\"&gt;Arreat's Bearing&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nDevelopment.\nKorlic has an unused color palette (slighty yellow in places) due to his lack of palshift.dat file."}
{"id": "17890", "revid": "9305822", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17890", "title": "Kormac", "text": "Kormac the Templar is one of the three &lt;a href=\"followers\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nRecruitment.\nKormac was once a soldier of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was conscripted by the &lt;a href=\"Templar%20Order\"&gt;Templar Order&lt;/a&gt; and initiated by force. He was chained to a wall by the order's inquisitors and beaten mercilessly. By the third day, he was mad from pain and hunger. That was when the whipping began. Kormac would later be told that he relived all of his past transgressions, of everything that brought him tainted joy, that the whip took away his joy and sin. By the end of it, he was a loyal follower of the Order, and was unable to remember his \"sinful\" past. Over the course of his service, Kormac was regarded as a paragon among them.\nThe End of Days.\nNew Tristram.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Kormac was in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, he was betrayed by his fellow Templar &lt;a href=\"Jondar\"&gt;Jondar&lt;/a&gt;, incapacitated, and disarmed by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cultist\"&gt;Dark Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s. He was soon freed by a group of heroes however, and he was able to rearm. The heroes intended to confront the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt;, and Kormac, seeing that their goals aligned, agreed to ally with them. After re-arming, Kormac took his revenge on Jondar, who had thrown in his lot with the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt;. The rogue Templar was killed, and in his last moments, Jondar begged for forgiveness. Kormac replied that betrayal could never be forgiven. After the fight, he took a journal off Jondar's corpse.\nKormac later thanked the heroes for their aid. As they too fought against the minions of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, he agreed to join them on the condition that he be allowed to keep any sacred tomes of his Order. The heroes agreed, but commented that Kormac did not seem like the kind of person who was once as sinful as he claimed, and wondered if there was any such 'sin' to be found. Kormac admitted that the idea had indeed occurred to him, but voiced his dismay that if that were true, it would ruin everything he fought for.\nCaldeum.\nBy the time the party reached &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, Kormac had had much time to reflect on his companions' suggestion. He decided to confront his past. Still, the present had to be confronted as well. A present which involved the enchantress, &lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt;, joining the group. Kormac was instantly attracted to her, though his vows as a Templar kept his actions in check.\nKormac later conversed with his companions over the issue of his past again, telling them of the journal he had taken off Jondar's body. It was written in an ancient Templar cipher, and while it would take time, he could translate it. He reasoned that by studying Jondar's treachery, he could gain insight into his past. He requested, however, that his friends slay him if he lapsed into his old sins. Despite his resolve, Kormac was afraid\u2014Jondar had betrayed the Order, but what if he had discovered something that made him betray himself?\nReading the journal, Kormac ascertained that Jondar had found a set of what he called \"key words\" hidden in a dusty libram. Apparently, when Jondar read those words, memories from his past returned to torment him. It was at this point that he began to mistrust the Order. Kormac declared himself ready to look upon the same words, but urged his friends to understand that if he died, he would still be loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. His friends assured him that he was testing his faith, and there was no shame in that.\nKormac proceeded to read the words. Memories came flooding back, allowing him to remember his time as a soldier of Westmarch, that he had been forcefully conscripted into the Order and lied to about his \"past sins.\" Shaken, Kormac nonetheless reasoned that the inquisitors must have acted without the blessing of the Order's grand master, and declared that once he returned with the tomes, the master would punish the inquisitors.\nBastion's Keep.\nThe group's journey led them to &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, for a final confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Sin\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of their arrival, Kormac had studied Jondar's journal further. He found a torn page within the binding, which he believed to be from one of the tomes he sought. He considered it strange that Jondar would hide it as such, as if it were proof of a crime. Studying the page, Kormac realized that the writing contained instructions for the creation of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al weapons, yet a rune displayed matched one on the armor of &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;. Taking the parchment to Tyrael himself, the former angel explained that the plans were for angelic weapons that would fit &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; hands.\nTyrael reasoned that the manuscript implied that the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; intended to destroy &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and the Templar Order had been created to stop them. A claim that once had weight in the last days of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, but was no longer true. Kormac resolved to see things through to the end, but once the battle was over, he would march back to the Order and have justice for their sins and lies.\nA Final Betrayal.\nKormac and his companions had to endure one last betrayal as &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; turned upon them, her actions leading to the death of her daughter &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; and the rebirth of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; as a single &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;. Kormac reflected on the history of the Coven, and reasoned that Adria must have once been allied with &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;, and left to find Diablo in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; over twenty years ago. However, the heroes were able to succeed, defeating Diablo and his forces and saving both Heaven and the mortal realm in the process.\nReturn to Westmarch.\nKormac and his companions journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, only to find his old home under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter successfully repelling the invaders and securing the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, Kormac decided to pay a visit to the Templar headquarters, the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Order\"&gt;Vault of the Order&lt;/a&gt;, in order to confront the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Maester\"&gt;Grand Maester&lt;/a&gt; and tell him about the atrocious techniques the Inquisitors were using on recruits (i.e. wiping their memory through torture). However, upon arrival, Kormac found out that the Order was welcoming him as a hero (the greatest templar ever, the one who defeated Belial and Azmodan) and that torture of neophytes was no longer a secret, being performed with consent of the Grand Maester. Furious, Kormac ordered the initiates to be unshackled (the Inquisitor did so, stating that such is the wish of the greatest one in the Order) and faced the Grand Maester, questioning him about how could he ever allow this. The Grand Maester, truly proud of Kormac's accomplishments, replied that such measures were necessary, and offered Kormac to be his second in command and eventually become Grand Maester himself. After Kormac refused, the Templars' leader ordered to kill him and his companions, but was slain along with his guards, and Kormac made a decision to leave the Order for good. He swore that every Templar he met would be freed from the lies of the Order...by force, if necessary. In the meantime, however, he remained sworn to aid the Nephalem.\nDisciples of Sanctuary.\nAfter long study and observation of The Nephalem, Kormac, Eirena, and Lyndon formed the &lt;a href=\"Disciples%20of%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Disciples of Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and continued the fight against the minions of Hell.\nIn-game.\nKormac first appears in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20the%20Black%20King\"&gt;Reign of the Black King&lt;/a&gt;\" in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". If the player saves him from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cultist\"&gt;Dark Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s on level 3 of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, he will ask the player to help him retrieve his items. He is first named \"&lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\" Even if the player ignores him and runs right past him, he manages to get free by himself anyway and joins the player, asking them to get his gear.\nEven with the chest containing his gear in plain sight he just seems incapable of opening it for himself.\nAfter the player retrieves his items, he will accompany the player through the rest of level 3, culminating in a showdown with his old brother-in-arms &lt;a href=\"Jondar\"&gt;Jondar&lt;/a&gt;, who has become a Necromancer serving the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Coven\"&gt;Dark Coven&lt;/a&gt;. After dispatching him, Kormac will become a follower, able to be selected at will.\nThe option is given to have him continue accompanying at that point (there is an 80 second countdown: if he is not accepted in that time he returns to town) and he is useful as a tank to defeat the . The only downside is that he kills unnecessary enemies which is bad if you want to minimize XP gain to generate a low-level &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Crown\"&gt;Leoric's Crown&lt;/a&gt; drop.\nIf he isn't present when entering Leoric's chamber it won't be possible to go get him since &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; is disabled upon entry until Leoric's defeated.\nReplay.\nIt is possible to replay quests in Act I, but keep Kormac. This includes being able to rescue the Templar, which gives the player two Templars.\nThis actually leads to unique dialogue. The original templar will say \"evil cowers at the sight of just one Templar. Two will bring it to its knees\" and refers to the replay-Templar as \"brother.\"\nThis only lasts until slaying Jondar. At that point a message says he is no longer following you, despite the dialogue saying he agrees to help: he vanishes after breaking the next barrier for you. This means it's not possible to have 2 Templars against the Skeleton King, only the Necromancer.\nIt makes it very easy to go AFK and just have them kill skeletons, which will be constantly summoned.\nEquipment.\nKormac rushes head first into combat, garbed in heavy armor and brandishing his one-handed weapon and shield. His imposing figure and righteous battle cries inevitably draw the attention of most servants of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; away from you in battle, though he fights with more of a focus on slaying his foes than on self-preservation. Throughout your journey, Kormac collects &lt;a href=\"Templar%20Relics\"&gt;Templar Relics&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 chalices, scriptures and fragments of sacred weapons that lend him purpose and power.\nAvailable equipment:\nSkills.\nMany of Kormac\u2019s skills focus on improving his capacity as your protector through taunts, new attacks and stuns. When acting in a support role, Kormac can increase party-wide health and resource regeneration, or quickly heal you with a burst of radiance.\nQuotes.\n\"Upon hiring the Templar as a Follower\"\n\"When the Player gains a level\"\n\"When the Follower gains a level\"\n\"Upon training\"\n\"Upon retraining\"\n\"Upon equipping with an item\"\n\"Upon noticing a rare monster or a champion pack\"\n\"Upon defeating a rare monster or a champion pack\"\n\"Random comment after killing monsters\"\n\"Upon receiving damage\"\n\"Random comment\"\n\"Waiting to be hired\"\n\"Upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ruins\"&gt;Old Ruins&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Upon Entering the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Ruins\"&gt;Forgotten Ruins&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"In &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"In the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20of%20Caldeum\"&gt;Sewers of Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Realm\"&gt;Shadow Realm&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"In &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Rift\"&gt;Hell Rift&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Random comment in the Overgrown Ruins\"\n\"Idle chit-chat\" (if you stand still too long)\nTemplar: I can't follow you around if you just stand there.\nTemplar: The darkness grows while we stand about.\nTemplar: While Virtue tarries, evil smiles.\nTemplar: Evil does not rest. Neither should we.\nTemplar: Surely there is someone who could benefit from our aid right now.\nPersonality and Traits.\nKormac is a courageous, headstrong individual, and often rushes into battle with more focus on slaying his foes than self-preservation. Loyal to the ideals of his Order, in Kormac's words, \"love is the surest way to a tragic end,\" hence why he has forsworn it. It was an oath that his infatuation with Eirena tested. He likewise came into friction with &lt;a href=\"Lyndon\"&gt;Lyndon&lt;/a&gt;, whose personality is the opposite of his own.\u00a0After Adria's betrayal and the death of Leah, he was shown to be noticeably agitated, seething with rage over Leah's death and need to kill Adria. While outwardly grim, Kormac has a good heart, even if he tries to hide it."}

What crimes haunt you?\nTemplar Kormac:\nI cannot tell you.\nPlayer:\nYou are a good man, the spirits say. Unburden your heart, my friend.\nTemplar Kormac:\nYou misunderstand me. We are literally unable to recall our pasts. The inquisitors stripped my sins and the memory of them from me, leaving me pure.\nInitiation.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Trailing the Coven (Act I)\nPlayer:\nTell me more of your order. Why do they steal your past?\nTemplar Kormac:\nOur initiation blinds us to our sinful pasts so that we might clearly see the future and prepare for the final battle.\nPlayer:\nBy what magic does your order strip a man of his memory?\nTemplar Kormac:\nI was chained to a wall and beaten. By the third day, I was mad from pain and hunger. That is when the whipping began.\nI was told I relived all of my transgressions, everything that brought me tainted joy. The whip took away that joy, then the sin, leaving me pure.\nPlayer:\nIn the Teganze, corrupt priests sacrificed men for their personal gain. Even they did not expect the men to be grateful.\nTemplar Kormac:\nDon't you understand? The templar order is trying to protect humanity from extinction. What is my pain against that goal?\nLessons.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Imprisoned Angel (Act I)\nPlayer:\nIn my time, I have often argued with the spirits. I did not always believe that they knew the true path for me.\nTemplar Kormac:\nI do not understand.\nPlayer:\nNo, you do not. When the spirits and I look at you, we agree. We say, \"This is a good man. There is no darkness in him. There never was.\"\nConfront what you call your sins, and I say you will find nothing there. Test your faith and prove me wrong.\nTemplar Kormac:\nI... cannot lie. That has occurred to me. But if it were true, it would ruin everything I fight for. Everything!\nSeeking the Truth.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Road to Alcarnus (Act II)\nTemplar Kormac:\nI have considered what we discussed, and you are correct. I know little about my past beyond what my order has told me.\nBut what does it matter? Look at what they have done for me. They have turned me into a living weapon, a light against the darkness.\nPlayer:\nI am not sure that the darkness you speak of is not in the order you serve. You must be able to remember your past to know the truth.\nTemplar Kormac:\nI wouldn't know how to begin. How do I seek memories that have been taken from me?\nPlayer:\nGround otatzo root would uncover every memory in your head. Or make you blind. It is a dangerous root.\nTemplar Kormac:\nYou may be right. I will find a way to take back my memories and exonerate my order.\nA Dangerous Journal.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Road to Alcarnus (Act II)*unlocked after Seeking the Truth\nTemplar Kormac:\nI have thought of a way to retrieve my lost memories, but it is dangerous. I must ask you to promise me something.\nShould I... lapse into my old sins, whatever they may be, you must kill me as I killed Jondar.\nPlayer:\nI still say I see no darkness in you, but tell me your plan.\nTemplar Kormac:\nI found a journal on Jondar's corpse, written in an ancient templar cipher.\nI can translate it, but it will take me some time. Perhaps studying his treachery will give me a clue into my past.\nPlayer:\nFear haunts your words. Why?\nTemplar Kormac:\nJondar was once a man of faith, devoted to the templar order. What if he discovered something that made him betray himself? It matters not, for I must do this anyway.\nConfronting Fears.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: A Royal Audience (Act II)\nTemplar Kormac:\nI have translated a strange passage from Jondar's journal. Long before he began serving Maghda, he found a set of what he called 'key words' hidden in a dusty libram.\nHe writes that when he read these words, memories from his past returned to torment him. It was at this point that he began to mistrust the order, though he did not say why.\nI am prepared to look upon these words and risk my soul, but I want you to understand something.\nI know that I may die at any time. When I do, it must be without a single doubt that I am serving the Light.\nPlayer:\nYou test your faith. There is no shame in that.\nTemplar Kormac:\nThank you, my friend. But please... remember your promise.\nThe Past Revealed.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Black Soulstone (Act II)\nTemplar Kormac:\nI m prepared to read these key words. I will turn the page.. How odd. They are simple words. Words that I have never seen together befo- uh...\nI can see everything! Water on a leaf. A burning hut. Light in my mother's eyes. Make it stop! I... I... It's slowing now. I can... Oh no. No!\nI was a young man, a promising soldier of Westmarch. The order recruited me. They lied to me! Piled false sins upon me!\nPlayer:\nWhy do you think they did this?\nTemplar Kormac:\nI do not know, but I am sure this is why Jondar turned from the order.\nHe was a fool. The grand master cannot possibly know what his inquisitors have done. When I return the tomes, he will punish them for their sins. Please... I must think on this.\nThe Torn Page.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Siege of Bastion's Keep (Act III)\nTemplar Kormac:\nWhile examining Jondar's journal further, I found a torn page hidden within the binding. I believe that it is from one of the tomes I seek!\nHe has written notes in the border as well. Perhaps by studying them, I will learn where the tome is.\nPlayer:\nThere is no joy in your discovery. Why?\nTemplar Kormac:\nIt seems strange that Jondar would keep a page hidden. It is though it is the proof of a crime.\nI have already found holes in my order's honor. What if there are more?\nThe Templar's Research.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Turning the Tide (Act III)\nPlayer:\nYou no longer study the torn page. Did you find the answer that you seek?\nTemplar Kormac:\nNo. I have learned something much more troubling. Judging by the borders, this is indeed a page from the tomes, but it does not contain prophecies.\nIt seems to be a set of instructions for the creation of magical weapons. But that is not the strangest part.\nI have seen the rune here before, on the bracers of Tyrael's armor.\nPlayer:\nI do not know this symbol. Let us ask him.\nThe Truth.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Heart of Sin (Act III)\nUnlocks: The Templar's Research\nUnlocks : Secrets Of The Tome\nTemplar Kormac:\nTyrael, examine this page. Tell me what you see.\nTyrael:\nThese are plans for angelic weapons that will fit human hands. Where did you find this?\nTemplar Kormac:\nThis is a page torn from the sacred tomes of my blessed order. The Light only knows what the others contain.\nTyrael:\nI see. It implies that my brethren seek to destroy this world and that your order was created to stop them.\nTemplar Kormac:\nIs it true?\nTyrael:\nIt was once. Not anymore.\nPlayer:\nThere is no darkness in you, Kormac. I cannot say the same for your order. What will you do?\nTemplar Kormac:\nThere is much difference between what I want and what I must do. Together, you and I will finish our work here. I owe you that.\nBut I tell you this: my faith is stronger than this betrayal. When we are done, I will return home and plunge my spear into the ground before the Vault of the Order.\nI will meet their champions until they answer for their sins and their lies. I will have justice.\nSecrets of the Tome.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Heart of Sin (Act III)\nTemplar Kormac:\nI keep thinking of the traitor Jondar. He had turned to evil, I have no doubt. But I wonder... would he have fallen as easily if the order had not betrayed him?\nI knew he was troubled, but I said nothing. I saw his doubts as weakness, and when he submitted to Maghda, I thought my suspicions were confirmed.\nPerhaps... perhaps I could have saved him before it was too late.\nPlayer:\nHis spirit is free now, my friend. He does not blame you, I am sure.\nTemplar Kormac:\nThat is good to hear. Thank you.\nThe Templar's Lesson.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Falls of the High Heavens (Act IV)\nTemplar Kormac:\nWait. Before we face that abomination, there is something you should know.\nWhen we first met. I thought you a primitive and dangerous savage. I was wrong.\nYou are the most civilized person I have ever met.\nPlayer:\nDo not let others tell you who you are, my friend. Your spirit always speaks truth. Listen to it.\nTemplar Kormac:\nI will.\nAdria's Betrayal.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)\nTemplar Kormac:\nOf all people, I should have seen this coming. I allowed myself to believe this... this fiction that Adria was other than I suspected her to be.\nAnd now the world is lost, and it is my fault.\nPlayer:\nDo not blame yourself. All of us were fooled. What we can do now is to set things right.\nShadows of the Coven.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)\nTemplar Kormac:\nEver since Adria betrayed us, I have been thinking about how Maghda used to share the leadership of the Coven with another.\nPlayer:\nExplain.\nTemplar Kormac:\nTwenty years ago, just before the Darkening of Tristram, they had some sort of falling-out, and the other leader disappeared. I think that the other leader might have been Adria.\nPlayer:\nThe spirits believe that to be true. Adria left to find Diablo in Tristram, while Maghda stayed with the Coven."}

His father was obsessed with finding a &lt;a href=\"Corvus\"&gt;hidden city&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, and Korsikk joined in the search. He found a location in mountains near &lt;a href=\"Bramwell\"&gt;Bramwell&lt;/a&gt;, which he believed was originally used as a shielded outpost for nephalem that were in danger. He stored a number of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; artifacts in the cavern and had a &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; trap a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Demon\"&gt;Bone Demon&lt;/a&gt; in it, to act as a guard until he returned. Korsikk believed that similar outposts existed all over &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. He believed that the city his father searched for was constructed by an ancient nephalem named &lt;a href=\"Daedessa\"&gt;Daedessa&lt;/a&gt;. The city was eventually found.\nSuccession.\nKorsikk succeeded his father as king of Westmarch, his father &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;entombed&lt;/a&gt; in the nephalem city that had both searched for. After his coronation, his first official act was to present a &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;special shield&lt;/a&gt; to the knight commander of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. \nHe continued his father's task of turning the land into a bastion of the Zakarum faith. He also continued his father's wars against the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;northern tribes&lt;/a&gt; by constructing &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20of%20Korsikk\"&gt;Bridge of Korsikk&lt;/a&gt; was apparently named after him. After years of military disasters, the frustrated king led a large army out of the fortress and into the north to conquer the Barbarians once and for all. None of them returned. With Korsikk's death, the location of the artifacts he'd hidden near Bramwell became lost."}

She also taught the early people of Pelghain to sail and fight in the bladedancing style, which was the catalyst for their expansion.\nAs the power of the empresses winnowed, they argued over the direction to take their people. Ksathra suggested uplifting a few so that they could shepherd their fellows, which Mehrwen said that it would be better to provide a small amount of power to all, that none may claim dominion. It is widely believed that Ksathra struck the first blow in anger. The result was a civil war that destroyed the empire, and left the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Isles\"&gt;Cold Isles&lt;/a&gt; beset by storm and sea.\nIn posterity, that Ksathra struck against Mehrwen in anger is considered the only lingering blotch upon her legacy. The legend of &lt;a href=\"Xekorendaag\"&gt;Xekorendaag&lt;/a&gt; states that the empresses' fury cursed the Isles so long as their descendants remained on Pelghain. When the people began to brave the deluges and hurricanes, arrogantly building tall cities and monuments, a great serpent drove into their settlements, consuming families and carving the isles apart as it did. Reproached, the people moved their settlements away from the capital, and the serpent faded to memory."}

A large and sprawling city, the sailor &lt;a href=\"Meshif\"&gt;Meshif&lt;/a&gt; described Kurast as beautiful before it fell to &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption, and called it \"the greatest city in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt;,\" a \"paradise\" where the air had a perfumed scent. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; likewise described it as \"glorious.\" The people of Kurast regarded their city as the center of the world. After its fall, however, its reputation plummeted\u2014&lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; regarded it as \"a boil on the face of Sanctuary.\"\nWithin Kurast proper, its houses are constructed of stone. Narrow alleys run through it. The city is broadly divided into two parts\u2014&lt;a href=\"Upper%20Kurast\"&gt;Upper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Kurast\"&gt;Lower Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. The former is home to large buildings, with a temple and reliquary looming over the city. Lower Kurast is the poorest section of the city, meant for laborers, and is a good place to hide. The city was linked to &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt; via a &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Causeway\"&gt;causeway&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to its fall, disciples of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; carried out a pilgrimage to the city.\nHistory.\nAn ancient city, Kurast became the capital of Kehjistan during the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith, taking the role once held by &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;. While the capital of Kehjistan, Kurast came to be under Zakarum control. Old tales spoke of a demon named &lt;a href=\"Harsus\"&gt;Harsus&lt;/a&gt; once threatening the city.\nMephisto's Jungle.\nAfter his corruption of the Zakarum, Mephisto was able to control the church, and through it, the surrounding lands. Kurast thus suffered two-fold. The populace of Kurast was decimated, and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s roamed the surrounding land. Additionally, jungle growth, spurred on by Mephisto's power, began to consume the city. As the jungle engulfed Kurast, it became harder to tell where the jungle stopped and the city began. Soon, the only refuge left in Kurast were its &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Docks\"&gt;docks&lt;/a&gt;, where a warding spell had been enacted to hold the jungle at bay. The people at the docks were choked with those trying to escape. Few people remained in the city proper, and their despair was evident. When a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the city, in pursuit of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, they noticed how disinterested the people appeared. As if they feared no harm, after the horrors they had already seen.\nThe heroes waged bloody combat throughout the streets of Kurast as they made their way to Travincal. But thanks to their efforts, Mephisto was defeated.\u00a0The jungle began to die back, and retreat from Kurast.\nIn Hatred's Shadow.\nDuring its fall, Kurast nobles fled to &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, where they remained, and Emperor &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20I\"&gt;Hakan I&lt;/a&gt; soon joined them. He made Caldeum the new capital of the Eastern Empire, where he remained until his last days. The truth of what had transpired in Kurast never made it to Caldeum, though rumors abounded. Paranoia existed for a time, that whatever darkness the nobles had fled had been carried along with them. The jungles around Kurast began to succumb to blight, so that &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;years later&lt;/a&gt;, the once lush jungles were gray and stunted, where they had once been a verdant green.\nAfter the 13 Kurast nobles died, nails were hammered into their heads to prevent them from rising as undead.\nIn Kurast itself, the rule of law collapsed, and it became a den of thieves, murderers, rapists, and a haven for those who sought escape from &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20I\"&gt;Hakan I&lt;/a&gt;'s rule. This also included pirates, as Kurast was a good port of call for them to make landfall. They might sail along the coast, and then head for Caldeum, allowing them to bypass the land route that was patrolled by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Its temples remained abandoned.\nBy the later years of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, Kurast had recovered to an extent, becoming the de facto capital of Nahantu. Part of the city remained infested by jungle. This section became infested with criminals.\nSometime after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to Kurast while bearing Mephisto's soulstone. The proximity to his old domain incited Mephisto to increase his mental attacks on Neyrelle and, though she was there for less than a day and had quickly departed the city by ship, Mephisto's hatred had engulfed the citizens and had them killing each other in the streets. &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; would later arrive in Kurast and helped the people return the city to order.\nThe &lt;a href=\"First%20Khazra\"&gt;First Khazra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Citadel\"&gt;Dark Citadel&lt;/a&gt; began raiding Kurast, abducting its people to bring back to the citadel.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nKurast is visited in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". \nDiablo III.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" concept art for Kurast exists.

It is the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, which has de facto (and apparently de jure) control over both Kyovashad and the Fractured peaks as a whole.\nKyovashad is a militaristic settlement and heavily defended, providing refuge to those who reside within its borders. Smaller defensive structures are located outside the town proper. Kyovashad itself has a gate, and is surrounded by steep stone walls, along with a deep, cavernous moat, designed to ward off any unwelcome visitors. Inside the walls, Kyovashad's architecture is typical of that found in the rest of the Peaks. Making use of the wood from the many forests in the region, the town's structures are clad with natural pine boards and birch shingles. The structures are densely packed together, and as with most dwellings in Sanctuary these buildings are very much function over form.\nThe city's inhabitants don't live equally, and Kyovashad features slums, where the downtrodden seek shelter from the extreme elements. And yet, by the standards of Sanctuary (at least by the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;), the people here are far better off than most of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. Despite their grim environs, the people of Kyovashad are generous and good-humored. They have a deep respect for privacy, for no-one survives in Kyovashad alone, and the people of the Fractured Peaks do not have the luxury of choosing their comrades. \nCulture.\nTo enter Kyovashad, one must take part in a cleansing ritual. The individual must take a tablet of cedarwood, inscribe it with the sin that troubles them the most, then toss the tablet into a brazier. In doing so, supposedly, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; would cleanse away their sin. While the ritual is a superstition, many take comfort in it.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; speculated that the ritual has its roots before the coming of the Cathedral of Light, and that the Cathedral had subsumed it into its own structure. He speculated that the original ritual may have served to foster trust by expunging past offenses to more quickly integrate a newcomer or stranger into the community; a symbolic way of saying that one's past did not matter, so long as it remained there.\nThe people of Kyovashad have historically commemorated &lt;a href=\"Midwinter%20Blight\"&gt;Midwinter Blight&lt;/a&gt;. The commemoration was suppressed by the Cathedral of Light, but revived in the winter of &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nKyovashad existed as a city well before the Cathedral of Light. &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; speculated that it had been erected to repel threats of immense proportions. After the Cathedral made the city its base of power, things changed. The Cathedral asserts its control over the city, and in time, the Fractured Peaks as a whole. \nAfter &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;'s return to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt; strayed closer to Kyovashad than they had previously. Later in the year, as the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Harvest\"&gt;Blood Harvest&lt;/a&gt; intensified, the people of Kyovashad turned to the Cathedral for help. They received no answer but shut doors and the &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Penitent\"&gt;Knights Penitent&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the coming of winter, Midwinter Blight was revived. While the Cathedral was not happy, the people sought a return to their roots.\nIn-game.\nKyovashad is explorable in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". It will be the first town that most players visit after completing the . Reaching Kyovashad grants the player the &lt;a href=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; of \"Initial Casualty.\" Kyovashad is located in the center of the zone, and is easily the largest town in the zone (in-game at least).\nIt holds a &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tier\"&gt;World Tier&lt;/a&gt; statue. \nDevelopment.\nKyovashad has been likened to a \"medieval settlement.\" It is designed to feel oppressive, frigid, and harsh.\" It is intended that the player draw similarities between Kyovashad with slum-type encampments. The dreary atmosphere is reinforced by the design details of frayed cloth, broken shelters, and general unhappiness. It is intended that Kyovashad gives players a reprieve from the Fractured Peaks with its earthly and \"lived in\" tones, as opposed to the Peaks' cooler, frigid palette."}

Cut off from the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, they carved out a &lt;a href=\"the%20Last%20Vestige\"&gt;foothold&lt;/a&gt; in the realm, battling &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s over the eons.\nHorn of Harmony.\nAfter learning of Skarn's death, Kyrel aimed to reunite the angels scattered throughout the Realm of Damnation. To do that,he took an angelic horn with him into the depths of the realm, in the hopes that it would attract any nearby angel that hears it. After sounding it with no reply, he left to search the surrounding area.\nDuring his search someone sounded the horn, and with high hopes he rushed back. It turned out to be a mortal who had a similar idea as he to attract angels. Unfortunately, demons arrived shortly after\u2014likely also attracted by the horn. After killing the demons, Kyrel told the mortal to sound the horn again. The mortal was wary of attracting more demons, but relented in the end. When nothing replied to the horn, the mortal tried to convince Kyrel to return to the Last Vestige, but he refused. Kyrel theorized that the sound of the horn couldn't reach his brethren because the Light of the mortal was in dissonance due to their heritage.\nKyrel sounds the horn himself, making it ring louder than before, and attracting more demons. Fortunately, the angel &lt;a href=\"Zepydra\"&gt;Zepydra&lt;/a&gt; was also drawn to the sound of the horn, and helped them defeat the demons. After that, the mortal was thanked for their help.\nDamnation's Chosen.\nKyrel discovered the presence of a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Citadel%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Citadel of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, one that was assisting the forces of &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt;. He ordered &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; to deal with it, believing it was their problem to solve, but aided them as they fought their way through the fortress. They discovered that the mortal was &lt;a href=\"Eskara\"&gt;Eskara&lt;/a&gt; (a member of Skarn's &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cult of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;), and that former humans had been transformed into &lt;a href=\"Aberrant%20Horror\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. Fighting their way through the monstrosities, they reached Eskara herself. They struck her down, but she was reborn as a demon, who was, in turn, struck down again.\nKyrel told the Shard-seeker that they would keep vigil, as given that Eskara was now a demon, she would inevitably reform in time.\nVisitor From Afar.\nLater on, Kyrel saw &lt;a href=\"Tassi\"&gt;a woman&lt;/a&gt; being chased by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, he reported the incident to &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; who was passing by and left it up to them to rescue the mortal.\nBlood Lure.\nLater, Kyrel heard about a demon that had been hunting angels, and using their &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; to create a shield for itself. Kyrel set a trap for the demon using his &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; as lure. Incidentally, the Shard-seeker was drawn to the location by investigating the blood trail.

Afterward, he was among those &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; brought with him into Khanduras, and he served the land with justice and honor.\nThe Black King.\nWhen Leoric entered the throes of madness, Lachdanan tried to discern the cause of his deteriorating spirit. However, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; waylaid him at every turn and admonished him for questioning the actions of his king. As tensions grew between the two, Lazarus charged Lachdanan with treason against the kingdom. The priests and knights of Leoric's court considered the notion ridiculous, considering Lachdanan to be honorable and just, and began questioning the motives of their king. Lazarus, seeking to contain the eroding situation, manipulated Leoric into declaring war on &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Lazarus declared that Lachdanan would lead the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20of%20Khanduras\"&gt;Royal Army of Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; into the neighboring kingdom. Lachdanan protested against the necessity of such a conflict, and correctly suspected that Lazarus had given Leoric the false idea that Westmarch was planning to invade Khanduras. Nonetheless, he was honor-bound to follow his king's command.\nThe war was a disaster, the royal army being decimated. Lachdanan quickly gathered together those who were not captured or killed and ordered a retreat back to the safety of Khanduras. They returned to find the town of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; in shambles\u2014&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Albrecht\"&gt;Prince Albrecht&lt;/a&gt; had gone missing, and Leoric had taken to execute the town's villagers in the belief that they were responsible. As Lachdanan and his fellow survivors returned to confront their king, Leoric sent his few remaining guards against them. Believing that Lachdanan was somehow part of the townsfolk\u2019s conspiracy, Leoric decreed that he and his party were to die. Lachdanan, finally realizing that Leoric was beyond salvation, ordered his men to defend themselves. \nThe ensuing battle carried them down into the very halls of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Lachdanan won a bittersweet victory as his men were forced to kill all of Leoric\u2019s deceived protectors. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Shayeed\"&gt;Shayeed&lt;/a&gt;, Lachdanan's friend and brother-in-arms, who despite having accompanied him in the war against Westmarch, chose loyalty to Leoric over his fellow knights. Lachdanan was forced to kill him.\nThe knights cornered the ravenous king within his own sanctuary and begged him to explain the atrocities he had committed. Leoric only spat at them and cursed them for traitors against both his crown and the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Lachdanan walked slowly towards his mad king and sorrowfully drew his &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. Full of grief and rage, all honor having been cast to the winds, Lachdanan ran his blade through Leoric\u2019s shriveled, blackened heart. As Lachdanan and his knights lay Leoric to rest in his burial chamber, Leoric rose in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;skeletal demon&lt;/a&gt;. Lachdanan's knights were overcome instantly, but he fought on. It was to no avail, and as Leoric's madness finally overtook him, he brought down a curse on his \"betrayers.\" Calling upon the forces of darkness, Leoric condemned Lachdanan and the others to eternal damnation.\nDamnation.\nWhile Lachdanan's fellow knights &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Knight\"&gt;succumbed to their curse&lt;/a&gt;, Lachdanan was able to retain his free will. Fleeing from the burial chamber, he sought to find a way to free himself from Leoric's curse but failed. He could feel the effects of Leoric's curse, and dared not return to Tristram lest he succumb to it. As such, he ventured down into the depths of the cathedral to die alone. At some point, he laid Shayeed's body to rest.\nBy the time Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moreina\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; reached Lachdanan in the depths of the labyrinth, the knight still possessed a hold on his sanity. He told them of his fate, and of an &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Elixir\"&gt;elixir&lt;/a&gt; that could lift the curse and allow him to die. However, he no longer had the strength to find it, (he was so weak he could barely lift his own sword) and as his strength waned, so did the remnants of his humanity. His servitude to &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; forbade him from attacking any minion of the Lord of Terror as well. The trio were able to find the elixir, and in gratitude, Lachdanan gave them his &lt;a href=\"Veil%20of%20Steel%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;helm&lt;/a&gt;. With that, the once proud knight of Khanduras was finally granted peace, fading away and leaving behind only his helm and sword.\nLegacy.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Over twenty years&lt;/a&gt; after his death, the ghostly apparition of Lachdanan was observed by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; as the hero(es) made their way through the Tristram Cathedral. Lachdanan's confrontation with Leoric was played out before their eyes.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nLachdanan can appear in &lt;a href=\"Level%2014%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Level 14&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", represented as a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;.

Once again, he is found on level 14. His helm, Veil of Steel, will simply be looted from his body.\nPersonality and Traits.\nLachdanan was fiercely loyal to his king and country and declared that no man had a greater love for his king than he did. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; held a similar opinion of the knight, considering him to be an honorable and just man, and a great hero. Upon hearing of Lachdanan's plight, he stated that Lachdanan would be the least likely to submit to darkness without a fight. &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt;, whom Lachdanan had treated with prior to Leoric's curse, found him to be honest and loyal in nature. &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; sensed great honor in him as well."}

Males are larger than the more agile females. Their limbs have four digits and have shown to be able to move both bi-pedally and in a more quadrapedal manner. Their savagery is unmatched in all of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nLacuni fur is surprisingly soft and beautiful. Their hair is useful in the use of &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; for the creation of &lt;a href=\"Butcher%20Demon\"&gt;Butcher Demon&lt;/a&gt;s (or similar constructs).\nHistory.\nAccording to legend, the lacuni are &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al outcasts from &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt; society. Legends tell of an &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; who lived long ago, and was skilled with the use of the &lt;a href=\"Javelin%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;javelin&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking power and fame, she made a bargain with a &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evil\"&gt;Lesser Evil&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange for her service, she was transformed into a sleek, catlike form, with the promise that her legacy would never die. If any truth to the legend exists, then this legacy endures with the lacuni to this day.\nOf what is known as fact, lacuni were originally found only in the jungle environments of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, trading freely with the cities there. But by the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23The%20Birth%20of%20Civilization\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; civilization, the lacuni had spread north to the desert wastes surrounding &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; and at some point, also into &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Although always considered somewhat aloof and untrustworthy, the lacuni never before behaved in a threatening manner toward human society. Such was the status quo until around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, when lacuni marauders began roaming Aranoch. Many blamed the disappearance of whole caravans upon them. Brother &lt;a href=\"Fyntana\"&gt;Fyntana&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monks of Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; attempted to purge Aranoch of the lacuni, but apparently failed.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the lacuni of the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt; had become a problem for both the people of Shassar and &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Westmarch requested that adventurers defeat the lacuni so that they could open up trade links with Shassar, free of attacks on their trade caravans. Later, the \"lacuni problem\" intensified, as the panther-men attacked &lt;a href=\"Lacuni%20Incursion\"&gt;a Shassar town&lt;/a&gt;, killing dozens and causing the survivors to flee. This stymied the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Blades\"&gt;Amber Blades&lt;/a&gt;' attempts to retake Shassar, and they requested aid from any able-bodied fighters in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; to help them retake the village.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, a variant breed of lacuni called \"snow lacuni\" could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nSociety.\nLacuni society is patriarchal\u2014males serve as tribe leaders while females act as huntresses. The leader of a pack is referred to as an alpha.\nThe females have a heirarchy of their own, and work together to surround their prey. Often some members of a pack will risk attacks of opportunity to get beyond a foe to allow the pack to encircle them.\nAt least some lacuni (such as those of the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt;) live in dens.\nWhile most lacuni attack with melee weapons, others have become fond of harassing their enemies with javelins or by &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Potions\"&gt;throwing potions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Huntress\"&gt;Huntress&lt;/a&gt;es disdain melee and often flee it to find better ranged attack vantages, while &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Cat\"&gt;Hell Cat&lt;/a&gt;s (lacuni that consort with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s) always walk with open claws. Yet despite this, lacuni are primitive and reclusive creatures, and will only attack if cornered or hungry. If desparate enough, they will feed on the bodies of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn game.\nDiablo II.\nLacuni appear in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;second act&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" under the name of \"Panther Women.\" They were split up into two distinct groups: the melee, whip-wielding &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat\"&gt;Sabre Cat&lt;/a&gt;s, and the ranged &lt;a href=\"Spear%20Cat\"&gt;Spear Cat&lt;/a&gt;s.

{"id": "7011", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7011", "title": "Ladder", "text": "The Ladder is a competitive type of closed realm &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer\"&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, hosted on &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Ladders were introduced in . In order to play and get your name on the ladder, you would have to create a new character from scratch and would not have the aid of any characters that were non-ladder. Ladder characters are not allowed to interact with non-ladder characters and vice-versa. This encouraged a lot more cooperative gameplay initially, but as the game aged, gameplay also declined over time.\nSeason 1.\nThe first of the ladder seasons began with the initial release of Patch 1.10 on October 28, 2003.\nSeason 2.\nAfter seeing how the first season went down, Blizzard decided to perform its first ladder reset on July 7th, 2004 with a promotional contest called \"When Worlds Collide,\" as \"World of Warcraft\" was scheduled to be released the following year. The contest began for all users that had a legitimate registered account (for recovery) for all 5 Realms, and it was a ladder race to be the first to reach level 99. The first character to reach level 99 on the ladder, regardless of being on &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;classic&lt;/a&gt; or , &lt;a href=\"hardcore\"&gt;hardcore&lt;/a&gt; or not, would be awarded a prize containing a Blizzard T-Shirt, a signed copy of \"World of Warcraft Collector's Edition\", a toy statue, and a &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt; CD Wallet. Most notably, the first character to reach level 99 on all Realms was Tifas-Revenge, a sorceress on the USWest Realm, who had reached level 99 on August 27th, 2004, about 50 days after the race began. Since the ladder races concluded much faster than Blizzard had anticipated, all winners did not receive their prizes immediately after hitting 99 and had to wait until sometime around January of 2005. The &lt;a href=\"Ruststorm\"&gt;Ruststorm&lt;/a&gt; program was run during this season once, and several users complained that their items had been erased unfairly. This season also introduced several new exclusive \"ladder-only\" &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Word\"&gt;Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;s later after the ladder race had come to an end just before 2005.\nSeason 3.\nThe second reset of the ladder took place in August, 2005, just after was released, and it also introduced the \"Warden\" anti-cheat system to Diablo 2. Unlike Season 2, Season 3 did not have a contest, and furthermore, thousands of accounts got permanently banned for using 3rd-party software from Maphacks to Bots. This did not stop bots indefinitely however, as programmers redesigned them to circumvent the \"Warden\" using different methods. There weren't any new \"ladder-only\" runewords during this season.\n\u00dcber Tristram.\nWith patch 1.11 and the Third Ladder Season, Blizzard added a new area called \"\u00dcber Tristram\" which can only be accessed on Battle.net. Players can gain access to \"\u00dcber Tristram\" by killing designated monsters and following a series of sub quests. Inside \"\u00dcber Tristram\" enemies have extremely heightened defense, damage and resistances. Three \u00fcber bosses, &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Diablo\"&gt;Pandemonium Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Baal\"&gt;\u00dcber Baal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Mephisto\"&gt;\u00dcber Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; can be found inside \"\u00dcber Tristram\" and upon killing the last of the three &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Bosses\"&gt;\u00dcber Bosses&lt;/a&gt;, players receive a valuable &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Torch\"&gt;Hellfire Torch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Large%20Charm\"&gt;Large Charm&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Standard%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Standard of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, which is an ornamental trophy and nothing more. The \u00dcber bosses provide a challenge to the high level characters that face them.\nSeason 4.\nThe third reset took place in June, 2007, and not much changed from Seasons 3 and 4. However, an exploit was discovered that made going to the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Sands\"&gt;Forgotten Sands&lt;/a&gt; to get &lt;a href=\"Baal%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Baal's Eye&lt;/a&gt; by sending a special packet to the server. This consequently allowed non-expansion or classic characters to enter &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; provided they had a copy of Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction installed. This method was patched in mid-February 2007, along with a patch that would end games if anyone's ping passed a certain threshold. This prevented a common lag-based item duplication method. This generally increased the quality of gameplay, as the number of people attempting to lag the servers to execute the method greatly reduced. However, this caused many players to drop from games unexpectedly. Even after Blizzard attempted to stop duping with the server-side patch, many people have still figured out ways to dupe. Blizzard has yet to release a patch that stops duping permanently.\nSeason 5.\nThe fourth ladder reset took place on June 17, 2008, and was integrated into \"\". It allows the players to play without the CD if the game is \"Full Installed\". No other significant changes have been reported with the release of the patch at this time.\nSeason 6.\nOn March 3, 2009, an announcement by a Blizzard employee was posted on the battle.net forum that the company was working on content patch 1.13, and asked for the Diablo community's input. The same employee informed the community that 1.13 is planned to be a major patch, introducing new content, instead of merely fixing bugs.\nAs of July 20, 2009, the patch was postponed due to a server crashing issue that surfaced from the latest patch on Warcraft 3, another one of Blizzard's major titles. On August 5, 2009, the community was informed that patch work for Diablo would not commence until the issue with Warcraft 3 was resolved.\nAlmost a full month later (September 2, 2009), the same employee that announced the 1.13 patch enlightened the community with the first positive update since the announcement of the patch, this post contained information about work having commenced once again on Diablo 2 and its patch, also stating that the PTR (Public Test Realm) for this patch would be opened very soon.\nOn September 30, 2009 the community was then informed that the patch may have restraints due to the new content being included (increased stash size), apparently old servers couldn't handle the updated content and would stress the servers too much. The community was told that as soon as they ran some tests to see how well the servers perform, they would make the decision as to whether or not they could include the updated content.\nOn October 14, 2009, a little after 7 months since the announcement of the patch, another report was made stating that they still haven't decided whether or not to include the content\nOn November 18 it was decided to leave out the increased stash size in patch 1.13 due to server concerns.\nThe patch was released on the PTR on December 10.\n's release, with a ladder reset, was on March 23, 2010.\nSeason 7.\nOn September 28, 2010, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 8.\nOn March 28, 2011, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 9.\nOn October 25, 2011, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 10.\nOn May 2, 2012, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 11.\nOn November 6, 2012, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 12.\nOn May 14, 2013, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 13.\nOn November 27, 2013, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 14.\nOn May 27, 2014, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 15.\nOn November 25, 2014, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 16.\nOn May 26, 2015, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 17.\nOn November 25, 2015, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 18.\nOn May 27, 2016, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 19.\nOn November 22, 2016, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 20.\nOn May 30, 2017, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 21.\nOn December 12, 2017, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 22.\nOn June 15, 2018, at 5:00 PM PST, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 23.\nOn December 7, 2018, at 5:00 PM PST, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 24.\nOn June 14, 2019, at 5:00 PM PST, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 25.\nOn December 6, 2019, at 5:00 PM PST, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 26.\nOn June 5, 2020, at 5:00 PM PST, the Diablo II ladder was reset.\nSeason 27.\nOn December 4, 2020 at 5:00 PM PST, the Diablo II ladder was reset.

After a final rejection, Lakrii left. In recent days, a ghost-pale woman caked in blood has led a wave of defections from the rogues. Lakrii's new paramour presents no uncertainty--just the clarity of service.\nLakrii was once a member of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;. She fell in love with &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt;, but couldn't secure her affection. She was eventually rejected by her, which broke her heart. She and numerous other members of the Sisterhood left the order, forming the Bloodsworn. They revived &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt; and served as her followers. At some point (potentially even before resurrecting her), Lakrii fell in love with the Countess.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, Lakrii and her retinue captured the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hemlir\"&gt;Hemlir&lt;/a&gt;, intent on forcing him on using his Druidic &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to spread corruption through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;. While he was tortured, Lakrii led a raid on &lt;a href=\"Blackstone%20Village\"&gt;Blackstone Village&lt;/a&gt;, killing every villager and taking their &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; for the Countess. Within their &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn%20Den\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;, she communicated with her master, who still needed more blood. The Countess ordered Lakrii to hasten her efforts, lest she lose her favor.\nIt was at this point that Lakrii became aware of an &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;intruder/group of intruders&lt;/a&gt;, whom were working with Kashya against the Bloodsworn. Lakrii and her fellow cultists fought against them, but were defeated. Lakrii, however, was able to escape.\nLakrii later conversed with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; through a &lt;a href=\"Damned%20Cultist\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cult of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; were searching the Dark Wood for the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; fragment that the Countess possessed. Skarn ordered Lakrii to turn over the fragment, and she could have whatever her heart desired. Otherwise, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; would cleanse &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Lakrii commented that her heart desired only one thing, and that the fragment belonged to her. Furthermore, if Skarn had such power, he would take the fragment himself, not ask for it. Enraged, Skarn reached out through his vessel and attacked Lakrii, but she managed to slay the cultist, reflecting that not even Hell could stand against one who bore the Worldstone. Skarn, still speaking from Hell, warned Lakrii that he would not be so easily denied, before letting loose more cultists to attack her.\nLakrii later encountered the hero(es in the &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20the%20Blood%20Rose\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt;, where she found that they'd severely wounded, but not killed, the creature. Believing that the hero(es)' blood would not be enough to revive it, Lakrii offered herself up to the Blood Rose, as a final act of service to the Countess. The creature drained her of her blood, and was consequently revived.\nIn-game.\nLakrii is a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", concluding the \"\" &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line.

Although the description seems to say otherwise, Enchant works on characters themselves \u2014 using Enchant will imbue both weapons in both sets with Fire Damage. Casting Enchant on a mercenary or player grants them the weapon buff; casting it anywhere else results in the Sorceress enchanting her own weapons. Visually, enchanted weapon glows bright red on characters (on minions and hirelings, the color change will not be applied, but the effect will still be active).\nEnchant is the key skill of the &lt;a href=\"Enchantress\"&gt;Enchantress&lt;/a&gt;. Some players choose to create Sorceresses that are intimidating physical fighters by allocating points into &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and then Enchanting their weapons accordingly. It is also a viable choice for a powerleveling support, since on high ranks it allows low-level characters to kill most enemies in one hit.\nWhen Enchant is used on the Sorceress herself, any +Fire Skill Damage she has (such as from &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Mastery\"&gt;Fire Mastery&lt;/a&gt;) applies twice \u2014 once when casting Enchant, and once when actually attacking. \nSome equipment, such as the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Runeword\"&gt;Runeword&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u00a0and the &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Gauntlets%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;battle gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Gout\"&gt;Lava Gout&lt;/a&gt;, grant a chance of casting a high level Enchant upon striking or killing an enemy.

Carried out by the &lt;a href=\"Mystic\"&gt;Mystic&lt;/a&gt;, it allows players to re-roll one of the properties of a &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Set%20Item\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; class item for another, possibly better random property. Players are required to pay a &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and material cost to complete the Enchanting process.\u00a0Enchanting rares takes normal crafting materials like &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Crystal\"&gt;Veiled Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Breath\"&gt;Death's Breath&lt;/a&gt;, but legendaries/set items will require a &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Brimstone\"&gt;Fiery Brimstone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Soul\"&gt;Forgotten Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Enchanting Legendary\u00a0jewelry costs no Gold, but takes &lt;a href=\"Gems\"&gt;Gems&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0instead (Imperial quality on level 70).\nWhen enchanting, the player must first choose one property; a question mark in the list of properties will show a list of the potential affixes that can roll. The new affix must always be of the same type as the affix chosen (i.e., a primary affix cannot be re-rolled to a secondary affix, or vice versa), and in general cannot duplicate an existing affix. Once one affix is enchanted, no other affixes can be re-rolled, but the enchanted affix can be re-rolled at any time.\nA maximum of five affixes are available for re-rolling. Objects that normally roll six affixes will have one that cannot be altered, which is often item-type specific: for example, Demon Hunter &lt;a href=\"Quivers\"&gt;Quivers&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0cannot re-roll their increased attack speed bonuses.\nEnchanting gives\u00a0the option to choose one of two new affixes, or keep the current affix. One of the two new affixes may be the same as the current affix, allowing for attempts to re-roll higher values without changing affixes.\u00a0The new affix is not guaranteed to be better than the current affix (e.g., attempting to re-roll a 6.0% Critical Hit Chance on a Ring can result in values lower than 6.0%). Keeping the original affix does not refund the cost of the enchanting attempt..The chances to roll each stat are\u00a0\"not\u00a0\"evenly distributed; some affixes are more rare than others.\nThe process may be repeated \"ad infinitum, \"as long as player has the required materials. However, for all but Legendary/Set jewelry items, the gold cost of each enchanting on the same item increases multiplicatively, stacking infinitely. The materials required remain the same. For Legendary/Set jewelry, the costs are the exact same (even the one gem needed), in part because jewelry tends to have more affixes that can roll.\nOnly one property can be chosen to re-roll, and it cannot be the orange one (special legendary property). Once that property is selected, no other can be re-rolled, even if the original property is restored. Primary properties can be replaced with primary only, and secondary with secondary only.\nOnce a player Enchants an item, it will (if it isn't already) become &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Account\"&gt;bound to their account&lt;/a&gt; and can no longer be traded to other players. Another restriction is that items earned prior to the 2.0 patch may not be enchanted.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally, the Mystic allowed players to reset stats of Enchanting in the event of dissatisfaction. However, after a single property had been changed via Enchanting, all other properties became \"locked in\" and could not be re-rolled.\u00a0As of patch 2.0.5, Enchanting can no longer roll both optional properties identical to the original one (for example, if one re-rolls Vitality, \"one\"\u00a0of the two new options could be Vitality, but not both). In addition, affixes allowed for a Legendary/Set item that normally do not roll for that slot are pulled back into the pool of possible affixes should they be the affix selected for rerolling. For example, re-rolling the elemental bonus on a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Jordan%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Stone of Jordan&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will allow elemental bonuses to be rolled."}

As a result, an Enchantress can do a number of different things with her extra points:\nWhen Enchant and its synergies are maxed, and the appropriate equipment is obtained, Enchant can add enormous Fire Damage to herself and her teammates. If an Enchantress decides to use the spell on herself, she can level up her &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; accordingly. The only problem with this is that Sorceresses, unlike classes such as s or &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;s, do not get as much &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; with each point into &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;. This is why some physical Enchantresses decide to put points into Energy Shield, and in place of Vitality level up &lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;. This high energy, combined with a very high level Warmth, is meant to absorb damage inflicted on the Enchantress while she attacks her enemies.\nEquipment.\nA support Enchantress should look for traditional Sorceress weapons that boost her spells with +skill bonuses.\nA &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Sorceress\"&gt;melee Enchantress&lt;/a&gt; should look for weapons with fast attack speeds or high elemental damage. A \u00a0&lt;a href=\"Phase%20Blade\"&gt;Phase Blade&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and/or dual s in a helm and a shield, for example, stack to create a very high Holy Shock on top of the fire damage already dealt.\nA ranged Enchantress can combine &lt;a href=\"Exploding_Arrow\"&gt;explosive arrow&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"piercing\"&gt;piercing&lt;/a&gt; to deliver her fire damage. &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Claw\"&gt;Raven Claw&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Kuko%20Shakaku\"&gt;Kuko Shakaku&lt;/a&gt; at mid levels and or at higher levels all fire explosive arrows. &lt;a href=\"Razortail\"&gt;Razortail&lt;/a&gt; adds additional chance of piercing.\nBoth melee and ranged Enchantresses may seek additional gear for prebuffing. Magefists are great for +1 fire skills, though &lt;a href=\"Increased%20Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Increased Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; gloves may be preferred while attacking. Drognan can sell staves with +3 Enchant; search for a nonmagic one with two sockets to make , or a nonmagic Gnarled Staff or Battle Staff with no sockets and have Larzuk socket it after the Siege on Harrogath quest is completed. They will receive 4 sockets, and can be created (of note is that memory will also boost Energy Shield by at least 6 and Frozen Orb by at least 3, making it a powerful switch weapon for this build). is another common prebuff item.\nHireling.\nAlthough many players solo with their characters, &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; can certainly increase the survivability of any character if maintained properly. Typically, most choose the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Act 2 Defensive Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt; (the \"Holy Freeze Merc\") or the Offensive version (the \"Might Merc\"), but the others have plenty of potential if geared properly. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Act 3 Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; with cold attacks used to be popular, but are rare now due to many monsters being immune to their attacks. Although &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarian Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are quite rugged, they can be overcome by large mobs. On the other hand, properly equipped, he can definitely play a major factor in increasing the character's survivability. And the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt; should not be counted out either, although without particular gear, her ability to assist in later stages of the game diminishes by quite a bit.\nEquipment.\nAlthough the weapons vary, the armor and helmet choices are mostly stock, with some variance in regards to armor."}

The Western Kingdoms are comprised of the three regions: &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller, self-contained kingdoms contained herein have developed unique rules of protocol and etiquette, leading many to consider the Western Kingdoms as the most civilized of lands. Such exalted opinions stand in surprising contrast to the youthful age of the realm. While long a destination of merchants and peaceful travelers, recently infighting has made the Western Kingdoms a common destination for mercenaries and other, more sordid, visitors.\"\n\"The Western Kingdoms are well known for their rich woodlands, a result of the area\u2019s nutrient laden soil, pleasant rainfall, and mild climate. From the massive pine and spruce, to the supple yew and ash, these woodlands are unequaled anywhere in Sanctuary. These abundant, fine-grained woods are forested for housing, farming tools, and weapons of warfare. The Sisters of the Sightless Eye, who make their homes within the provinces of Entsteig, are renowned for the bows that they fashion from these trees.\"\n\"But as the shadows fall across all of Sanctuary, the Western Kingdoms too, are changing. The once familiar creatures that have inhabited these forests have become warped, aggressive versions of their natural forms. Woodsmen have spotted several of the following creatures, and have submitted their report so that travelers and heroes alike may be better prepared to encounter these foul beasts:\"\nThe Great Deserts of Aranoch.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Tamoe%20Highlands\"&gt;Tamoe mountain range&lt;/a&gt;, which lines the eastern border of the Western Kingdoms, acts as a natural barrier into these provinces. Although impassable in most areas, these mountains hold a vast and lush woodlands. These forests stand in stark contrast to the bleak wastelands lying beyond them to the east: the flat, unforgiving, sand-swept deserts of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Boasting one of the harshest climates in the world, the deserts of Aranoch claim the lives of many each year. Only the most robust and highly trained nomads survive longer then a few hours in this scorching environment. This vast desert land is mainly comprised of vast, empty tracts, punctuated with but a few specially adapted plants and trees. Water is a rarity among the sand dunes of Aranoch, with dry spells reportedly lasting for years. The climate of this desert ranges from life threatening heat during summer days, to dry frigid winds during winter nights.\"\n\"Set on the western edge of the Twin Seas, the jewel city of Lut Gholein has actually prospered in the merciless environment of Aranoch. Most credit this to the city\u2019s coastal location and strong sea trading ties with the kingdoms to the east and west. Although a few bands of nomadic people have found ways to survive in this hostile desert, most steer clear of these sandy wastelands.\"\n\"The perilous nature of Aranoch\u2019s unique and deadly environment is without equal. Few creatures could survive in habitats so unforgiving, but some hardy beasts have managed. Now twisted by the chaos brought about by the arrival of the Prime Evils, these unique beasts are fearsomely powerful:\"\nKehjistan and Kurast.\n\"On the eastern edge of the Twin Seas lie the emerald jungles of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. Several thousand years ago, hunter-gatherers found themselves drawn to the lush, fertile rain forests and bountiful game inhabiting Kehjistan. But there was something else; Kehjistan\u2019s geography was rife with nodes of magical energies, and eventually those with innate, arcane abilities began to sense and recognize these forces, gathering in groups to settle these special areas. It was here that the original &lt;a href=\"mage%20clans\"&gt;mage clans&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ennead\"&gt;Ennead&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ammuit\"&gt;Ammuit&lt;/a&gt;, were founded. Unfortunately the history of Kehjistan is not a peaceful one, and the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt; that erupted nearly destroyed the clans.\"\n\"Geographically, Kehjistan encompasses almost one-third of Sanctuary\u2019s eastern hemisphere. With an average rainfall of over four hundred inches per year, Kehjistan has the largest rainforests in the known world. This huge expanse of jungle feeds the Argentek River, which is the longest, widest river in Sanctuary. Hundreds of smaller rivers and tributaries twist and turn their way through the lush tropical forests until they finally unite with the mighty Argentek. Herbalists and alchemists revere the rainforest environment for its ecological diversity. Until recently, these sages would come from far and wide to study and collect the rare plants and animals that make their homes here. Now the jungle is far too dangerous to visit, let alone inhabit. Entire villages, even small cities have been wiped out. News has broken that &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, the current capitol of Kehjistan, is now under siege by the powers of Hell, and is kept safe only through powerful magical barriers that even now begin to ebb and fade.\"\n\"What reports do escape this besieged area tell of terrible creatures:\"\nThe Undead.\n\"Scattered throughout all the lands of Sanctuary are these walking vessels of Hell\u2019s influence on the mortal realm. For in recent times, the newly dead have risen anew to terrorize and assault the living. These corpses and spirits of the deceased, twisted and corrupted, are imbued with a hatred for the living that defies understanding. The undead loathe the living and seek only to consume warm flesh and blood. It has reached the point where all who value their lives are sure to butcher and burn the remains of loved ones and pets who have fallen prey to death. One needs to be sure in these troubled times. Below are descriptions of a few of the living dead known to exist:\""}

So long as she can maintain her concentration over this magical buffer, she diverts harmful magical energies and absorbs physical harm into her store of Mana. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nAlthough most Sorceress users tend to be a little contrarian, pumping &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; and ignoring &lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;, Energy Shield is for the conventional Sorceress, whose &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; severely outweighs her &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. Energy shield converts some damage she takes from life into mana; when taking very high amounts of damage, this can save a player's life, but can also eat up a player's mana, preventing them from casting spells.\nStill, using this same logic, this can also allow a Sorceress to focus mainly on consuming Mana potions, using them to replenish both hit points and spellcasting ability (although Energy Shield won't convert ALL damage to mana, so some life potions might still be needed). Either way, Energy Shield is not recommended for Sorceresses with low Mana or slow Mana regeneration, since being low in either could be fatal.\nSince Energy Shield is defensive in nature, it is often used by builds such as &lt;a href=\"Enchantress%20%28Build%29\"&gt;Enchantress&lt;/a&gt; to give them an extra edge most physical fighters don't have.\nEach point in Telekinesis makes Energy Shield's damage absorption more effective. By default, for each point of damage absorbed by Energy Shield, 2 mana points are deducted, a 200% ratio. Each hard skill point in Telekinesis makes Energy Shield 0.0625 Mana per point more effective. For example, with 8 points in Telekinesis, 1.5 mana points are deducted for each point of damage absorbed, a 150% ratio. With 16 points in Telekinesis, one point of damage absorbed equals one point of mana loss, a 100% ratio. And at the maximum level 20 of Telekinesis, the ratio will be 75%.\nIt should be noted that when taking damage with the Energy Shield on, that resistances do not take effect as long as the damage is being done to your Mana. For example, with level 7 Energy Shield (50% damage absorption)\u00a0a fire bolt dealing 100 fire damage will apply 50 damage to your mana (before Telekinesis calculations are done); the remaining 50 damage will be dealt to Life, subject to fire resistance.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 5"}

In other words, it prevents a boss from being killed by the \"thousand cuts\" tactic over an unreasonably long time. In \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; bosses have an of six minutes.\nIf the battle is not finished after a few minutes, bosses can do a variety of things. One is buffing the boss' damage, or debuffing the player. The effects will increase until the battle is ended. Other bosses gain or empower an ability beyond reasonable survivability. The time and effects vary by boss, and not all bosses have them. \nThe idea is making the combat harder after a certain amount of time, up to the point where the battle becomes unreasonably hard for an adequately geared player. A general rule of thumb to keep in mind is to try and keep on damaging the boss monster most of the fight. The reason for this is twofold. Firstly, once the boss monster is killed, if it had any minions summoned, they will prove to be of little to no threat afterwards, or will even die outright. Secondly, for most adequately equipped players, most of the attacks used by the boss monster will prove easily survivable and/or avoidable, especially if they have a high degree of &lt;a href=\"Toughness\"&gt;endurance&lt;/a&gt; and healing compared to the difficulty level.\nThere are two types of enrage timers: hard and soft. \nSee individual boss pages for timers (mostly 3 or 4 minutes) and effects of the enrage. Known effects include:\nSome bosses, most notably &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, do not have enrage timers. This is due to these boss fights being complicated enough, and these bosses having much larger &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; pools, and therefore players are allowed to fight them for as long as needed. However, unless managed properly, they certainly can put the player in a situation similar to hitting the enrage timer, such as Malthael spamming his Death Fog."}

Only one curse can exist on a player at any time, however.\nThe curses are as follows:\nUpon death, they leave no corpse: rather than being killed, they are sucked into the dark swirling portals, presumably being drawn to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "3047", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3047", "title": "Entsteig", "text": "Entsteig is part of the region known as the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, along with the lands of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThick, mountainous forests blanket Entsteig, though it has some open fields. Mountains are located in the kingdom's north. A number of main roads cross the country (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Road\"&gt;King's Road&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Road\"&gt;Queen's Road&lt;/a&gt;), and during times of harvest, multiple people can be seen travelling them. Entsteig has a number of towns, but they are dwarfed by their counterparts in &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. Also, unlike Kehjistan, these towns are not planned; most villages in Entsteig simply grow as people congregate in a given area. \nCulture.\nEntsteig is a proud kingdom that has pledged its loyalties to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith. However, faith in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; is mixed with paganistic beliefs, (at least some of which include the concept of gods) and its people (referred to as \"Entsteigians\") believe the &lt;a href=\"Sharval%20Wilds\"&gt;Sharval Wilds&lt;/a&gt; to be an enchanted place of fey spirits. Goblins and dragons feature in Entsteig folklore.\nThroughout its history, the people of Entsteig have always believed in &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps even before any other culture on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. They have traditionally been ruled by various kings and queens, who are buried in mounds. It is believed that a curse will befall anyone who defiles an unbroken grave.\nWhile not necessarily unique to Entsteig, its people believe in the concept of a \"Naming\" for their newborns. It is considered bad luck for the child if they do not receive a name within two months of their birth.\nSimilarly perhaps not unique, Entsteig hangs executed individuals at crossroads.\nHarvest festivals are held within the kingdom.\nHistory.\nLocated north of the Sharval Wilds and south of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, Entsteig developed a culture highly distinct from nearby &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28Country%29\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; and the tribes to the north. Prior to the coming of &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, Ivgorod controlled portions of Entsteig. Entsteig itself did not possess even a fraction of the military might of either culture/nation.\nInvasions.\n\"Note that the following events are not necessarily in chronological order\"\nAssur's Invasion.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23302\"&gt;302&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Anno%20Kehjistani\"&gt;Anno Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"archdemon\"&gt;archdemon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Assur\"&gt;Assur&lt;/a&gt; launched an invasion of Entsteig. An army led by Earl &lt;a href=\"Edgewulf\"&gt;Edgewulf&lt;/a&gt; met the invaders at &lt;a href=\"Bear%27s%20Hill\"&gt;Bear's Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s defeated their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; foes, and continued north on to the &lt;a href=\"Entsteig%20%28City%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;, razing villages and slaughtering their inhabitants on the way. Assur was slain at &lt;a href=\"Brennor\"&gt;Brennor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Siggard\"&gt;Siggard&lt;/a&gt;, and his invasion was thwarted.\nAughild's Invasion.\nThe warlord &lt;a href=\"Aughild\"&gt;Aughild&lt;/a&gt; became the only person to ever successfully besiege Entsteig's &lt;a href=\"Entsteig%20%28City%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;. He was subsequently crowned king of Entsteig.\nWar of Thorns.\nEntsteig participated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Thorns\"&gt;War of Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, in which Entsteig was the aggressor. However, Entsteig's forces were forced to retreat.\nZakarum Rule.\nWhen Rakkis marched west, Entsteig opened up to the man and embraced his teachings. In return for embracing the Zakarum faith, Entsteig was allowed to retain much of its independence. Because of its quick acceptance of foreign rule, Entsteig quickly modernized and became an important Zakarum territory. In recent times, many of the most devout Zakarum &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s have hailed from Entsteig.\nDespite this, elements of Entsteig's former culture remain. Even now, many old customs and pagan rituals are still practiced by Entsteig's inhabitants in the Sharval Wilds, as per their spirit beliefs. Even so, these ancient rites have not conflicted with the observance of the Zakarum faith. Rather, Entsteig's people have managed to meld their own esoteric beliefs with their adopted religion."}

The &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; must be Hell II or higher.\nThe portal leads to a map that is a variation of the map used for &lt;a href=\"Purge%20the%20Depths\"&gt;Purge the Depths&lt;/a&gt;. The player must enter the front door and then open as many chests as possible in a limited amount of time. Opening enough chests increases the time limit, but also the Danger Level, which causes stronger and stronger monsters to spawn. A large chest spawns once 40 chests are collected. Once the time expires or the large chest is opened, another countdown starts during which the player must return to the starting location and exit through the portal. During the escape, the Avatar of Terror as well as quickly spawning monsters try to hunt the player down. Furthermore all previously open doors become closed and must be opened again.

This was removed in the update, such that only the portal needs to be clicked. In the same update, the spawn point was moved closer to the castle entrance and the damage of the Avatar of Terror was reduced.\nAfter the update, &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; are no longer lost after a defeat.\nIn the update, &lt;a href=\"Monstrous%20Essence\"&gt;Monstrous Essence&lt;/a&gt; drops were added to chests.\nThe Normal Gem rewards were added in the update. At the same time, a guaranteed Abyssal Essence drop was added for escaping at danger level 5 or higher.\nOriginally, the difficulty scaled at the same rate as the number of players, so a 4-player party had 4x difficulty.

She traded her &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; for escape.

Eskara had not forgotten her death at the hands of her foe, and fought them twice. One, in spiritual form, and a second time, when she was reborn as a demon. This monster too, however, was destroyed. Despite her third death, Kyrel told the Shard-seeker that his kin would keep vigil, as given that Eskara was now a demon, she would inevitably reform in time.\nIn-game.\nEskara is a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", encountered in the Unseen Lair.

As a primary &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; it is used by s in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", but it is also a term used when acquiring the unique properties of creatures or items in some form.\nLore.\nEssence is a form of energy that gives beings life. It can be harvested from dead and living beings by &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s whether those beings be mortal, &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;. It is gained by summoning the fading life force of corpses, by rending a &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, or siphoning it directly from &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. It can even come from the Necromancer's own health. By doing so, every Necromancer ensures that they are seldom helpless or powerless. Necromancers use Essence to &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;animate&lt;/a&gt; the dead, curse enemies, and command minions.\nAs a static resource, Necromancers only have as much Essence as they harvest from their enemies. It does not fill up slowly over time, nor does it decay. Due to this peculiarity, Necromancers who are careless may find themselves out of Essence when they need it most. Necromancers who make the most of their power embrace the balance between exhausting Essence reserves and obtaining more from enemies, forever looking to the next battle. A Necromancer with a full Essence pool is a terrifying adversary indeed, but they must carefully use their spells to keep enemies at bay.\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Engine\"&gt;Chaos Engine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; was similarly able to extract Essence, and use it to animate his creations.

It is capped at 200, and does not regenerate passively (but also does not decrease over time), only being replenished by primary skills such as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Siphon\"&gt;Blood Siphon&lt;/a&gt;, or by other skills like &lt;a href=\"Devour\"&gt;Devour&lt;/a&gt; in battle. &lt;a href=\"Overwhelming%20Essence\"&gt;Overwhelming Essence&lt;/a&gt; passive increases the maximum cap by 40, and &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; levels further add up to 50.\n&lt;a href=\"Reilena%27s%20Shadowhook\"&gt;Reilena's Shadowhook&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20Scythes\"&gt;two-handed scythe&lt;/a&gt;, boosts all damage done by 0.5% for every point of maximum Essence (normally +100%).\n&lt;a href=\"Scythes\"&gt;Scythes&lt;/a&gt; (both one and two-handed), &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phylacteries\"&gt;Phylacteries&lt;/a&gt; increase maximum Essence as well: up to +20 per item (at level 70).\nMany skills generate Essence upon killing enemies as well, including the &lt;a href=\"Reaping\"&gt;Reaping&lt;/a&gt; passive skill. &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt; can provide a 10% generation bonus.\n&lt;a href=\"Corpse\"&gt;Corpse&lt;/a&gt; skills usually cost no Essence to cast.

Extracting essence destroys the equipment. Essences extracted for the first time are added to the collection.\nEssence Mastery.\nExtracting an essence already in the collection adds to Essence Mastery, shown as a green bar at the top of the Extract menu. Filling the bar grants a level in Essence Mastery, up to a maximum of 4. Each level of Mastery improves the quality of all legendary equipments.\nEssence Mastery is counted separately for each &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoyalty Bonus.\nPlayers have a chance to automatically receive a pre-selected essence whenever they extract another essence. The Loyalty Bonus (and the chance to get it) is shown on the bottom left corner of the Extract menu. Extracting essences increase the chance to be granted the Loyalty Bonus, until a guaranteed chance after 400 extractions.\nThe chances of getting loyalty bonus are not reset by changing class.\nInherit.\nA legendary gear can be changed by inheriting an essence from another gear of the same same equipment slot. Any essence to be inherited must be in the collection of extracted essence. Inheriting an essence changes the Legendary property, name, icon, 3D model, and flavor text of a legendary gear.\nTransmogrify.\nTransmogrification is unlocked at an Essence Mastery of 1. Some legendary equipment also have a transmogrification option once their essences have been added to the collection.

{"id": "2660", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2660", "title": "Eternal Conflict", "text": "The Eternal Conflict (a.k.a. \"Great Conflict\") is the name for the war between the forces of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. It has since spilled over into the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly a few &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s have ever questioned their purpose in the Eternal Conflict. Fewer still have acted upon it.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThe Eternal Conflict is as ancient as Creation itself, with Heaven and Hell vying for dominion. On one side were the angels of the High Heavens, led by the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;, who believed that only absolute order could govern the realms. Opposing them were the demons of Hell, led by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed that darkness and chaos were at the center of all things, and saw the order the angels intended to oppose as an affront.\nThe Eternal Conflict raged on, endless and all-consuming. The &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; fought countless battles against the armies Hell. Though the High Heavens often defeated their adversaries, they also failed to destroy them, allowing evil to return again, and again, and again, ceaseless, unrelenting. Both sides claimed victories. Both suffered crippling defeats. The Conflict was a never-ending slaughter. Prior to &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, not a single or demon or angel ever made peace with one of their counterparts. In effect, the war was in perpetual stalemate.\nThe war was most commonly fought in the realm of &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;, as both sides fought for control of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that whoever controlled the Worldstone had the ability to shape reality and create life and worlds almost without restriction. While the Eternal Conflict had begun before the Worldstone's discovery, the giant artifact became the war's focus. Angels used the stone to create worlds of perfect order in line with their ideals. Demons used it to create engines of annihilation and worlds of destruction, terror, and hatred. However, none of the worlds, regardless of their maker, ever flourished, and were doomed to wither and die due to the war. Some worlds were put to the torch as both sides sought control of the Worldstone.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; ordered a bastion to be built around the Worldstone. This stronghold came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. It changed hands many times over the course of the conflict and as such, its structural and metaphysical traits of both demons and angels. Over time, the Worldstone itself became 'poisoned' by Heaven and Hell, per their desire to control the relic.\nAt times, the war would reach Heaven and Hell itself. The &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt; of the High Heavens were assailed at least &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Battle%20of%20the%20Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;five times&lt;/a&gt;, but the gates themselves were never breached. Likewise, angels assaulted Hell. One such assault was made against &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; himself in his &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;own realm&lt;/a&gt;, and another against the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt; himself, where &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; was lost. But while the Great Conflict burned hotter and longer than any of the stars in the sky, neither side could gain dominion over the other for long. Both factions sought some way to turn the tides of the war to their favor.\nDisappearance of the Worldstone.\nWhile the armies of Heaven and Hell clashed, &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; were disgruntled and disillusioned by this unending conflict, both seeking a way out of it. They led a renegade group of like-minded angels and demons to steal the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; and used it to create a world of their own, where angels and demons can co-exist peacefully away from the Eternal Conflict and soon bore the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe disappearance of the Worldstone soon caught the attention of both Heaven and Hell, puzzled on how such a powerful item to create worlds disappeared without a trace.\nThe Sin War.\nEventually the forces of Hell learned about Sanctuary. Not wanting to attract Heaven's attention, they worked in secret to try and corrupt humanity via the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; reasoning that their potential would allow them to finally break the deadlock in the Great Confict. They were opposed by Inarius, although both Inarius and &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt; were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;. The High Heavens found out about Sanctuary and moved to destroy it. Eventually Uldyssian's heroic sacrifice drove both armies back and resealed humanity's potential. After the Heaven's voted to spare sanctuary a truce was reached with the Burning Hells; both factions would respect Sanctuary's right to exist. However, the Prime Evils had no intention of honoring the truce. From then onward, Hell (or at least the Prime Evils) were more interested in corrupting humanity than taking to the battlefield directly.\nHumanity itself learnt of the Eternal Conflict to some extent, but never in great detail, its true history only known by a select few. Scholars spilled gallons of ink and spent their eyesight in grim scriptoriums writing and debating how angels and demons originated, and what came before them.\nRecent History.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, the Eternal Conflict was still ongoing."}

Which, under &lt;a href=\"Akeba\"&gt;Akeba&lt;/a&gt;, they did, thus beginning the &lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Cycle of Strife&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 11th century, the crown was searched for by &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;.

A single Immortal leader bears the Eternal Crown, and four lieutenants have crowns of their own. Each crown grants an extraordinary power once it has reached a certain level of progression thanks to the reign's Dominance. A mixture of offensive and defensive buffs will emanate from these Legendary items, amplifying the wearer\u2019s might as well as that of other Immortals in close proximity."}

It is the source of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Scholars have likened the Ether to the ocean, with &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; being the sky. By the same analogy, spells are the turbulence that occurs when the two interact with each other. However, much energy is lost in the transition between the physical and ethereal realms, meaning that only the strongest of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s can harness anything more than the most basic of magical effects, and even then, much energy is lost in the transition between the physical and ethereal realms. Electromagnetism exists on the cusp of both realms.\nIt is through the Ether that &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ation is made possible, traversing the Ether to instantly appear in a separate location. Manipulation of the Ether within the physical plane also allows the use of &lt;a href=\"telekinesis\"&gt;telekinesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s are also capable of using the Ether to charge their weapons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; dwell at the edge of both the Ether and the physical realm.

Ethereal items are representative of &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; (but never &lt;a href=\"amulets\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rings\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"arrows\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bolts\"&gt;bolts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crossbows\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phase%20Blade\"&gt;Phase Blade&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"set%20items\"&gt;set items&lt;/a&gt;) crafted from other-worldly material. \nEthereal is an item flag, similar to socketed, and is not a &lt;a href=\"prefix\"&gt;prefix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"suffix\"&gt;suffix&lt;/a&gt;. When an item is ethereal, it gains a bonus to its &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt;, has reduced &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;, has reduced &lt;a href=\"requirements\"&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;, and is no longer &lt;a href=\"repair\"&gt;repair&lt;/a&gt;able through conventional means.\nThe bonus to damage or defense is 50%. The new durability is half of the original +1. Strength and Dexterity requirements are reduced by 10 each. The sale value is reduced by 75% or more.\nEthereal items can be &lt;a href=\"Self-Repair\"&gt;self repairing&lt;/a&gt;, but if the item breaks, the self repairing attribute will stop working and the item will stay broken with the durability remaining at 0. The same principle doesn't apply to ethereal &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Weapons\"&gt;Throwing Weapons&lt;/a&gt; with replenish quantity \u2014 even if you hit 0, the attribute will still work and the quantity will be eventually restored.\nIt is safe to give an ethereal item to &lt;a href=\"hirelings\"&gt;hirelings&lt;/a&gt;, because equipment used by them will never lose durability.\nWhether or not the ethereal condition of items transmuted with the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; will be kept depends on the recipe used. As a general rule, recipes that keep the attributes of the original item, like socketing and upgrading recipes, will also carry the ethereal condition to the results, while recipes that generate a new item with new properties, like rerolling or crafting recipes, likewise, won't carry the ethereal condition to the results. None of the Cube recipes that repair items work on ethereal items.\nEthereal items can be used to make &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt;. An Ethereal item with a &lt;a href=\"Zod%20Rune\"&gt;Zod Rune&lt;/a&gt; will fully negate the side effects of reduced durability (see &lt;a href=\"Indestructible\"&gt;Indestructible&lt;/a&gt;).\nSome Unique items &lt;a href=\"Repairs%20durability\"&gt;Repairs 1 durability&lt;/a&gt; in 4/5/10 or 20 seconds and can be ethereal: &lt;a href=\"Sandstorm%20Trek\"&gt;Sandstorm Trek&lt;/a&gt; (Boots), &lt;a href=\"Warlord%27s%20Trust\"&gt;Warlord's Trust&lt;/a&gt; (Axe) &lt;a href=\"Ginther%27s%20Rift\"&gt;Ginther's Rift&lt;/a&gt; (Sword), &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Limb\"&gt;Demon Limb&lt;/a&gt; (Club), &lt;a href=\"Skin%20of%20the%20Flayed%20One\"&gt;Skin of the Flayed One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skullder%27s%20Ire\"&gt;Skullder's Ire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Carapace\"&gt;Steel Carapace&lt;/a&gt; (Armor), &lt;a href=\"Hone%20Sundan\"&gt;Hone Sundan&lt;/a&gt; (Spear)\nMercenaries can use ethereal items (&lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt;, rare, magic etc) without destroying them.

Should Baal gain full control of the Worldstone, the boundaries between the mortal realm and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; could shatter, and the forces of Hell would spew forth and overtake everything mankind has struggled to build.\nThe quest is completed when Baal is slain. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; will appear inside the Worldstone's chamber, telling the player that Baal already corrupted the Worldstone and that it now must be destroyed. Tyrael then opens a portal to safety.\nTips and additional information.\nYou must fight your way through the Worldstone Keep until you arrive in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Throne of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, where Baal will summon five waves of minions against you. Once the minions are gone, you must enter the &lt;a href=\"The%20Worldstone%20Chamber\"&gt;Worldstone Chamber&lt;/a&gt; and kill Baal. See the &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; article for tips on how to defeat the Lord of Destruction.\nBefore you can fight Baal, you must first defeat his minions. Baal summons five waves of different enemies, each wave consisting of a 'signature' monster representing the monster's &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;. The wave is led by a &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt;. These are as follows:\nCorpses are cleared after a wave has been defeated. If the player has trouble dealing with a particular wave, he/she can lure the monsters away from Baal's throne. Upon returning to Baal, he will think they're dead and proceed with summoning the next wave. This can prove to be a useful strategy when dealing with the powerful Minions of Destruction; Baal will simply enter the Worldstone Chamber, allowing you to chase him.\nAfter the player has defeated Baal, Tyrael will appear and open a special portal (titled 'Destruction's End'). Upon 'entering' this portal, the game's final &lt;a href=\"cinematic\"&gt;cinematic&lt;/a&gt; will play and the game will end. Therefore it's advised to return to &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; first and finish any business left there."}

Haroutunian describes the design and iteration of a &lt;a href=\"game%20mode\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" called &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Mode\"&gt;Challenge Mode&lt;/a&gt;, which was never officially released but influenced a number of in-game features, with a focus on &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Chest\"&gt;Cursed Chest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Shrines\"&gt;Cursed Shrines&lt;/a&gt; but also including connections with other elements of the live game.\nOverview.\nThe presentation is organized around four iterations of Challenge Mode, beginning before the release of \"Diablo III\", and continuing through the development of features for '. It includes gameplay clips of one or two prototype s for each iteration. For each one, Haroutunian describes the goals they had in mind during design, which shifted over time, as well as feedback from the \"Diablo III\" team who tested each event and the lessons and conclusions they led to. It ends with an explanation of how the final form of the Challenge Mode concept became Cursed events in \"Reaper of Souls &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, but also notes how various design options tested out along the way ended up in the game attached to other features, despite being \"cut\" from Cursed events.\nHaroutunian emphasizes several times that none of the prototype footage shown was ever intended to go live in the game in the same form it was prototyped; the assets used such as levels and monsters were simply placeholders. An overall theme is how the design process is full of experimentation to determine what's fun and what the limits are of good gameplay befitting \"Diablo III\", making both good and bad feedback valuable for the process.\nChallenge Mode.\nThe video describes Challenge Mode as going through four iterations which Haroutunian calls Challenge Mode 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; Trials. Challenge Mode overall was a loose idea, and part of the iteration process was to figure out what it even could be.\nFor 1.0 before the release of \"Diablo III\", the goal was to explore using game assets already developed to add more content to the game. Several of the events created at this stage had features quite similar to the eventual Cursed events and others, but the feedback was that they did not feel special or exciting, so the team went \"back to the drawing board\".\nFor version 2.0 after the game had launched, \"minigame\" style events were prototyped to attempt to create unique and exciting gameplay. However, the concepts felt too far from core Diablo mechanics, and were only fun in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nVersion 3.0 zeroed in on the multiplayer experience and competitive aspect, attempting to challenge on skill rather than character progression. Feedback was very negative, with severe balance problems and a feeling that luck rather than skill determined the outcome, making the mode fun with friends but not competing against strangers.\nAt this point, during development of \"Reaper of Souls\", the team \"hit the reset button\" and renamed the mode to \"Nephalem Trials\", changing expectations away being a completely different game mode, and focusing more on repeatable challenges which worked with cooperative gameplay. The competitive aspect was pulled out of the in-game experience and shifted to the metagame with &lt;a href=\"leaderboard\"&gt;leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;s. This was well-received.\nFinal designs.\nHaroutunian shows that Cursed events were essentially the final outcome of Challenge Mode/Nephalem trials. He shares &lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Grove\"&gt;The Cursed Grove&lt;/a&gt; as an example which kept the essentials of the previous design, and states that almost all events developed for testing as Nephalem trials ended up as cursed events and/or &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;. However, the team concluded the events did not have enough depth to make competition meaningful, so leaderboards were removed, and the events were integrated directly into the game world rather than being isolated via portals, as they were initially.\nHe also explains how many aspects of their experimentation did end up in various game features. This was seen as a very acceptable outcome despite discarding those ideas from Challenge Mode/Cursed events, as each idea ended up with a gameplay element that suited it better.

He does not battle against the &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Flavie\"&gt;Flavie&lt;/a&gt; does in &lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt;, and is ignored by them in turn.\nHadriel does not share in party-friendly auras, but he gains the effect of party sharing &lt;a href=\"Warcries\"&gt;Warcries&lt;/a&gt;. This is redundant, however, given his lack of involvement in combat.\nDialogues.\nHadriel is clickable, and has two speeches, depending on whether a character has already finished the quest:\n\"\"Halt! Before venturing into &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s lair, go to the Hellforge with &lt;a href=\"Mephisto%27s%20Soulstone\"&gt;Mephisto's Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. Place the stone on the Hellforge and use the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge%20Hammer\"&gt;Hellforge Hammer&lt;/a&gt; to destroy it.\" (before quest completion)\n\"Proceed, hero, into &lt;a href=\"Terror%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Terror's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. Know that Diablo's innermost sanctum is hidden by five seals. Only by opening each of these seals can you clear your way to the final battle.\"\" (after quest completion)\n&lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"Between the River of Flame and the Archangel Hadriel stands a row of statues, guarding the way to the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Chaos Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. As you pass each statue, take notice as they turn their head and follow you with their icy stares. What purpose could they serve? Perhaps they are the eyes of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself!\"\""}

He served King Leoric?\nHaedrig:\nNot much to tell. I lived with my father in Caldeum at the time.\nWe heard that my grandfather stayed in Tristram until the end, trying to save lives. Don't know if he succeeded, but there it is.\nWhen the Skeleton King fell, my grandfather was dying from a sword wound. He had the crown sealed with him to keep it safe.\nPlayer:\nIt takes strength to stand against the dark. Thank you for your grandfather's sacrifice.\nMira Eamon.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Reign of the Black King (Act I)Disappears at the end of Act I.\nPlayer:\nI see the villagers weeping for their dead.

Hear me when I tell you that I understand.\nLong ago, before I became a warrior, my little sister died of a terrible illness. I did not sleep for long days. I did not eat.\nThe spirits, they whispered and sang to me until my tears dried. They sing to me still, and I smile to hear my sister among them.\nHaedrig:\nWith all due respect, I don't want to hear about your beliefs or your spirits. If you don't have any business for me, just leave me be.\nHaedrig's Father.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Doom in Wortham (Act I)\nPlayer:\nYou spoke of your father before. I would like to hear of him.\nHaedrig:\nMy father was a diplomat. We had a manor in Caldeum with servants, terraces, all of that.\nEverything changed when the troubles started. Somehow, rumors spread that my grandfather was responsible for the King's madness.\nMy father's work fell apart. No one would speak to him. He kept believing it would blow over, though.\nPlayer:\nDid it?\nHaedrig:\nNo. I'd rather not talk about it now, if you don't mind. I have work to see to.\nFate of Haedrig's Father.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Return to New Tristram (Act I)\nHaedrig:\nI can tell by the look in your eye that you're not going to leave it alone. You want to hear what happened to my father.\nPlayer:\nAnyone can see that it pulls at you.\nHaedrig:\nRight, well... my father tried to dispel the rumors about my grandfather. No one would listen.\nThen one night, a week later, crazed refugees from Tristram came for revenge. I remember my father screaming for us to get out. And nasty laughter... a lot of it.\nJust before Justus shoved me out of the window, I saw my father crawling up the stairs at me with two daggers in his back and a third whipping around his throat.\nPlayer:\nWhy did these men kill him? Did they believe your father a traitor as well?\nHaedrig:\nI doubt it. Madmen don't need reasons to kill, just blades.\nReturning to Caldeum.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Shadows in the Desert (Act II)\nPlayer:\nDid you ever think that you would return to Caldeum?\nHaedrig:\nI told myself I'd never come back here, and yet here I am.\nPlayer:\nBecause of what happened to your father?\nHaedrig:\nBecause of what happened to me. Some scars don't heal, and there's no point in scratching at them, is there?\nWeather doesn't suit me either.\nChanges in the City.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Road to Alcarnus (Act II)\nPlayer:\nHave these lands changed much since you were here last?\nHaedrig:\nLast time I passed through here was soon after meeting Mira.

I'll be glad for us to be gone.\nMeeting Mira.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: A Royal Audience (Act II)\nPlayer:\nIs this where you met your wife?\nHaedrig:\nIt's actually quite a tale. We met in a town not far from here, n the outskirts of Kurast. She was... Well, you're not going to believe it...\nShe was... locked in a cage.\nPlayer:\nShe was a breaker of laws?\nHaedrig:\nNo! They were going to burn her as a witch.\nPlayer:\nYou wife was a witch?\nHaedrig:\nLet's talk about this another time.\nAbout Mira.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Betrayer of the Horadrim (Act II)\nPlayer:\nTell me more about your wife.\nHaedrig:\nI broke her out in the middle of the night, and we escaped. They didn't chase us far. I guess they were glad to see her go.\nPlayer:\nNot many care for witches.\nHaedrig:\nShe wasn't a witch. She was a mystic. Though we didn't find that out for a time, not until we started traveling with a Vecin wagon train. But that's another story for another time.\nThe Vecin.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Blood and Sand (Act II)\nPlayer:\nTell of your time with the Vecin.\nHaedrig:\nWhen we first joined the wagon train, we were just two lost souls. The Vecin thought it was unbearably romantic, a pair of lovers on the run from their pasts.\nI suppose it might have even been true.\nA mystic with the Vecin recognized Mira's talent immediately. We stayed with them while Mira learned from her. Along the way, we fell in love and got married.\nI've never known anything as surely as my love for her.\nPlayer:\nPerhaps she cast a spell on you.\nHaedrig:\nNever mind.\nGoing to Tristram.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Black Soulstone (Act II)\nPlayer:\nWhy did you go to Tristram?\nHaedrig:\nYou know, I've asked myself that. It was Mira's idea. I wonder if she saw something and knew that I needed to be there to help you.\nDid she knew what was going to happen all along?\nPlayer:\nYou had many years of love together. She would not want you to worry for her.\nHaedrig:\nThank you. I need a moment alone.\nCaldeum After Belial.\nAvailable after Killing Belial in: Lord of Lies (Act II)*easier to get in Act III if backtracking.\nHaedrig:\nDo you wonder what will happen in Caldeum now?\nPlayer:\nThe people there will survive if they value wisdom over greed.\nHaedrig:\nAsheara will be there to keep the peace. I only hope they rebuild wisely. I have seen the ruin that Leoric and Diablo brought in Tristram. I would not wish it upon Caldeum.\nBastion's Keep.\nAvailable at the start of the quest: The Siege of Bastion Keep (Act III)\nBlacksmith Haedrig:\nFrom the burning desert to the freezing north. You don't make it easy on us, do you?\nPlayer:\nWe will rest the moment the demons do. I promise.\nBlacksmith Haedrig:\nAt least there's a lot of work to be done here. These men fight with blunted swords and dented armor. It's good to help.\nThe Future.\nAvailable in the quest: The Siege of Bastion Keep (Act III)\nBlacksmith Haedrig:\nWhat will you do when this battle is ended?\nPlayer:\nIt may be too early to think about such a thing.\nBlacksmith Haedrig:\nIt's never too early.\nPlayer:\nMy people are enslaved by brutal traditions. I will return, and free them.\nBlacksmith Haedrig:\nA noble goal. I just want a quiet town in the country, where I can work and live a life of peace.\nRaising the Catapults.\nAvailable at the start of the quest: Turning the Tide (Act III) (Talk to Tyrael first to start the quest)\nHaedrig:\nIt will be difficult to break Azmodan's advance without the catapults brought to bear. The demon's numbers are too great. In time, they will overrun us.\nBut if the catapults can be raised, our superior position may make all the difference.\nThe Final Goal.\nAvailable at the start of the quest: Tremors in the Stone (Act III) after accepting the quest from Lieutenant Lavail.\nHaedrig:\nTime has flown by since I joined you in New Tristram. Look at us now. Who would have ever guessed we'd be here?\nAnd now every passing hour brings us closer to our goal. But do we have a chance?\nPlayer:\nThe spirits have led us to this place and time. We cannot fail.\nTide of Battle.\nAvailable at the start of the quest: Machines of War (Act III)\nHaedrig:\nThe men look to you to lead them. When they see you laying waste to the demon hordes, they are heartened. As you go, so does this battle.\nAlways remember that.\nNerves.\nAvailable at the start of the quest: Siegebreaker (Act III)\nHaedrig:\nHow do you feel? Nervous?\nPlayer:\nSometimes. Then, I breathe, I smile... and the nervousness is gone.\nHaedrig:\nI feel a sense of calm. I know you can do it. Have no fear; the things I have crafted will not fail you.\nHaedrig's Sorrow.\nAvailable at the start of the quest: Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)\nHaedrig:\nI thought I could make my wife's death mean something. It doesn't matter now, does it?\nPlayer:\nIt does matter. You are here now, and we might still turn the tide of this battle.\nHaedrig:\nRight. I'm sure that's a comfort for Leah now that she's gone too. I've been a fool.\nYou don't get to make things right. This world isn't made for redemption.\nAn Apology.\nAvailable at the start of the quest: Beneath the Spire (Act IV)\nHaedrig: \nI'm sorry for what I said before. I was upset. I don't know what it is, but I feel better, like things can be made right.\nPlayer: \nYou feel hopeful once again.\nHaedrig: \nYes, that's it exactly. My wife would not have wanted me to wallow in my misery. She would have wanted me to do everything I could to help you win this battle.\nAnd you can win. I know that now."}

He is the Blacksmith of the group traveling with &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and performs many duties similar to the &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;smiths&lt;/a&gt; in other games.\nBiography.\nCaldeum.\nHaedrig lived with his father, a diplomat, in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. They lived in a manor, along with their servants. He was present there during the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, while his &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Eamon\"&gt;grandfather&lt;/a&gt; served &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, even as madness claimed the king. Rumors spread that Haedrig's grandfather had been behind Leoric's madness, which affected his father's standing. His father believed that things would blow over, but it didn't. He tried to dispel the rumors, but that didn't work either. Then one night, a group of crazed refugees from &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the manor, storming it. Haedrig escaped with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Justus\"&gt;Justus&lt;/a&gt;. Just before he was shoved out a window, he saw his father crawling up the stairs towards him with two daggers in his back and a third whipping around his throat. Haedrig would later reflect that the people hadn't necessarily considered his father a traitor. Rather, madness itself was enough to drive &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; to murder.\nScarred by his experiences, Haedrig later left Caldeum, swearing never to return.\nMira.\nAt some point after leaving Caldeum, Haedrig met his future wife, &lt;a href=\"Mira%20Eamon\"&gt;Mira&lt;/a&gt;, in a town on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. He found her locked in a cage, as a group of people were going to burn her for being a &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;. Haedrig broke her out in the middle of the night. The people didn't chase them far (in Haedrig's mind, they were just glad to see her go). At some point they passed by Caldeum. Mira wanted to stop and see the city, but Haedrig convinced her to travel on, as he had little desire to return to the city.\nAt some point they joined a &lt;a href=\"Vecin\"&gt;Vecin&lt;/a&gt; wagon train. One of the Vecin recognised Mira's talent as a &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;mystic&lt;/a&gt;, and cultivated her talent. While they traveled, the pair fell in love, and were married. At some point, Mira suggested that they head for &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Haedrig would later wonder if Mira knew what was going to happen to her, but had nonetheless brought him back home, knowing that &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; would need his aid.\nThe End of Days.\nHaedrig and Mira were at &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt; fell from the &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;s, awakening the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt;. During or prior to the event, he had taken on an apprentice. Mira helped tend to the wounded, but Haedrig noticed that she'd fallen ill. In reality, Mira had been bitten and had been infected, and was thrown in a cellar with those who were similarly infected. He was ordered to put them down, but found himself unable to do it, wondering how he could possibly kill his own wife. He was approached by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, who offered to help. He led them into the cellar, but froze. Nevertheless, The Nephalem killed the infected, including Mira.\nHaedrig was greatful for the heroes' aid. They told him that they were seeking the crown of King Leoric. He told them that it was buried with his &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Eamon\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;, whose tomb was located in the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Hollow\"&gt;Weeping Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. He also told them that if they found his apprentice, have him get back to town. They successfully returned with the crown (much to Haedrig's surprise), and informed him that they had found his apprentice, dead. He fixed the ground, but told The Nephalem that he wanted to do something more than making spades. That he wanted his life to mean something.\nHaedrig remained at the Nephalem's side, providing them with weapons and armor. Over time, he opened up about his past.\nThe Nephalem's journey brought Haedrig back to Caldeum, a return that brought Haedrig little joy. He was still in denial about his grief in regards to Mira. After the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, Haedrig could only hope that the people of the city rebuilt wisely. He'd seen the ruin that Leoric and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; had brought to Tristram after all.\nHaedrig followed The Nephalem to &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which was under siege by the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Sin\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;. Haedrig helped provide/maintain arms and armor for the soldiers stationed there as the siege continued. He told The Nephalem that when this was over, he wanted to live in a quiet town in the country, where he could work and live in peace. After Leah's death and Adria's betrayal, he fell into despair, stating that he'd believed he could make Mira's death mean something, but now, none of it mattered. After The Nephalem rescued &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; however, Haedrig's spirit recovered, stating that his wife would not have wanted him to wallow in misery, but rather, do everything he could to help them win the battle. Which The Nephalem did, defeating Diablo.\nIn-game.\nHaedrig is first encountered early in when &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; asks about the Shattered Crown.\nAfter completing a short quest, Haedrig's smithing services will become available to the player. He can salvage magical items into crafting parts, craft new weapons/armor from those parts, and be leveled up to improve his skills.\nHis services include the following:\nSalvaging is fool-proof: for every item players try to salvage, if it is of rare quality and above, they need to click a confirmation button. This can be set in Options to affect Legendary/Set items only. &lt;a href=\"Identify\"&gt;Unidentified&lt;/a&gt; items can be salvaged without wasting time to identify them first. Any &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed gems will be returned for free.\nIn Patch 2.1, three more buttons were added: \"Salvage all Normal / Magic / Rare items in inventory\". This option is unlocked at artisan level 12. Note that as of Patch 2.1.1, the \"Salvage All\" button cannot salvage an item that has been equipped, &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed or &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrified&lt;/a&gt; before.\nCrafting is not performed instantly (so one has time to cancel it without losing the materials if misclicked). Item types are sorted in alphabetical order, and players may choose to display only the items they can equip, the items they have materials for, or items that are of highest level they can currently use (discarding any lower), one for each level of quality.\nTo learn a recipe, the player must find it, then open the Blacksmith's interface and right-click the recipe. Once learned, recipes that are &lt;a href=\"Account-Bound\"&gt;Account-Bound&lt;/a&gt; will no longer drop for that account and type (as &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;al and normal, as well as &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; and Softcore characters, have separate artisans).\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Season%20Journey\"&gt;Season Journey&lt;/a&gt;, Haedrig will reward players with &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Haedrig's Gift&lt;/a&gt; for completing certain chapters early in the journey. These rewards include &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Items&lt;/a&gt; for the player's current &lt;a href=\"Class\"&gt;Class&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of patch 2.6.5, it's possible to collapse (or expand) all recipes at once."}

He became the host of &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"mortal%20realm\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs an infant, Hakan was described as a \"sweet child.\"\nBiography.\nOrigins.\nThe boy who would be called Hakan II was born in the mid-1270s. His birth, and role as future emperor of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, was noted by &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;'s demonic servants. Sensing an opportunity, Belial made his plans...\nWithin the mortal realm itself, the boy was born somewhere in Sanctuary's north, living an impoverished life. To the south, however, Kehjistan had lost its &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20I\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; conducted a series of elaborate rituals (possibly a charade for their followers) and declared that the youth was Hakan I's spiritual successor. Once the rituals were complete, the faith employed the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the boy. They dubbed him Hakan II and installed him on the throne despite his scant years. &lt;a href=\"Kohin\"&gt;Kohin&lt;/a&gt; was a servant who cared for the infant, and continued to remain at his side.\nThe Child Emperor.\nAs soon as Hakan II took the throne, Caldeum entered a decline. Hakan's reign was ineffectual \u2014 poverty worsened, tensions between the Zakarum, &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Consortium%20Council\"&gt;Trade Consortium Council&lt;/a&gt; rose, and there was apparently nothing Hakan could (or would) do to stop it. At some point, Hakan was either possessed by Belial, or impersonated by him.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, the situation had become dire. Hakan was acting increasingly paranoid. He ordered all of his staff to leave the city, and threatened to throw them off the walls if they refused to obey. At this time, the town of &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt;, and its inhabitants slaughtered. After this, Hakan sealed the city, created a new &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; to carry out the task, and left the Iron Wolves to deal with the growing refugee problem. After fighting their way through both the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and Alcarnus, The Nephalem was granted an audience with Hakan. He stated that he had been informed that The Nephalem was behind the massacre at Alcarnus, and revealed that the Imperial Guard had captured their 'spy,' &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;. He left the Guard to deal with The Nephalem as he left, stating that he detested violence.\nWhen The Nephalem went in search of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;'s remains, Emperor Hakan communicated with them via a magical projection (he would later claim that he was using a &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; ambassador's amulet) in the city's &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20of%20Caldeum\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt;. Hakan apologized for his earlier treatment, explaining that it was a necessary ruse to prevent Belial from learning that the emperor was onto him. He promised to find where Belial was hiding and deliver him to The Nephalem. He contacted them again via projection as they explored Caldeum's aqueducts. He told them that he hadn't yet found Belial's identity, but instructed them on how to navigate their way through the aqueducts. The Nephalem was becoming skeptical of Hakan's ability to find Belial, and as they made their way through the aqueducts, &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; sensed that Belial had been there before them.\nHakan appeared to The Nephalem for a third and final time when they entered the &lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Archives of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;. He told them that he had found Belial's identity, and would lead them to him. He told them that Belial had noticed their actions and was growing nervous, but in the meantime, The Nephalem was to focus on the Black Soulstone.\nThe Nephalem confronted Hakan inside his palace after making their way through Caldeum and the fire Belial had rained down on it. When Hakan asked to see the Black Soulstone, The Nephalem said that they had figured out that Hakan himself was Belial's host. Belial let himself be known to the world and battle ensued. In the end, Belial was sealed in the soulstone.\nHakan either survived Belial's possession, or, if impersonated, was found soon afterwards. He remained emperor.\nThe Great Enmity.\nHakan remained emperor of Kehjistan during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, but watched his empire collapse due to countless wars and demonic invasions. When a plague swept across Kehjistan, he ordered Caldeum be sealed, declaring that while Kehjistan might succumb to its woes, Caldeum would not.\nIn-game.\nHakan appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", and is referenced in flavor text of the &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Hakan\"&gt;Word of Hakan&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

As a Paladin, he sought to fight evil and protect the innocent wherever they might be found. \nWhile in a forest, he found a family under attack by &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;. He slew the creatures, but not before they slew the farmer and his wife, leaving their daughter, &lt;a href=\"Bay\"&gt;Bay&lt;/a&gt;, as the only survivor. He buried Bay's parents and offered to take her to the Zakarum. She offered to show him a Zakarum cathedral not too far from from where they were. As they walked through the night, she explained that her father had had an adversarial relationship with the priests there, as he'd refused to pay them tithes for their holy works.\nThey arrived at the cathedral, and were granted entry. The &lt;a href=\"Curate%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Curate&lt;/a&gt; agreed to take Bay in and train her in the ways of the Zakarum. Bay was put off by the cathedral's grim interior, and even Hale himself was uneasy. Telling himself it was fatigue, he went to the chamber that he was given, and fell asleep. However, he awoke to the sound of Bay calling out for him. He found that his chamber door was locked from the outside, but was able to smash through the wood. Following Bay's cries, he descended into the cathedral's crypt, only to be attacked by &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. Fighting his way through them, he came across the Zakarum priests about the sacrifice Bay.\nBay fought his way through the priests, while the curate declared that he was fighting a losing battle. He revealed that Hale had in fact been serving &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Hatred (per his corruption of the Zakarum faith), and would always serve him as long as he counted himself among the Zakarum. Hale refused to believe him, and continued to cut his way through the priests. The curate however, &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed away with Bay. Hale slew the remaining priests, but it was a hollow victory. Haunted by what the curate had set, Hale set the cathedral ablaze and departed. He told himself that whatever the truth of the matter, his purpose was still clear. He would find the truth, and if Zakarum truly had fallen to evil, the church would burn as well."}

Valla grabbed Halissa and they ran to the river and hid for weeks. Memories of the massacre gave her nightmares and \"unhinged\" her mind.

Valla, who had chased after her, tried to grab her hand, but lost her grip and she was swept away in the current, raving and cursing before drowning.

It is the most played character build in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", as Hammerdins dealing 15,000 damage per hammer are not uncommon. However, it is one of the most expensive builds to successfully create, as there are so many Hammerdins out there. A Hammerdin will use his &lt;a href=\"Enigma%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Enigma Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; to teleport next to large mobs of enemy, and then hit them with multiple hammers. Many saw this build as being overpowered, and so 1.13 attempted to balance this by removing Blessed Hammer's &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"immunity\"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt; bypassing. However, this only slowed Hammerdin &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; runs a little, as people later realized that &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Bolt\"&gt;Holy Bolt&lt;/a&gt; can still damage the undead, magic immune or not, and so &lt;a href=\"Achmel%20the%20Cursed\"&gt;Achmel the Cursed&lt;/a&gt;'s boss pack did not prove to be as big a problem as was initially thought.\nSkills.\nA 'basic' Hammerdin setup looks like this:\nWith high end gear a hammerdin ends up having +20 combat skills; an alternate version is to put only 1 pt into Holy Shield and instead put the skill points into either Fire Resist or Lightning Resist to up the max resist cap from 75.\nStats.\nYou will still need dexterity to reach a 75% &lt;a href=\"Blocking\"&gt;chance to block&lt;/a&gt;, as Holy Shield increases the shield blocking rate, and does not scale directly with your character's chance to block. See below.\nFor example, a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Shield\"&gt;Royal Shield&lt;/a&gt; with 55% blocking and level 20 Holy Shield will raise the shield blocking to 80%, however, blocking is capped at 75% (25% while running). A shield with higher blocking rate will require less dexterity to reach the maximum block rate of 75% while a shield with low blocking will require significantly more dexterity to reach the cap.\nAn alternative version is to keep the base 25 strength and equip an breast plate, and either a &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Torch\"&gt;Torch&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Annihilus\"&gt;Annihilus&lt;/a&gt;) and placing more stat points into vitality instead. Though this has fallen out of favor in with the ability to reset stat points.\nItems for non-expansion.\nIt's hard to find perfect equipment in non-expansion but the preferred (or perfect) equipment for a Hammerdin in non-expansion looks like this.\n&lt;a href=\"Faster%20Hit%20Recovery\"&gt;Faster Hit Recovery&lt;/a&gt; on the Armor, Helm, Boots or Shield could be really helpful too.\nMagic find.\nA Hammerdin is useful for &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Find\"&gt;Magic Find&lt;/a&gt; runs and to run a party through all difficulties, due to its high damage output. Use &lt;a href=\"Gheed%27s%20Fortune\"&gt;Gheed's Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, 7% better chance of getting magic items &lt;a href=\"Charms\"&gt;small charms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"War%20Traveler\"&gt;War Traveler&lt;/a&gt; boots to increase your chances of getting magic items. You may insert &lt;a href=\"Ist%20Rune\"&gt;Ist&lt;/a&gt; into and a Perfect Topaz into Shako as well.\nMercenary.\nA well-equipped &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act 2&lt;/a&gt; Defensive &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; from difficulty will help, by distracting the enemy and slowing them down with its &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt; aura. Popular equipment for hammerdin's act 2 mercenary is &lt;a href=\"Fortitude%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Fortitude Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; in ethereal armor, &lt;a href=\"Insight%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Insight Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; in ethereal &lt;a href=\"Colossus%20Voulge\"&gt;Colossus Voulge&lt;/a&gt;, and ethereal &lt;a href=\"Andariel%27s%20Visage%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Andariel's Visage&lt;/a&gt; inserted with a &lt;a href=\"Ral%20Rune\"&gt;Ral Rune&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother alternative Mercenary is the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, using the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Ice Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; in a high damage &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Items\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; Bow such as a Shadow, Colossus, or Diamond, then boosting her attack speed with Andariel's Visage socketed with a Ral rune, and the &lt;a href=\"Treachery%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Treachery Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; for armor. This setup was more commonly used for &lt;a href=\"Chaosing\"&gt;Chaos Party leveling&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knight&lt;/a&gt;s casting &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;.

Consecrated by the Church, and once able to wield the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, It has since fallen into corruption and collapsed.\nLore.\nThe Hand's M.O. could be summized as such\u2014meddle in a town\u2019s affairs, settle disputes, convert new followers, burn some &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es, and then move on. Only a few of their members (mostly high ranked) knew of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Hand of Zakarum was called into service a few decades after the original march west of the &lt;a href=\"Protectors%20of%20the%20Word\"&gt;Protectors of the Word&lt;/a&gt;. During the height of this &lt;a href=\"Time%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Time of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, the Zakarum commenced a second campaign of conversion. This time, however, the inconvincible were deemed evil. The Zakarum Inquisition spread through the lands like a tempest, laying waste to all suspected of demonic possession or corruption. The Hand of Zakarum were at the forefront of this crusade, expunging &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic taint wherever they found it. The forces of Chaos actively resisted this holy scourge, often by claiming that the Paladins themselves were corrupt agents of evil. There were times when &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; managed to trick these holy warriors into killing an innocent, in the hope that it would spread doubt within the church. Occasionally, the zeal of one of these Paladins would cross the line into fanaticism, thus opening him up to evil influences. The demonic host took every chance to plant the seeds of chaos, and the forces of Light fought endlessly to weed out every hint of corruption. The Hand judged nonbelievers as corrupt, and subjected the 'heretics' to horrific interrogations and \"purification\" techniques. The Hand was given control over the &lt;a href=\"Dindai%20Flats\"&gt;Dindai Flats&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, which the church had effectively annexed. Villages were razed and locals punished for \"heresy.\"\nIn the midst of this crusade, the Hand splintered. The rebels condemned the methods of the Inquisition, proclaiming that the new &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Paladins\"&gt;Order of Paladins&lt;/a&gt; should protect the innocent, and that the evil corruption was rooted in their forebear's failure. They resolved to fight the true source of corruption, namely the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s. And so, these rebellious paladins left their Zakarum brethren and ventured west. However, the rebels were outnumbered by the loyalists, who continued to propagate the horrors of the Inquisition until the movement finally faded away.\nCorruption.\nAs Zakarum as a whole succumbed to Mephisto's corruption, so too did the Hand of Zakarum Shortly after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, the Hand collapsed. The &lt;a href=\"Templar%20Order\"&gt;Templar Order&lt;/a&gt; was born from its ashes, viewing itself as the new, pure continuation of the faith."}

Its sisters are generally called &lt;a href=\"Enchantress\"&gt;Enchantress&lt;/a&gt;es.\nHistory.\nIt was created by &lt;a href=\"the%20Prophet\"&gt;the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; (an &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; in disguise) approximately 1500 years before the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;. When Eirena and her sisters killed their &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; masters, the Prophet found them and cured the curse those &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s had bestowed upon the girls with their dying breaths. Foreseeing the dark events of the distant future, the Prophet took the girls with him, forming a sisterhood named Hand of the Prophet. He trained them in &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, augmenting the skills the sisters acquired before. It is not specified how numerous the sisterhood was, but not all of the sisters were actually siblings.\nAs no mortal man (or, in this case, woman) could survive that long, the Prophet placed the sisters in a dreamless slumber (a kind of stasis spell), with the goal of awakening ages afterwards, and aid &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Evils\"&gt;Evils&lt;/a&gt;. He chose one of the sisters, the most powerful (i.e. Eirena), asking all others if they are willing to sacrifice their lives for hers. Before he cast the spell of binding, each of them could leave without any thought of shame, yet only &lt;a href=\"Lysa\"&gt;Lysa&lt;/a&gt; did so.. The sisters apparently went into stasis at various locations.\nShortly before finding &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, the hideout has been breached. &lt;a href=\"Demons\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt; under Lysa's command killed most, if not all, sisters (except Eirena), some in combat and some in their sleep, and dragged their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;. They could not break the binding spell, however, and were forced to withdraw, leaving Eirena to wake up alone later.\nWhen Eirena awoke 1500 years later, she encountered The Nephalem. Her companion(s) accompanied her to to the &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Lair of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, where Lysa was waiting for her, using the souls of dead sisters as a bait.\nAfter defeating Lysa, Eirena decided to rebuild the sisterhood, in case &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; ever needs their help again, but instead of sleeping for centuries, they would rather pass knowledge from generation to generation."}

{"id": "4703", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4703", "title": "Hardcore", "text": "Hardcore (HC) is an optional &lt;a href=\"game%20mode\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;\"Diablo\"&lt;/a&gt; series, implemented to give an extra level of challenge to players. Most of the game plays the same, but for hardcore characters, &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; is permanent.\nGeneral Concept.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", a player may choose upon the character creation to make it a Hardcore (HC) character, the true test of the player's skills. This is an irreversible decision. In effect, the game treats Hardcore characters like mortal human beings rather than the \"semi\"-immortal non-Hardcore characters, accordingly called Softcore (SC) by Hardcore players. In this mode, a character only lives until the first &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, being \"permanently\" lost after that.\nRemember: all Hardcore characters are mortal and \"will\", sooner or later, die, the only way to prevent this is not to play them at all. Usually it happens because of a lag spike, an overly powerful monster (for example, &lt;a href=\"Multi-shot\"&gt;Multishot&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Lightning Enchanted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Fetish\"&gt;Bone Fetish&lt;/a&gt;es, or &lt;a href=\"Gloam\"&gt;Gloam&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt;), disconnection (in D3 only, as game continues for 10 more seconds after losing control). In \"Diablo II\", a set of side cheat programs were developed (such as \"MapHack\") to minimize the chances of dying, but it will eventually happen.\nUsing bots on Hardcore is also pointless, since bots are generally more prone to dying than players. It is also common among players of some communities to orchestrate deaths of HC characters who are suspected of cheating.\nCustomer Support does not restore dead Hardcore characters, no matter the cause of death; by checking the 'Hardcore' checkbox, a player accepts that their character may die with no chance of revival. This includes deaths due to account being stolen or otherwise compromised.\nDiablo I.\nHardcore Mode didn't exist in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", but its existence can be traced back to the game. &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt; originally wanted to make what would become Hardcore Mode the default state of the game, but was overruled. \nDiablo II.\nA Hardcore character is the same as a normal character except for the following:\nOther than these, there are no other differences in gameplay terms. Dead hardcore characters will even retain whatever position on the Hardcore &lt;a href=\"Ladder\"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt; they may have achieved (albeit with their names in gray) until they have been surpassed by enough other players to knock them off the Ladder. Hardcore mode is regarded by many as a more realistic playing experience.\nDevelopment.\n&lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; originally objected to the existence of Hardcore Mode in the game. Blizzard was wary of negative player feedback on the idea of permanently losing their character.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", there are following additions to this system:\nDevelopment.\nDuring development of Diablo III, there was talk of removing the Hardcore system, due to the customer service problems and costs involved. However, &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt; remained committed to including a Hardcore mode, as it didn't conflict with any of the core goals of Diablo III.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; was removed, Hardcore characters were unable to trade or purchase items for real currency: only gold transactions were allowed.\nDiablo IV.\nHardcore mode is featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Much like in previous titles, hardcore characters have no advantages over regular characters. The one exception is the inclusion of a hardcore-exclusive, very rare item, called Scroll of Escape, which allows players to escape from harm's way, consuming the item. A future patch will also include the automatic use of Scrolls of Escape during specific circumstances where the a hardcore player disconnects."}

It was surrounded by stone walls and was well fortified. It was quite lively during victory celebrations.\nHistory.\nThe Siege of Harrogath.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; led an assault on the Barbarian &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;lands&lt;/a&gt;, his intent being to enter Mount Arreat, corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, and through it, the rest of humanity. The Barbarians stood firm, but were forced to give ground and were driven back to their sacred peak. If &lt;a href=\"Caldra\"&gt;Caldra&lt;/a&gt;'s portent to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt; wasn't sign enough of the coming battle, then the black clouds of smoke to the south were. Contact with the Barbarian capital of &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; was lost, and Harrogath was all that stood between Baal and his goal. &lt;a href=\"Qual-Kehk\"&gt;Qual-Kehk&lt;/a&gt; readied his warriors, but Elder &lt;a href=\"Aust\"&gt;Aust&lt;/a&gt; proposed a different strategy\u2014to perform a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; of warding. It would be risky, but if cast successfully, it would prevent any &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; from setting foot inside Harrogath. Even Baal himself. The council was at first opposed to the action, but eventually, six of the seven members (including Aust) agreed to it. The seventh, &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt;, was unconvinced, but like the rest of the elders, he could offer no alternative. The spell was cast, but apart from Nihlathak, every council member paid the price with their life.\nDuring this period, Aust had also suggested that Harrogath request aid from neighboring kingdoms, but the people (or at least the Council) were too prideful to do so.\nAlthough the demons could not enter Harrogath, they were still able to encircle it. They were also able to seize and control the watchtowers and barricades on the slopes of Mt Arreat. In the early days of the siege, Quak-Khek's confidence bordered on arrogance. He tried, but failed to break Baal's siege lines, and lost a third of his warriors in the process. Others were wounded, others were captured. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Shenk%20the%20Overseer\"&gt;Shenk the Overseer&lt;/a&gt;, Baal's legions dominated the battlefield, and were able to bombard the defenders with their &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s. While the Barbarians had to ration food and water, and pay dearly for any medical supplies, Baal's demons feasted on the flesh and blood of their dead foes.\nLifting the Siege.\nThe tide turned with the arrival of a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of mortal heroes&lt;/a&gt;. This group had slain the demon lords &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and now, directed by the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, had come to Harrogath to finish the job with Baal. The heroes were able to destroy the demonic catapults and slay Shenk, and save Qual-Kehk's captured warriors. However, it was here that Nilathak's true colors were revealed\u2014he had exchanged the &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Relic of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; for Baal's promise that Harrogath would be spared. Such an act would allow Baal to ascend Mount Arreat unopposed by its &lt;a href=\"Ancients\"&gt;defenders&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the heroes set off in pursuit.\nBaal was defeated, but it was a hollow victory. The Worldstone had been corrupted, and Tyrael saw no other option bar its destruction. Harrogath was destroyed in the ensuing blast. Its survivors never forgave Nihalathak's actions, whom they held responsible for the loss of their home.\nIn-game.\nHarrogath appears as the town hub of \"\".\nQuests.\nThere are six quests to be completed in Harrogath:"}

The peasant is no match for the monsters and they turn towards his daughter. They don't have the chance to touch the young girl as Hale intervenes and kills them. The young girl, &lt;a href=\"Bay\"&gt;Bay&lt;/a&gt;, tells him that the goatmen never seemed to notice them before, as they hid, but this time they attacked. The story is not new to Hale as he has heard of random attacks on farmers before. Burying the parents, they set off towards a Zakarum cathedral to turn Bay over to them to raise her as the Priests of Zakarum did him. Bay tells Hale that her father wasn't a believer and that he and the priests had an argument and that he refused their protection.\nReaching the giant wooden castle-like cathedral, they are taken inside. The Paladin tells them that he is here for rest and to drop off Bay, to be raised at the cathedral. The girl is taken by one of the priests and Hale is shown to his room. His suspicions grow as he senses that something is amiss. They are confirmed as, in the middle of the night, he hears Bay scream his name. The door is locked, but that is only a slight delay as he bashes through it. Following the cries for help he reaches the cathedral's crypt. &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; attack him, but he dispatches them swiftly. Hale reaches the place where the priests have prepared to sacrifice the girl to &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;.

As he is swarmed by the rest of the priests, the &lt;a href=\"Curate%20%28Character%29\"&gt;curate&lt;/a&gt; escapes through a portal with Bay. Killing all the followers of Zakarum, Hale questions the meaning of his life. Was it spent in lie, in the service of evil, of Mephisto? No. His purpose is still clear, he will fight evil and fight to find out the truth. The cathedral \"\"is a place of evil -- and for that it must burn\" and \"if the Zakarum faith is truly a work of evil... then it shall burn as well.\"\""}

Furthermore, with the &lt;a href=\"Archery\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; passive, dual-wielding &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Crossbows\"&gt;Hand Crossbows&lt;/a&gt; increases Hatred regeneration by +1 per second. The &lt;a href=\"Templar\"&gt;Templar&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can add +1 Hatred per second, as can the &lt;a href=\"Companion\"&gt;Bat Companion&lt;/a&gt; (the Bat can also restore 50 Hatred at once). Primary skills (as well as &lt;a href=\"Chakram\"&gt;Chakram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Arrow\"&gt;Elemental Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, in certain cases), generate 4\u20137 Hatred per damage-causing attack; this is increased by +2 by the two-piece bonus of the &lt;a href=\"Unhallowed%20Essence\"&gt;Unhallowed Essence&lt;/a&gt; set. The Punishment rune of &lt;a href=\"Preparation\"&gt;Preparation&lt;/a&gt; adds 75 Hatred instantly.\n&lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; levels can grant +25 to maximum Hatred (+0.5 per point). The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Vengeance\"&gt;Blood Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; passive adds another +25 maximum Hatred.\nDiscipline (Blue).\nDemon Hunters start with a base maximum of 30 Discipline, which returns at the rate of 1 point per second. Currently, there are no ways to increase Discipline regeneration, though many skills allow generating it from hits and &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s. However, Demon Hunters may gain up to +36 maximum Discipline from items (+46 with &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; items, namely bows, quivers, and some rings, most giving +9-12 discipline), and +20 from &lt;a href=\"Preparation\"&gt;Preparation&lt;/a&gt; (Invigoration rune), which is also a primary way of mid-combat Discipline recovery. &lt;a href=\"Perfectionist\"&gt;Perfectionist&lt;/a&gt; skill also reduces cost of Discipline skills by 10%, rounding down. &lt;a href=\"Bolas\"&gt;Bitter Pill&lt;/a&gt; rune choice allows some chance on hit to regain 2 Discipline. Maintaining Discipline is especially important for the &lt;a href=\"Unhallowed%20Essence\"&gt;Unhallowed Essence&lt;/a&gt; set, as the 6-piece damage bonus is proportional to Discipline. To ease its generation, this set also grants 1 point of Discipline for each cast of a Hatred generator."}

Haunt ignores line of sight, intervening enemies and most obstacles, but cannot phase through solid walls. If Haunt kills its target, it will pass the remaining duration to another random enemy within 70 yards, but only if that enemy is not affected by Haunt yet.\nHaunt does damage to whatever enemy it possesses, either until the duration ends or the enemy dies (the Witch Doctor's death stops it as well). Note that an enemy can only be affected by one Haunt at a time, but multiple enemies may be haunted at once. It may not score &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s, but the &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Over%20Time\"&gt;Damage Over Time&lt;/a&gt; increases proportionally to the Critical Hit Chance / Damage ratio. Unlike most &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Over%20Time\"&gt;Damage Over Time&lt;/a&gt; effects, Haunt has a &lt;a href=\"Proc%20Coefficient\"&gt;Proc Coefficient&lt;/a&gt; of 1.\nJumping to another enemy does not refresh the duration: it is therefore not possible to kill a horde of enemies with a single unmodified Haunt. In addition, corpses of enemies killed by Haunt are &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Enemies%20Rest%20In%20Pieces\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt;.

Healing is the opposite of dealing &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. Healing complements other defenses as well as reducing the need to maintain as high defense. Healing usually takes time or cannot be used too rapidly, so attacks that don't kill a character instantly may still overcome them if the damage rate is greater than the healing rate.\nUnlike most RPG's, there aren't many ways in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo series&lt;/a&gt; of directly healing other characters. While the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; each have pretty effective ways of healing themselves and other party members, other classes will have to find other ways to heal themselves if these classes aren't available.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt; has an \"effectiveness stat\" called &lt;a href=\"Recovery\"&gt;Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, formerly called Healing.

Like Toughness, this is measured not simply by raw Life points, but is adjusted by the protection from &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt;, and other defenses - the more difficult it is to lose any amount of life, the more impactful it is to heal that amount of life.\nThere are numerous methods of healing, and almost all of them can contribute to a character's health at the same time.\n&lt;a href=\"Life%20Steal\"&gt;Life Steal&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Life%20per%20Hit\"&gt;Life per Hit&lt;/a&gt; / Life Leech.\nThis refers to attacking with a weapon or skill that causes damage done to also leech Life from the enemy, healing the attacker.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"curse\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; gives this bonus to anybody attacking the affected monster or player. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Golem\"&gt;Blood Golem&lt;/a&gt; has a very powerful built-in Life Leech that also heals the Necromancer, as well as the golem, for a small amount of life for each successful attack made by the golem. These two effects \"do\" stack, so combining them can be quite potent if one decides to specialize in the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Golem\"&gt;Blood Golem&lt;/a&gt;, since the Life Leech via the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Golem\"&gt;Blood Golem&lt;/a&gt; scales with the amount of skill points invested.\nIn \"Diablo III\", the two effects are different:\n&lt;a href=\"Simplicity%27s%20Strength\"&gt;Simplicity's Strength&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gem\"&gt;Legendary Gem&lt;/a&gt; with a hefty bonus to Life per Hit.\nLife per Kill.\nFor every enemy killed or assisted, regardless of how tough that enemy was, restores a fixed amount of Life to the killer.

In general:\nThe class bonuses above do not apply to Full Potions, because they restore a hero to 100%, regardless of circumstances.\nIt should also be known that unlike the rest of the series, the effects of lesser potions are a randomized percentage of a hero's maximum Life/Mana, instead of a set amount.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" Healing Potions have 5 levels with each one restoring more hit points than the previous. The healing effects of the potions are not instantaneous. It takes around 5 seconds for them to fully &lt;a href=\"heal\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; their specific amount of hit points. The amount they heal is spread evenly over time.\nHealing Potions are one of the most common items found in the game. They can also be bought from any town's magical item vendor.\nHealing Potions replenish different amounts of hit points depending on which class is using it \"(see table below)\".

After the formula works out as it is listed, he stands virtually a 2/3 chance of getting an \"upgraded\" healing from Health Potions. While this does not necessarily make them more favorable over Rejuvenation Potions, it does offer a bit of longevity, as a Super Healing Potion would heal the Barbarian for almost his full HP capacity over 5 seconds.\nHoradric Cube.\nPrior to Patch 1.10, Healing Potions, like &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;, could be combined in threes to upgrade them to the next higher level potion.\nThree Minor Healing Potions, along with three Minor &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Potions\"&gt;Mana Potions&lt;/a&gt; and a chipped &lt;a href=\"Gem\"&gt;Gem&lt;/a&gt;, could be transmuted to a &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation%20Potion\"&gt;Rejuvenation Potion&lt;/a&gt;.

Each potion use restores 60% of the character's maximum &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; instantly with no difference between character classes. \"Diablo III\" also introduced &lt;a href=\"Health%20Globes\"&gt;Health Globes&lt;/a&gt; which \"drop\" from slain enemies (or at certain life thresholds on bosses), and can restore a larger amount of health in a short period like previous potions could, but cannot be picked up or stockpiled.\nCharacters can also obtain Legendary potions like other &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt;. Legendary potions are \"bottomless\" (unlimited in use), and all share the same cooldown with the regular potion. These potions heal the same amount as the default one, but grant an additional benefit on each use, which varies by unique Legendary power. Since they are strictly better upgrades to regular potions, they are not used separately, and simply replace its functionality. They are not used from the inventory; instead one can be \"equipped\" to the button used for the regular potion. Once one is equipped, it no longer takes up an inventory slot, but can be unequipped or replaced later, and is saved in the &lt;a href=\"Armory\"&gt;Armory&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nHealth Potions before version 2.0 were more similar to those in \"Diablo II\", with collectible, one-use potion items which healed players for a set amount depending on its tier, each of which had a level requirement. These potions were somewhat weak by themselves compared to the content a hero may face, but were supplemented by &lt;a href=\"Health%20Globe\"&gt;Health Globe&lt;/a&gt;s, and items with the &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt; 'Health Globes/Potions heal +x Life' could make them more useful.\nPatch 2.0 eliminated regular potion tiers, replacing them with a single collectible item, and introduced Legendary potions, which were all bottomless. These regular potions were picked up automatically (a lot like &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;), since all were equally good. This pickup could not be disabled, even after finding a Legendary potion which removed the need to collect them. In patch 2.2.0, after criticism from the community, the quantity-limited healing potions were removed altogether and replaced with the repeatable-use potion each character starts with by default.\nDiablo IV.\nHealing Potions return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". They have their own inventory slot. The player character can carry up to 5 potions on them at a time, though this number can be increased through gaining &lt;a href=\"renown\"&gt;renown&lt;/a&gt;. There's no cooldown after using a potion, and the player gains refills by slaying enemies or bringing a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; down to certain thresholds of their health. This is similar to the health globe mechanic from \"Diablo III\", but the potions are stored rather than used immediately (or not stored/used at all if the player is at full health).\nHealing Potions can be upgraded by talking to &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally, players were able to store up to 50 potions at a time."}

Many of its design elements may have carried over from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Diablo II\":\nEaster eggs and references.\nBoth franchises contain often-humorous references to each others' lore and game content.\nIn Warcraft games:\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\":\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\""}

There is a lot of variety in this tree, ranging from attack skills to aura-like bonuses to corpse skills. There are actually seven Warcries in the skill tree, the other three are corpse skills, grouped in here by default.\nWarcries are cast with a right click, and are a sort of spell. When casting them the Barbarian throws his arms up and his head back and howls. The warcry is shown as a nova of brightly-colored light moving out from the Barbarian in an expanding ring. All warcries have a distinctive graphic, but the sound the Barbarian makes is a random one each time. The Warcries all have different ranges, with the beneficial aura-like ones generally going nearly full screen, while the attack Warcries that hurt monsters have much less range, usually just a few &lt;a href=\"yards\"&gt;yards&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther characters and minions must be in range of the Warcry when it is cast. Walls and other solid obstacles block Warcries for anything behind them. Duration of the buff depends on the amount of skill points in the skill. Beneficial Warcries can be refreshed before they expire.\nThe three corpse skills are very useful as well. &lt;a href=\"Find%20Item\"&gt;Find Item&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most powerful skills in the game, in terms of finding good equipment, and &lt;a href=\"Find%20Potion\"&gt;Find Potion&lt;/a&gt; can be very helpful also, for the more patient Barbarian. &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Ward\"&gt;Grim Ward&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is used to keep enemies away from an area, useful if a Barbarian needs space to escape dangerous situations."}

For a melee class with low damage, &lt;a href=\"Griswold%27s%20Edge%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Griswold's Edge&lt;/a&gt; can help by inflicting &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; upon the Warlord of Blood.

By collecting the essence of the ambient heat in the surrounding air, she can convert this energy into the mystical force that powers her spells. In this way, she recovers more quickly from her magical exertions. \"\nGeneral Information.\nWarmth is one of &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;'s best non-damaging skills and may very well be one of the most important passive skills for her. This skill increases the regeneration rate of the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;'s mana pool, allowing her to cast spells with less worry for mana conservation.\nExactly how many points should go into Warmth is debatable. While maxing out warmth greatly helps with mana regeneration, sorceresses can often survive simply with &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Potions\"&gt;Mana Potions&lt;/a&gt;, and spare the points for other skills. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Sorceress\"&gt;Blizzard Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"Meteorb%20Sorceress\"&gt;Meteorb Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es may agree with this latter philosophy, since a majority of their points go to synergizing skills, and can't be wasted on Warmth.\nGenerally, at least one point in Warmth is beneficial: investing one point into Warmth allows it to take advantage of + skills from equipment.\nAlthough nothing synergizes with Warmth, Warmth does synergize with other abilities, most notably and &lt;a href=\"Enchant\"&gt;Enchant&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, an &lt;a href=\"Enchantress\"&gt;Enchantress&lt;/a&gt; would certainly wish to max out Warmth, as would a Sorceress that wishes to have a powerful Inferno.\nA high-level Warmth essentially is the same as a &lt;a href=\"Meditation\"&gt;Meditation&lt;/a&gt; aura; although the two can stack, if a sorceress has a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; in the party willing to use Meditation, or the Rune Word, it may be redundant."}

Spell Levels only decrease Mana cost.\nIt is mostly used as a method of escape, as stairs in general tend to be in large, empty rooms with nothing dangerous in them, although it can also be used for covering ground in a short time after clearing a floor. Still, it is best to make sure the player is closest to the intended exit or entrance to avoid being transported into unexplored area. \nA more useful spell than &lt;a href=\"Phasing\"&gt;Phasing&lt;/a&gt;, it is cast instantly, and can be used to travel blind in order to skip half of the entire level (if, for whatever reason, player wishes to do so).\nLore.\n\"In ancient times the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; built many magical gateways, and though the secret of their construction is long lost, many uses and manipulations of these portals have evolved over the centuries. Akin to the spell of &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; is the spell of Warp, though far less versatile as a means of exact &lt;a href=\"teleportation\"&gt;teleportation&lt;/a&gt; between two specific destinations. Rather, Warp sends the caster on a one way trip to the nearest exit from a place. Immediately thereafter, the portal is closed and dissipated, leaving the traveler with only conventional means with which to return to the point of casting. Limited as a means of travel, this spell can, however, prove to be extremely useful in finding an exit when the caster is lost or besieged in a dark and dangerous place such as a dungeon or cave. Unfortunately, the forces drawn upon by the Warp spell make no distinction between types of exits, since they merely focus their energies on the nearest at hand. As often as not, the caster is sent to an exit downward, which almost always leads to even greater perils.\""}

Ranging from crusading &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s to unscrupulous &lt;a href=\"mercenaries\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;, Warriors can be found wherever there is conflict amongst their countrymen. Many of these adventuresome men joined with &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;'s army and went to battle against the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. As the fires of war burned themselves out, these Warriors returned home to find their kingdom in shattered chaos and disarray.\nDark rumors of the mysterious demise of King Leoric abounded and the evil that lurked within his &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; drew many Warriors to Khanduras seeking fortune and glory. Though they were warned by the people of Tristram, a few of these brave souls ventured into the chaotic labyrinth beneath the old &lt;a href=\"Diablo_I_Walkthrough%23The_Cathedral.2FDungeon\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; - never to be heard from again. Whether they were driven by valor, honor, madness or greed, new Warriors arrived in Tristram every day, ready to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;dark unknown&lt;/a&gt; that awaited them beneath the earth.\nOther Warriors.\nWarriors served the city of &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt; before its destruction.\nAn order of honor-bound Warriors once roamed the far east of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s are regarded as a type of warrior.\nWarriors exist in &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; societies.\nIn-game.\nWarriors are arguably the strongest character class in \"Diablo I\". They can wield &lt;a href=\"Swords\"&gt;Swords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Axes\"&gt;Axes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Maces\"&gt;Maces&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0and swing them at fast speed with ease. These &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; are either &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt;. Two-handed weapons are more useful in the beginning, but at later levels, players reach a &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; cap which causes &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; to increase at a relatively slower rate. In these later levels, the warrior has similar life to their earlier levels, but the &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; do much more &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. This necessitates the use of a &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Their amazing &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; allows them to equip even the heaviest of all\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al abilities are limited. With the lowest maximum &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Attribute%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; of\u00a0 and less &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; per level than the other classes, they are forced to only use support &lt;a href=\"Spellbook\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Curse\"&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/a&gt; and . With their low mana, these support spells can be used only sparingly. Since their low level attack spells cannot effectively damage high-level monsters, attack spells like &lt;a href=\"Firebolt\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charged%20Bolt%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Charged Bolt&lt;/a&gt; are not an option. &lt;a href=\"Advocate\"&gt;Advocate&lt;/a&gt;s, which can teleport away from the player(s), and the &lt;a href=\"Succubi\"&gt;Succubi&lt;/a&gt;, which upon close contact, flee at the exact same pace as the player character(s) walks, are for that very reason especially difficult. Following them might result in aggravating more enemies to attack the player(s). Although the modification which gives less &lt;a href=\"Light%20Radius\"&gt;Light Radius&lt;/a&gt; is intended to be a curse, it proves very beneficial to warriors nonetheless. If one chooses to go with a lower light radius, the Warrior will aggravate fewer monsters.\nRepair Skill.\nThe Warrior's &lt;a href=\"Item%20Repair\"&gt;Item Repair Skill&lt;/a&gt; restores an &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;'s durability, but at the same time decreases its maximum durability. This can be used to get more use out of broken &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; nonetheless. However, one is advised to repair valuable/end-game equipment at &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold the Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nIn the original design document for \"Diablo\", a class called the \"fighter\" was conceptualized.

He was often attacked by bandits and outlaws, but never when he had a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; accompanying him. Warriv had great gratitude for the service of their &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; as a result. During his visits to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, he met &lt;a href=\"Meshif\"&gt;Meshif&lt;/a&gt;, a ship captain. Warriv enjoyed listening to his stories about the strange lands of the east.\nDark Wanderings.\nWarriv was present in Khanduras when the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; began traveling eastward. Shortly after he passed the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Monestary\"&gt;Rogue Monestary&lt;/a&gt;, strange creatures began ravaging the countryside, and the monastery itself was overrun. He set up shop in the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;, while he waited for the eastward pass to re-open, so he could travel to Lut Gholein.\nSuch a thing was accomplished by a group of heroes, whom Warriv greeted at the camp. They slew &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, and with her death, the path to the east opened. Warriv took them along with his caravan as they traveled east, along with the scholar &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, whom Warriv considered to be a madman.\nThe group arrived in Lut Gholein after a dangerous journey across the desert. Warriv was shocked at the state of the port-city, noting the presence of mercenaries. He decided that once he made some trades, he would return and give equipment to the Sisterhood. He offered the heroes the chance to return with him if they so desired. As the case was however, they were forced to keep traveling east, as the Dark Wanderer had beaten them to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tomb of Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; and was traveling eastward with &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. Warriv suspected that they were headed for &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, and was confident the heroes would succeed.\nWarriv's End.\nThe following decades were not kind on Warriv, as he suffered numerous failures and tragedies. After twenty years, he returned to Khanduras, wondering if Cain hadn't been the madman he thought, and if he could banish the shadow that dwelt over him. He did not live long enough to find out, as he was killed outside &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nWarriv is the first character encountered at the start of a new game in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". He greets the player and explains the current state of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, he invites the heroes who slew her to join his caravan and travel on to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Pass\"&gt;Rogue Pass&lt;/a&gt;. His outfit changes between acts\u2014the only NPC in the game where this occurs.\nDialogue.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Warriv/Dialogue\"&gt;Warriv/Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;\"\nDiablo III.\nAlthough this does not happen in every game, his corpse can sometimes be found in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". It will be located among the remains of his caravan a short way up &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tristram%20Road\"&gt;Old Tristram Road&lt;/a&gt; out of town, and can be looted to find his &lt;a href=\"Warriv%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nWarriv was a dour adage-sayer, and a large man with a stern demeanor. He was skeptical of rumors of treasure. Still, he always had a smile for those who visited the Rogue Encampment.\nTrivia.\nWarriv and the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; are both voiced by , who is also known for his roles as &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Awow%3AKel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Awow%3AUther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" series."}

Solidifying all of the tiles is not required and brings no real benefit, but can be done even after the event is complete; Destroyers still dive and attack in this case."}

They can be used to travel quickly between various areas.\nLore.\nWaypoints are &lt;a href=\"arcane%20magic\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; circles of &lt;a href=\"teleportation\"&gt;teleportation&lt;/a&gt; etched into the ground. They were created by the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, who devised the Waypoints to provide instant transport from one place to another. The &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s at work have long since been forgotten, as the original Horadrim have all but disappeared. However, these Waypoints remain as a legacy to the Horadrim's once-great power, and the value of these devices cannot be denied.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nWaypoints make their debut in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". The Waypoint system featured here, at first, is nothing more than the towns for each Act. As players fight against the minions of Hell, it is advised to click on Waypoints upon finding them to add their location to the Waypoint menu. The Waypoint destinations in gray text are ones that a player has not yet discovered and activated. A player can jump to any Waypoint shown in blue text by clicking on its button in the Waypoint Menu. A player may also access Waypoints from other &lt;a href=\"Acts\"&gt;Acts&lt;/a&gt; by using the Act Tab in this menu. Since Waypoints are saved with a player's character between games, they are a quick way to bypass areas one has already explored.\nParty members do not share Waypoints with each other; however, players can help transport other players to a Waypoint's location by opening a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Players who haven't activated that Waypoint location can now use this Town Portal to reach the undiscovered Waypoint. Once there, they can activate the Waypoint and add it to their own Waypoint lists.\nWhen a player uses a Waypoint to switch between &lt;a href=\"Acts\"&gt;Acts&lt;/a&gt;, it is best to go first to the main town of the Act to which they are traveling. This way, they can safely load the Act in town, where they cannot be attacked. From there, they can use the Waypoint to go to other Waypoints in the Act.\nDiablo Immortal.\nWaypoints appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". They share many features with their counterparts in Diablo II and Diablo III. Players can only travel to waypoints that have been visited before.\nDiablo III.\nThe Waypoint system returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", and for the most part, works much like it did in the previous game. As &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; journeys forth to battle the minions of Hell, they will come across several waypoints. Moving near the waypoints will add them to the hero's Waypoint list. They can then return to the area at their heart's desire.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; portion of the game, any waypoints that are missed will still be added as the storyline progresses. However, once the current Act has been completed, the Nephalem may not return to that Act without progressing backwards in the storyline. At that point, the waypoints are, for all intents and purposes, considered as disabled.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, all of the waypoints for each Act of the game are immediately unlocked, to serve as the main method of reaching the several &lt;a href=\"Bounties\"&gt;Bounties&lt;/a&gt; that are in place. Some waypoints have been relocated; for example, there is no waypoint in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Araneae\"&gt;Caverns of Araneae&lt;/a&gt; in the campaign portion of the game, but there is in Adventure Mode. All Waypoints that are right before the &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; fights, with the sole exception of the &lt;a href=\"Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Archives of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, are also removed.\nAs of patch 2.0, the Nephalem has a choice that they can make regarding the need to reach any location. They can reach the desired point by clicking that location on the map. This will teleport the character there as if they were using a Town Portal. However, if they are not in town, they will need a short casting time that works much like trying to cast a Town Portal. On the other hand, they can manually activate the waypoint if it is nearby, and reach their destination faster than they would have going by the other method.\nDiablo IV.\nWaypoints return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Each waypoint discovers grants the player &lt;a href=\"renown\"&gt;renown&lt;/a&gt;."}

Weapons also vary by &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;, and in their many possible magical &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;properties&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s may require a specific item type to be equipped. While some &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;character classes&lt;/a&gt; focus on damaging capabilities, other seek the &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; bonuses of the enchanted tools of death.\nCategories.\nWeapons come in the following categories, also known as classes:\nDiablo II.\nThere are wide differences in how the various &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;second game&lt;/a&gt; use weapons. &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s, s and &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s generally are designed to use weapons against their foes, although even some of these do have &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s more focused on spells not influenced by weapon damage. s and &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es are generally summoners and spellcasters and care little about a weapon's direct damage capability. s are also summoners and spellcasters, but their weapons affect their power when in shapeshifted forms.\nWith all characters however, the magical &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt;es on their weapons are hugely influential. Some weapons and powers that appear on them are focused on their direct combat capabilities, while others are designed to support magic users. Many powerful &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Weapons\"&gt;Unique Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and weapon &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt; are sought after by all types of characters and their &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;third game&lt;/a&gt; reinvented the relationship between weapons and &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s. The damage dealt by almost all offensive skills, including those of the \"spell-based\" classes, is measured as a percentage of total weapon damage, and the speed of physical attacks \"or\" casting or channeling spells is based on weapon attack speed. Thus, weapons with high attack statistics are important for every class.\nWeapon damage is stated on its in-game tooltip as Damage Per Second, along with the \"total\" damage per attack and attack speed of the weapon. These numbers include the bonuses from +flat Damage, +percentage Damage, and Attack Speed magical affixes on the weapon, but not the ones on other items. \"Every\" character stat that affects weapon damage output is combined and summarized simply as Damage on the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt;, and it is this number that goes into a skill's damage calculation, stated like \"200% weapon damage &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;as Fire&lt;/a&gt;\" or similar.\nDevelopment.\nCompared to the previous game, \"Diablo III\" removed Javelins and Throwing Weapons, and made Spears one-handed only. They also replaced Scepters with &lt;a href=\"Flails\"&gt;Flails&lt;/a&gt;, Katars with &lt;a href=\"Fist%20Weapons\"&gt;Fist Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, Orb weapons with orb-like Wizard &lt;a href=\"Sources\"&gt;Sources&lt;/a&gt; held in the &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt;, and replaced the other class-specific types with new types for the new classes.\nWeapons along with almost every other item were reworked significantly as part of the &lt;a href=\"Loot%202.0\"&gt;Loot 2.0&lt;/a&gt; concept implemented in the &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0.1%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;pre-expansion update&lt;/a&gt;, with many possible Magic Properties added, removed, and standardized.\nMagic properties.\nUnder the Loot 2.0 system, the possible Magic Properties that can appear randomly on weapons are:\nThe Primary Magic Property which adds a flat amount of damage to a weapon's total becomes universal at higher levels. At maximum level, particularly in the \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, the added damage massively outweighs the \"base\" damage without this addition. This damage bonus can be &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;\"re-rolled\"&lt;/a&gt; to any Primary Magic Property at the Mystic, but it is only wise to do this to try to get an even higher added damage number or a different element, never to replace it with a different property entirely. When crafting items at the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, only the base damage and base Damage Per Second is shown on the recipe page, which drastically understates the power of the actual finished item.\nThis kind of added damage is commonly known as &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; because it can be of any of the 7 element types. Physical added damage is stated as simply \"+X-Y damage\", whereas the others specify the element; &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt; weapon tooltips also receive an element-specific background effect. Most interactions with elements are based only on the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Rune\"&gt;Skill Rune&lt;/a&gt;, but a few look at the added damage type as well."}

Its lowlands are quite fertile, and are the envy of the Western Kingdoms. The lowlands were originally the heart of the land before the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous rain-drenched ports exist along the coast. A trip by sea from Westmarch to Kehjistan takes weeks.\nCulture.\nWestmarch is a kingdom that thrives on commerce and maritime trade. It operates as a monarchy, with the monarch being supported by noble houses, and beneath the nobility are the commoners. Spats between nobles were common.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; were the kingdom's original dynasty, who were succeeded by the &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20Dynasty\"&gt;Justinian Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. While founded in the name of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, faith has waned of late, and Westmarch is now a forward-looking civilization. In the opinion of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, Westmarch (at least prior to the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;) was one of the healthiest, most vibrant kingdoms left in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. At least some people in Westmarch believe in gods.\nWestmarch possesses a \"zealous\" army, and is protected by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Both are under the command of General &lt;a href=\"Torion\"&gt;Torion&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the kingdom's army is organized along feudal lines; marshalled forces that are loyal to various lords, who 'lend' them to the crown as a sign of trust. It also possesses a &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Royal%20Navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Royal &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s\" were employed by its court. \nWolf imagery is common in the kingdom; this stems back to the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, who used a wolf as their sigil. Even after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Rakkis%20Dynasty\"&gt;Rakkis Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the comining of the &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20Dynasty\"&gt;Justinians&lt;/a&gt; (who used the bear as their sigil), wolf iconography remained common.\nThe people of Westmarch are considered to be a \"proud\" people (at least in the mind of &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;Zayl&lt;/a&gt;)\u2014most of them are suspicious of the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;. Its society can be divided between the commoners and nobility. Capital punishment is enacted via hanging. Theater is part of Westmarch culture, and &lt;a href=\"Waltz%20Macabre\"&gt;Waltz Macabre&lt;/a&gt; was a fashion for its nobles. &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; and copper serve as currency. Before the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, including the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;, were known to the people of Westmarch, but only through folklore. Mostly, they were used as tales to frighten children. The people of Westmarch believe that children born during a storm carry its fierceness in their voices, and its chaos in their hearts.\nWestmarch maintained orphanages, though in the opinion of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, they were \"little better than slave camps.\" Hanging is a common form of execution.\nFestivals celebrated in Westmarch included &lt;a href=\"the%20Festival%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;the Festival of Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brumaltine\"&gt;Brumaltine&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nIn what would be called the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Gulf of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; resided nine warring clans, residing along its southern edge. They arrived prior to the events of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. During this period were cultists who worshiped the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Astrogha\"&gt;Astrogha&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt; made their way to Westmarch over 1000 years before &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; made his way into the land. Some of their &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s resided in the port city of &lt;a href=\"Ransim\"&gt;Ransim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Creation of Westmarch.\nThis state of affairs came to an end in the 11th century, with the coming of &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;. Rakkis, tasked with bringing the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith to the West, knew that moving against the clans in force would unify them into a combined front. Instead, he lived among them, learning their language and culture. All the while, he subtly spread the Zakarum faith to anyone who would listen. Through an arranged marriage, Rakkis bound himself by blood to the &lt;a href=\"Ortal%20Clan\"&gt;Ortal Clan&lt;/a&gt;, which was the third largest in the region. Using this standing as leverage, he brought four of the lesser clans under his banner.\nAllegiances secured, Rakkis launched his combined forces against the &lt;a href=\"Hathlan%20Clan\"&gt;Hathlan Clan&lt;/a&gt;, the largest and most hostile tribe in the region. The battles that followed were bloody, and the stench of decaying corpses were carried along the winds as far as Khanduras. However, at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dyre%20River\"&gt;Battle of Dyre River&lt;/a&gt;, Rakkis's forces dismantled the remnants of the Hathlan and slew the clan's leader. The Hathlan, in addition to the clans that had abstained from taking sides, submitted themselves to Rakkis's rule, declaring him to be their one true king.\nIn honor of Rakkis's crusade, Rakkis named the territory \"Westmarch,\" so named as it marked the westernmost point of his conquest. He rallied his subjects to the faith of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sons of Rakkis also rooted out Astrogha's followers.\nA New Kingdom.\nThe subsequent years saw Westmarch flourish. New roads, cities, churches, and infrastructure sprung up throughout the land, and due to plentiful access to the sea, the nation quickly became a formidable naval and mercantile power. Rakkis ruled with a strong but fair hand, and gained the admiration of his people. However, the Zakarum Church maintained a large amount of influence within the country, even as rulers came to the throne that were more interested in power than faith. It was a state of affairs that would last well into the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;13th century&lt;/a&gt;. Still, Zakarum was able to operate under its own law within its churches inside the country.\nYears after founding the nation, Rakkis launched further incursions against the s to the north, but failed to make any true gains. Additionally, Westmarch and &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; had a strained relationship, as Westmarch was much wealthier than its neighboring kingdom. Bandits from Khanduras repeatedly raided Westmarch, and it was possible that Khanduras's coffers were fueled in part by these ill-gotten gains.\nRakkis was succeeded by his son, &lt;a href=\"Korsikk\"&gt;Korsikk&lt;/a&gt;, who continued his father's rule and turned Westmarch into a bastion of the Zakarum faith. He continued his father's wars against the northern tribes by constructing &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. After years of military disasters, the frustrated king led a large army out of the fortress and into the north to conquer the Barbarians once and for all. None of them returned. Bastion's Keep itself remained manned however, standing vigilant against any tribal incursion.\n&lt;a href=\"Korelan\"&gt;Korelan&lt;/a&gt;, grandson of Rakkis, would be the last of the original line of kings, for when he died, he left behind no heirs. The crown passed to &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20I\"&gt;Justinian I&lt;/a&gt;, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20Dynasty\"&gt;Justinian Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, through \"a somewhat convoluted interpretation of Zakarum scripture.\" Seen as usurpers by many, the Justinians suffered nearly constant challenges to their rule.\nThe Return of Zakarum.\nIn the 12th century, Khanduras was settled by Eastern pilgrims. Westmarch proved to be a strong ally, and the two regions engaged in trade. However, brigands based in Khanduras often crossed the border into Westmarch for plunder. During this time, Westmarch priests preached the Zakarum faith in Khanduras, regardless of whether their dogma was wanted or not. It is known that Westmarch launched some crusades in this century.\nAs part of the Zakarum Reformation, the kingdom received missionaries from &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-12th century. In the mid-12th century, turning the &lt;a href=\"Time%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Time of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Paladins\"&gt;Order of Paladins&lt;/a&gt; pledged their allegiance to Westmarch, distancing themselves from the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;Hand of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivil War.\nDuring the reign of &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20III\"&gt;Justinian III&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Cartolus%20Insurrection\"&gt;insurrection&lt;/a&gt; broke out in the outlying region of &lt;a href=\"Cartolus\"&gt;Cartolus&lt;/a&gt;. Led by a woman known only as &lt;a href=\"Tyrra\"&gt;Tyrra&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed to be descended from the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, Westmarch was consumed by civil war. While the rebels managed to gain control of the capital, Tyrra succumbed to plague. Seizing the opportunity, &lt;a href=\"Cornelius\"&gt;Cornelius&lt;/a&gt; was able to crush the insurrection and become the new king.\nWar, and a New King.\nThe peace between Westmarch and Khanduras was shattered when &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt; of Khanduras (under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;) declared war against Westmarch, sending his army against the western kingdom. Westmarch had the advantage of numbers and defensive positions however, and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20of%20Khanduras\"&gt;Royal Army of Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; was easily repelled. At around the same time, King &lt;a href=\"Cornelius\"&gt;Cornelius&lt;/a&gt; pulled the country's navy back into port, spooked by the sighting of a demon at &lt;a href=\"Tauruk%27s%20Port\"&gt;Tauruk's Port&lt;/a&gt;. Dissent grew among cities that had previously relied on the navy for protection, pirates grew bolder, and northern cities no longer curried as much favor with the kingdom.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;Two years&lt;/a&gt; after the war, &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt; came to power. Subsequently, with the revelations of the &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt; that had plagued Zakarum, it completely eroded any influence the church had over civil affairs within the country. Faith in the church diminished within the populace as well.\nAge of the Wolf.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270s&lt;/a&gt;, Westmarch experienced a golden age; the so-called \"Age of the Wolf.\" It attempted to open up trade with the merchants of the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt;, but the creatures prowling the region (such as the &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt;) made this impossible. It offered &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; to clear them out, but adventurers in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; refused to take bounties that would take them to the region. Tension remained between King &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt; and the nobility, who threatened to withdraw their support for him if he did not keep the peasants in their place.\nIn 1270, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; Westmarch, wrecking havoc across the kingdom. Eventually, only the capital stood against Skarn's forces.\nThe Reapers.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Westmarch citizens were abducted by &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s as part of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to gauge the defenses of Sanctuary. The kingdom was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; shortly afterwards. Its capital was successfully defended however (albeit with heavy losses, including its king, at the hands of traitors), and &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; was/were able to defeat the fallen &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nWestmarch is the main setting for &lt;a href=\"Act%20V%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

It was located near mountains and forest, the latter being found northeast of the city\nWestmarch was so named as it marked the westernmost point of &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;'s crusade into the West. It had sprawling streets with gutters thick with sludge and refuse, and Gothic architecture. It served as the berth of the country's &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city of Westmarch was surrounded by stone walls, lined with archers and lookouts. Its ramparts and buildings were much taller than &lt;a href=\"Bramwell\"&gt;Bramwell&lt;/a&gt;. The city possessed at least three gates\u2014&lt;a href=\"the%20Wolf%20Gate\"&gt;the Wolf Gate&lt;/a&gt;, located at the city's southeast, gates situated at the city's west, and a gate that faced northeast towards the nearby forest. The city's geography involved a rise as one moved inwards towards the city center, as it was built on hills. As one moved into the city, the buildings grew more ornate. The city's roads were paved with cobblestones, with straw scattered along them to soak up mule droppings and urine. \nIn its heyday, Westmarch was always bustling with activities as people came from all over the world to marvel at its sights and landmarks. It was home to a number of churches, museums, and art galleries.\nMuch of Westmarch's trade came in through its piers. Here, a rivalry existed between longshoremen and sailors. Sailors resented longshoremen for \"not having the guts to go to sea,\" while longshoremen looked down on sailors, not seeing them as a true part of the community. Ergo, those in one profession tended to keep their distance from those in the other while in taverns.\nThe city had a number of orphanages, though, according to &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, they were \"little better than slave camps.\"\nWestmarch was frequently beset by storms.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nAfter his conquest of Westmarch, &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; ordered the construction of a river-port settlement that would serve as a capital for his new kingdom, located adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Sea\"&gt;Western Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Marsh\"&gt;Blood Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. He later consecrated the city, taking the wolf \u2014 a guardian icon that would be familiar with the western clans; as his sigil, and named himself king. What would become the city's &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Palace\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; was the first building constructed, which served as Rakkis's stronghold. The &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; later constructed the outer walls of the city. Later architects would mimic this design and embellish it. In a sense, the city of Westmarch became an extension of the palace.\nBecause of Westmarch's proximity to the sea, it quickly grew into a center of martial and mercantile power. Over the next two centuries, no outside force ever laid siege to the city. As it spread outwards, as Westmarch and its harbor grew, nearly all of its buildings built by the sea were torn up and replaced with new ones. Only a few examples of its old architecture remained, as they had been shored up by expert artisans.\nThe Great Pestilence.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231200\"&gt;1200&lt;/a&gt;, the city experienced an outbreak of plague, known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Pestilence\"&gt;Great Pestilence&lt;/a&gt;. It affected both humans and animals. The panicked survivors threw the corpses of both into the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Tunnels\"&gt;Plague Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20II\"&gt;Justinian II&lt;/a&gt; ordered the incineration of plague victims.\nSometime in the 12th century, the &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt; settled in Westmarch. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt; (about a century later), they were known as a secretive sect of zealous guardians that served Westmarch, though their real origins remained a mystery.\nMoon of the Spider.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Cornelius\"&gt;Cornelius&lt;/a&gt; passed away. Per the line of succession, &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian&lt;/a&gt; was next in line for the throne. As with every other time a king passed away, uncertainty was in the air, given Westmarch's feudal system. Justinian ordered that the &lt;a href=\"Rakkisguard\"&gt;Rakkisguard&lt;/a&gt; be pulled back from the city walls to shore up the palace, reasoning that the capital was under no threat of invasion, and that a show of force in his seat of power would discourage any noble from challenging his right to rule. Despite his misgivings, General &lt;a href=\"Torion\"&gt;Torion&lt;/a&gt; obeyed, and half of the Rakkisguard were removed from the walls. In truth, this was part of a mad scheme enacted by Justinian while under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Karybdus\"&gt;Karybdus&lt;/a&gt;. Westmarch would be attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Astrogha\"&gt;Children of Astrogha&lt;/a&gt;, he would thwart any threats to his claim to the throne, and would be a hero for removing the very threat he'd created.\nPer tradition, nobles made their way to the capital to honor Cornelius and pledge loyalty to his successor. This was a spectacle for many in Westmarch, as many of them had been born just before or during Cornelius's reign, and had never seen such a gathering before.\nThe attack by the Children of Astrogha was carried out through stealth. One of the &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s took control of Captain &lt;a href=\"Alec%20Matteus\"&gt;Alec Matteus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Rakkisguard\"&gt;Rakkisguard&lt;/a&gt;, who returned to Westmarch and ordered that the guards present douse the torches and take off their helmets. His behavior and questionable orders caused the soldiers to have second thoughts, but it was too late\u2014in the period that the torches had been doused, the spiders had been able to scale the outer wall without any of them noticing. With their diminished numbers and helmets off, the Rakkisguard were quickly overwhelmed. Some were killed, others were controlled by the spiders. Their human puppets then opened the gates, allowing the main swarm to enter Westmarch.\nThe Children swarmed through Westmarch. Shrieks rang through the air, and quickly fell silent. The spiders were quickly discovered by General &lt;a href=\"Torion\"&gt;Torion&lt;/a&gt;, who fought them alongside his fellow Rakkisguard. They fared better than the guards had on the outer wall, as Torion quickly realized that the spiders were controlling human hosts (and gave orders for all helmets to be secured), and were vulnerable to fire. However, such were the spiders' numbers, they were forced to fall back.\nThe situation was desparate. While the fires were vulnerable to fire, rain was making the flames feeble. While the spiders were no longer able to take the Rakkisguard as hosts, they were able to bite them, killing them nearly instantly given their venom. &lt;a href=\"Salene%20Nesardo\"&gt;Salene Nesardo&lt;/a&gt; realized that if things continued, Torion might have to choose between letting the spiders take Westmarch, or burning the city to the ground.\nThe battle continued to rage. Reinforcements steadily joined the front, but when it came to numbers, the Children of Astrogha had the advantage. They began pouring over every wall, and began to take Westmarch's citizens as their hosts, making them akin to the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;walking dead&lt;/a&gt;. At least a fifth of the capital was either ablaze or had been burnt to the ground, the rain was going stronger, and oil stockpiles were running out. However, with the banishment of &lt;a href=\"Astrogha\"&gt;Astrogha&lt;/a&gt;, his children stopped dead in their tracks, and withered away, the rain itself washing away their dust.\nAge of the Wolf.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, Westmarch accomodated an influx of refugees from the north, while coping with rising tensions between the city's commoners and nobility. The city began to de-emphasize its once prominent &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith.\nDawn of Damnation.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, refugees from &lt;a href=\"Ashwold\"&gt;Ashwold&lt;/a&gt; flocked to Westmarch. Similarly, villagers living in/around the western part of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt; tried to flee to Westmarch, but were waylaid by a &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt; tribe. The city requested that adventurers clear the wood of Fallen, so that the roads would remain clear.\nLater, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; invaded Sanctuary, sweeping across the kingdom. Soon, only Westmarch itself stood against his forces. The attack was successfully repelled.\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, tensions were growing in the city. The people were hungry, and while King &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt; promised to grant favor to his people, they desired food more than anything else. However, never able to refuse a bit of extra coin, the people took him up on his offer. Still, tensions continued to simmer, and people gathered in dark corners of the city, whispering of change. Restless, and with their concerns ignored time and again by the king, champions rose up amongst Westmarch's citizens in an act of revolt.\nIn a future glimpsed at by the &lt;a href=\"Einfrinn%20Tree\"&gt;Einfrinn Tree&lt;/a&gt;, Westmarch was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Wrathborne\"&gt;Wrathborne&lt;/a&gt; and set ablaze. However, this future was apparently averted, thanks to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;.\nStorm of Light.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Westmarch remained a thriving city. However, ill omens were afoot. The city's defenses were probed by the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; prepared his forces to attack Sanctuary. People across Westmarch were abducted, never to be seen again. Patrols along the walls of the capital were bolstered, but the disappearances continued, and even some of the guards vanished.\nDespite this, the main issue within the capital was that of the &lt;a href=\"Templar%20Order\"&gt;Templar Order&lt;/a&gt;. A sect under the command of Lord &lt;a href=\"Norlun\"&gt;Norlun&lt;/a&gt; took control of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Cathedral\"&gt;Zakarum Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, using it as their base of operations. General &lt;a href=\"Torion\"&gt;Torion&lt;/a&gt; believed they were planning to assault the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; and take control of the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Palace\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt;. While the Templars did not hold power \"de jure\", they did have some \"de facto\" when it came to the populace. With tales of the disapearances and a possible uprising looming over them, many of Westmarch's people were on edge.\nThe Knights moved against the Templar directly in the early hours of the morning. However, an informant tipped the Templars off, and what was meant to be a quick show of force became an open battle in the streets. Eventually, the Knights overcame the Templars, with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Reaper of Souls.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; led his &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; against Westmarch, culling many of its citizens and defenders and converting them into an army of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; thralls under his command. The city fell nearly instantly, but fighting continued between the Reapers and Westmarch's remaining soldiers, who were aided by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. The city was successfully defended, albeit at the cost of thousands of lives. Currently, the city is deserted, with much of it reduced to rubble.\nThe Great Enmity.\nSometime after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to Westmarch, his birthplace. Even after fifty years, the devastation remained evident. The streets were quiet, the once bustling markets were somber, and there were many vacant houses and buildings which were boarded up and left to rot.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nWestmarch serves as the hub for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". Players can interact with vendors and other players here, along with being able to store their loot. To change the game's &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; level, players must be in Westmarch.\nIn the beta, players gained access to Westmarch after completing the &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt; zones. In the final version, players gain access to Westmarch straight after Ashwold.\nDiablo III.\nWestmarch is an area featured in &lt;a href=\"Act%20V%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", as introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".

King's Royal Navy) was the maritime defense force of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe harbor of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Military%20District\"&gt;Military District&lt;/a&gt; served as the berth of the Navy.\nThe Navy often came into contact with pirates. It maintained a system of officers (e.g. captains) and enlisted men (e.g. sailors). Officers had their rank insignias displayed on their collars. A quarterly meeting called \"the Captain's Table\" was held between chosen ship captains. A captain's uniform was green with gold piping, accompanied by a cloak. Sailors wore whites in the event of funerals, inspections, or while at anchorage. Sailors buried at sea had the flag of Westmarch draped over their bodies. Sailors within the navy often endured long hours, low pay, and a dismissive attitude from the captains they served under. Great pains were taken to ensure that ships didn't stink; salt and vinegar were applied to prevent fungus from growing on wood.\nNavy captains demonstrated harsh discipline. Lower ranked officers could be flogged if deemed necessary. Any man who missed his ship's departure for no good reason was hung for dereliction of duty.\nSteps were taken to ensure that the ships of the navy didn't stink. Sailors were kept busy cleaning them out, dousing them with salt water and vinegar to kill any fungus or mold that tried to leach into the wood.\nHistory.\nWestmarch quickly grew into a major maritime power due to its plentiful access to the sea. The navy was never able to verify the location of &lt;a href=\"Greyhollow%20Island\"&gt;Greyhollow Island&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whatever attempts they might have made.\nc. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;1263&lt;/a&gt;, the Navy was involved in rescuing the &lt;a href=\"Cornelius\"&gt;king's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lhex\"&gt;nephew&lt;/a&gt; from pirates. They invaded their stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Tauruk%27s%20Port\"&gt;Tauruk's Port&lt;/a&gt; and rescued him. However, due to the sighting of a demon in the port, Cornelius pulled his navy back into &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Dissent grew around northern ports and cities that had usually relied on the navy to defend them. Pirates grew bolder, and northern cities no longer curried as much favor with the kingdom as they once had.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Over twenty years&lt;/a&gt; later, the navy lost its berth as Westmarch's capital came under assault by the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, and was abandoned."}

Designed like a fortress, it was a gray stone edifice, with pointed towers, jutting buttresses, and gargoyles on every rooftop. It was surrounded by high, spiked walls (from which banners were mounted) and a deep moat, which led to wrought-iron gates. The lowest windows were three feet up and barred with iron. The palace was defended by the &lt;a href=\"Rakkisguard\"&gt;Rakkisguard&lt;/a&gt;. Befitting its nature as the home of the &lt;a href=\"Rakkis%20Dynasty\"&gt;Rakkis Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, wolf iconography was carved into the fortress's gates and interior.\nThe palace's interior included kitchens and the throne room.\nHistory.\nThe palace was supposedly constructed by &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, and was built before Westmarch (the city) was, operating as a fortress. The palace was chosen as the base from which the city would grow. In a sense, the city was an extension of the palace itself.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Rakkis%20Dynasty\"&gt;Rakkis Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, the palace became the seat of power for the &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20Dynasty\"&gt;Justinian Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in a clash of iconography, as the Rakkis Dynasty had used the wolf as their sigil, and this was represented in the palace's original design. The Justinians, who adopted the bear as their sigil, mounted it on the palace's banners, but the original wolf carvings and statues remained. &lt;a href=\"Torion\"&gt;Torion&lt;/a&gt; noted that the bear banners appeared more frightened than frightening; that they were mounted high as if to avoid the snapping jaws of the wolves below.\nIn-game.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Courtyard\"&gt;courtyard&lt;/a&gt; of the palace is explorable in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", as is the palace itself (though not the interior)."}

This location was added in patch 2.1.\nDescription.\nThe level is made in the style that is the opposite of everything that can be expected from a Diablo game: deliberately childish, colorful, cartoonish, similar to the fantasy of little girls about the perfect paradise. It is inhabited by cute, but still bloodthirsty creatures: Petal Flowers, Hug Bears, Plump Unicorns, etc. However, the external cuteness of these creatures is destroyed not only by their aggressiveness, but also by the fact that they all die the most brutal deaths in the entire game, colorfully falling apart with blood splatters and anatomical details.\nThe music in the level is obnoxious and ludicrous, giving the impression that it's a backwards melody, but when played in either direction, it remains a cacophony.\nThis zone can spawn all the same &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt; as Whimsyshire, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20William\"&gt;Sir William&lt;/a&gt;. At least one will spawn every time.\nThere is no achievement for entering or beating it, but there is a chance of obtaining two weapon transmogs (sward and dagger) and &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Wings\"&gt;Cosmic Wings&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrincess Lillian.\nIn extremely rare cases, a unique unicorn can be found on the level. &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Lillian\"&gt;Princess Lillian&lt;/a&gt; is the rarest mob in the entire game. Outwardly, it almost does not differ from other unicorns, but is marked in purple as an elite. As an enemy she is nothing, players usually waste her apart, barely having time to notice. The reward for destroying her is Cosmic Wings.\nDrop rate.\nAs of March 2017, Whimsydale &lt;a href=\"container\"&gt;container&lt;/a&gt; drops have been greatly increased, growing even further with difficulty. Enemy drops are consistent with normal drops of that difficulty.\nA single run of Whimsydale can bring rewards comparable to multiple &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt; combined."}

Pony Level) is an easter egg level in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", similar to the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;Secret Cow Level&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". \nOverview.\nThe enemy monsters featured here are flowers, unicorns, and teddy bears. The level itself is created in a style different from the rest of the game, the map having been drawn to look like a child's painting. Normal world objects, chests, health globes etc. are replaced by toys, happy clouds, sweeties etc. The monster death animations, however, remain as gory as in the rest of the game.\u00a0\nMonsters are also specific to that zone:\nThe\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sir%20William\"&gt;Whimsyshire portrait&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can only be obtained in Whimsyshire.\nWhimsyshire was originally made as a response to criticism regarding the game's graphics being \"too cartoon-like\" and \"too bright\".\nA dark version of the Whimsyshire layout may appear in &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s, regardless whether you have been to this level or not. The Dark Whimsyshire may or may not come with its monsters.\nA nearly identical zone exists called &lt;a href=\"Whimsydale\"&gt;Whimsydale&lt;/a&gt;, which\u00a0only appears if one kills a &lt;a href=\"Rainbow%20Goblin\"&gt;Rainbow Goblin&lt;/a&gt;, and is the only place one can obtain the &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Wings\"&gt;Cosmic Wings&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the similarities to Whimsyshire, in &lt;a href=\"Whimsydale\"&gt;Whimsydale&lt;/a&gt; the happy clouds and lovely presents will drop gold, gems, and items significantly more often.\u00a0\nGaining entry.\nWhimsyshire can be accessed through the following steps (\"Note: as they have become account bound, these items cannot be collected from other players\"):\nHigher difficulty levels.\nAs of version 2.0, any Staff of Herding will allow access to Whimsyshire on any difficulty. Previously, though, to access Whimsyshire on higher difficulties (nightmare, hell, inferno), the Staff of Herding had to be upgraded 3 times. But for many years this mechanic has been abolished and the staff gives access to the location on any difficulty without additional manipulations.\nTrivia.\n "}
