Over the years, she developed an understand with &lt;a href=\"Elzix\"&gt;Elzix&lt;/a&gt;. He would send travelers to her for drink and entertainment (often trading their wares for lodging), and she'd send them back to him for a soft bed. \nAtma had a son.

The reduction in travelers harmed Atma's business, but she'd saved a \"nest egg\" and was therefore able to support herself. However, her son and husband were both killed by &lt;a href=\"Radament\"&gt;Radament&lt;/a&gt;. The emotional wounds were deep and became distracted, her mind always seemingly elsewhere. &lt;a href=\"Fara\"&gt;Fara&lt;/a&gt; feared that she would succumb to her despair and hatred because of her loss.\nAtma asked a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; to descend into the sewers to slay the creature. In this, they succeeded. She took some solace in knowing that her son and husband had been avenged, and in thanks, talked to Lut Gholein's townspeople. The merchants agreed to give the heroes discounts on their wares and services.\nThe heroes were able to put a rest to the evil that had plagued the desert, to which Atma gave her thanks.\nIn-game.\nAtma is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".

{"id": "3750", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3750", "title": "Attack Rating", "text": "Attack Rating, displayed on the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt;, determines the percentage chance that you will hit the target, as well as the chance of the targeted monster hitting the player. If your Attack Rating is too low, you will notice that your attacks often miss. The chance to hit increases if you are at a higher character level than the monster you're attacking. Your Attack Rating can be improved by increasing your &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, and by equipping magic items that specifically increase your Attack Rating.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Attack Rating no longer exists; the chance to hit is always 100%, modified only by chance.\nAttack Rating should not be confused with Attack Rate, better known as &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo I/Hellfire.\nAttack Rating made its debut in Diablo/Hellfire in the form of To-Hit %. This chance starts at a base of 50%, and is increased by 1 for every 2 points allocated into Dexterity for melee/ranged attacks. For spellcasting, the formula changes to use Magic instead of Dexterity. There are also affixes on Weapons and Jewelry that increase that To-Hit chance further, although the best of those are only available on the former.\nIn addition, all heroes have 'hidden bonuses' to that To-Hit %. These bonuses are not shown, and new players may not even be aware of them until much later in the game, or even until told so by experienced players. These hidden bonuses affect the heroes greatest at their specialized form of combat- that is, to say:\nThis being said, at max level, every hero will have up to a +70% increased To-Hit that is not seen on the character sheet. This makes it so they can focus on affixes that give both To-Hit and damage dealt, without problems due to a lack of To-Hit %.\nDiablo II/Lord of Destruction.\nAttack Rating changes form in Diablo II/Lord of Destruction. Instead of a flat % chance to hit enemies, your Attack Rating is simply another number that determines the % chance of hitting a monster. Dexterity adds to Attack Rating at 5 units per 1 point. Attack Rating affixes from gear are varied a bit more now, with flat increases, and then affixes that also add a \"%\" bonus to your Attack Rating.\nThose are not all the affixes that dedicate themselves to boosting your chances to hit your target, however. Certain items, like &lt;a href=\"Eaglehorn%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Eaglehorn&lt;/a&gt;, possess a powerful affix that completely negates the defense of many monsters. And there are affixes that either negates a % of defense, or lowers the targets' defense upon a successful hit.\nIn multiplayer, it should be noted that the actual chances to hit a monster may appear to be much lower than what is displayed on the character sheet. This may be due to multiple reasons including server lag which results in your character being too far away from the monster (in the case of melee attacks) to properly connect with his attacks. Confirmation of this effect can be seen in crowded environments (Arcane Sanctuary and Maggot Lair notably) where on one player's screen compared to another, characters occupy different locations. Using a melee attack like smite (which always hit) and still missing also indicate that the target is out of range. Moving away then re-engaging the target usually re-evaluates the character's position and may fix the issue."}
{"id": "8134", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8134", "title": "Attack Speed", "text": "The Attack Speed of a weapon is an item attribute that determines how fast the hero can attack. The faster one can attack, the less time it takes to get a swing in, leading to increased damage per second because of more hits in a shorter amount of time. Heroes can also get bonuses to Attack Speed which allows them to attack faster than their weapon would normally allow.\nGeneral Information.\nGenerally, each class has their own set of attack speed bonuses and penalties. The more adept classes such as the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, have a higher attack speed than caster-oriented classes like the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo I/Hellfire.\nAttack Speed is represented in its most basic form in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;/\". One-Handed weapons, Two-Handed Swords and Maces attack at the same rate. Axes swing a frame slower than them, unless the wielder of choice is a &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Hellfire%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, and all other forms of attack vary depending on the class of the player.\nGenerally, however, it comes to no argument that:\nWeaponry can be enchanted with suffixes* that allow a hero to swing a weapon faster than he normally would. From weakest to greatest, they are:\n&amp;ast; Ingame, this series of suffixes is bugged. Readiness does nothing but change the gold value of the item, Swiftness affects the hero as Readiness would, Speed affects like Swiftness, and Haste does not offer any better than Speed. Blizzard Entertainment incorrectly claimed they fixed this in patch 1.07 for Diablo I.\nDiablo II/Lord of Destruction.\nAttack Speed is a bit more varying in Diablo II and the expansion set, but classes still retain their bonuses and penalties.\nGenerally, it comes to no argument that:\nAttack Speed increases are not limited to just Weaponry as they were in Diablo/Hellfire, with Gloves being able to spawn with affixes that increase a hero's Attack Speed, as well as certain skills, like &lt;a href=\"Fanaticism\"&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III/Reaper of Souls.\nAttack Speed returns in Diablo III, but in a different form compared to the earlier installments. Instead of class bonuses and penalties, each weapon type instead has a set attack speed value, in \"Attacks per Second\" (APS), ranging from 1.20 to 1.60 APS for one-handed weapons and 0.90 to 1.15 APS for two-handed weapons.\nFrom highest to lowest, they are:\nIf the character fights unarmed (for example unequipping the bow a starts with) the APS is 1.0: it's somehow slower to throw punches than it is to shoot even a crossbow much less a bow and arrow: only polearms and 2H maces are slower than punching.\nAttack Speed affixes are a bit more diverse than in the earlier installments, with Weapons, Jewelry, and Gloves being able to roll Attack Speed. And there are certain &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Items&lt;/a&gt; that are guaranteed to have Attack Speed affixes on them. At level 70, all possible item slots can offer up to a +7% increase in attack speed. The one exception are Quivers, which can roll up to +20% attack speed.\nIn addition, certain skills, like the 's\u00a0&lt;a href=\"3\"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt;, can increase Attack Speed for a short duration.\u00a0Frenzy &lt;a href=\"Shrines\"&gt;Shrines&lt;/a&gt; can award +25% Attack Speed for a brief time. Heroes can also gain up to +10% Attack Speed from &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; level points. There exists a hard cap, however; a hero may not gain more than +100% Attack Speed from more permanent sources, like equipment and/or Paragon levels.\nBecause of the &lt;a href=\"Life%20per%20Hit\"&gt;Life per Hit&lt;/a&gt; statistic mechanics (the way it was prior to patch 2.1), Attack Speed is not multiplicative with each other except for a weapon with a bonus to Attack Speed. Regardless of circumstances, a weapon's Attack Speed becomes the base amount, upon which all other bonuses to Attack Speed are calculated.\nUpon reaching level 61 and above in Reaper of Souls, almost all melee &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; weaponry available will gain a flat 0.10 bonus to attack speed, with the exception of Swords and\u00a0Daibos, which gain 0.05,\u00a0and Flails, which gain no bonus.\nFor most builds, stacking Attack Speed is a matter of arguable efficiency (since the total amount of attacks a character can make is usually limited by their resource pools). Exceptions may be found in builds that make heavy use of resource-free and primary skills, rather than resource spenders. These builds may find the tactic of having as much Attack Speed as possible rather effective.\nOff-hand items for the spellcasting classes (&lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; and ), along with some &lt;a href=\"ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"amulets\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt;, can add a static amount of damage to successful hits. Because the amount does not change amongst weapons, these items are more of an aid to heroes when they wield faster attack speed weapons. Despite this fact, items that add to a hero's &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt; statistics are generally favored. Most skills use a % of raw weapon damage to calculate the total damage, and in some cases, having a more potent, albeit slower, weapon is yielding better results.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Over%20Time\"&gt;Damage Over Time&lt;/a&gt; skills and similar effects utilize a mechanic called \"attack period\" (also known as \"tick of damage\") to determine the damage they are doing, in order to compensate for the \"fast weapon vs. powerful weapon\" dilemma. A skill stated to deal 100% weapon damage will deliver this damage every 1 / AttackSpeed seconds. For example, with attack speed of 1.0, it delivers 100% damage every 1.00 seconds; with AS 2.0, it will deliver a hit every 0.50 seconds (200% damage per second), and with AS 0.5 it will only deliver 100% damage every 2.00 seconds (that is, 50% damage per second). As slower weapons are usually more powerful, the actual damage output is more or less comparable for different weapon types. Example of skills and effects that utilize attack period include &lt;a href=\"Sweeping%20Wind\"&gt;Sweeping Wind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chantodo%27s%20Resolve\"&gt;Chantodo's Resolve&lt;/a&gt; weapon set's Waves of Destruction. Pets also gain a damage multiplier equal to the attack period.\nSome Damage Over Time skills gain no damage increase from attack speed, instead they only cast with a faster animation time. Examples include Haunt and Locust Swarm.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"Tasker%20and%20Theo\"&gt;Tasker and Theo&lt;/a&gt; can increase the Attack Speed of &lt;a href=\"Pet\"&gt;Pet&lt;/a&gt;s. Any other Attack Speed increase will increase the Pet's &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; instead. This makes Attack Speed critical for most Pet oriented builds."}

Affected monsters do not attack their peers, however.\nAttract is ineffective against bosses, super unique monsters, &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, and other players.\nUnaffected enemies attack whoever is closest. If necromancers are too close to their enemies casting Attract does not change their attackers' targets.

This allowed players to put items up for auction, bid and buyout. Two versions of the auction house existed. One used &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; earned in-game while the second used real-world currency. Sales and purchases from the Real Money Auction House (RMAH) could be funded by either the players &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; account balance or a separate e-commerce service such as PayPal. The Auction House was introduced as a means of combating third-party trading of items. The developers were left with the choice of removing trading, or integrating it into the game economy, thus reducing the incentive to use third parties. According to &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt; however, after release, it was clear that the Auction House had made getting items too easy. Within two months of the game's launch, he had come to regret implementing the Auction House, but wasn't sure if it should be shut down. While there was a lot of criticism from the playerbase towards the Auction House, the developers had to consider how many were using the service. Contrary to some players' beliefs, Wilson has stated that the Auction House was not pushed on &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; by \"corporate overlords.\"\nThe Auction House's disbandenment was suggested by &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Mosqueira\"&gt;Josh Mosqueira&lt;/a&gt;, who had been brought in as game director. After a short discussion, the entire team, even those on the business side thought it would make the most sense. After this change, it gave the team the ability to make sure to reward players with better items, clear and concise tool tips, and &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;. Wilson supported his move, attributing Mosqueira as being the driving force for shutting down the Auction House.\nThe Auction House service was discontinued on March 18, 2014. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;'s original goal was to provide a convenient and secure system for trades, but it was found that the auction house undermined the game's loot-based gameplay. Subsequently, &lt;a href=\"Loot%202.0\"&gt;Loot 2.0&lt;/a&gt; has been introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". Most, if not all, means of player-to-player trade were eliminated in result."}

{"id": "3732", "revid": "53893697", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3732", "title": "Aura", "text": "Aura is a type of skill used by &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Summoning%20Skills\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Desert Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Enchanted\"&gt;certain Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt;. It passively affects either the caster and all nearby allies, or all nearby enemies. There are two types of Auras: &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Auras\"&gt;Defensive Auras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Offensive%20Auras\"&gt;Offensive Auras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn example of an offensive Aura is the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt; Aura, which &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt;s any affected target and inflicts &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; damage. An example of a defensive Aura is the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Lightning\"&gt;Resist Lightning&lt;/a&gt; Aura, which increases the Lightning &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; for the Paladin and all party members.\nA single target \"may\" be affected by more than one \"different\" Aura, though only one graphic will show at a time (the graphics will alternate). Same Auras will not stack, a weaker one being suppressed.\nAn Aura is a semi-Passive skill, in that it usually requires no &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; (although &lt;a href=\"Prayer\"&gt;Prayer&lt;/a&gt; drains Mana over time while active), and can be kept on as long as possible. In return, Aura is only active while focused, occupying the RMB skill slot, and is dropped immediately when switched. Only one Aura of any type can be active per Paladin at a time.\nSome Auras provide a minor passive bonus when inactive; an example may be &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fire\"&gt;Resist Fire&lt;/a&gt;, which still increases the \"maximum\" (not \"current\") &lt;a href=\"Fire%20resistance\"&gt;Fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; by half of usual value even when turned off or replaced with a different Aura. Many Auras also &lt;a href=\"Synergies\"&gt;synergize&lt;/a&gt; with other skills, enhancing the Paladin's attacks even when turned off.\nA single caster can only have one Aura active at a time. However, auras different that the skill-granted one, granted by items will be active even if item wielder has another Aura. If multiple items grant the same Aura, each Item will act with the Level of the combined Auras. It can lead to powerful combinations, such as stacked &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt; from double or &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt; from double and .\nItems with auras.\nThe following table contains items which grant auras, and can be used to plan stacking them by looking at which slot combinations are possible.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Auras partially return in form of Mantras and &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; Laws.\nUnlike Auras, these skills have both passive and active effect, providing a bonus that can be greatly increased for a short time by manually activating the skill.\n's &lt;a href=\"Frailty\"&gt;Frailty&lt;/a&gt; curse and &lt;a href=\"Devour\"&gt;Devour&lt;/a&gt; skill can be used as auras with respective runes."}

The main characteristic of Auras is that they will influence either the Unique's Minions, or their enemies. Unlike most other bonuses, though, there are a variation of auras which can appear. Any Unique Monster may only have one Aura.\nAura Enchanted Monsters may have the following Auras:\nIn previous versions of Diablo II monsters could also get &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; aura. This was removed from the game, most likely to even the playing field between melee physical damage heroes and ranged attackers/casters. If it remained, melee heroes would probably be nothing but useless in Multiplayer, due to the requirements of high Life having soared up even higher than it already is now.\nApproach these Unique monsters cautiously if they possess Fanaticism, Conviction or Holy Freeze. These auras are very detrimental to your hero, and are very hard, if not outright impossible, to avoid. The rest of the Aura Enchanted mobs do not pose a big threat unless paired with other powerful monster affixes, but these 3 take a high priority.\nAll auras can be found from monsters starting at level 4+, but Holy Shock can spawn only starting on level 20+"}
{"id": "9433", "revid": "1687225", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9433", "title": "Auradin", "text": "An Auradin is a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; build in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". It uses mostly &lt;a href=\"Offensive%20Auras\"&gt;Offensive Auras&lt;/a&gt; to damage the opponent. The idea of an Auradin is to \"stack\" his &lt;a href=\"aura\"&gt;aura&lt;/a&gt;s in order to get the full effect of the damage caused. An Auradin is not always a frontline fighter. He evades his attacker by running or teleporting away with the right equipment, and he lets his auras do the work. But they can do a high amount of damage while hitting, due to their auras providing elemental damage to their attacks. There are several types of Auradins:\nTesladin.\nThe Tesladin is a &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20builds\"&gt;Paladin build&lt;/a&gt;, using the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt; aura granted by the &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Dream Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zeal\"&gt;Zeal&lt;/a&gt; deals physical damage as a complement to the lightning damage Holy Shock provides, while &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; strips enemy monsters of lightning resistance.\nGear.\nWith zeal and a phase blade base, Tesladins will hit their IAS breakpoints at 24, 54, and 72 IAS. Assuming a Fanaticism aura is being provided by a mercenary, teammate, or the Paladin himself, ~31-36% IAS is already a given; with 34% IAS from Fanaticism, only another 20% is needed to hit one of the best reasonable breakpoints. In plain language, this means that more than 20% IAS provided by the gear doesn't increase attack speed at all. \nMercenary.\nThe Tesladin is a highly customizable build, and his ideal mercenary varies based on his needs. Tesladins could use &lt;a href=\"Fanaticism\"&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt; and then rely on an &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Desert Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"Infinity%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Infinity Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of his &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; aura. Conversely, Tesladins could provide the Conviction aura themselves and use a &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt; mercenary with the &lt;a href=\"Faith%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Faith Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; to provide a Fanaticism aura instead.\nStacker Build Auradin.\nMax:\nHoly Fire Auradin (AKA Dragon paladin).\nThis Auradin is a &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20builds\"&gt;Paladin build&lt;/a&gt; maximizing the use of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt; aura. It is capable of excellent damage capabilities until Hell Difficulty, where the damage drops off significantly - despite having the most synergy items of all the damaging auras (weapon, armor, shield), it will still do the least damage of any type of auradin.\nSkill Point Distribution.\nThe main aura will be &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt;, to break immunities and resistance to fire, The damage from &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt; aura gained from items will be more than a twenty point investment.\nMax:\nOther Points:\n- All in all, that is 91 Skill Points. So make sure you don't waste your points, you have very little wiggle room.\nMercenary.\nThis is completely up to you. A &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt; using Frost Arrow, with a , Bow, and maybe a helm might be a good choice, but this is all up to you.\nNote: In Difficulty, you will not be able to break the fire immunity of all enemies you encounter. If you can afford an auradin, you can afford Grief - for almost every situation it will deal more damage than HoJ, and pulsed fire damage is too low to kill anything anyway.\nOmnidin.\nOmnidin is a versatile Paladin build primarily using Runeword equipment to project multiple elemental auras around the character, hirelings, and party members. The goal of this build is to simultaneously stack &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defiance\"&gt;Defiance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;Redemption&lt;/a&gt; all as passive skills. This gives the option for the Paladin to use &lt;a href=\"Fanaticism\"&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0almost exclusively\u00a0and switch auras only if the situation demands. Aura options are &lt;a href=\"Salvation\"&gt;Salvation&lt;/a&gt; for improved resists and &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; to nerf monster resists, but otherwise Fanaticism should be your primary.\nThis build is not skill nor attribute intensive though does require higher level characters to procure and equip the required gear. Putting a few points into Holy Freeze is advisable. Use Freeze\u00a0early on\u00a0to slow monsters until Fanaticism or gear can replace it.\u00a0\nThe greatest benefit of the Omnidin is its ability to merge well with other popular builds including Zealot, Avenger, and Smiter.\nSkills.\nWhile you may choose most any accompanying skills you wish, here are a few staples to consider:\nEquipment.\nThis is the bread and butter of this endeavor. You'll note the high level requirements for much of this gear so be prepared to use lower levels finding your personal play style which can then be augmented with this build."}

The most beloved of all &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s, it is she who leads the sweet chorus of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Eternal Conflict.\nAs with all angels, Auriel was born from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;. She was among the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s, and among the five who best represented the five virtues of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; (in her case, hope). Alongside &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;, Auriel formed the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; to lead angelkind.\nAs with her kin, Auriel fought in the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, slaying many demons. There are many tales of her incredible feats in battle, breaching the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; alongside her fellow archangels to wrest the stronghold from &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;'s grasp.\nAuriel had an encounter with &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt; during the war. She alone saw past Lucion's guise, and smote him with &lt;a href=\"Al%27maiesh\"&gt;Al'maiesh&lt;/a&gt;. While Lucion was struck down, he did not perish, instead feigning his &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, as he was loath to return to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath.\nOn one &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Battlefield\"&gt;such battlefield&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;, Auriel fought alongside her fellow council members. Using &lt;a href=\"Al%27maiesh\"&gt;Al'maiesh&lt;/a&gt;, she sent her &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; foes sprawling. The &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; pressed forward, and the demons were sent into retreat. &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt; pressed on ahead however, and confronted &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; alone, fighting the Lord of Terror to a stalemate until Auriel and her fellow archangels arrived. Using Al'maiesh, Auriel broke the Prime Evil's grasp on her comrade, and, with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, was able to bind the demon against a slab of stone. Auriel declared that holding Diablo prisoner would turn the tide of war in Heaven's favor, for, as &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, slaying him would just lead to Diablo being &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;reborn&lt;/a&gt;. However, an enraged Imperius, declaring that demonkind could only be dealt with in blood, slew Diablo, an act which Auriel called \"sacrilege.\"\nThe Sin War.\nWith the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Conflict ground to a halt. It was only with the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; that Heaven learned of the existence of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, and how it had come into creation through the coupling of angels and demons. Initially declaring this new species abominations and intent on exterminating them, the Angiris Council was given pause after watching &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice in battle. Thus, it was put to vote whether Man be spared, or eradicated as initially planned.\nIn the resulting discussion, Auriel was the most impassioned speaker, maintaining that the crimes of &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; (who had stolen the Worldstone and created Sanctuary in the first place) should not be transferred to humanity, and that given time, they may play a role in the Great Conflict. Thus, her vote was for them. While she was disappointed that Malthael abstained from casting a vote, not to mention that Imperius argued for their eradication, the votes of &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt; and Tyrael let humanity continue to exist.\nThe Light of Hope.\nOver three millennia after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, war returned to the High Heavens. Diablo, now a singular Prime Evil, destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt; and led his &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Legion\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; into the angels' realm. Diablo specifically targeted Auriel during his attack, knowing that without her, the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt;'s morale would plummet. She was taken prisoner by &lt;a href=\"Rakanoth\"&gt;Rakanoth&lt;/a&gt;, and the Host became listless and dejected, easily scattered. She remained a prisoner until &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; (who had pursued Diablo from Sanctuary) slew the demon and rescued her. Auriel directed them to destroy the corrupted growths while she returned to rally the Heavenly Host. With her return, the angels began to fight back with more fervor.\nImperius confronted The Nephalem, telling them to depart the realm, lest he kill them. Auriel told the hero to pay Imperius no mind. The Nephalem went on to defeat Diablo, saving the Heavens. Auriel appeared to congratulate them, alongside Itherael.\nStorm of Light.\nDiablo had achieved singular Prime Evil status through the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, a device that, after his body disintegrated following his battle with the nephalem, remained in Heaven. The stone was later found by Auriel and her fellow council members. As the stone lay stored in the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council%20Chamber\"&gt;Angiris Council Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, Auriel sensed conflict at the site while she resided in the &lt;a href=\"Gardens%20of%20Hope\"&gt;Gardens of Hope&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving, she found Tyrael confronting &lt;a href=\"Balzael\"&gt;Balzael&lt;/a&gt;, the latter angel letting his distrust of Tyrael (still mortal) shine through. Auriel stepped in to defend Tyrael from the verbal barbs of Balzael, and told the angel to take leave of his guard duties.\nConversing with Tyrael, Auriel correctly deduced that he was weary, and that while he required sleep as a mortal, such a thing did not come naturally to him. She reassured Tyrael that while many angels did not agree with Tyrael's choice to become mortal, that did not mean it was the wrong one. She wrapped &lt;a href=\"Al%27maiesh\"&gt;Al'maiesh&lt;/a&gt; around Tyrael briefly to give him clarity, then departed.\nAs the Angiris Council debated the soulstone's fate, Auriel suggested that in order to neutralize the Black Soulstone, it be sealed in a chamber of light and sound. Imperius disagreed and suggested destroying the Stone instead. Itherael was crippled with indecision and could not choose between the two. Furthermore, there was the question of humanity, given that it was through &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;one of their own&lt;/a&gt; that Diablo had been able to become the Prime Evil. Auriel still vouched for humanity's continued existence, pointing out that Diablo may have been able to achieve such a feat regardless. Imperius wasn't convinced, and Auriel found her own faith in humanity waning. She nevertheless claimed that there was still hope for mankind, as they were the children of angels as much as demons.\nOn the subject of the Black Soulstone, Tyrael suggested that he hide it in Sanctuary. Like the others, Auriel disagreed\u2014the original &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s had corrupted humans, there was no reason to believe that the Black Soulstone wouldn't likewise. Tyrael warned them that the Black Soulstone was corrupting the Heavens in this very moment, but the Council refused to listen. Thus, he departed, warning them that if the soulstone stayed where it was, the Heavens would be doomed.\nAuriel sent a messenger to Tyrael, confirming that the Council had refused to act on his advice; that the soulstone would remain in Heaven. Tyrael ended up leaving the Heavens, but returned, leading a new group of &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to retrieve the stone. She confronted the intruders at the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Pools of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;. However, she instructed the &lt;a href=\"Luminarei\"&gt;Luminarei&lt;/a&gt; to let the Horadrim go.\nAuriel and Itherael met with Imperius and Tyrael. She stated that while she may have disagreed with Tyrael's methods, he was right in saying that the stone couldn't stay in Heaven. Therefore, she had let the Horadrim go, taking the Black Soulstone with them. Already, she could feel its taint leaving the realm. She thus called for an emergency trial of Tyrael, or allow him to remain on the Council. Before Imperius could object, she cast her vote\u2014reinstate Tyrael, and allow him to return to Sanctuary. It was, after all, where he belonged, where he could guard the stone. Turning to Tyrael, she apologized for not listening to him from the outset.\nImperius voted that Tyrael be put on trial. Itherael stated that Tyrael was no longer an archangel, but should remain on the Council. Tyrael ended up departing the Council, having found his home on Sanctuary.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nAuriel appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;fourth act&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". She is the focus of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Light%20of%20Hope\"&gt;The Light of Hope&lt;/a&gt;\" quest. During Diablo's assault on Heaven she is captured, robbing the Angels of Hope. She is guarded by &lt;a href=\"Rakanoth\"&gt;Rakanoth&lt;/a&gt; the Lord of Despair in the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Library of Fate&lt;/a&gt;. Auriel is freed by the Nephalem and grants them her blessing, allowing them to destroy the Demonic Corruption spreading through heaven. She appears sporadically throughout the following quests to advance the plot, starts the \"&lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;\" quest and congratulates the player upon defeating Diablo.\nDiablo Chess.\nAuriel appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Chess\"&gt;Diablo Chess&lt;/a&gt;\". She is the queen piece of Heaven's side.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nAuriel first appeared in the trailer for the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt; event in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", and was later confirmed hero for Heroes of the Storm, releasing in August 2016.\nMuch like Tyrael, she can be equipped with a demonic-themed skin.\nPersonality and Traits.\nAuriel is said to be the most lighthearted member of the Angiris Council. It is through her that hope flows through the fabric of Creation, and her eternal light illuminates even the darkest of souls. She believes in the potential for good in all things, including the hearts of all sentient beings, and is said to embody the shining light of a bright future.\nSeeking harmony in all things, Auriel is a mediator and counselor. However, Auriel is not a pacifist, and she does not shy away from strife, for she recognises that conflict is the nature of the universe. Thus, when necessary, she serves as a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; as well, striking down those who would bring despair and darkness. She is no less a warrior than any other member of the Angiris Council.\nAuriel places great value on virtues such as love and compassion. In her mind, these are things to be valued in both war and peace. She rarely speaks in short sentences, but the impact of her words is greater when she does so. She lets out a warm and soothing glow.\nWhat makes Auriel unique is her ability to see harmony even in the midst of discord. She believes that victory for one side does not always mean defeat for the other. To her way of thinking, beyond each conflict lies the promise of healing. This philosophy was often exemplified when she acted as a mediator between Tyrael and Imperius, in many of their heated debates. Rather than scolding them or objecting to the use of violence, she let them see that resolution opened the door to new possibilities. Sometimes, she would drape &lt;a href=\"Al%27maiesh\"&gt;Al'maiesh&lt;/a&gt; around her fellows' shoulders, granting them clarity.\nIn battle, Auriel can use Al'maiesh as a weapon as readily as she can as a device of healing. She is also capable of wielding a &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. When not on the field of battle, she spends much of her time in the &lt;a href=\"Gardens%20of%20Hope\"&gt;Gardens of Hope&lt;/a&gt;.\nAuriel has a high regard for &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, believing him to be an example as to why her faith in mankind was justified. Notably, she was even respected by &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, who considered hope to be \"the only virtue with purpose.\" "}

In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231255\"&gt;1255&lt;/a&gt;, Elora passed away, much to Aust's grief.\nThe Coming of Destruction.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;Ten years later&lt;/a&gt;, dark tidings reached Aust's ears, which he recorded in his &lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Elder%20Aust%20of%20Harrogath\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;. Harrogath's seer, &lt;a href=\"Caldra\"&gt;Caldra&lt;/a&gt;, was beset by visions, and her screams woke up the entire village. Aust rushed to her aid, and found Anya already there, comforting her. It took some time to calm Caldra down, but even then, she would not respond to anyone directly, instead, staring into a world of her own. They realized that she had gone mad.\nThe following day, Aust and his fellow Elders held a vigil over Caldra's comatose form, praying to the &lt;a href=\"Ancients\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt; for guidance. Suddenly, her madness broke, and in a ragged voice, whispered, \"&lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; comes...and destruction follows him like a storm.\" She then sank into the bed and with a shudder, breathed her last. Aust reflected that as long as he drew breath, he would never forget Caldra's portent.\nThe day after that, the people of Harrogath realized that Baal's &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; was bearing down on them, and that &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; had fallen. The &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; made preparations for a siege, and Aust reflected that the &lt;a href=\"Uileloscadh%20M%C3%B3r\"&gt;Uileloscadh M\u00f3r&lt;/a&gt; had come. He believed that the conflict would affect the entire world, not just the Northern Steppes. He said that Mount Arreat iwas as necessary to the world's survival as food and water was to his people's own. He realized that outside assistance would be necessary in stopping Baal's legions.\nTwo days after preparation for the siege began, Aust presented a plan to the Council to use a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;ic spell of warding, which would prevent any &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, including Baal, from ascending &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. Aust was aware of the risks of the spell, not to mention that venturing beyond the walls carried a risk of its own. However, he saw no alternative.\nThe proposition did not go down well. &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; argued that there had to be another way, but neither he nor any other Elder could offer a real alternative. In time, five of the Elders came to accept Aust's plan, but Qual-Kehk remained unconvinced. Aust reflected that he had never seen Quak-Kehk so upset before, but he stood firm, and reluctantly, Quak-Kehk gathered his men to escort the Elders outside Harrogath. \nAust made preparations for what was to come, and saw Anya one last time before heading beyond the walls. The spell was successfully cast, but it cost Aust his life, as well as the life of every Elder bar Nihlathak."}

In the third game, a mini-map is always active, but a full map can be accessed by Tab key.\nMany players use the map as a navigation in order to see which areas they did not explore yet.\n\"Diablo\".\nIn Diablo, the automap is shown as a simple line drawing placed over the game screen to represent walls and doors that the character has seen. Since the labyrinth is \"constantly changing\" (randomly generated in each new game), it is the best method to track where you are, and where you have been. You can zoom in and out of the automap by pressing \"-\" and \"+\". You can also shift the map in a direction by pressing an arrow key.

Arrow keys can still be used to move the map around.\nBecause the map is not reset until you change a game (even if you save and exit), the automap also remains as it was until the levels are re-randomized.\nThe automap can be displayed either as an overlay of the whole screen, or set to a \"minimap\", where it is set in a corner of the screen and contained in a square boundary.\n\"Diablo III\".\nIn Diablo III, the map has been reworked. Instead of overlaying map, a small portion of it is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If you wish to access a full map of the level, you can use a Tab key, gaining ability to move it around (using mouse), with 1 key recentering map at your character. The map can also be zoomed.\nThere are also maps of the Act and of the World, accessible by M key. Right click on any map will bring you one level higher (Level - Act - World). World map is only available in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, though.\nClicking a Waypoint will teleport you to that location as if you were using a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to showing the terrain and entrances / exits, automap is also revealing locations of &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Pools of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Well\"&gt;Healing Well&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Shrines\"&gt;Shrines&lt;/a&gt;, and highlights the quest markers (showing a direction with an arrow if necessary).

It is based on the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; Vengeance and Conviction, but like other builds, other &lt;a href=\"Skill%20points\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; become important too for a successful &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;.\nStats.\n&lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;: Vengeance does not apply Strength in calculating for elemental damage, so allocate only enough points to wear the equipment.\n&lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;: There are two options. The first, and most popular, is to use a &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and put enough points for a 75% &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;block chance&lt;/a&gt;. The second, wielding a &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;. Wielding a two-hander is not as popular, but given the massive damage that some of these can output, it is certainly a possibility.\n&lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;: Vitality is an important stat, all extra points should be allocated here, but it is a question of play style.\n&lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;: This should be left at base, as the character(s) will have decent &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; at higher levels. However, the skill may be mana intensive at the beginning or of a heavy investment, so &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Steal\"&gt;Mana Steal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; which give mana per kill will help offset this problem.\nSkills.\nSkill Points.\nThis is a tight build. The skill has four synergies, not to mention the usual skills that round out a successful Paladin. The Conviction &lt;a href=\"Aura\"&gt;Aura&lt;/a&gt; is also a preferred choice, and in that 20 points are usually invested, as there is no mana cost and the perk of breaking immunities more effectively and overriding other conviction-using monsters. Holy Shield is also a good choice, but it is not unknown to have avengers using a good two-hander.\nSecondary Skills.\nWith secondary skills, these are optional. It would cost a fair bit to invest anything other than a single point in these skills, meaning that in PvP, a player should overlook everything but a single point in Smite. In PvM, however, these skills might provide significant assistance.\nEquipment.\nThere are two main ways to play an Avenger. The first one is using one-handed weapons with shields, it is reliable and recommended, because Vengeance does adequate amounts of damage even in Hell, and the perks of a shield will make things a lot easier.\nThe second one is the using of two-handed weapons. It is not recommended, but it is still possible to play in this style, but like any character that uses a two-handed weapon, building resistances is a priority. Physical Damage reduction will also come in handy.\nLike any other melee build, \"Cannot Be Frozen\", and some amount of Crushing Blow are two essential attributes to acquire. While a Crushing Blow does not benefit from your bonuses with Vengeance, it can be quite handy when facing monsters like Bosses for removing the initial huge chunks of life that cannot be done so easily solely with plain damage alone.\nWeapon \u2014 The bottom line is that the Avenger ideally requires a fast weapon with a high base damage as you are hitting one monster at a time, and Vengeance only calculates its damage off your weapon's base damage. Players can use easier-to-obtain items like higher end uniques or upgraded exceptional uniques for that purpose.\nHirelings.\nAlthough many players solo with their characters, Hirelings can certainly increase the survivability of any character if maintained properly. Typically, most choose the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Act 2 Defensive Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; in Nightmare Difficulty (the \"Holy Freeze Merc\") or the Offensive version (the \"Might Merc\"), but the others have plenty of potential if geared properly. The Helmet and Armor are standard choices, the only thing that would vary are the weapons. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Act 3 Hirelings&lt;/a&gt; with cold attacks used to be popular, but are rare now due to many monsters being immune to their attacks. Although &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarian Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are quite rugged, they can be overcome by large mobs. On the other hand, properly equipped, he can definitely play a major factor in increasing the character's survivability. And the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt; should not be counted out either, although without particular gear her ability to assist in later stages of the game diminishes by quite a bit. Although the weapons vary, the armor and helmet choices are mostly stock, with some variance in regards to armor.\nMechanics.\nVengeance: Vengeance is a skill that adds elemental damage to every successful attack.\nConviction: Conviction is a necessary for causing the highest possible damage with Vengeance, since it reduces the resistances of enemies, some important points."}

One night, as Ayuzhan slept, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malphas\"&gt;Malphas&lt;/a&gt; possessed him, taking advantage of Ayuzhan's isolation and the cracks in his mind.

The Wanderer explained that the demon had also possessed people in &lt;a href=\"Gea%20Kul\"&gt;Gea Kul&lt;/a&gt;.

Ayuzhan pointed out that he could hear the Loom operating beneath them, despite Kulle's claims.\nIt was at this point that Ayuzhan caught sight of his reflection in the mirror. He realized that he had become an old man, and wondered how many years had passed. Malphas whispered to them, explaining that he had used Ayuzhan to repair the Loom. The pair were attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Herald%20of%20Malphas\"&gt;Herald of Malphas&lt;/a&gt; and its corrupted constructs, but the Wanderer was able to defeat Malphas's minions.

His training consisted of &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt;play, keeping his village safe, and spiritual studies. While carrying out these studies, he began to manifest &lt;a href=\"werebear\"&gt;lycanthropic&lt;/a&gt; abilities, which is &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Skeld\"&gt;Clan Skeld&lt;/a&gt; called \"the gift of the spiritbeast.\" He was urged to meditate, in order to master his skill. He committed himself to the task, but one day, lost control and transformed into a Werebear. Losing himself to the transformation, instinct bid that he run to the only place of comfort that he knew...home.\nHome was his village, and his people ran away in terror. Entering his tent, he found Grey there, and in his rage, severely wounded. It was at this moment that Azgar realized what he had done, and reverted to his &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; form. Thinking that he had killed his brother, he fled the village, hiding in the forest and evading the Druids (his father included) that searched for him. He knew that he could never afford to return to his village, lest his rage get the better of him again. To his joy, he learnt that Grey was still alive, though his attack had blinded him. He spent his remaining days defending the village from the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nRage.\nYears after his exile, Azgar was found by a child of his village, who told him that minions of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; (who was marching on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;) were threatening the village. All of their &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s were away on a different offensive, and only a handful of guards were left to defend the village. Without aid, they wouldn't survive. Azgar told the child his story, who while surprised to hear his version of events, nonetheless still pleaded with him to come to their aid. Azgar relented, and found his kindred under attack by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Azgar leapt into the fray with his sword, and as the demons overwhelmed him, took on his Werebear form. Azgar slew all the demons, but one of them fatally impaled him.\nAzgar fell to the ground in his human form, dying. Grey, who was still alive, came to him, telling Azgar that he never held him responsible for what had happened all those years ago, and that he knew that Azgar had always been watching over them. Before Azgar died, he told him he would always have a place of honor within the clan."}

{"id": "38984", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=38984", "title": "Azmodan", "text": "Azmodan, the Lord of Sin is a &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evil&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; and was the last of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; to be trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAs with all the Evils, Azmodan originated from one of the seven heads of the great dragon\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;. He lorded over the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Realm of Sin&lt;/a&gt;. For much of his existence he desired to be the sole ruler of Hell.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, Azmodan successfully defeated his &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic foes many times on the battlefields of &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;. In one such battle, Azmodan faced the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrael bested him and stood ready to deal the final blow. However, one of Tyrael's &lt;a href=\"Ardleon\"&gt;comrades&lt;/a&gt; called for aid and Tyrael rushed to lend aid. Azmodan thus escaped the angel's wrath. In another battle against Tyrael (or possibly the same), Azmodan came under direct attack by his angel foes, who were able to use their wings to outmanauver his host and assault him directly. Frustrated by his near defeat, Azmodan began breeding &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Hellflyer\"&gt;winged demons&lt;/a&gt; capable of tearing the angels asunder.\nIn another battle, Azmodan fought alongside his fellow demons against angels, among which &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; was present.\nSeeds of Rebellion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt; was waged by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; secretly, the existence of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; kept from the Lesser Evils. This lack of trust soured relations between the Lords of Hell. What enraged Azmodan and his allies even further was that the Primes seemed intent on converting Man to their side of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt; rather than fighting the war directly. \nAzmodan's first attempt to wrest power involved his close followers\u2014&lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s that performed acts that he could not or would not be involved in. However, the attempt failed and in his wrath, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; turned Azmodan's followers into the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20One%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Fallen Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The infuriated Azmodan held them responsible for the Prime Evils' continued reign, and so he left the fallen in their new bodies, where their degradation would serve to amuse him for all eternity. However, the fallen demons had nonetheless provided him with valuable information.\nThe Dark Exile.\nBelieving that they were innately superior to mortal kind, and that their war against the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; was theirs alone to fight, the Lesser Evils enacted a stratagem to overthrow the Primes. Led by Azmodan and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Lies, the rebel demons claimed dominion over much of the Burning Hells. Although the Primes exacted a heavy toll on the rebels, they were, in the end, banished to the mortal realm, weakened and bodiless. Azmodan believed that with the Three set loose upon humanity, Heaven would be forced to turn their focus to the mortal plane, thus leaving Heaven potentially vulnerable to attack.\nMost accounts state that Azmodan and Belial soon turned on each other, relations souring as they began arguing over who should ascend to the highest rank of the Burning Hells. When the bickering turned to violence, their pact was forgotten, and Hell's denizens found themselves having to choose their allegiance once again. The result was another civil war. Yet others say that there was no falling out between Azmodan and Belial in the first place, and that they began conspiring to subjugate all life to their will. In truth, Belial and Azmodan did wage war, claiming entire realms as their own. By the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Azmodan had held the advantage in the Hells' civil war for awhile. However, the two demons nonetheless came to share the same goal of subjugating humanity into their fold. Not content with ruling over the Realm of Sin, Azmodan set his sights on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nHarbingers of Sin.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, Azmodan apparently tried to claim the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Realm of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; as his own, sending demons through &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Portal\"&gt;Hell Portal&lt;/a&gt;s into the realm. However, the portals were closed by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasion of Sanctuary.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, Azmodan and Belial controlled half of Hell each. While not necessarily enemies at this point, they were still \"more rivals than allies.\"\nAfter Belial's defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, Azmodan contacted Diablo through his mortal host, &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;. He revealed that he intended to lead a full-scale invasion of Sanctuary to find and claim the Black Soulstone with which he could become a fusion of all the Great Evils, the Prime Evil. The vision held true and Azmodan's armies poured forth from the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt; and laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis lieutenants, the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20Lieutenants\"&gt;Sin Lieutenants&lt;/a&gt;, were introduced, with &lt;a href=\"Ghom\"&gt;Ghom, the Lord of Gluttony&lt;/a&gt;, storming the depths of Bastion's Keep while the Nephalem rallied the stronghold's defenders and raised its catapults. Azmodan projected his visage to his foes in an effort to strike fear into their hearts, but had the effect of him unintentionally prematurely revealing his plans. The Nephalem destroyed Ghom and fought their way across the battlefield, destroying Azmodan's war machines. Once again, Azmodan appeared as a vision before The Nephalem, stating that even the destruction of his war machines didn't matter, that he could count on a limitless supply of demons to reinforce his army. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; was unfazed, stating that all Azmodan had left to hurl at them were words.\nAzmodan's consort, &lt;a href=\"Cydaea\"&gt;Cydaea the Mistress of Lust&lt;/a&gt;, tried to slow the Nephalem as they fought through the portion of Hell just inside the crater and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20Heart\"&gt;Sin Heart&lt;/a&gt;s, relics from the depths of Hell that empower the demons. Eventually Cydaea was slain as well and the Sin Hearts were destroyed.\nAt last the Nephalem confronted Azmodan himself, who reiterated his desire to become the Prime Evil. His plan was ultimately left unfulfilled when Azmodan was defeated and his spirit was sealed within the Black Soulstone, making him the final of the Great Evils to be locked in the stone. Shortly afterwards one of &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Diablo's secret operatives&lt;/a&gt; revealed the Lord of Terror's own plan to become the Prime Evil had reached fruition and the Black Soulstone was bound to &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah's&lt;/a&gt; body, through which Diablo manifested himself and proceeded to assault the High Heavens.\nLegacy.\nDiablo was defeated, and the Lords of Hell were imprisoned in the Black Soulstone, their souls screaming for vengeance and release. The artifact was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, which released Diablo, still bearing the essences of Azmodan and the other Evils. Eventually however, Azmodan's spirit was able to break free from Diablo, just as all the other Evils.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nAzmodan briefly appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" during the character select sequence of the &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the final version, Azmodan is replaced by a generic demon.\nHis actions are referenced in the \"&lt;a href=\"Harbingers%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Harbingers of Sin&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;, though Azmodan himself is not seen.\nDiablo III.\nAzmodan is the primary antagonist and end &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; of . He is first mentioned in the game in when &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; explains the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;, who worship the last remaining Evils, &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; and Azmodan. Azmodan is more heavily foreshadowed in , when &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; speculates that finding Belial may lead to Azmodan, although &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; correctly guesses that he will be found elsewhere, since they are more rivals than allies at this time. Azmodan makes his grand entrance in the &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; between Acts II and III, as Leah has a vision of his invasion from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, in which he proclaims his defiance to her and/or the soul of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; within her, and his intent to conquer &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and claim the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; for himself. He taunts the Nephalem throughout Act III, appearing as a fiery visage floating in the air.\nHe is eventually found and fought in the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Sin%20%28Area%29\"&gt;Heart of Sin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Core%20of%20Arreat\"&gt;The Core of Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. The Heart is a circular arena with a large central pillar, surrounded by chain barriers, and combat starts once player enters the ring. Azmodan moves and attacks slowly, but the main danger is his abilities. He has a total of six, most of them used regardless of whether or not he is currently performing any other attack:\nOn &lt;a href=\"Torment%20difficulty\"&gt;Torment difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, Azmodan has a hard enrage timer of 3 minutes. Once it expires, Pools of Destruction will cover the entire arena and will not fade until the fight ends.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;s representing the seven Evils could be obtained and used during &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;s 25 and 30. The &lt;a href=\"Stain%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Stain of Sin&lt;/a&gt; represents Azmodan.\nOther.\nAzmodan appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Chess\"&gt;Diablo Chess&lt;/a&gt;\". He represents his side's knight piece.\nAzmodan is a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//heroesofthestorm.wikia.com/Azmodan\"&gt;playable character&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". He retains his Black Pool, Eye Beam and Globe of Annihilation attacks, as well as ability to summon &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Trooper\"&gt;Demon Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPersonality and Traits.\nAzmodan is a clever manipulator who traded in vice and corruption. Passionate and plotting, he is by far the most charismatic and seductive of the Great Evils. He loveds vice in all its forms, but the truest gratification he derives is that from the failure of others. He is a master of temptation, of causing those who held steadfastly to principles and beliefs to ultimately betray them. He exists only to shred morality, and to bring all within his sphere of pleasure to the point of breaking, believing that all beings find their truest identity by embracing the far limits of perversion and depravity. No stranger to oppulence or granduer, greed and pride are among Azmodan's favorite sins. He was close to all of his Sin Lieutenants, with &lt;a href=\"Cydaea\"&gt;Cydaea&lt;/a&gt;, the Maiden of Lust being his favorite. He considered her to be \"very distracting.\"\nAzmodan was never content with his place in Hell, and always sought more power. He despises the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, considering them to be \"creation's greatest sin.\" He had a low opinion of Belial as well.\nAzmodan was regarded as an \"uncanny tactician,\" cunning, and attacked when his foes would least expect it. However, he also possessed a degree of overconfidence and arrogance, his dealings with the Nephalem at Bastion's Keep being an example.\nAzmodan's true form is corpulent. He walks on six insect-like legs which, along with his torso, are opulently decorated with treasures and trophies. His face features a large, glowing mouth full of dagger-like teeth and a forked tongue, and his visage has four glowing eyes. From his back, two large horn-shaped appendages extended.\nTrivia.\n&lt;a href=\"Az-Lo\"&gt;Az-Lo&lt;/a&gt;, a miniature version of Azmodan, is available as a non-combat pet in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

He never got tired of it, partly because he never exhausted all the opportunities for wanton destruction.\nOne rare exception where Baal worked with his brothers was the &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Battle%20of%20the%20Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Fifth Battle of the Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt;. So certain of their impending victory, the Prime Evils turned on each other, battling over spoils they had yet to win. Their discord allowed the forces of Heaven to drive them back.\nThe Sin War.\nWhile leading his forces on the battlefields of &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;, Mephisto noticed that the angels were withdrawing. He ordered his forces to withdraw so he could analyze the situation. Baal, losing patience, stormed the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; was missing. The angels he killed could not enlighten him to its whereabouts. However, Baal did have his suspicions, and pointed out to Mephisto that &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; was missing. Believing her to be responsible for the Worldstone's disapearance, he demanded that they find her, kill her, and take the Worldstone back.\nDue to the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt;, the powers of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; came to learn of the existence of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;inhabitants&lt;/a&gt;. Diablo informed his brothers of this new world's existance. Sensing the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;dormant power&lt;/a&gt; within humanity and reasoning it could be turned to suit their own ends, the Prime Evils began a campaign to tip humanity over to their side. To this end, they founded the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a seemingly benevolent religion that was actually a front for their true motives. Each of the Primes took on an alter ego for worship and in Baal's case, he was known as Bala, the Spirit of Creation, represented by a leaf in Triune iconography. \"Bala\" was depicted as wielding a hammer when he himself was portrayed, along with a bag, which the Triune's priests preached contained the seeds of all life. Both nature and the architectural triumphs of humanity were said to be under the auspecies of his spirit.\nThe Triune's efforts to ensnare humanity were hindered by the rogue angel &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; however, who founded the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the conflict ended with both Heaven and Hell agreeing to respect Sanctuary's neutrality in the Great Conflict. After the war, the &lt;a href=\"Overlord\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; of Inarius were gifted to Baal.\nThe Dark Exile.\nBaal and his brothers had kept Sanctuary's existence a secret from the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;, and that had driven a wedge between them. That they continued to be interested in Man's potential after the Sin War did not sit well also and the Lesser Evils rose up in rebellion. Baal and his brothers were banished into Sanctuary in what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;. In truth, this was a plan on the Primes' part to corrupt the Worldstone and corrupt humanity. While Baal and his brothers were free to wreak havoc for a few decades, their presence came to be discovered by the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, who formed the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; to find and capture the three brothers.\nThe banishment of the Prime Evils from Hell to the mortal plane also left them incorporeal. In other to acquire a physical form, they required a body for their spirit to possess. Over time their demonic presence twisted the victims human flesh into grotesque simulacrums of their physical form.\nIn time, both Baal and Diablo journeyed west across the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; to the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Aware of the pursuing Horadrim, Baal took refuge in the city of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; while the Horadrim patiently waited. After three days, Baal fled north, the Horadrim in close pursuit. Baal had hoped that the harsh wasteland would deter the Horadrim, but the mortals kept up their pursuit.\nIn the end, Baal stood his ground, directing his powers of destruction against the Horadrim, summoning a force of demons to engage them. However, they would not be swayed. Baal ended up facing &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; in single combat, before Horadrim led by Zoltun Kulle arrived, aiding Tal Rasha in incapacitating the Lord of Destruction. The two used the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; against him, intent on sealing his essence inside it, but Baal was able to shatter it, before escaping through a portal into the valley below. \nTal Rasha &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed after him, while Kulle led the Horadrim through Baal's forces, finally arriving to aid Tal Rasha. In a battle as vicious as the last, the Horadrim battled Baal before incapacitating him, and sealing him inside the soulstone fragment. However, the shard would not be able to hold Baal for long.\nThanks to &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, a surrogate soulstone would be created. Heading underground into the burial chambers of long-dead kings, the Horadrim built a binding stone etched with runes of containment in one of the largest tombs. Tal Rasha ordered his brethren to contain him, upon which, a sorrowful Tyrael jammed the broken soulstone into his chest, sealing his fate and transferring Baal's essence into his body. The Horadrim departed, leaving Tal Rasha to wrestle with Baal's spirit, presumably for all eternity.\nThe Corruption of Tal Rasha.\nTal Rasha's physical form began to wither away as hunger and thirst took their toll. He was left a hairsbreadth shy of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, and his deteriorating body was no longer entirely his. Baal, controlling Tal Rasha's body, struggled to escape, but could not break free of the bonds.\nTo break Tal Rasha's mind, Baal kept showing him the moment where he and Kulle had bound him to the soulstone fragment, but subtly reworked it, introducing shades of doubt and fear to make Tal Rasha doubt himself. Always, Tal Rasha saw through the illusion, but each time, it took him a little longer to realize that it was falsehood. In Tal Rasha's mind, Baal mocked him, telling Tal Rasha that his mind was crumbling, and that eventually, it would be reduced to ash, and the Lord of Destruction freed. \nOver the centuries, the soulstone became infused with Baal's destructive essence.\nThe Release of Destruction.\nCenturies after his impirosnment, Baal was released at the hands of Diablo (in the guise of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; kept the Wanderer at bay, Baal was able to dupe Marius into freeing him. Baal joined his brother and Tyrael was captured. Unfortunately for Baal, Marius had escaped with his soulstone.\nWith the Lords of Destruction and Terror wearing the guises of the Dark Wanderer and Tal Rasha respectively, the brothers arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, where they reunited with Mephisto. In the depths of the temple, they planned their stratagem. Baal would travel north to corrupt the Worldstone. Through it, humanity and its nephalem birthright would fall into enslavement, and through their nephalem birthright, would be enough to re-establish the Primes' place in Hell. However, to fulfill his role, Baal had to re-obtain his soulstone. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would later theorize that as the soulstone had been infused with his destructive essence over the centuries, it would be vital to corrupting the Worldstone.\nDestruction Unleashed.\nBaal tracked down &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt; in a sanitarium in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, disguising himself as &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, where the man told his tale of the journey he had taken with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. Marius recounted his experiences, and handed the soulstone over. Baal revealed his true colors and slew the man, setting the sanitarium ablaze as he exited.\nNow possessing the shard, Baal traveled north, butchering entire villages en route to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. Those who were slain were possessed and transformed into demonic soldiers. Every act of destruction committed by Baal and his minions increased the shard's power. Thus, rather than approach Mount Arreat through stealth, Baal's approach meant that the soulstone (now named the &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Shard of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;) pulsed with untold corruptive energies. Additionally, he summoned a legion of demons to his side that reveled in destruction and chaos. Baal swore that his brothers would not have died in vain, and that he would rule unchallenged.\nAssault on Mount Arreat.\nBy the time Baal reached the lands of the s, his &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Army of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; numbered in the thousands. By all accounts, the Barbarians fought ferociously, yet it was not enough to stop Baal from storming their lands. Reaching the gates of &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;, the Barbarians attempted a parlay with the demon, but Baal casually killed the emissary and ordered his forces to attack. The few survivors of the assault later described Baal as being atop his litter, surveying the city with ravenous malice and an insatiable lust for destruction.\nSoon, all that stood between Baal and the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Summit\"&gt;Arreat Summit&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;. To stave off Baal's assault, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed themselves to enact a warding spell to keep Baal's forces at bay. Nonetheless, Baal's forces laid siege to the fortress. The defenders were betrayed by the elder &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt;, the only survivor of the spell. Believing his people would be doomed unless he negotiated a pact with Baal, he provided the Lord of Destruction with the &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Relic of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for sparing Harrogath. With the relic in hand, Baal raced up the slopes of the mountain, able to bypass the mountain's guardians thanks to the relic. In the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20Chamber\"&gt;Worldstone Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, Baal fused the Shard of Destruction with the Worldstone. All of the strife and horror that had accumulated within the shard began to spread through the gargantuan crystal.\nYet Baal's plans were stymied by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;; the same group that had defeated his brothers. After a ferocious battle, Baal was defeated, yet the Worldstone was already past saving. To save humanity, Tyrael threw &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt; into the stone, destroying it. In the ensuring explosion, Baal's body was obliterated, and in the belief of Deckard Cain, his spirit banished to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt; to join his brothers. The shards of the Worldstone remained corrupted, and &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt; later, would bring even more misery to the world.\nDestruction's Wake.\nWith his soulstone fused to the Worldstone, the Worldstone itself became a soulstone for Baal. With his death, his soul was sealed within the Worldstone. He battled Tyrael (who was also trapped in the Worldstone) in a shattered realm, which reflected the state of the Worldstone, as the angel struggled to keep him sealed. As Baal's soul began to reform, he started to overpower his foe.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt; tried to purge a shard of the Worldstone from Baal's taint at the &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt;, they inadvertently opened a way for both Baal and Tyrael, whose souls lingered in the fragments of the Worldstone. The angel tried to keep him bound, but was swiftly overpowered. Baal was defeated by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; shortly after he escaped from the shard.\nAt some point after the event, demons loyal to Baal gathered in a vile attempt to resurrect their master.\nPrime Evil.\nBaal's essence ended up in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, as per the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;. He was the third of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; to be marked, coming after &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;. When Adria came across the remains of his spirit, she discovered that like Duriel, he yearned to bring about the End of Days. He quickly learnt the truth of Diablo's plan, to use his essence to become a singular Prime Evil, and that Adria was imprisoning him until that day came to pass. However, to Adria's surprise, Baal didn't lash out, but rather, felt something close to amusement from him.\nTwenty years after his defeat at Arreat, the day came to pass, and Baal briefly merged Diablo as a single Prime Evil. However, Diablo was defeated by a new hero and the Great Evils were drawn back into the Black Soulstone, their souls screaming for release. Because of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, the stone was destroyed, and Diablo was freed, still retaining the essences of the other Evils. Eventually however, Baal's spirit was able to break free from Diablo, just as all the other Evils.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nBaal is the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo Immortal.\nBaal appears as a boss in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOther.\nBaal and the other Prime Evils' manuscripts can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Battlefields%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Battlefields of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Act%20V%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Fragment of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; is named in reference to him.\nBaal appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Chess\"&gt;Diablo Chess&lt;/a&gt;\". He represents Hell's bishop piece.\nPersonality and Traits.\nThe most reckless and brash of the Prime Evils, Baal revels in utter annihilation, not only of the world around him, but those who dwell in it. This is regardless as to whether he incites or inspires such destruction.\nOn the surface, Baal appears to be the most base and easiest to comprehend of the Prime Evils, and many have claimed as such. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; wrote in opposition to this, maintaining that Baal is just as cunning and nefarious as his siblings; quite capable of using strategy and deception to further his goals. &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; once speculated what might happen if Baal succeeded in reducing Heaven and Sanctuary to ash. Would he destroy Hell likewise? Would he destroy himself? Or was he clever enough to ensure that such a thing never came to pass, embracing defeat, death, and rebirth, lest his cycle of annihilation be jeopardized?\nBaal has shown a sadistic side in the murder of his foes. He frequently indulged in feasts of human flesh and blood with his brothers. &lt;a href=\"Spitting%20Terror\"&gt;Creatures&lt;/a&gt; would feed off the remnants of such feasts.\nThose who follow Baal prefer to surround their enemies and attack from all sides simultaneously, and are bred for strength and agility. They seek the undoing of Creation, striving for disorder and destruction. To Baal's minions, Order is anathema, and his lieutenants are bred for strength, endurance, and cunning, constantly training themselves in the art of war. Many of Baal's demons are intangible on the mortal plane.\nLike his brothers, Baal, by his nature, is confrontational. It is his desire that the Eternal Conflict be fought forever, and his vision for Sanctuary was to be a wasteland stained with &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;."}

When confronted in \"Diablo II\", Baal moves on four insectoid legs. Compared to his brother Diablo, Baal still retains some humanoid features Granted, it is only his upper torso, which is pale, emaciated, and skeletal. Most likely one of the most recognizable traits of Baal is his Festering Appendages, tentacles that manifest in various places on his body. In battle, Baal summons these from the ground to impede the player's path.\nTips and Other Additional Information.\nBefore the encounter, Baal summons monsters from each Act. Once all 5 groups of monsters are slain, Baal will go into the Worldstone Chamber. Baal is the final boss in and possesses a variety of deadly special attacks. He has moves such as:\nThe duplicate is not as strong as Baal and does not drop any &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;. The player can identify the duplicate by looking at their names. The duplicate has the word \"&lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;\" right below the 'B' in his name (so that the B and the D are perfectly aligned) and has no light radius. The real Baal has the word \"Demon\" centered below his name, as with most monsters.\nWhile he does not use the ability in the final battle, he displayed use of the spell &lt;a href=\"Blaze\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt; in the final cinematic of Diablo II as a swarm of scarabs follow him. This is a skill more useful for humanoids, and not as useful in his quadruped form, as he does not move around very much.\nHe also seems to be capable of some form of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing\"&gt;remote viewing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-sensory_perception\"&gt;extrasensory perception&lt;/a&gt;. This is evident when players, if they stand at one place anywhere in the Worldstone Keep, find themselves suddenly attacked by an unseen assailant, while a terrible laughter (none other than Baal's) is heard from nowhere. This also means that he is capable of manipulating far-away surroundings, since he should be in the Throne of Destruction."}

They believe that all Creation exists in a delicate balance between &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;; birth/renewal and infection/rot. Should either side gain control, &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; would fall into ruin. Their beliefs state that falling to Light and Darkness are equally as horrific a fate for mankind. Falling to the Darkness would result in the world being ruled by Hell. Falling to the Light would lead humanity to stagnation and a loss of conscience. By maintaining the Balance, the priests believe that they ensure that neither &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s will gain too much sway over humanity. They do not see their actions as being good or evil, simply obedience in service to the Balance.\nThe priests hold sacred the delicate balance of life and death and are able to &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;twist the line&lt;/a&gt; that borders the two. They see death merely as a natural part of life and do not seek to deny its arrival. To the priests, the actions one takes in life are as important as those that occur after death. They hold &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt; as the fulcrum of the Balance. They believe that when one dies, their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; passes into the next plane of existence, where they will fulfill another role for the Balance.\nThe Necromancers believe that numbers influence the Balance, and that certain numbers will shift it in one way or another. They believe that even the slightest imbalance in the Cycle can lead to catastrophe.\nThe Balance extends to even the &lt;a href=\"animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt; of Sanctuary. As humanity gained the upperhand in intelligence and tools, beasts of the forest became more silent, more deadly, more swift.\nOther Beliefs.\n&lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s believe that &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s are the only truly balanced beings in Creation, as per their &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; heritage and the mingling of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s that produced their forebears. \n&lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Kabraxis&lt;/a&gt; believed in a balance between Light and Darkness. He claimed that by entering Sanctuary, demons sow the seeds of their own downfall, which allows the Balance to be maintained. Likewise, all those who follow the Light have a weakness which may be exploited. &lt;a href=\"Taramis\"&gt;Taramis&lt;/a&gt; similarly believed that Light and Darkness balance each other, and that the greatest threat to the Balance is humanity itself.\nSome believe that the world should be cleansed of both demons and angels, that Light and Darkness should be erradicated, and humanity be left free to find its own path.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monks of Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; worship gods of order and chaos. Every monk must struggle to achieve balance between order and chaos, and do this by accepting the gods of both with closed eyes. A good monk employs both order and chaos, but the best monks resist indulging in either.\n&lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the Balance, but saw no virtue in the concept. To him, worth only existed in the Light.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Animus%20Revenants\"&gt;Animus Revenants&lt;/a&gt; heeded Rathma's teachings on the Balance, though their primary loyalties lay with &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Balazan\"&gt;Balazan&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Guardian\"&gt;Spirit Guardian&lt;/a&gt; who represents the cycle of death in the &lt;a href=\"Spiritborn\"&gt;Spiritborn&lt;/a&gt;'s belief system.\nHistory.\nTrag'Oul was the first being to understand the Balance.\nRathma spent his early years studying the cycle of life and death, and imparted his discoveries to those willing to find him. Among the first generation of humanity, he discovered a fundamental truth; that the forces of Light and Darkness would clash eternally, and that both were a threat to the world. \nTrag'Oul imparted the concept of the Balance to Mendeln during the Sin War. The Priests of Rathma strove to uphold the Balance, and always feared the day when the Balance would be lost. After the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, the priests received portents foretelling a looming disaster. The masters of the order spent years trying to decipher them.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening&lt;/a&gt;, philosophers swear that Sanctuary drifts further from Balance each year, and Rathma's followers cling to a world of wet sand with their fingertips.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, the Balance was threatened, prompting the Priests of Rathma to dispatch an &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt; to help restore it. The acolyte declared that the Balance had been lost, that the fears of the Priests had come true. \nThe Balance was again disturbed by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s resurrection of the dead \"en masse\". As it was, the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; was the portent the priests had received, and the Necromancers lost many of their number to Malthael's forces. However, &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; was able to defeat Malthael by gaining the powers of death, becoming closer to the Cycle than any Necromancer before him/her."}

He became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Luminarei\"&gt;Luminarei&lt;/a&gt;. At some point he visited the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;; he saw Imperius's trophies as being a source of inspiration for angels to fight with courage and rightousness.\nStorm of Light.\nThe Black Soulstone.\nBalzael fought in defense of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt;. He demonstrated great heroism during the battle and slew more &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s than any other angel. However, he lost many fellow Luminarei in the battle, and the ordeal left him shaken. That &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; had succeeded where the Luminarei had failed did not do his pride any favors, and he rationalized that the Nephalem had transcended their human origins. He became determined to never let such a thing happen again. In the aftermath of the battle, Imperius granted him a position of being his \"right hand.\" &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; noted that Balzael grew more arrogant after being granted the position. Imperius also entrusted him with training a small group of angels to become &lt;a href=\"Sicarai\"&gt;Sicarai&lt;/a&gt;, who Balzael sent on missions to clean up rogue packs of demons wherever they could be found. \nBalzael was also assigned to guard the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. At some point he fell into league with Malthael, whom he referred to as \"the Guardian.\" It was Malthael's plan that the Black Soulstone corrupt the Council long enough so that they would decided to unleash the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; upon &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, eradicating &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. It was a goal that Balzael was happy to help reach fruition. In his mind, Heaven's survival depended on the eradication of Man. In the meantime he spied on Tyrael, his opinion of the angel declining as he saw him carry out the ordeals of mortal life. He tried to convince Imperius that Tyrael should be imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"the%20Fist\"&gt;the Fist&lt;/a&gt; for his crimes, but Imperius refused. He nonetheless mocked Tyrael when he attended a &lt;a href=\"Lightsong\"&gt;Lightsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following day, Balzael denied Tyrael entry to the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council%20Chamber\"&gt;Angiris Council Chamber&lt;/a&gt; in which it was held, his contempt for the former &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; shining through. Auriel dismissed him and he left the two to speak. He watched from the shadows as the two discussed the revisiting of the Council's decision to spare &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. He resolved to contact the Guardian on recent events.\nBalzael encountered Tyrael as he left the session without leave. Balzael mocked him, and Tyrael drew &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt;. The two angels dueled until the fight was halted by Imperius. Balzael stated that Tyrael should be thrown into &lt;a href=\"the%20Ring\"&gt;the Ring&lt;/a&gt;, but Imperius ordered Balzael to let Tyrael go.\nDeath in Heaven.\nTyrael disappeared soon after. It didn't take Balzael long to track him to &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; in Sanctuary, in the company of a group of humans. Imperius ordered that Tyrael be retrieved, and that while killing the humans was permissible, Tyrael was to be taken alive. Balzael tried to sway Imperius's judgement, but the archangel had none of it, and Balzael, on the face of it, acquiesed to his orders, telling him that he would send his best Sicarai. In that, he obeyed. But instead he ordered the Sicarai to kill Tyrael and all his companions.\nThe Sicarai failed, and returned to Heaven wounded. Aggrieved, he considered unleashing the Luminarei then and there upon humanity, but abstained, as the Council had not yet darkened enough to agree with his plans of genocide. Balzael demanded that the Sicarai tell him everything.\nBalzael watched a Lightsong before the Sicarai returned, having failed. Again. Tyrael and his companions had retreated into &lt;a href=\"Corvus\"&gt;Corvus&lt;/a&gt;, which no non-mortal could enter due to the nephalem shielding that protected it. The Sicarai informed him that it was likely Tyrael and his companions were planning to steal the Black Soulstone. In the Pools of Wisdom, Balzael contacted the Guardian on this turn of events. The Guardian informed him of a change in plans\u2014the stone was working too slowly. He would bring about the end of humanity in another way.\nThe Sicarai turned out to be right in regards to Tyrael's plan. As the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrael was captured. Balzael came down to his cage, mocking him, but let slip that he had ulterior motives. Balzael didn't elaborate, but it was clear that he intended Tyrael to be a distraction while the stone was stolen. He planned for the Horadrim to steal the stone, and they would intercept them in Sanctuary before they reached Corvus. \nThe drama began, as Balzael took Tyrael and &lt;a href=\"Cullen\"&gt;one of his companions&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Column%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Column of Tears&lt;/a&gt;. He planned to have Imperius come in and watch Tyrael kill his human companion in a forced display, where Balzael would be given no recourse bar killing Tyrael. Imperius would be distracted from the Horadrim, and he would see that Balzael would truly have no choice. In spite of it all, he gave Tyrael one chance to join them. Tyrael refused, but was spared from being executioner, as the Horadrim mounted a rescue.\nIn the commotion, Tyrael pursued Balzael to the &lt;a href=\"Courts%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Courts of Justice&lt;/a&gt;. Balzael remained defiant\u2014the Black Soulstone would enter Sanctuary, and the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; stood ready to enact the Guardian's plans. The two did battle, with Balzael gaining the upperhand. Before he could finish off his foe, he was impaled from behind by Imperius. Balzael screamed with such force that the room's crystal dome shattered. His wound grew brighter and brighter until he faded away to nothing. As Imperius later explained, he had never intended Balzael to be Tyrael's executioner.\nPersonality and Traits.\nBalzael saw himself as a fierce warrior, battle-hardened and afraid of nothing, though even he could be cowed by Imperius. He despised humans, to the extent that even Tyrael's mortal form (e.g. presence of flesh) disgusted him, and saw them as being akin to animals. In his mind, they also cared far too much about each other. He saw the Nephalem as being an exception to baseline humanity.

{"id": "3408", "revid": "45045523", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3408", "title": "Barbarian (Diablo III)", "text": "The Barbarians were the first of five classes to be confirmed in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". They play similarly to the previous \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" , with a few skills from that game carried over to the third installment.\nLore.\nFor ages, the s dwelling in the shadow of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; were shaped to be as strong and unyielding as stone. Immense in size and unmatched in ferocity, they were charged from birth with a duty passed through generations: to protect the sacred mountain. and the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; within. When their homeland was shattered and the Worldstone destroyed, many Barbarians lost faith. They became aimless, haunted by their past, traveling from place to place without honor or direction.\nBut not all Barbarians have given up their vigil. Some still honor the harsh snows of Arreat's summit and prowl the outskirts of its &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;crater&lt;/a&gt;. They recall being handed &lt;a href=\"Axe%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;axes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spear%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; at an age when city children were clinging to their toys...and they burn with shame at the failure of their people. These Barbarians strive to find a new purpose for themselves in a changed world, and they will crush any who stand in their way.\nAmong these Barbarians is one who searches for hope. Through the evil that has taken hold of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, this Barbarian sees a means to rekindle the Barbarian culture, and give them a reason to fight. Only in the midst of combat does this Barbarian truly feel alive. A peerless combatant, this Barbarian may appear to lack finesse, but is renowned for their weapons expertise. Strong and noble, fearless and resolute, the Barbarian is a warrior to the core. Yet the Barbarian grew weary of battle that were once craved. But with the sight of a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;fallen star&lt;/a&gt;, the Barbarian was drawn to &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to find what they had long sought\u2014a foe worthy of their blade.\nGameplay.\nThe Barbarian class is based on physical strength, which stems from his/her connection to &lt;a href=\"the%20Ancients\"&gt;the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Thematically, the Barbarian is based around earth and might.\nAs the Barbarian is a class specializing in brutal melee combat, all who choose to play as one will gain +30% built-in damage reduction, before all other factors are counted in. Most skills are designed for close combat (or short to medium range), and only melee weapons can be used. Barbarians may equip &lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Belts\"&gt;Mighty Belts&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Weapons\"&gt;Mighty Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20Mighty%20Weapons\"&gt;Two-Handed Mighty Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, which are simply too heavy for any other class. Barbarians can use &lt;a href=\"dual-wielding\"&gt;dual-wielding&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn battle, Barbarians are an endless barrage of melee blows, becoming stronger with each strike, and even as enemies damage them. Barbarians make extensive use of 'on hit' and 'on kill' effects, becoming deadlier as the combat rages on.\nOn the Hero Creation screen, the following is stated: \"The Barbarian moves aggressively, unleashing a multitude of attacks on enemies. Fury drives the Barbarian's assaults and is generated in the thick of combat by dealing and receiving damage.\"\nBarbarians have six class sets in game:\nSkills.\nThe Barbarian's skills are very similar to those of\u00a0 from Diablo II, only much more primal, savage and, in a way, more spiritual. Some of the crowd-control skills like &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Ward\"&gt;Grim Ward&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0are missing, yet many more have come to replace them.\nOriginally, the skill trees were divided into three distinct play-styles (read builds) with the Juggernaut being especially liked by the fanbase because of the overall coolness of the name, as well as the great variety of all-purpose skills in the tree. However, later the three-tree system was replaced.\nUnlike their previous incarnations, the barbarian now uses &lt;a href=\"Fury\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt; for their skills. This system, combined with short range of attacks, forces the Barbarian to remain in combat for a long time, always in melee, making them vulnerable to effects that other classes can easily outrun. Reckless assault of a Barbarian can be deadly for the enemy, yet it also brings high risk for the fearless warrior.\nAlmost all skills are &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt;, but can be modified to use &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage type. Many of them are variations of crushing melee blows, hitting multiple enemies at the same time. &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bleed\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; are frequent side effects, as well as &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt; with certain runes. Notable skills are &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Spear\"&gt;Ancient Spear&lt;/a&gt; that may (depending on rune choice) drag enemies\u00a0\"towards\u00a0\"the Barbarian, leaving little chance of escape, &lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Call of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; that summons spirits of the legendary warrior keepers of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, and the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Berserker\"&gt;Wrath of the Berserker&lt;/a&gt;, which turns the Barbarian into a striding giant with molten skin of living metal. Barbarians may fight through the worst of injuries, &lt;a href=\"Ignore%20Pain\"&gt;endure pain&lt;/a&gt; that would kill a weaker warrior, &lt;a href=\"Earthquake\"&gt;quake the ground&lt;/a&gt; with their very treads and call forth unstoppable &lt;a href=\"avalanche\"&gt;avalanche&lt;/a&gt;s from the sky. &lt;a href=\"War%20Cry%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;War Cries&lt;/a&gt; and return as well.\nPopular Barbarian Skill combinations include:\nDevelopment.\nThe Barbarian was a \"must have\" in \"Diablo III\" for &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, and the first class created for the game. During development, there was some talk to make a Barbarian-like class that wasn\u2019t called Barbarian. However, in Wilson's mind, these concepts failed to pass the , in regards to distinguishing them from the Barbarian archtype. As the first class, the Barbarian became the baseline against which all future classes would be compared. Its model was down-sized in order to fit the environment (e.g. the original model was too big when compared to some doors.\nDuring development, it was originally intended that the male Barbarian be the same individual as the one from Diablo II. This led to issues in the game in that things had to be explained differently to the other characters (newcomers) as opposed to an experienced character. It was later decided that the Diablo III heroes should be unique to the game itself, and thus the characters were made separate. Appearance-wise, the Barbarian originally had a full beard with a mustache, but this was later dropped, with his beard shorter without a mustache.\nThe male Barbarian's design was intended to invoke the world-weariness of his kin in the timeframe of the game\u2014a gray-bearded veteran who can't stop killing demons. Artists referred to the male Barbarian as \"the Barb.\" The female version was designed to be younger than her male counterpart but just as capable. This was reflected in her design, with the artists avoiding a slender build."}

With the Arsenal system, Barbarians can swap between different types of weapons, such as from a heavy two-handed mace to a pair of sharp, agile hand axes, depending on the situation, skill, and your player needs. The Arsenal can be composed out of two two-handed and two one-handed weapons, with affixes applying from all four at once, but only one or two at a time used to resolve attacks.\nBarbarians will be able to haul around four total weapons and swap between them dynamically at any time. You\u2019ll also be able to assign specific weapons to different skills, allowing advanced players even greater depths of customization. Several skills specifically require the equipped weapon to be bludgeoning, such as &lt;a href=\"Maces\"&gt;Maces&lt;/a&gt;, or slashing, such as &lt;a href=\"Swords\"&gt;Swords&lt;/a&gt;; some skills may require &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;Dual Wielding&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons; using such a skill immediately swaps the Arsenal to the best fitting weapons.\nBarbarian may bestow immunity to &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; upon themselves or others, as well as other useful bonuses, via Shouts (working similarly to D2 and D3 skills of the same name).\nMost Barbarian skills will only deal &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage, but the Barbarian has two distinct specializations, either at Red or Orange skills. Warlord (Red) skills and talents generally aim for defense, party bonuses, tactical damage, &lt;a href=\"Bleed\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;ing and opportunity strikes, as well as &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;; while Berserker (Orange) skills go for reckless offense, maximum damage output, self-buffs and speed.\nAs a Barbarian, each point of Strength increases the damage of their skills, while Willpower improves Fury generation, and Dexterity grants critical chance.\nDevelopment.\nWhen designing the Barbarian, classical barbarian imagery was looked at along with the takes on the class from previous games. The arsenal system was added to reflect how, invariably, takes on the Barbarian in the past had always shown the class equipped with heavy weaponry (swords, axes, and polearms)."}

{"id": "5692", "revid": "48080954", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5692", "title": "Barbarian (Hellfire)", "text": "The \"&lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;\" Barbarian can only be played after editing the &lt;a href=\"Command.txt\"&gt;Command.txt&lt;/a&gt; file in the \"Hellfire\" folder, and only in the 1.01 patch. He is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; class and uses the same graphics, but he has unequaled prowess in melee combat, even when reduced to the same tactics as the Warrior, at the costs of no innate magic power and reduced chance to-hit.\nLore.\nFrom the shattered lands of the South this proud race of people hails. A tribal and nomadic culture, the southern Barbarians prayed to no deity and swore allegiance to no leader. This was the reason that when the kingdoms of the East invaded the Barbarian lands, little resistance was found. The scattered villages fought valiantly, each man, woman and child battling to the death against the hordes of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; users from the distant lands, but to no avail. The lands of the Barbarians, beautiful forests and the majestic jungles, were conquered by the East, and the tribes scattered to the four winds. Still proud, the tribes still gather occasionally, but they are small in number. They despised all magic, for it was this mystical force that was used against them in the wars they had fought. Their battles in the war taught them much about magic however. Because of the war against the Eastern &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, all Barbarians have a certain immunity to magic bound within them as a result of so much exposure to the powerful forces. Training in brute strength and physical force was the norm for Barbarians, with great endurance and vitality being praised. They came to be large people, with flaring tempers which makes the blood of a Barbarian truly boil when he is outraged. Chief weapon to the Barbarians was the , for it was this weapon that proved most useful to them in the forests and jungles where they resided. Their great strength allows them to wield other weapons in a single hand, but the axe is still the weapon of choice for most Barbarians.\nIn-game.\nDifferences.\nThe Barbarian has the following differences from the Warrior:\nAdditionally, he gains more damage per strength point and more &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; per vitality than the warrior (when leveling up, he gets 2 hit points and every attribute point spent on vitality also gives him 2 hit points each, but when equipping an item that gives \"+X to vitality\", the barbarian gets 2.5 hit points per vitality point added by this item). Also, the barbarian gains some base damage per vitality point as long as he does not make use of a shield, which can cause his damage to develop into significant amounts at higher levels. Coupled with the 1-12.5% life steal of the Undead Crown, high levels of Strength and Vitality, and a King's Axe of Speed or Haste, he can be efficient with less need for potions than a Warrior of the same level\nHe also gains a +1% resist all each level up and gains more life per level up than the warrior. Thanks to his resistance bonus from levels, another +mana prefix is\u00a0affordable without destroying efficiency. Given his natural +1 for every 4 levels bonus to Armor Class, as well as his stun threshold/hit recovery, he is more robust and more difficult to stun than any other character in the game, helping the use of two-handed swords, mauls or axes, both of the latter of which he is the most proficient and particularly effective in combat with.\nSince the Barbarian has\u00a0no &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28attribute%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and thus zero points of mana (with empty mana orb)\u00a0when naked, he only\u00a0has\u00a0as much mana and magic points as granted by equipped items. This means\u00a0in\u00a0most cases even less mana than the warrior. However he is not prevented from learning any\u00a0spell provided he finds\u00a0equipment to boost his magic up to the requirement\u00a0needed to read the respective book and learn it on spell level 1\u00a0. Boosting spells via Enchanted Shrines thus takes\u00a0Barbarians even more time than other non-sorcerer classes, but is not fundamentally different.\nSpells most useful to a Barbarian:\nAlso, ranged attackers such as &lt;a href=\"succubus\"&gt;succubi&lt;/a&gt; run away when melee characters walk close. When fighting these foes, a warrior could cast to chase them or &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Curse\"&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/a&gt; to paralyze them. Learning these spells as a barbarian is tedious, as it requires gathering lots of +magic gear. A King's Axe of Vampires can help replenish mana used from teleports and stone cursing. A barbarian can use Enchanted Shrines to boost his spell levels (to reduce the casting cost of Teleport and Stone Curse). This is the recommended route to go after getting enough +Magic gear to reach Teleport, as gold is limited by your inventory, and with all the gear a Barbarian would need just to reach it, he'd be hard-pressed to carry enough gold to get by with the costs he must endure to get back in top fighting form.\nThe Barbarian's major weakness is his low Dexterity, the worst of all the character classes, and oddly, no class bonus to hit aside from levels. He will need lots of +% to-hit on his equipment to be able to strike his enemies. Given the facts that he can use a mace and shield combo or an axe and that he swings a mace/axe weapon faster than even a Warrior, a Strange/Weird mace/axe of Swiftness, Speed, or Haste should give him some leeway. Damage dealt per blow is a secondary priority, considering his greater bonus from Strength, as well as his Vitality bonus for going shieldless; a Barbarian does too much damage based on those values to really need a damage affix (+210 for using jewelry with perfect Zodiac suffixes when using maces/axes, and an additional +105 from Vitality for going without a shield, vs. Warrior's +155 at lv. 50 with the same jewelry), whereas the only monsters that would prove to be even close to a threat enough to warrant the extra damage would be &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Na-Krul\"&gt;Na-Krul&lt;/a&gt;, both of which have a hit recovery time outdone by a weapon with a sufficient bonus to attack speed. If one were to allow the bugs present in Hellfire to do the work for them, though, they would really only need the to-hit % for up to maybe Catacombs or Caves, Hell Difficulty. After that, enemies are treated as though their Armor Class was 0.\nSkills.\nThe Barbarian's special ability is &lt;a href=\"Rage\"&gt;Rage&lt;/a&gt;. For 12 seconds, it adds 2*Character level to &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; and 1.5*Character level to &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. For 12 more seconds during his rest phase, it decreases Strength, Dexterity, and Vitality by the same values, and destroys his resistance bonus from levels. Afterwards, he loses 2*Vitality of his Life points, but a bug exists so that if you do anything that would potentially change your hero's stats, such as remove an item in your inventory, or even apply an attribute point, it will return to normal. Usefulness is debatable. While a Barbarian loses nothing permanently from using this, the fact that he suffers penalties during his rest phase is what makes players gauge the skill's usefulness. If it did work effectively and have its duration scale with level, however, a Barbarian could have been a true force to be reckoned with in almost every way- +250 HP, +66-67 points of damage with maces/axes, +37-38% better to-hit + armor and blocking chances, all at max level.\nDevelopment.\nThe Barbarian was added late in the development of Hellfire as a placeholder class. After discovering it, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; demanded that it be removed. Of note, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt; had instructed &lt;a href=\"Synergistic%20Software\"&gt;Synergistic Software&lt;/a&gt; not to include a Barbarian class, as they intended &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;such a class&lt;/a&gt; for inclusion in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". The Hellfire Barbarian was removed in the next test version, but it remained playable through the txt exploit. Blizzard North was less than pleased when they discovered that the Barbarian had remained playable within the game."}

She could only be played after editing the &lt;a href=\"Command.txt\"&gt;Command.txt&lt;/a&gt; file in the \"Hellfire\" folder. \nLore.\nBards are members of the &lt;a href=\"Seekers%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Seekers of the Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nThe Bard uses the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;'s graphic, but can dual-wield weapons in lieu of a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nBards possess balanced attributes, so they excel at nothing. Possessing medium amounts of the three core attributes of &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28attribute%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, while enough to make them able to at least make use of everything in the game, for the purposes of specialization, makes them weak at all of them. High dexterity, while helpful when using &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt;, works better when the bard makes use of at least one &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nBards have the ability to wield two &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons. This combination of two one-handed swords is not as powerful as it seems. It can be as damaging as a at best. But there are benefits to this style for her. To name one, there is the potential for an additional two magical modifications on the second weapon, which allows for deadly combos. Equipping a along with a good sword (preferably of Speed or Haste) will make the Bard a very powerful Melee character since the +200% damage bonus on Civerb's Cudgel applies to the whole damage and not just weapon damage. On the other hand, a Bard could sacrifice stopping power for a good weapon with life steal, and it would be near impossible to end her reign, unless stunlock is involved.\nAnother benefit is that when a Bard dual wields, she possesses the same ability to attack enemies adjacent to her target that the Monk has with his staff. This, when combined with potent equipment, allows the Bard to carve a path of destruction with relative ease, much in the same way that the Barbarian would with his trusty &lt;a href=\"Axes\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;.\nA fatal flaw in this character's design is that she has the melee attack speed of the Rogue. &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s were never intended to be melee attackers, so they were given a slower melee attack speed than the warrior. The only saving grace of the bard's melee ability is her high dexterity; having a higher degree of dexterity, as well as being able to equip a second weapon for extra to-hit makes the bard more suited for Civerb's Cudgel than the Warrior or Barbarian, who firstly, needed to get the extra To-Hit from jewelry when wielding it, and secondly, had to make the hits count, as they swung at their normal attacking speed, robbing them of being able to stunlock some monsters. By hitting the enemy more frequently, she has the potential to stun lock her enemy.\nBecause her magical ability is only second to the &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, a Bard can effectively use the attacking magical spells of and , and some may even find worth in choosing to invoke the protection of &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Shield\"&gt;Mana Shield&lt;/a&gt;. This helps to made the Bard effective in combat, both as a spellcaster, and as a melee hero who can quickly restore damage taken with her equipment and the art of .\nHowever, the saying 'jack of all trades, masters of none' certainly applies to a Bard: a Warrior, Monk, or Barbarian will always outdamage her in melee combat, the Rogue bests her in ranged combat, and the Sorcerer is more powerful in spell combat. Their strength lies in their ability to adapt: if a Bard cannot adapt, death and/or failure is more likely.\nSkills.\nBards have one of the most useful skills in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\". Bards can &lt;a href=\"identify\"&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt; magical &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; without using &lt;a href=\"scrolls%20of%20identify\"&gt;scrolls of identify&lt;/a&gt;. This skill stopped the drudgery of going back to town, to get &lt;a href=\"Cain\"&gt;Cain&lt;/a&gt; to identify it, and selling magical items of little value. Compared to other classes' skills which seemed to actually hurt the hero rather than help them, identify is very beneficial.\nCharacter Attributes.\nBase Attributes:\nMaximum attributes:\nDevelopment.\nThe Bard, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Hellfire%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, was scrapped early on in the development of Hellfire. The class was designed by &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Tsang\"&gt;Donald Tsang&lt;/a&gt;. While looking at the code for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", he noted that it would be pretty easy for a class to wield a different weapon in each hand. He had no idea whether it was balanced or not, but the Bard was going to be a completely experimental, extra, no-balanced-is-required character. It was, in his words, \"just for fun.\""}

Barrels can easily kill an unwary hero, so healing before opening them is advised.\nBarrel explosions are not &lt;a href=\"traps\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; that will emit a triggering sound before detonating, they explode instantly and are unavoidable.\nBarrels often are grouped together, and when one explodes, it will also detonate any other explosive varieties standing immediately adjacent to it.\nThe loot they drop, if any at all, is generally not very good and with their high chance to explode, they may not even be worth the effort.\nDiablo II.\nBarrels return in the second game, and function in exact same way as in the first game, except for their damage is much less significant, and can damage monsters as well.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt;, there is a different type of barrel. These stone barrels are usually not found in groups, and while they do still frequently explode, they do not inflict any damage.\nDiablo III.\nIn the third game, barrels can no longer damage players; instead, barrels of oil (marked with a lit oil lamp) will explode when damaged, delivering &lt;a href=\"fire%20damage\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; to nearby monsters. Normal barrels usually contain nothing, but sometimes still drop gold and spawn Skeletons.\nTorture Barrels in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt; will always spawn &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Dead\"&gt;Risen Dead&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hungry%20Corpse\"&gt;Hungry Corpse&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Shen\"&gt;Covetous Shen&lt;/a&gt; will be found in a &lt;a href=\"Big%20Trouble%20in%20Talking%20Barrel\"&gt;huge barrel&lt;/a&gt;, which has become famous among player community.

{"id": "2629", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2629", "title": "Bartuc", "text": "Bartuc, the infamous \"Warlord of Blood\", was the brother of &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt; and was a significantly powerful member of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBartuc and Horazon lived in the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23The%20Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;third-century&lt;/a&gt; pre-&lt;a href=\"Anno%20Kehjistani\"&gt;Anno Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt;. Both were equally powerful and ambitious, and both were fascinated by the power one could obtain through the practice of &lt;a href=\"demonic%20magic\"&gt;demonic magic&lt;/a&gt;, following the teachings of the Vizjerei. Bartuc received instruction from &lt;a href=\"Attis%20Zuun\"&gt;Attis Zuun&lt;/a&gt;. However, while Horazon believed in bending &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to his will, Bartuc grew to sympathize with demonkind, a view that stemmed from the baleful influence his interactions with the creatures were inflicting on him. He believed that demonic forces were best understood by allying with the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; so their secrets could be shared freely, and did so. At some point Bartuc was close to an unknown woman and with her, fathered a child.\nThe Mage Clan Wars.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt; began, Bartuc fought for the Vizjerei. He earned the title of \"Warlord of Blood\" for his bathing in the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of his enemies as part of a ritual. According to Vizjerei accounts, this infused him with incredible powers. His &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Bartuc\"&gt;armour&lt;/a&gt; was said to have been empowered with demonic sentience. During the final battles of the wars, Bartuc became an unstoppable force, instilling fear in not only the enemy clans but among his own people as well. Demonic corruption spread through the Vizjerei, and the hellspawn that Bartuc continued to summon lacked any kind of control, destroying everything in their path. By this stage, Bartuc believed that demons were &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's masters, and that loyalty to them would be generously rewarded, though such was his madness that even the demons he summoned feared him. Acting on Horazon's warnings, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Ruling%20Council\"&gt;Vizjerei Ruling Council&lt;/a&gt; stripped Bartuc of his command on the cusp of victory, even as victory seemed assured for them. The brothers' diametrically opposed philosophies caused a great schism that split the ranks and tore the Vizjerei Clan apart. The result was a civil war within the Vizjerei Clan as Bartuc turned his forces against his own people, leading an entire legion of demons. He regularly used the tactic of moving his forces in a circular pattern, trying to cause as much destruction as possible. He would raid undefended villages, cutting off support for walled towns before moving against them. After many hard-fought battles, Bartuc's forces gained the upper hand, and he gave his armies the task of conquering &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point during the war, Bartuc came across a Vizjerei spy. He used the spy's body as a candelabra to illuminate his quarters, an act that instilled fear in his own demon servants.\nIn what would be the final battle of the war, as a defeat for the Vizjerei neared, Horazon met Bartuc's challenge. The cataclysmic battle between the two siblings tore destroyed Viz-jun, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands. In the end, both siblings realized that they had been played as pawns by leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Legion\"&gt;Demonic Legion&lt;/a&gt;. In the midst of casting a counterspell, Bartuc was decapitated. As the fire and smoke cleared, Bartuc lay dead, with Horazon standing over his corpse.\nLegacy of Blood.\nHorazon and his fellow mages were unable to destroy Bartuc's corpse, as his armour protected him even after death. That he had failed to cover his throat properly was the reason he had been able to be decapitated. Wary of his brother's vast power even in death, Horazon ordered that Bartuc's body be forever hidden from the sight of Man. The Vizjerei worked with the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that Bartuc would not be able to rise again. Bartuc's head and body were separated and sealed into two different caves. As time passed, horrific legends of Bartuc reached the ears of the people of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Many sought to find his tomb, especially those interested in the black arts (due to the possibility of lingering magic around his body/armour), but none succeeded.\nAt some point, the song \"&lt;a href=\"Bartuc%20and%20Horazon\"&gt;Bartuc and Horazon&lt;/a&gt;\" was composed, telling the tale of the two brothers.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;Over a millennium&lt;/a&gt; after Bartuc's death, the Warlord of Blood nearly lived again in the form of &lt;a href=\"Norrec%20Vizharan\"&gt;Norrec Vizharan&lt;/a&gt;, his descendant. Norrec was possessed by his armour, while &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20Malevolyn\"&gt;Augustus Malevolyn&lt;/a&gt; possessed his helm. &lt;a href=\"Xazax\"&gt;Xazax&lt;/a&gt;, a servant of &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, also sought the armour in order to create a new Bartuc, one who would serve his master. Under the armour's influence, Norrec nearly became Bartuc incarnate, as the warlord's spirit resided within the armour. However, with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Kara%20Nightshadow\"&gt;Kara Nightshadow&lt;/a&gt; and Horazon, the armour's power was negated, freeing Sanctuary from Bartuc's legacy.\nIn-game.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Bartuc has a unique item to his name, &lt;a href=\"Bartuc%27s%20Cut-Throat\"&gt;Bartuc's Cut-Throat&lt;/a&gt;, unique &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Talons\"&gt;Greater Talons&lt;/a&gt;.

It is unclear as to whether this individual and Bartuc are one and the same.\nPersonality and Traits.\nBartuc was powerful, ambitious, and ruthless. He relished in embracing the powers of Hell, but trusted no-one but himself, and refused to ally with or serve any other mortal. &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20Malevolyn\"&gt;Augustus Malevolyn&lt;/a&gt; was of the opinion that Bartuc's failing was that he was not a career soldier, that he was first and foremost a &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; and as such, had been unable to react to sudden shifts in the battle that an actual commander would be able to."}

This Bartuc could just have acted similar to the Warlord and so earned a similar title.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Legacy of Blood&lt;/a&gt; novel by Knaak (deemed canon by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;) makes it seem as if it is impossible for the Warlord to come back to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; without his armour. And since his armour was destroyed by Horazon just before &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; entered &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, Baal would not have had the armour to resurrect the Warlord of Blood.\nBartuc the Bloody is not wearing armour though, so it is possible that &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; just brought back half of his soul without the half in the armour. It is also possible that only the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; have the power to do that, while the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; do not, because &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; was interested in reviving the Warlord but needed his armour to do so.\nDevelopment.\nBartuc The Bloody has an unused pale color palette due to Council Member monsters lack of palshift.dat file and randtransform.dat file error in D2Client.dll"}

This is probably easiest in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;.

It is unconfirmed whether its drop rate is 100%. If it doesn't appear, restart the game and try again.\nHitting Bashiok with the blade.\nOnce the blade is found, the primary concerns are finding &lt;a href=\"Bashiok%20%28Monster%29\"&gt;Bashiok&lt;/a&gt;, and ensuring you can hit him with the weapon before he is killed in some other way.\nTo find Bashiok, once again there are two alternative sub-strategies: Look on the map for a &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; to kill Bashiok, or search the Oasis for him. In either case, restart the game until successful. Both take a long time, as the bounty is only one among many \"kill bounties\", but Bashiok himself is rare and the Oasis is large. Bashiok is a unique &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Fallen Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, but it is possible for him to appear with other &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; Fallen Shaman in the zone, so most of the zone needs to be covered to be sure.\nOnce he's found, hit him with the basic weapon attack or any other direct attack skill - achievement obtained."}

The artists have had a very specific commitment to keeping items very much based in a realistic style, size, and appearance. Or at least as much as is appropriate for a fantasy game. Look at the hands, feet, head, facial features, etc. and you'll see that they're being kept at a very realistic proportion.\nIf anything I think the barbarian shoulder pad size could be shrunk a bit, and maybe it will be, but a single slot on a single class really shouldn't be used to form an opinion when there are plenty of other pieces to examine that show the contrary. Source deleted.\nThis comment earns a reply in which someone asks for Diablo III to at least not have all the goofy, impractical weapons we see in World of Warcraft.\nYou try to take WoW seriously? It's ... kind of a goofy game, I mean it's filled to the brim with pop-references, over-the-top visuals, mechanical impossibilities, inter-stellar space travel... it isn't a normal fantasy game at all.\nIt's definitely not Diablo, but I think that the ways in which it's sometimes absurd and quirky are what make it an interesting world.\nAlso I think the crazy rotating crystals and weirdo squid-on-a-stick weapons look cool, and match that over-the-top visual and thematic style. Source deleted.\nTo that someone cites Diablo items and weapons as largely based in reality, which forces Bashiok to point to... actual Diablo II artwork.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.blizzard.com/shared/blizz-com/images/diablo2/wall03.jpg\"&gt;I R NEED GIANT GOLD RINGS&lt;/a&gt;\nThere's always going to be some amount of \"hey, that looks cool\" going into it. Diablo isn't grounded in reality. Source deleted.\nThings wrap up when someone tells Bashiok he shouldn't have to defend Blizzard's artwork.\nNah, I'm not defending it, I'm just explaining that they're wrong. Source deleted.\nAugust 27th, 2008 - Health Orbs and PvP.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Orbs, a poster asked if the orbs could heal party members even if the character who grabbed it was at full &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; already. And received some good news in reply:\nThat's how it works!\nWe're also playing around with some alternate functionality for when/how they're picked up while you're at full health, as well as some visual tweaks. Regardless we're going to make sure it's as fun and balanced as possible. Source deleted.\nAs for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, some commenters brought up some of &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"http%3A//pc.gamespy.com/pc/diablo-iii/901260p3.html\"&gt;comments from Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;, in which he said that they had big plans to improve on PvP in Diablo III, but that a return of the in-game hostility option was not among them. The initial poster agreed with that change, but these are the &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; forums we're talking about here, so you know angry, Blizzard-slamming comments were just around the corner. Amidst the slavering cries of \"only losers play WoW,\" and \"Care Bear D3!\" Bashiok pointed out the fairly obvious issue with enabling PvP: only the people who can duel or want to gank are going to turn it on.\nWhen/Why would you choose to enable PvP in your game if it was an option? Would it be before you were max or near-max level, or twinked?\nIf not then you're essentially looking for a dueling game, and wouldn't a dedicated PvP focus provide a more logical option than a blanket PvP-on/PvP-off option which no one would enable until they were powerful enough to defend themselves? Source deleted.\nA rebuttal is offered, earning another reply from Bashiok:\nWould they? Players don't generally opt-in to situations they don't think they have a chance to win. Source deleted.\nAugust 26th, 2008 - Diablo III age rating.\nJust back from Leipzig and just about to head off to PAX, Bashiok took the time to offer a clarification in the forums. Someone asked about Jay Wilson's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//diablo3.ingame.de/szene/interviews/interview_jaywilson/index_engl.php\"&gt;Leipzig interview&lt;/a&gt; comment that Diablo III would are trying to avoid an 18+ rating.\nJay was referring to the German USK rating of 18+. Which is a rating specific to Germany and games sold there.\nIn the US we have the ESRB, and other countries may have their own rating advisories and labels. For our ESRB rating and US release we have been and still are planning for a \"M\" for Mature rating. Source deleted.\nDue to Diablo's popularity in Germany, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; won't risk a 18+ rating. The German rating system is focused on violence, not sexuality. As 18+ games in Germany are prohibited from running ads or being displayed in shops and can only be sold to adults, this rating would seriously damage the profit of the company.\nAugust 15th, 2008 - Game visuals and design philosophies.\nA poster complained about the obscuring visual fireworks created by various Diablo 2 skills.\nKeeping the visuals distinct and \"readable\" is an extremely important focus for us, and as has been stated quite a few times, relates to a lot of the art style and direction choices.\nYou need to be able to read the scene, tell monster and player apart, and not have it turn into a mess of spell effects. While we're really aiming for over-the-top skills and effects, it's going to be a constant goal (and likely struggle) to keep those in line so that in a multiplayer game it's going to retain its readability.\nIt's fine for things to get chaotic, it will happen and we want there to be mass-mayhem and slaughter, but we're trying to keep the game playable even during the chaos. It's a balance. Source deleted.\nOther fans are hungry for more content, and are already wondering if they'll see the goods at Blizzcon. Will there be a gameplay movie? Bashiok deals with one such fellow with Roper-ian grace, acknowledging, inspiring, and redirecting him so smoothly he never even feels the PR knife slide in.\nWell, you'll just have to wait and see!\nIn the more immediate future a few of us are heading out to Leipzig for GC next week. We'll be joining our friends from the Blizzard Europe office to meet and greet the fans. If you happen to be passing through Germany and also happen to have a ticket to the convention, be sure to stop by and say hello. Source deleted.\nOthers are not so easily put off, and a follow up question is quickly posed, asking what sort of information we'll see released to coincide with that major German gaming event. Not a whole lot, apparently:\nFrom what I gather I think I would equate it more to our presences at similar booth-style conventions, ComicCon and GenCon Indy in years past, for instance. We have a booth, usually some gaming stations set up, and we talk with people about the games and hold interviews. I fully expect some good interviews with Jay to come out of it, but I would more or less expect that to be the main focus of information coming out of the show regarding Diablo III. \nStop by and say hi though. I think I may be the only Blizzard person there with a goatee, so I should be easy to spot. I'm scheduled to be there every day to chat up fans about the game. Source deleted.\nAugust 15th, 2008 - Beta testing and release date.\nBashiok posts on the Diablo III forums to address some misconceptions of the forumers about his post from a week earlier.\nIn the first he follows up his post from last week, about Diablo III beta keys and the Blizzcon goodie bag:\nI think the wording in my original post got some people thinking I was hinting that any included beta key would undoubtedly be used for a Diablo III beta.\nThat was not my intent, and as I said any beta key we give out on those cards could be used for any purpose deemed necessary. If the Wrath of the Lich King beta is still going after BlizzCon and we want more testers, then it could be used for that if we wanted.\nMy original post was only meant to say that regardless of what a beta key is used for, you should still attend as you won't be disappointed. Source deleted.\nElsewhere, someone tries the old trick of \"I know someone, who works for a game store/distributor and Diablo III will be out in 3 months.\"\nThere has been no release date announced, shared, hinted at, or otherwise imagined. Retailers may have dates in their computers which someone at their company made up, none of them have anything to them other than best-guess work. This is how video game pre-orders work.\n...there's no standard announcement-to-release formula. Source deleted.\nAugust 8th, 2008 - Blizzcon.\nBashiok answered a question about the goodie bag to be given out at this year's Blizcon with the following tease:\nGenerally if a goody bag were to contain a beta key, it's nondescript. In the past we've never announced what the key will be used for as we generally don't know for certain ourselves until the time comes to herd them into an upcoming beta. We may use them for one purpose or another, depending on development timelines.\nIf your interest is in Diablo III, then I would highly recommend attending this year's BlizzCon. Source deleted.\nThen someone asked about viewing the panels online.\nhttp://www.blizzard.com/us/press/080729.html\nIt will be covered live in a pay per view event offered through DirecTV. Source deleted.\nAugust 6th, 2008 - Secret Cow Level.\nYeah, who doesn't like fighting cows running around with halberds?\nI disliked the secret cow level from a design standpoint though. It actually angered me that it existed at one point, maybe it kind of still does.\nI'm not a designer, at all, but in my opinion and from a design standpoint I think the secret cow level was a failure. For a long time it was one of the most lucrative ways to level, and one of the best places to MF. For an easter egg, something fun and whimsical, to overshadow the entire rest of the game was a huge problem, and one that existed for far too long. It was a fun idea, a cool nod to the rumors that spawned it, but in execution it was just... game breaking in some ways. Source deleted.\nSome players disagree, and say they didn't like when made the Secret Cow Level a bad farming area.\nWell of course, everyone wants everything made easier for them, and that's effectively what it was. This barrel of fish that not only acted as cheesy way to pull the slot machine lever, but almost rendered the rest of the game unnecessary.\nThe oversight, I believe, existed in the requirement for the current difficulty to be beaten as well as the &lt;a href=\"Cow%20King\"&gt;Cow King&lt;/a&gt; kill. It's easy enough to avoid the King or just have the level opened by other characters, and I can only guess that the amount of replay potential of the actual game was extremely undervalued. Source deleted.\nSome posters say it doesn't matter where and how a player decides to level up their character.\nBecause you're playing a game, and it should be respected that you're playing that game. The cow level was not part of the game, it was an easter egg that made leveling and item finding far easier than the actual game. I'm inclined to almost call it cheating. Source deleted.\nAugust 6th, 2008 - Barbarian abilities.\nSomeone on the forums says that the 's skills, are too magical and that &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Hammer of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; is an example of that.\nI don't get that feeling while playing one. I think the Hammer of the Ancients ability is definitely magical to some extent, he's effectively summoning a giant hammer to smash an enemy.\nI kind of fill in my own blanks as to where it's coming from and it feels very natural to me and the Barbarian \"kit\". I kind of see it as - and like the idea of - the barbarian ... I guess drawing upon the power of his ancestors. It feels very Norse, very mythological, and somehow tied to a family bloodline of great and powerful warriors. Summoning the power of a giant hammer? Hell yeah! If a barb is going to do anything magical, it's going to be so he can use a big *** ethereal hammer. Source deleted.\nTo Bashiok's post a forum goer responded: \"But if you have the magical ability to hit so hard you break the rock beneath you, WHY ARE YOU HITTING A ROCK?\"\nBecause it looks cool, and it's a very physical and apparent way to get the basic mechanic of a \"crowd control\" skill across.\nI don't see anything \"magical\" about it either. Is it realistic? No, but why should it be? Immersion and reality aren't intrinsically tied. Source deleted.\nAugust 6th, 2008 - Achievements.\nSomeone on the Diablo II forums complained about the announced achievements system, because in his opinion World of Warcraft's aren't any good.\nSteam achievements are generally based around small, situational, skill, or long-term goals in short \"round\" or level based FPS'. So obviously achievements in an MMO are going to be vastly different, and can cover a much wider range of goals from small and fun, to long and involved, and yes even to the impossible.\nFor us completionists we're going to be frustrated by not being able to have everything. But part of the system is specifically to show off where you've been, how long you've been playing, and what you've accomplished. I'm going to have to deal with the fact that I wasn't everywhere or did everything at some point in time. I'm going to have to focus on the goals I can achieve instead of those I can't. There's no point crying over milk that was spilled two years ago that I just found all dried and crusty under my refrigerator.\nThat's World of Warcraft though. It's a persistent world and moves and evolves and changes with patch to patch, and expansion to expansion. There's a lot more area for there to be achievements that were attainable at one time, but due to that evolution of the game - are no longer possible.\nDiablo III isn't an MMO, it doesn't evolve in the same way, and so there's far less chance for there to be an achievement rendered impossible due to game updates.\nBashiok then proceeded to clarify some things about the Achievements system and how it will function.\nQuestion: Will the system frustrate most players?\nIt won't. Completionists like you and I account for such a small percentage as weirdo OCD-crazed gamers that it really won't. It may seem like a large group because we entrench ourselves in groups and pockets of like-minded individuals. But really a \"normal\" person might say \"Hey there's an achievement for going to BlizzCon 2005, I wonder if I can find anyone that has that one...\" while you and I may sit in a corner with glazed eyes rocking back and forth and muttering something about murloc codes.\nComplaint: Achievements aren't good since some of them will take forever to acquire, and that just measures time spent playing.\nIt's only cruel if you're putting that much importance and stock in a tiny colored square in your armory profile.\nComplaint: \"I choose subsets of things to complete, and I never would try to do everything in wow - it's just too big. I do however feel that making the game into a bunch of elitist cliques seems horrible wrong\"\nSuch as the /love a squirrel clique? Come on though, you're going a bit far. So we can't even recognize raiding achievements now because it's an elitist clique? It's a game, keep it in context.\nComplaint: Achievements should be stuff that players enjoy doing, so they are available to everybody.\nIs an achievement found in an out-of-way website really that much more in-your-face elitism than someone wearing full Season 4 and a spectral tiger mount right in front of you in-game?\nNo, no, it's just an achievement system, not a weapon.

It would be cool to have something a bit more engaging; however, I think the Diablo II style zoom-zoom to the next act ...worked.\nQuestion: \"Can characters fall or be pushed off the edge of a level?\"\nBashiok's reply: No. Unless it's part of a special event or something.\nQuestion: \"Can we filter &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; games by mod being used?\"\nBashiok's reply: We've never supported and don't intend to support \"mods\" for Diablo II or III.\nQuestion: \"If there are forest landscapes like the &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; jungle, can we clear them out or will they be pre-defined paths like in D2?\"\nBashiok's reply: We haven't announced/shown any locations beyond those on the website.\nQuestion: \"Will there be more boss-specific fatalities like the Barbarian head bite by &lt;a href=\"Seigebreaker\"&gt;Seigebreaker&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nBashiok's reply: That's what we would like to do. We'd like it that when a player dies to a boss we may have a special/random event or death animation specific to that boss. So if you're going to die or have died to a boss, there's a random chance that you'll see something other than a normal death. That's the dream any way.\nQuestion: \"Night and day cycle? Any difference in monster behavior between them?\"\nBashiok's reply: Not that I know of. \nQuestion: \"Can the Character window display base stats and bonuses?\"\nBashiok's reply: The UI is still under some design revision, but currently in Diablo III you can open your character sheet, and when mousing over a stat it lists what your total stat is and then breaks it down to base stat plus any modification. So for instance Vitality may list: \"24 (22+2)\" if you've got something giving you +2 to Vitality.\nThat's the current design any how, but I don't see any reason for it to change.\nQuestion: \"What's your favorite thing about playing Diablo III right now?\"\nBashiok's reply: Blood sprays. They never get old. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s seem to just be chock full of the stuff.

But still...\nMe. Source deleted.\nThen someone asked why isn't it painted.\nYet. It's still somewhat early in production, although I have no idea how production on these things really works. They brought the actual sculpt to Comic-Con since they were still working on it, no casts yet. I'm guessing these photos of it are actually of the sculpt, which is sort of an ugly mish-mash of clay colors, and then they just made the photos B&amp;W to even it out.\nAs soon as there's a final paint version to show, it shall be shown.

{"id": "11751", "revid": "865253", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11751", "title": "Bashiok's forum posts/August 2009", "text": "August 27, 2009 - Zombie Dogs.\nFirst thing's first, the mongrel is now (or again) known as the Zombie Dog. It was the name that was used when the idea was first proposed and all the way through development. Calling it a mongrel was kind of confusing because everyone was so used to calling it a zombie dog for so long, no one remembered to call it a mongrel (dune thresher and fallen imp suffer from it as well to a degree). The name zombie dog doesn't need to be lore-fied really. It describes the skill perfectly, so why not use it?\nSo anyway, right, the fire and poison/locust enhancements for the zombie dogs was removed. It was a cool idea but it just wasn't really panning out to be anything meaningful. It was sort of confusing as to why you would be switching between fire and poison, was it to keep an additional DoT active, or maybe there would be tactical reasons for it? But it just wasn't really jiving in a way that made sense for the rest of the game as it all came together more. It wasn't shaping up to be a meaningful or fun decision to make on-the-fly. And if you didn't happen to spec into the skills that would empower the mongrels in different ways, what then? You're just constantly refreshing a fire DoT on them? To what end? It seemed more and more that a decision that was made at the base skill, either through spending points in another skill (passive potentially), or using particular runes to alter the zombie dogs, made the most sense.I haven't spoken to the designers about it, so I could be way out of line, but I think the potential for passives that affect all \"summoned zombies\" is definitely there as there are quite a bit more of them that exist now. The gargantuan, zombie charger, wall of zombies, grasp of the dead, and then the zombie dogs of course. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19378306463%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1%235\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nIt's not an issue of coming up with various ways the effects could work, it's the issue of why is it interesting or fun to switch between the two? Why/when/how would I choose to set my dogs on fire versus poisoning them, and most importantly! could it be done accurately enough so that it actually makes a difference?\n\"Ok I'm a firebomb WD.\nFirebombing, firebombing...

They're essentially Diablo III machinima if you want to classify it. And they're effing amazing. Obviously they're not the pre-rendered cinematics, but if anyone is even confused about that... then that's pretty cool too actually.\nThe reason why those close-up character dialogues with the animated portraits were removed was because it took you away from your character and the game. So I'd be really surprised if we had in-game cinematics, but ... never say never. \nAugust 26, 2009 - Magic Find.\nThere is indeed currently &lt;a href=\"magic%20find\"&gt;magic find&lt;/a&gt; (MF) on items in Diablo III, as well as a temporary shrine buff. I think though it's a system we're just sort of dipping our toes into for the moment.I don't think it's accurate to say or even guess that the inclusion of MF means the system will mirror that of Diablo II. We could easily set rules for affix combination, requirement, frequency, and strength to control how and where MF appears in the game.We may decide that MF as a stat is a fun alternative and building sets purely to that end, similar to Diablo II, is what we want to do. Or, we could say that it should just be a fun affix and not something you could stack to meaningful amounts.Putting things like MF, additional XP, additional gold, speed increase, etc. on items now and having them in the demo is really just begging for discussion so please do give some feedback. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19378796056%26amp%3BpostId%3D195058669020%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%237\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nAugust 26, 2009 - Morlu Caster.\nThe demonic enemy shown in the Monk trailer is a morlu caster, not Belial. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19377975126%26amp%3BpostId%3D195058668527%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%2315\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nAugust 24, 2009 - Hellfire Monk.\nIt's not a recognized part of the Diablo franchise, and to be honest it is so much so not recognized, that when people asked about returning classes in the Q&amp;A's and in some of the press interviews the Hellfire expansion just wasn't in anyone's minds.Plus, it isn't the same class. We aren't taking an old class and updating it. The monk from Hellfire, and in fact the story and content of Hellfire, doesn't exist as far as game lore and story is concerned going into Diablo III.They happen to share a name, the same as all of the other monk classes that have existed in all other RPG's since the beginning of time. It doesn't mean they're related kit/story/flavor wise.\nAugust 24, 2009 - Skill effects and dev time.\nThanks for the post, well reasoned opinion and a reasonable concern.The spell animations, blood, explosions, and everything else going on can create what Jay mentioned a few times as \"soup\". An indistinguishable mess. It's really only an issue during four player games and even then, to be honest, I personally think it's all far more readable than it was in Diablo II. But, it's an ongoing concern and something we're going to have to continue to work at to make sure you can tell what's going on.For the second point, development time, there is a lot going on - a lot of areas, creatures, and dungeons created that no one has seen yet and probably won't see until the game is released. But dev time is certainly always something on people's minds. We're constantly refining our tools and processes, and the team just naturally gets better and faster at creating contest as they go. I don't think it's anything for the community at large to concern themselves with, let the producers sweat it. ;) &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19377974424%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.\nAugust 8, 2009 - Patch 1.13 re-spec.\nSkill tree re-specialization is currently a planned feature for the Diablo II 1.13 patch, yes.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19110021662%26amp%3BpostId%3D191084426671%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%232\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nThere will be an easily accessed but very limited way characters will have access to respecs, and another way ... &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19110021662%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3BpageNo%3D3%2347\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;."}

I want to try to put the idea of auto attribute allocation, the topic of this thread, in a potentially different light though. Potentially.\nIt seems there are really only a few core problems for those that do take issue with auto attributes when you boil it down. The loss of a customization option and the ability to create builds for characters that are apart from the norm - or even just kind of crazy and experimental. Some other issues could be a loss of a \u201cleveling achievement\u201d and also just the classic RPG design of manually spending points on base stats. Sort of a nostalgia issue, but still valid in its own right.\nSo I\u2019ll sort of tackle these each on their own and then hopefully give you some things to think about.\nFirst is the loss of customization, and I\u2019ve mentioned before that we don\u2019t think it will be an issue, but let me elaborate a bit more. With the current skill system, runes, and item affixes, as well as other unmentionables, there\u2019s not going to be any issue with not having enough customization. If there is, bottom line, we\u2019ll add more. We\u2019re not going to release a game we\u2019re not happy with, and a lack of character customization options would make us unhappy. But, even right now we have a lot more variety and ability to customize a character than Diablo II had. I\u2019m going to come back to some of this later because we\u2019d like your help.\nSomewhat similarly is being able to create \u201coff-spec\u201d builds, or characters that aren\u2019t just cookie cutter ideals of the class you\u2019re playing. This is important to the game, and we will ensure that it doesn't get \"tuned out\" of the game. Most importantly though being able to manually spend attributes does not make this a possibility. Which is to say that us automatically assigning attributes does not take away the ability to make these types of characters, at all. Manual attributes were not what made them possible in Diablo II. The ability to make these types of characters relies solely on the complexity and diversity of the options available to steer your character, and not that they come in the form of a \"+\" button.\nThe loss of a feeling of a leveling achievement is actually something we recognize and intend to address.\nThe nostalgia of simply having points, and spending them on base stats is probably the most difficult. Liking something because it\u2019s familiar is difficult to argue with, but it\u2019s also probably the easiest to overcome. Since we can\u2019t force your memories out of you, we just have to make the best game we can and hope you realize that manual attribute assignment isn\u2019t the best, most engaging or entertaining form of character customization possible, and that we\u2019re offering an even deeper and richer game without those buttons. Or you\u2019ll just forget you even cared because you're playing Diablo III and it's totally kick ass... one or the other.\nBack to the part where I said we\u2019d like your help. We want a lot of items in the game, and with that we want to have a lot of affixes. The largest pool of character-focusing mojo is coming from your items, so we plan to have a very diverse selection. While we have been and continue to come up with as many affixes as we can we\u2019d like some help from you guys in coming up with more. We have some pretty crazy stuff already but I don\u2019t want to influence your creativity - plus when it\u2019s one we already have and it goes in to the game you can tell all your friends it was your idea. So if you'd like somewhere to focus your creative energy, this is the place.\nThat aside I know I missed some specific concerns and points, so any follow up questions are welcome. Being Friday I\u2019ll try to get to some today but they may have to wait until next week. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D11296624916%26amp%3BpageNo%3D6%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%23111\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "11742", "revid": "49086", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11742", "title": "Bashiok's forum posts/July 2008", "text": "July 31st, 2008 - Battle.net experience and fake screenshots.\nBashiok commented on a thread about playing single or multiplayer first, with this bit of insight into Blizzard's focus on getting us online immediately, come Diablo 3 time:\nOne thing that seems to be a fairly consistent experience for a lot of people when they first picked up Diablo II was their introduction to Battle.net. And it wasn't generally a positive one.\nMost people, including myself, went home and installed the game and started playing. Over maybe a few weeks or months they've finished the game maybe a few times, they had a ton of fun, but they keep playing and trying to find more items.\nOne day while loading up the game they notice the \"Battle.net\" button and decide to click it... and, their characters aren't there. They have to start over. Any of us would have gladly played on Battle.net (in passworded games if necessary) just to have that online/trading option for their character available to them. It felt like a lot of wasted time to find the actual game, which was on Battle.net.\nWhile \"starting over\" is something almost every Diablo II player is going to do any way, the lack of on-screen instruction or indication as to what the different systems meant left a bad taste.\nTo help avoid that type of situation we're going to try to find ways to encourage Battle.net character creation first and foremost. Source deleted.\nElsewhere, someone posted a fairly-convincing fake screenshot of D3, which had most of the Battle.net forum goers going, until Bashiok killed their fun.\nIt isn't Diablo III.\nI'm guessing it's from another game or someone took the time to actually create it, which would be pretty cool. So no ideas where it's from then? Source deleted.\nJuly 29th, 2008 - Monsters showing wounds.\nSomeone asked if bosses and maybe other monsters show wounds and other marks sustained in a fight with the player character\nFor boss fights we don't really want to just start throwing \"damage decals\" on them. It can very easily be too subtle if you're fighting a smaller boss or one that has odd geometry to it, and it can also end up that no matter the flavor, style, and cool look to a boss you just end up fighting a big gory mess.\nAlso we think that we can go a lot further than just simple decals and get something much cooler out of a boss fight. So what we hope to do for at least the bosses where it makes sense is to show more apparent and visually noticeable damage states. Instead of a blood splatter they may actually lose a limb, or a piece or armor, or - like the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Pounder\"&gt;Thousand Pounder&lt;/a&gt; - may transform in some dramatic way changing how the fight progresses. We want to go a lot further than just showing sword slashes and instead use dramatic and noticeable (which can be difficult in a game like this) ways to indicate a boss' current state.\nSpeaking of battle damage though, and I don't think this came across in the gameplay video or any of the screenshots as of yet, but when an enemy dies a critical death it actually drenches your hero in blood if you're within proximity of the spray. It's awesome. Source deleted.\nA moment later he made an addition post to clarify the dismemberment comment:\nIt was just an example I made up, I don't know if the loss of a limb would actually happen or make sense for a fight. Source deleted.\nAdd Bashiok's comment about critical damage to what was said during the WWI Denizens of Diablo panel, and it sounds like we're going to have a delightfully visceral and rather juicy play experience:\nCritical hits are bigger deal in d3 than in the previous Diablo games, so we took all the same visual effects we had for normal damage types, and made them that much louder and bigger for critical strikes. When you kill a monster with critical damage, they literally explode.\nWith all that hitting happening, you'll be killing a lot of monsters. We wanted to pump up the player's sense of impact on monsters. In D3 monsters all die with ragdoll physics, which allows the character to interact with the monsters. Depending on what/how you hit them, monsters die in different ways. You can set up situations to knock them off of ledges, or send them flying out into space.\nJuly 23rd, 2008 - Assorted topics.\nBashiok answers numerous questions in one big post:\nQuestion: \"How can other characters get over that broken bridge the Barbarian leaped in the WWI gameplay?\"\nBashiok's reply: While the crumbling bridge could be taken quite literally, it was intended to get the idea across that Diablo III will have more interactive and responsive environmental hazards. Of course if such obstacles existed in the way they were displayed every class would need some way to proceed. At this time we aren't announcing any additional class abilities though. \nQuestion: \"Is the Tristram dungeon shown in the demo a dungeon we'll see in the game?\"\nBashiok's reply: It used the same \"tile set\" as the Tristram Cathedral dungeon including a specially made entry room. It was a static and specifically crafted dungeon especially for the demo, so yes it includes the look for Tristram Cathedral, but it's not a true piece of the game as you would play through it. \nQuestion: \"What will the remaining characters be? New or returning?\"\nBashiok's reply: Hey, are you kind of kid who reads the last page of a mystery first? Who pesters the magician to tell you his tricks? Who sneaks downstairs to peek at his Christmas presents? Nooooo... of course you're not. That's why I'm noooot goooonna teeeeell yoooou!\nQuestion: \"Will there be any class-specific equipment?\"\nBashiok's reply: What I said was: \"... we don't plan nor have any armor items at the moment that are class specific - although the bonuses and stats may be better suited to a certain class - anyone can pick up any chest/shoulder/leg/etc item and wear it. However, there are some weapons/off-hand items that are class specific.\"\nNo changes to this yet, there just weren't any drops that were class specific. We essentially \"hand placed\" every drop that happened in the video. We knew people were going to dissect and scrutinize every detail, and everything that drops in that video was purposefully and specifically chosen to be dropped... everything.\nFun fact: I played as the female barbarian for the recording.\nQuestion: \"The decapitation by Siegebreaker in the demo; in the game or just a special for the demo?\"\nBashiok's reply: Well the way we imagined the final fight going down when thinking about the flow of the presentation was to have a few heroes killed off, and thought it would be cooler to see someone get ripped in half by a giant demon than just fall down. While it was an event made for the presentation it could definitely be worked in to the actual end-product. We try not to spend time on anything that can't be incorporated in some way. If there's a mockup or some cool flavor added in somewhere to show something off, we want to build it so that it can actually be used.\nQuestions: \"Are outdoor areas random or static?\"\nBashiok's reply: They're for the most part static. With the outdoor environments we felt we could get a lot more out of them by crafting large and visually impressive scenes, which random map generation really just doesn't allow for all that well. By that same token one of the main goals with Diablo III is to flesh out Sanctuary, to make it feel more like you're in this living and breathing world. With towns shifting around everywhere you do sort of lose a sense of cohesion, and an attachment to the places you're visiting.\nOn a very slight technical note - for random map generation you're essentially creating a bunch of rooms that can all fit together in various ways. It works quite well for a dungeon which is essentially a series of rooms any way. For an outdoor environment though it tends to make it either fairly bland, or fairly linear just by how the edges have to line up. You're either running zig-zag patterns to find the map edges, or you're running down a narrow pathway. Neither are extremely compelling, and at the same time you're losing the visual grandness that could come from a fully hand-crafted and artistically realized environment.\nThat said, the outdoor areas aren't completely static. Source deleted.\nJuly 17th, 2008 - MMO rumors killed; Bashiok thanks the community.\nSomeone asked if Diablo III is going to be an MMO.\nMMO's are generally categorized as being able to support hundreds of thousands of simultaneous players in a persistent world.\nWhile Battle.net can certainly support that many players at one time, the lack of a persistent world and restrictions on how many players can be within each \"world\" (game) would keep Diablo III from being categorized as an MMO. Source deleted. \nBashiok thanks the community for ten great years:\nWell, thank you. We all work here because we love games. Personally, \"my game\" before coming to work here was Diablo II. So being in a position that's not only at the company producing the Diablo games, but to be so closely involved in the project is extremely exciting. I wouldn't dream of taking credit for the history of the company, but I definitely share in your thanks.\nOne thing to remember while ... well, being alive, is that there will always be someone ready to complain about anything, and while it isn't your job to really deal with that and interpret the overall sentiment properly, it is my job.\nFor me, this kind of thing is old-hat. I'm more than capable of dealing with it, and more than capable of reading what needs to be read, delete what needs deleting, and (more often than not) laughing at what needs to be laughed at. I realize for many here it may be a new experience. The gaming public now has focus on Diablo again, and with it comes the modern-age of trolling and jackassery.\nThese types of reactions have become commonplace, and beyond that easily and widely spread, mimicked, and perpetuated. It's become commonplace for feelings of question or doubt to turn immediately to ire and disdain. Perhaps it's the nature of anonymity on the internet, perhaps it's a nationally bred sense of entitlement, or perhaps it fills some sort of primal urge that many lack fulfillment of in their day-to-day lives.\nWhatever the case, it's a game, it's a forum, and it's best not to get too wrapped up in it all.\nWe're going to keep working on making games.\nAll things in moderation, and all things in perspective. Source deleted.\nJuly 22nd, 2008 - Caring about corpses.\nDoes Blizzard even care about corpses?\nAw, of course we care! A large part of my job is specifically to ensure that the valid concerns, comments, and critiques are brought to the appropriate people's attention. That doesn't mean that every idea or suggestion is something we agree with, or are going to base changes on though. There's a point where, as a game designer, you have to stick to your guns and know that your choices and direction are what's best for the game and ultimately those that will be playing it. There's a point where you have to be confident that you're making the right decisions. So at the end of the day you're staying true to your vision and design, and doing what's best for the game.\nA good example of us paying attention though was the concern and thread about corpses not sticking around long enough. I read that thread, brought it up, and some discussion was happening on it. Later our lead tech artist Julian was reading through the replies, and got some ideas of how we may want to keep corpses on screen a little longer. Now we're playing around with some changes that shouldn't have a huge performance hit, while still keeping the corpses on screen for variable amounts of time. Hopefully it works out.\nWould any experimentation for corpse decay have happened had it not been brought up on the forums? I don't know, maybe, but we're not just dismissing good, valid, and well reasoned concerns.\nAs I said not every suggestion, comment, or idea is going to be considered, but we're definitely watching and reading. Source deleted.\nJuly 13th, 2008 - Corpses vanishing.\nBlizzard commented on corpses vanishing in the WWI gameplay movie:\nThe main reason for the corpses not being able to stay permanently is the potential number of them on screen at one time, and specifically that each corpse is affected by physics, allowing them to be blasted and thrown all over the place by the force of player abilities.\nIt's one of the trade offs when integrating new technology, you can get really awesome effects, but they do have a cost. In a 2D world, a sprite of a dead creature doesn't really cost any more (system requirement-wise) than a sprite of something that's alive. Probably less. In a 3D world where a creature dies and then needs to have physics calculations thrown onto it so it can bounce and fall and fly around, they cost substantially more.\nWe remember fondly those situations where you've just completely obliterated a camp of Fallen, and as you're picking up items - marvel in your destruction. That's a feeling and part of the gameplay where if we can realistically keep some of it without sacrificing features or having insane system requirements we'd definitely like to, but no promises. Source deleted.\nWhat does that mean for the corpse skills so enjoyed by the players in Diablo II?\nWe haven't announced any abilities outside of those listed on the website, so by discussing what is or isn't in the game I would be essentially making an announcement, which I'm not prepared to do. Source deleted.\nJuly 12th, 2008 - Health globes and party play.\nBashiok quoted posters on the Battle.net forums and replies to each of their comments and questions. \nYeah, as others have said the current intent to encourage cooperative play (in regards to health globes) is to ensure that they heal everyone in the party when picked up.\nBut in any case, why wouldn't the witch doctor be using any of his abilities? Mass confuse, and while everything is busy wailing on each other or attacking your mongrels you sneak in. Or horrify, and while they're scattered you snag some health.\nThe witch doctor is a little sneakier though, a little more frail, a little more of a \"I'm gonna make you die or kill your friend while I'm all the way over here\". You should probably be doing everything you can to avoid being hit, and you have the tools to do so.\nMaybe? Maybe not. Maybe there are other situational/environmental mechanics that would, or would provide assistance in healing up?\nThat's a lot of conclusions to jump to in a single sentence. Classes will have abilities to help them work through groups of monsters. Obviously health globes are going to be necessary to pick up, and obviously class abilities will exist to help you do so.\nAnd, come on :-), I realize there's a lot of room for hyperbole since we just announced and a lot of details aren't out there or just don't exist, but at least have the ground before you call it a mountain. Rational concerns, complaints, issues, questions, are going to go over way better.\nWell, it's not like there's a hard cap on what a loot table can contain being forced upon us, or that health globes are even associated with loot drops. It can be balanced any way we see fit.\nBottom line, is that we're simply not going to release a game that is irritating, slow, aggravating, boring, or any of the other adjectives you used. If that means ripping out the health globe system and going a different direction, so be it, but at current it plays and feels fun and engaging. Source deleted.\nJuly 11th, 2008 - Self-sufficient classes.\nTo a question on how the each class works in a party, Bashiok responded: \nNot that classes won't benefit from each other in various ways, Barbarian shouts being good party buffs, etc. but every class is essentially a demon-killing DPS class. We have no intentions to create a tank, or healer, etc. Every class will play their own way, and while some may take direct hits easier than others, it certainly wouldn't define their role within a party. Everyone should be kicking in heads at the same time.\nDiablo III having a strong emphasis on cooperative play is really building upon one of the best parts of Diablo II, and that's charging through dungeons with other people. Our focus is on removing the frustrations that existed with grouping, and adding new features that encourage everyone to stick together and fight as a party. Source deleted.\nJuly 11th, 2008 - Item drops in multiplayer.\nOn item drops in parties, Basiok comments:\nCurrently - while in a party each player will see their own drops from each kill. This could mean that after killing a zombie I see a sword drop, and you may see a shoulder slot item drop. Or I see nothing drop, while you got an axe.\nObviously while in a group you're killing faster, and this could translate to an exponentially increasing number of drops with each additional player in your party. However, it's balanced in such a way that the drop % is pulled back a bit with each additional player (I'm simplifying it, but that's what it boils down to). This keeps it from being almost detrimental to not play with a full party, while still giving a nice increase to the amount of drops if you do.\nFrom this system it seems quite a few people got the impression that you'll never see items drop that you can't use. For instance, a Barbarian will never see a dagger that only a Witch Doctor can use. This isn't true. There is no effect, or at least no currently intended effect, to restrict which items which classes can or can't see for their respective drops. It's still intended that you could see an item that your class can't use. It's easy enough to drop the item, ask if anyone can use it, or just sell it off of course.\nYeah, so right now in a multiplayer game I'll see my items drop, if I don't want it or can't use it I'll need to pick it up and then drop it at which time everyone can see it. Then I can of course ask in chat if anyone wants it. It's fairly straight forward, and by no means final, obviously.\nTo clarify \"can't use\" we don't plan nor have any armor items at the moment that are class specific - although the bonuses and stats may be better suited to a certain class - anyone can pick up any chest/shoulder/leg/etc item and wear it. However, there are some weapons/off-hand items that are class specific. Source deleted.\nJuly 11th, 2008 - Number of classes.\nA poster asks why are there only five classes.\nWe're setting out to create unique, interesting, and diverse classes that each have their own style and flavor. Most importantly this isn't just a basic look at each individual class, but how they compare to each other and overlap (or hopefully, don't).\nWhen you up the number of classes more and more you're eventually going to begin down the route of homogenization, they start to bleed into each other's core abilities and styles which really just detracts from each individual class' recognizability and distinction within the game.\nIn addition, by limiting the number - and I say limiting not because it's a low number, it's the number of classes in Diablo II and a good one at that, but because we're not going crazy with it - we can focus on making each class really impressive, both visually and through the way they each feel and play. Source deleted.\nJuly 11th, 2008 - Health globes affecting gameplay.\nSomeone asks how will &lt;a href=\"Orbs\"&gt;Health Globe&lt;/a&gt;s affect gameplay.\nThe health globes are actually, in my opinion, really cool. Playing the game and actually seeing what types of strategy they encourage, you can start to see what they add and how they make the combat more interesting.\nI'll set the scene. You're a barbarian, you're in the wilderness and after fighting wave after wave of ghouls, skeletons, demons, what have you, you're low on health. You're out of potions, and after using a strategic leap out of the fray you turn around and seismic slam the skeletons charging you. Two of them drop health globes, but the globes dropped behind the skeletons that are still advancing. If they reach you, you're not going to survive. Are you able to leap safely to snag the globes before they can tear into you? Can you throw out another slam and try to remove the remaining enemies? How can you survive? You have a fraction of a second to decide.\nThe health globes help to create situations just like this, where you're not just sitting there spamming potions, you're using your abilities and strategy to stay alive. Possibly most importantly, you're encouraged to keep fighting, and not just run away.\nWith random spawns, random drops, and of course the randomness of combat, the health globes add to creating situations that are just more... interesting, and in my opinion, fun.\nOn the side of potions, they still exist, but they're likely to be on a cooldown of some type. They'll also likely restore health based on a percentage that's relative to your character. They may heal an instant amount, they may be the old over time type system. They're probably going to be filling an emergency-heal role more than anything though. Source deleted.\nJuly 10th, 2008 - Trading.\nBashiok on making trading more accessible:\nOne of the largest issues with a bartering system is that it prevents any ease of entry into the system for players. I have an item and I think it's probably worth something, but I have no idea what its worth and no easy way to find out. You have an item I want, but I have no idea what you may want for it or if I'm going to get a fair trade for it. You may throw a bunch of acronyms at me, get frustrated I don't know what I'm doing, and then leave. That's not going to be a positive experience for either of us, and neither of us get what we want out of it. With a stable economy and currency, there's at least a common language that anyone can understand regardless of their game knowledge. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D7903652480%26amp%3BpostId%3D79027624124%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%2313\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nJuly 10th, 2008 - Item binding.\nSomeone asked about items biding to the player.\nDiablo is a trading game, and we have no plans to change that. We don't have any inclination to make items bind to a character, or otherwise remove trading opportunities.\nWill there be absolutely no items that will be bound to a character? It isn't possible to say with any certainty at this point, there might be. Source deleted.\nJuly 9th, 2008 - Respecing.\nA poster on the WoW Diablo III forums asks whether respecing will be in Diablo III.\nThere will almost definitely be some sort of system to respec; however, it isn't likely to be as liberal as World of Warcraft. We don't want to lock a player into a system that punishes them for mistakes, experimenting, or lack of knowledge early on in the game. We also don't think a system that allows immediate, complete, and at-a-whim changes to a character spec matches the feel of Diablo. It's likely to be somewhere in between.\nThat said we still feel like the desire to play the same class again that you may have played before is still a part of the game, and with some ability to respec could potentially require other incentives. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D7720017221%26amp%3BpostId%3D79027690664%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%2324\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.\nJuly 3rd, 2008 - Player Killing.\nSomeone said that they liked to PK people on Battle.net and that option should be restored in Diablo III.\nWe're - in general - not big fans of griefing for any game. It's really only \"fun\" for one person, and that definition of fun isn't generally something we're going to want to encourage. It's far more positive to encourage and support meaningful and skillful options and systems within a game, than a mechanic for people to instantly turn against one another for no meaningful gameplay reasons.\nI definitely remember running with my friends, and someone toggles it, and bam everyone is dead and your one friend is laughing. Ok, ok, good joke I guess, and then you run back and *bam*, you've toggled it to get them back. After a while everyone usually agrees to a truce because it's just a waste of time. But I also remember running with random players and losing extremely nice items because of it, not cool. I'm sure that it was a feature that was right up some people's alleys, I won't deny there are some that would enjoy nothing more than to see others frustrated, but is that truly something that should be encouraged through design - if not directly opposed?\nWe have a large focus on cooperative play for Diablo III, and the mechanics and design decisions related to multiplayer are likely going to be based on supporting and encouraging it as much as possible, and not breaking it down.\nThat doesn't mean that PvP won't have its own focus, but those are details and features we aren't yet discussing. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D7475464063%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%26amp%3BpageNo%3D2%2324\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;."}

When asked if item drops are now class specific, Bashiok replied:\nWe don't want to bias the drop system into only giving you items you want or can use, it would be a trading and economic killer. We want to encourage trading and encourage people to see worth in items even if they can't use them - give them to friends, use them for other characters, sell them, trade them, etc.Along those lines but somewhat off-topic we do now have some restrictions on weapon types usable by each class. It's been part of the game for a while now. Allowing every class to use every weapon type was actually going to require a huge amount of time and effort and it would have meant cutting out or cutting into other features. We evaluated really how often people would want to have their class holding a weapon type that (traditionally) contradicted their class-style versus that work going in to other features - specifically having a lot more skills and a lot more skill-rune effects. We made the obvious choice which is making sure there are a ton of awesome skills and rune effects to choose from.Because I can see the conclusions being jumped to RIGHT NOW in my old cranium - let me state that weapon types do not dictate stats. At least not wholly (barbarians can't use staves so there's no point in allowing fury related stats on them). We understand that the game is about variation, customization, and experimentation in class builds. We're not World of Warcraft, we're not looking to make weapon stats \"optimal\" for the types and classes that will use them. Which is to say, we're not going to put specific stats in specific amounts on each weapon of a specific type because we're making assumptions about what each class wants out of their stats. We want variation, and experimentation, and all that good stuff. These restrictions don't affect those goals, it really just means you probably won't see a wizard lugging around a two-handed axe. Kind of a bummer, but then think about what it affords us to work on with more and better looking skills, a more robust rune-skill system, etc. We want to spend our time and effort on what makes sense to making the game better. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D18696995114%26amp%3BpostId%3D188327046923%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%2315\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nOur intention isn't to limit build potential by limiting what weapon types each class can use, and I attempted to explain that in my original post. So yes, we want to have a large variation of stats on all weapons to allow for experimentation and \"off-build\" customization. \nThere still aren't any armor restriction planned. Armor is a different issue as it's shown in much the same was as Diablo II, so more types don't actually increase the animation/modeling costs like weapon types would. \nThe list of what weapon types are or aren't allowed for each class aren't final and could change. They're fairly logical choices and what is most commonly seen as closely tied to the hero archetypes. In our current game the wizard can't wield a two-handed sword for instance, but can still use a one handed sword and shield if so desired. \nWhen asked if it was possible for restrictions to change, Bashiok replied:\nAnything is possible. Dare to dream! \n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D18696995114%26amp%3BpostId%3D188333808893%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%2336\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nJuly 28, 2009 - Difficulty.\nBashiok addressed a poster that was concerned that the difficulty of Diablo III may not be hard enough for experienced players. Although the poster seemed to answer his own question, coming to his own conclusion that difficulty will probably be progressive, Bashiok replied:\nA gradual progression of difficulty is the most logical approach for ensuring that the game is fun, and isn't prohibitive or frustrating to players of any experience level or knowledge.\nYou seem to come to the same conclusion yourself, yet you disregard the logic of it because... &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D18872650119%26amp%3BpostId%3D188327046003%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%238\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;"}

Over the years the remembrance of the old heroes waned, new hair styles emerged, and the majority of the Fallen imps now sport mohawks which symbolize undivided unity and strength.\nThe real reason for any sort of change is purely artistic. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D17367980671%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1%2317\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nAll lore is just someone sitting around and making stuff up.

I sort of see them as the comedy relief of the Diablo franchise. Except you get to stab them.\nThey're small impish guys, mischievous, not very brave, little voices that talk really fast and seem to only be able to recount the names of other fallen. They're goofy looking, sort of oddly shaped, tubby little guys running on short little legs. They're about as far as we want to push any sort of silliness in the game though. But for that, they're perfect. I don't think anyone ever took the Fallen very serious. They shouldn't be, they're little annoying imps.\nIf we push to that extreme too much though then the game's not taken seriously enough, and if anything this is a dark and very serious game. But, at the same time, you want some breaks. We don't want to constantly bombard the player with the grotesque or else that too sort of loses some of its punch.\nOf course, and I'm quoting our associate producer Nathan on this, \"The Overseer rolls seven popped collars deep.\" So there's still definitely some bad-assery to be had with the Fallen. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D17345245007%26amp%3BpostId%3D173660639389%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%2333\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nMay 22, 2009 - Animation.\nBashiok responded to an outraged poster that lamented about the choppy animation of the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;Fallen Shaman&lt;/a&gt; seen on the official site:\nHahah, well that just earns you a ban for so many reasons ... but I'll still address it. Why? I don't know, it's still a valid observation. And the outrage made me giggle.\nSo yeah, you can see that clipping issue pretty well on the model close up. The shaman was given a dagger fairly recently. From my old avatar you can see the previous model (sans dagger). The dagger was added, along with some slight model tweaks and re-texturing, to give the shaman a bit more of an edge (pah dum chhhh!). Toughen him up a little. The clipping, obviously something we try to avoid at all times when animating and building the item sets and models, in this case is practically unnoticeable at game-cam distance.\nWe're not building models, textures, and environments for these types of close up shots. In these updates we grit our teeth and bear it, because it's cool for you guys to be able to see this stuff.\nIn closing, I'm more than willing to provide reasoning and discuss observations, just don't be a jerk about it. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D17367766669%26amp%3BpostId%3D173660639228%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%2314\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;."}

Something as complex as a limb-specific crippling ability probably just wouldn't get enough screen time to make it worth it.I could see it more as a potential mechanic for progress in a boss fight maybe? Something that's a bit more substantial in health/fight length and also size and visibility of something like a crippled limb.

Right now these are drops off of monsters but there's potential to have them come from vendors, quests, etc. We're still going through UI revisions and changes, and some that includes inventory. We do like the ability to upgrade your character's storage capacity though. It gives it a comfortable RPG element.We obviously don't want to create a situation where there's huge amounts of inventory space, there should be a choice as to what items you want to hold and carry. However, we also don't want to create a restriction that ends up hurting your ability to play effectively and have fun. I have seen quite a few people comment in various threads that a limitation on the ability to get back to town quickly and frequently will compound storage issues, and that would be true, if we hadn't already designed solutions for it.Also keep in mind that alternative item storage such as a stash is still likely if not guaranteed. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D12645264729%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%234\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.\nNovember 12, 2008 - Monsters respawning in new games.\nWill the areas reset in single-player after leaving a game?\nWe're looking to follow Diablo II.

Also I think that style tends to lend itself to a game like StarCraft II a bit better since there's a lot more talk of very specific unit stats and balance, where Diablo would be based more around broad game systems and skills. Those types of things sometimes need a little back and forth.\nWhat I am planning to do though is every couple weeks sort of gather up all the posts I've made, and maybe some stuff that's happened around the internets, and keep something like that updated and posted so if people want a single place to find information they can.\nRight now I'm leaning away from the Q&amp;A's. That could change later though. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D11228425213%26amp%3BpostId%3D112954734751%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%2325\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.\nOctober 13, 2008 - Stat allocation.\nBashiok answers the community's concern in regards to the automatic stat allocation.\nFirst off thanks for writing this, it's awesome to see some indepth analysis offered in a reasonable tone. I'm sure there have been others on this same topic, but yours happened to catch my eye.\nFirst let me state that the interview article has an error in that \"You still get attributes, and they will still be required for equipment use\" is incorrect. I've already let the Diii.net guys know. There are no attribute requirements for items, that would essentially limit items to specific classes which we don't intend to do outside of actual class specific items, like the Wizard's off-hand orb for instance.\nYou missed probably the biggest positive, and if you watch the video interview (from which the Diii.net article was written) he goes in to it a bit. (http://www.diii.net/blog/comments/diiinet-jay-wilson-video-interview/)\nTo quote Jay \"For the most part attribute spending in Diablo II was a great way - when you didn't know how to play the game - to break your character. Most people didn't know where to put them and when they found out the answer was always kind of weird like \"Put 5 points in Energy and then all the rest of the points in Vitality.\"\nTo expand on it a bit more when you don't know what you're doing you're essentially lost, and you sort of spend points how you think you might want to. When you finally have an idea of how a character should be built, stat distribution generally comes in the form of \"this is exactly what you need for x build\" and there's little variation. At that point it's pretty easy to remove that system and instead offload the potential build 'requirements' to something more interesting and something that's actually more engaging and fun.\nDefinitely agree. I'm going to give you a bit of a cop-out answer, but we have quite a few game systems we haven't even talked about. Those aside, I would argue that the rune system - something we have announced - adds quite a bit of customization, and in a more interesting way than attribute distribution.\nSo as I already said the information in the article is incorrect, so happy happy joy joy this shouldn't be an issue at all.\nI don't think it's minor at all, character builds and customization is a HUGE thing, and it's important you be concerned with it. It's important that we be concerned with it, and customization and differentiating one person from another is a pretty big deal. Being able to try different things with the same class is a pretty big deal. At this point someone brings up that respecs are going to ruin wanting to replay the same classes over and over again, and you'd be right, if we weren't already thinking about it and potential solutions.\nHrm, I'll have to talk to the designers about this but I think you might taking a little bit too much Diablo II experience and overlaying it on Diablo III. Itemization and stat distribution and their relative balance of attributes to unique stats (as you put it) is a bit of a stretch at the moment. I'll see what they have to say though. Hopefully I've clarified something at this point, the error in the article seemed to be a decent piece of many people's ire over the situation so I hope that helped. Now, just to read the rest of the thread... and the hundreds of others that have built up. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D10972021570%26amp%3BpostId%3D111614720059%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%2360\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.\nOctober 7th, 2008 - Monster infighting.\nBashiok responded to a thread about monster fighting each other:\nIt would be naive to think that with all of the creatures, demons, and monsters in the world of Sanctuary that they'd all purely be concerned with killing you and you alone. Source deleted.\n\"Wow thats awesome. So they can actually fight each other?\"\nNot without reason... Source deleted.\nOctober 7, 2008 - User Interface.\nBashiok responded to a thread about the new inventory interface:\nWe have an awesome UI guy (Mike Nicholson) who is constantly iterating on the interface. Right now it has a lot of the core pieces of what we want, but it's still being worked on fairly heavily. Specifically regarding item images and being able to see the artwork - being able to reach a happy medium between single slot and having nice big item images is something we're striving for. Source deleted.\nOctober 2, 2008 - Naked Witch Doctor and Skull of Flame.\nBashiok comments on :\nIt's a \"naked\" female witch doctor, she's twisting around to her right on a wind up of a skull of flame cast (previously called fire bomb). I don't think that's the most interesting part of the screenshot though. Source deleted."}

Scary. :)\nWe'll have another website update this Thursday too, and we might find out what was in the cage. Source deleted.\nSeptember 29, 2008 - Death and checkpoints.\nBefore I get in to what we are doing let me go over some things we want to avoid with a death mechanic.\nWe want to separate being in town and being out on a quest/adventure/dungeon as much as possible. Leaving the safety of a town should not be a decision you take lightly. We don't want to remove the sense of suspense and danger by making town something you're always going back to pretty much whenever you like. The intent is to create a greater separation from being in town, and not, and to make your time away from town a lot more tense.\nOn that same note we also don't want to remove the player from the action. Throwing them back to town for every death really breaks up the action, and not in a fun, interesting, or necessary way.\nSo, with these things in mind we've found that a check point system works really well. Throughout your adventures, and generally at the ends of each \"floor\" of a dungeon your character is saved to a checkpoint. When you die you're dropped back at the last checkpoint with a small amount of health, and the rest regenerates slowly. It's obviously a very forgiving system as it is. It's just too early to put a ton of thought in to what penalties there should be, if any, added on top of it.\nRegardless, potential penalties aside, this is the death mechanic we're currently using and it's working really well so far. Source deleted.\nSeptember 27, 2008 - Q&amp;A sessions.\n\"We'll take the Q&amp;A session, please. So, when can we get that set up?\"\nHoping to get that going pretty soon after BlizzCon. Source deleted.\nSeptember 25, 2008 - Guns and spellbooks.\nFirst, Bashiok gave an sarcastic reply in a thread about guns being in Diablo III. \nWell, you have to realize that it's been 20 years, and in technological terms that can be a very long time. We're trying to create a world that's not static, its filled out, and with that it's an advancing world. With that amount of time, and also the loss of the Arreat Summit much of the remaining barbarian culture has focused on... nah I'm just kidding, there aren't any guns. Source deleted.\nBashiok then gave a more serious answer to the questions on whether spellbook will make a return from Diablo I.\nThat came back in Diablo II too eventually in the form of rune words, and I don't think it really worked out too well in the end. I do think it actually could be designed and implemented properly; balanced, etc. but...\nFor me the more important question though is what impact does it have on the class you're playing and also our knowledge of the Diablo world? Is a class nothing more than someone who read from a book, or is holding a specific item? No, they're very specific and very iconic figures (heroes even) from very distinct styles and backgrounds. The characters we play are these concentrated images of their cultures, beliefs, etc. Everything they do resembles who they are and where they're from, and what does it mean to then piecemeal that out to any one who just happens to throw a couple runes in to an item.\nIt worked better in Diablo (1) I think. Conceptually it was a bit easier to digest just because of the basic pen and paper underpinnings, and the heroes were far more generic. It was also far less obtrusive.\nIn Diablo II though, for me anyway, it always undermined the uniqueness of playing a specific class, and also what it meant to be that character. Aside from everything else it caused. Source deleted.\nSeptember 22, 2008 - Inventory and level-cap.\nBashiok was asked about the maximum level cap, and he restated something that's been said before.\nThe first and last thing said on it was in an interview with Jay at WWI when we first announced, and paraphrasing that: we will probably keep it about the same, level 99, but it always seemed like an arbitrary number to stop at so we may up it to 100. Source deleted.\nBashiok also responded to a post about the concept of using item weight instead of the tetris system of previous games.\nA weight system is simply a different approach to inventory restrictions, and it's actually fairly similar to a grid based system except that weight systems are generally augmented by a character stat instead of being item based upgrades.\nThe main issue with these systems as they relate to Diablo III is they add an additional value to items. That secondary value works to complicate and thus slow down the inventory management of a player, drawing their attention away from the action, which is of course the main focus for us with Diablo III.\nI've played a few RPGs with weight systems, and they're among my favorite games of all time, but it's a case of choosing which systems works best for each game. Source deleted.\nAnother forum goer questioned if the approach Blizzard is taking lacks depth.\nWell there's still the depth and complexity of item/stat utilization, building out your character, exploration, increased emphasis on story and lore, etc. but aside from those sort of obvious points, no I'm not worried. There are some big things we haven't revealed yet. Source deleted.\nSeptember 22, 2008 - DirectX 10 features.\nA poster wanted to know if Diablo III will include DirectX 10 features.\nWe haven't announced any final support for DirectX versions/system requirements. I'll say that right now we're not using any DirectX10 features, but we potentially could. Source deleted.\n\"Does it scale with multi-GPU's and multi-cores CPU's? \"\nHrm, I don't know what functions could be running on separate threads to throw to alternate cores, I'd have to ask. As far as I know though multi-GPU support is purely (or almost purely) a function of the drivers to throw alternate frames to each card, and as such shouldn't be dependent on the software(game) whatsoever. Source deleted.\nSeptember 19, 2008 - Alt key.\nSomeone asked if item names could appear without holding down the Alt key. \nThe way it works now is that when an item drops the name shows for about 5 seconds and then they fade out and disappear. Pressing Alt shows all dropped item names for again about 5 seconds and then the names fade out and disappear.\nI actually didn't like it at first, I liked the on/off state of pressing or not pressing Alt, but with the names showing immediately after drop and having a sort of \"grace period\" after just tapping Alt, it's really grown on me and is a lot more intuitive. It's a lot easier to see what just dropped quickly and decide if you care, and it isn't necessary to constantly hold down Alt while scavenging after a large fight.\nI still want to see -nopickup return but I haven't really asked anyone what the possibility of that is. I don't think it would work well with the current system, so options may have to be a possibility. Source deleted.\nPosters complained that he would keep pressing the Windows key instead of Alt and while the game was minimized, his character was killed.\nI've always popped out the Windows key or have keyboards with an option to turn them off just for that reason. I think there's a way to disable it through the registry too but I wouldn't recommend messing around with regedit unless you know what you're doing. Source deleted.\nSeptember 17, 2008 - More info on bodies.\nBashiok speaks again about bodies and how they interact, after giving a smaller bit of info a couple of days before:\nOur lead tech artist Julian and I talked a bit yesterday about some of the effects and fading, and he gave me some more insight as to how they're working and being changed. We also went in to some of the questions you've all brought up, and so I'll hit some specific points too (with quotes!).\nAside from my previous comment of this not being nearly as fun (it would also look/feel kind of lame), Havok already knows when an object has come to rest and so they already have a lower cost when they're still. Additionally with the proposed method there is no reliable way to determine when or even if a body will come to rest. In a single player game with a class that maybe doesn't use a ton of skills that interact with corpses in a significant way this could work, but in a multiplayer game there could potentially be hundreds of corpses piling up as they've never come to rest due to all of the player skills firing off.\nWe're also taking extra care to minimize the ability of a player to impact the performance of another player, as was sometimes maliciously done in Diablo II.\nI'm just going to quote Julian from an e-mail at this point so I'm not rewriting his words and acting like I know what I'm talking about here - \"Because most objects in the game that use the age method aren't different enough in anatomical complexity for this to yield significant benefits. The size of objects generally isn't a factor. It is the number of unseen physics meshes that the technical artists add to these things that matters and they tend to be pretty similar from actor to actor. This is largely due to the anatomical similarity of living things in nature...\"\nMost things have appendages, a back bone, head, etc.\nJulian also made the point that while we have our new system for determining the number and age of a physics actors, we still have the old tried and true \"disappear after n seconds\" method. We can actually choose which actors use which system, so our intent is to make sure that a destroyed table won't make a corpse disappear, for instance. The corpse probably being the more important of the two to keep around.\nQuite a few of you were discussing options, sliders, ways to control how long something takes to disappear, etc. and that may be a possibility. The current setting, which is around 20, is just our initial implementation. There's always the possibility for that number to change, or for it to potentially be variable by the player. We do want to keep the game options uncluttered and consistent as much as possible though. Source deleted.\nSeptember 15, 2008 - Bodies and Wretched Dead.\nA poster asked about blood and corpses fading away after a set amount of time.\nFirst, touching on the corpse fade timers as they stand, the tech to have them last longer has been in for a while. Pretty much how it's working is that there's an allowed number of physics \"actors\" that are allowed to remain at a time. These actors could be corpses, but they can also be pieces of destroyed tables, or railings, etc. anything that relies on physics. These are corpses and destructables generally. As you 'create' physics actors the oldest ones disappear. So as you're fighting there are always a number of actors remaining in the world, and it works out pretty well. Obviously how many of them can remain at one time will come down to final performance tweaking, but right now I believe it's around twenty.\nOn to blood and fading; the \"cost\" of decals, which include the blood stains, are fairly high. Cost being the relative strain put on the machine running the game. Decals account for blood, but they also account for quite a few other effects, most of which haven't yet been revealed. In the potential case of a full party creating these decals, blood flowing from creatures, skills that create them, as well as monsters themselves using skills that create them (Wretched vomiting all over the place is a good example), there is the potential to have a large number of decals on screen at any one time. So again, it's going to come down to final performance tweaks as to how many of them will remain on screen and for how long. Source deleted.\nThen someone asked about separating corpses from the physics, so they'd last forever.\nI wouldn't like that, it's awesome being able to continue to interact with the corpses. Source deleted.\nElsewhere, Bashiok revealed that we should see something new (screenshots? concept art?) on the official D3 page later this week:\nI wouldn't expect any groundbreaking revelations before BlizzCon, but do keep an eye on the Diablo III page for a nifty reveal this Thursday. Source deleted.\nSeptember 12, 2008 - Skeletal Shieldman glow.\nBashiok made a post on the Battle.net forums with an interesting tidbit of info about the &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Shieldman\"&gt;Skeletal Shieldman&lt;/a&gt; monsters in Diablo III:\nThe glow on the shields of Skeletal Shieldmen (http://www.blizzard.com/diablo3/medi...enshots.xml#11) actually serves a couple purposes. First it's an easy and quick way to identify them from other skeletons, that's a given, but the second function is that it's actually a status indicator. Obviously as you hit them they'll block the hits with their shield, but they can only block so much damage. As they block damage the glow dims. It's a useful tool that visually indicates how close their shields are to breaking.\nMy biggest gripe is having to reply to this particular thread to get that information out. Source deleted.\nSeptember 12, 2008 - Chests.\nAnswering to a complaint about how chests didn't mean much in the previous games and how most of the drops were useless, Bashiok said:\nThere have been a few discussions about chests, what they meant in the previous game, and what they'll mean in Diablo III. Currently there are no locked chests, and it's not something we're looking to reintroduce for now. We have discussed varying chest quality and types, adding randomness not only to the appearance of a chest but also the value of items it may drop or possibly specifically what types of items it's guaranteed to drop. Mix it up a bit and make finding a chest exciting, but make finding a special chest something even rarer and more exciting. It could certainly make exploring the entire floor of a dungeon more compelling before moving on. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3Bjsessionid%3DFFC5DC49ECD329514773B956B339B7AB.app05_05%3FtopicId%3D9336498309%26amp%3BpostId%3D98787703390%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%2320\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeptember 5, 2008 - Skovos artwork.\nTalking about a recently released :\nIt is &lt;a href=\"Skovos\"&gt;Skovos&lt;/a&gt;, and I think this piece was something that Leonard showed and discussed at the WWI Lore and Environment Art panel.\nIt isn't a location that you'll visit in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, but the artwork is a good example of the work and thought going in to fleshing out the world of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. It's already a very complex world with a lot of locations and events, but a lot of it still isn't visually or contextually realized. As we want to create the feeling of a world outside of your immediate view it's important to create or expand upon the locations and stories of that world.\nAs we're working to create Diablo III we're also working to create a more visually complete Sanctuary.

That is completely false.\nIf manual stat placement was or should become the best system for the game then we would balance for it - bottom line. But the fact is, it isn't the best system. The game needs to be fun, it needs to be awesome. We're not going to cut corners or try to make it easier on ourselves by choosing systems that are less work. In fact I'd say the exact opposite is true. Some of things these guys do requires an insane amount of work, but it makes the game better, and that's why it's done.\nManual stats ultimately provide no better or more interesting customization options than other systems, and in fact by removing it we're then able to implement systems which are better and more interesting ways of character customization.\nThere's a last thread of \"well why can't we have everything?\" that auto-stat opponents hold to, and the simple answer there is that having a bunch of different systems all just sort of tossed in onto each other is not a clean or fun solution. We want a lot of customization, we'll have a lot of customization, clicking a button to allocate stat points in no way needs to be involved to make that true. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19595522505%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3BpageNo%3D3%2344\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nSeptember 2, 2009 - Skill graphics.\nYeah, and that's cool. It was said I don't know how many times at this BlizzCon alone that we're always working against the issue of having too many effects that are too crazy and over the top going off at the same time. So yeah, it's always a potential problem. I just don't think our artists need to be drawn a schematic of how to fix it. They're paid professionals, they do this for a living.\nThey seem to indicate, in an unnecessarily blurry way, that spell effects should change depending on the environment. Which is a really odd and unnecessary direction. They also seem to indicate that Diablo games do not have bright/flashy/glowing weapons, armor, enemies, or spell effects to help differentiate things on-screen, that each environment should be a brown mess and spells are indistinguishable from the background. I can only assume they did not play Diablo II.\nTruthfully whoever created those images has an entirely distorted perception of what Diablo is. Really.\nBut hey, thanks for the feedback. It was delivered in a very hostile way. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19675687885%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3B19\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nAh ok, fair enough, maybe not so much on weapons. A mistake. Screenshot it. ;)\nThere were more than a few.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//img299.imageshack.us/i/appimagephpzr5.jpg/%23q%3Ddiablo%25202%2520glowing%2520weapons\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20100602023430/http%3A//gadgets.boingboing.net/Diablo-II-1.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//file043b.bebo.com/5/large/2008/07/19/19/3703920010a8371730567l.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nDo any of those blend in? Diablo II always used very bright garish colors to help give indicators to the players to serve the gameplay. There was nothing wrong with it, but condemning what's in one hand while hiding the other is just untruthful.\nI wholly disagree. And we limit to 4 because we recognize that even in Diablo II 8 was way too many people, that anything above 4, even in Diablo II, made a terrible mess of the game.\nWe want the game to look awesome. Skills should feel awesome. And more importantly you should be able to tell what each skill is. But I would disagree that most people are actually curious, as you are. The OP and others want to tell us that they know how to make a game better than we do, and I find that insulting.\nPLEASE, be curious, ask why, give some reasoned feedback. But marking up a screenshot with red marker like it's a test and we're being graded by a teacher, it's a hostile approach as far as I'm concerned.\nThe skills are absolutely not final, we understand the issues with skills being too noisy, as I said, and it's something we're aware of and will keep on top of. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19675687885%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3BpageNo%3D2%2328\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nQuote from the OP:\n\"They don't have that \"diablo touch\" or feel, yet.\"\nHe was drawing direct comparisons to previous games, and to that, I say that we're not straying.\nOk fine, I'll go find better examples. :P Bottom line is that we all know Diablo II is commonly bright, colorful, and messy with effects. It's insincere to propose otherwise.\nYes it is good design, because it's easy to then build variations, less powerful versions, or tone it back. Make everything as awesome and amazing as possible, then you work your way back if necessary to a point where it all works together. There's no real way to be completely precise with it on the first shot, so why not make things awesome?\nBut overall, yes IT IS awesome design to make everything feel epic. Do you want to put points into a skill and think it feels weak?\nAnd I think I'm just tired of stating over and over that it's a known concern. Everyone has a bad day, just give me this one as a mulligan. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19675687885%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3BpageNo%3D2%2334\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nSeptember 2, 2009 - Damage types.\nDamage types aren't actually completely finalized. There's likely to be some additions, maybe some combinations. For instance people may have noticed that a few of the witch doctor skills refer to a damage type called \"black magic\". All of the monk spells seen relied purely on weapon damage as their base, but that doesn't mean there couldn't be a holy damage type. What we don't want is for players to carry around a ton of different resistance sets to deal with a large number of different types of damages. There's quite a few different ways to go about solving that, but just to be clear we want damage types to serve the gameplay and not require players to have to pursue complex or item-heavy solutions to it. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19675928349%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1%235\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nProbably. At the very least on skills that it may not be obvious for, which if I were to guess would probably just make it easier to list it for all of them. But, UI/skill description brevity is always a goal, so we'll see. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19675928349%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1%237\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nSeptember 2, 2009 - Replayability.\nWell that's just not true. Where and when possible itemization and playing the game more to get drops and find items play into the various types of customization. Diablo is an item game, our customization systems play into that as much as possible. Runes for example. Another being every item you wear, as items and their stats play a big role in how your character is defined.\nThose require playing the game more to find items to customize your character.\nAnyway, so yeah let's say that character customization is out of the picture entirely as far as reasons to continue playing the game.\nWell, we have some ideas, and we're not going to tell you what they are. :) &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19717481671%26amp%3BpostId%3D197158473253%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%2318\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nSeptember 2, 2009 - Bind of pickup items.\nYes, true, as Jay said at BlizzCon we are planning to have some amount of items that will bind to a character upon equipping them.\nWe absolutely won't have items that bind when picked up, except for the obvious things like quest items and other character-specific items that wouldn't/shouldn't be tradable anyway.\nThat alone, I think, should dissuade the most severe concerns with binding items.\nAnd before I go on just understand that while a lot of this is very stable in its concepts, the details aren't final.\nFor Bind on Equip (BoE), the idea right now is that it would only be applied to \"end game\" items of specific quality levels. So to start, it's not every item, and it's not even every item above a certain level. For the BoE items that will exist, you can pick them up, if you don't want it you can still trade it, or give it to another character, a friend, vendor it, whatever you like. But, if you make the commitment to keeping the item and equipping it, yes, it's yours now.\nThe reasoning is that in reality we need a solid way to keep the economy stable at the end game. With items building up over a potentially infinite amount of time there's no way to have any measure of control over worth of items. While an item may be the rarest and best in the game, over four or five years a stockpile has built up and those items are now commonplace and hold little value as compared to their rarity. The gold being earned by players stays the same or likely increases as players become more proficient at playing the game while they spend less as items lose their value. Gold value drops, and we're skirting into a familiar cycle.\nBy ensuring we can rely on some amount of \"consumption\" of items, their relative worth stays high, the market is predictable and both sellers and buyers enjoy a stable marketplace for (hopefully) many years.\nDiablo II has an inconsistent approach which is the somewhat stable Ladder economy, since it's quite literally flushed out every so often. But it's a very intrusive approach to a problem that could be solved through other means that don't require making everyone start over.\nAs a quasi-aside: There's an idea being thrown around, and this is really not guaranteed in any way, that some or potentially all items that are bound to you could be bound to your entire account. So if you yourself \"own\" an item from it being bound, you can trade it between all the characters on your account freely. Feed alts your old-but-still-very-nice items, etc. That's just an idea, it may not take shape, but it's a possibility. One obvious issue with it is that it removes market demand. If you already have the best staff in the game you'll never need one again, eventually no one ever needs them, prices drop, etc. etc. That's maybe an over simplified scenario, but anyway, we'll see. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19595522940%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1%2315\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\n1. Hrm... well no, I didn't mean class specific items. What I mean was... for the items that ARE bind on pickup you wouldn't be surprised that they were.\n2. I didn't mean to indicate that but I'm not sure it's a system we're looking to carry forward. The leveling competition aspect is really cool (if it works), the dumping of one economy onto another... maybe not so much. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19595522940%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%26amp%3BpageNo%3D2%2323\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nNo armor/weapons/equippable items will be Bind on Pickup unless they are rewarded by quests.\nEnd-game items of specific quality types are currently planned to be Bind on Equip.\nI confused it all by attempting to allude to other things just so I don't get called on it later, and it really wasn't necessary.

First is the panelists, these guy's names don't get out there too much but them along with the rest of the amazing artists help to create the world and do a kick ass job of it too.\nArt Director - Christian Lichtner\nLead Character Artist - Paul Warzecha\nSenior Artist (animation) - Nick Chilano\nTech/FX artist - Chris Haga\nEnvironment Artist - Nathan Bowden\nSr. Environment Artist - Patrick Stone\nThe first part was with Paul and went over \"character\" creation, in this case the Fallen monster family. How it went from early concepts to more recent concepts, modeling, animation, and texturing. Imp, Shaman, Hound, Lunatic, Overseer. How their silhouettes define them outside of their design/abilities. There was some hint that the family revealed thus far may not be complete.\nThen he went over the creation of the witch doctor, again from concepts through the modeling and texturing process. Through some of the earlier artistic designs of follower/helper type skills such as the wicker man and fetish that would have rode on the witch doctor's back (both of which were either scrapped or transformed into other ideas).\nThen Nick went over animation, how the animation team pours over design docs and references to get an idea of how the creature/character should move and react, but ultimately just relying on the fact that \"Jay Wants Awesomeness!!\" There were videos showing examples of animation progressions, reference videos used to help the animators (we don't mocap), and some final products.\nThen Haga went over Tech/FX. Some of the things the tech art team does: Rigging, Character Implementation, Data wrangling, Debugging, Lighting and Light Map creation, Custom Tools and Scripting, FX, Design/Implementation. He went through how some of the monk skills were created, and the progression of them getting more and more awesome.\nPat Stone went over dungeons, from concepts and theme/lighting/mood to rough models, textures, refining passes, etc. How areas are created in \"gray box\" modes first, which are rough block outs of rooms to test how they play before any texturing or detail work goes into them. He also went over the concept of \"showcase rooms\". These are larger rooms that are made (essentially) first and encompass a lot of what will be going into the dungeon to serve as a style guide for the rest of the dungeon. Everything needs to blend seamlessly so a large central focus to build from helps to keep the dungeon feeling cohesive. And of course a brief bit on how dungeon rooms are randomized.\nNate went into exterior, taking the concept of the Stinging Winds (playable area at BlizzCon) and how the colors/shapes translated into playable space. How they wanted to keep a lot of depth in the zone with the rocks as well as cliffs and mining operations. Then probably my favorite part, and completely unfulfilling to type out, was a video showing Nate taking a concept of a small village/building in the Stinging Winds and building it in-game using our editing tools. He walked through how he builds out areas from big items to the smaller details, and then it's handed off for lighting passes, and the panel ended with run through of the area we watched him build in-game looking all pretty. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.battle.net/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D19595102181%26amp%3Bsid%3D3000%236\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;"}

Soldiers were stationed there along with their families. Children would play a game called &lt;a href=\"Defend%20the%20Keep\"&gt;Defend the Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThe fortress was constructed by King &lt;a href=\"Korsikk\"&gt;Korsikk&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; in order to pen the \" threat\" to the north. \nAfter years of military disasters, the frustrated king led a large army out of the fortress and into the north to conquer the Barbarians once and for all. None of them returned. Since that time, Bastion's Keep has remained as a bulwark between the violent tribes of the north and the lands of the south. The soldiers who manned its walls remained ready to confront any foe, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise, who might besiege them. Legends of the fortress were known even in &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe walls of the keep were damaged from the explosion that stemmed from the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Even two decades later, the damage had yet to be repaired.\nThe Siege of Bastion's Keep.\nIn &lt;a href=\"timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress's impregnability was put to the test as &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Army of Sin&lt;/a&gt; moved south from the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt;, the crater itself serving as staging grounds. By this point, the keep's garrison had been reduced from an intended 3000 to 1000. In contrast, the Army of Sin's numbers were practically without limit, as more demons emerged from Hell to join it with every passing hour.\nOn the tenth day of the siege, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and his allies arrived. &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; was able to turn the tide of battle and defeat Azmodan. However, victory was short lived, as &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; revealed her true colors, turning on the defenders and killing many of them. While Azmodan was defeated, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, reborn as the Prime Evil, was let loose upon the world. Many of the survivors were demoralized not only by Adria's betrayal and the death of &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, but by the capture of &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Archangel of Hope, which brought despair to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and Sanctuary until her rescue by the Nephalem. While Diablo was defeated, Bastion's Keep was left in a precarious state, as all of its food stores had been spoiled by Ghom. Sister &lt;a href=\"Frances\"&gt;Frances&lt;/a&gt; wondered how the garrison would cope over the next season.\nDuring the battle, Tyrael commented that even &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt; would have been hard pressed to have held the keep against Azmodan's forces, and that the world owed its defenders a great debt.\nIn-game.\nStarting in &lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep%20Stronghold\"&gt;Bastion's Keep Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; is a playable area, serving as the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; and NPC hub for Act III and Act IV.\nThe fortress is under attack by &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;'s demonic army. The Lord of Sin attacks the fortress without mercy, killing hundreds of soldiers and bombarding its walls with his demonic war machines. He also sends one of his commanders, &lt;a href=\"Ghom\"&gt;Ghom&lt;/a&gt;, to destroy the walls and attack from the inside. The Lord of Gluttony is shortly after hunted down and killed by the nephalem. After his attacks are pushed back, the group joins &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Archangel Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; in an offensive attack on Azmodan's army and into &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. There, the hero hunts down &lt;a href=\"Cydaea\"&gt;Cydaea&lt;/a&gt;, the Maiden of Lust, and destroys the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Heart of Sin&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after Azmodan is killed and trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Act IV and Diablo's assault of the High Heavens, if players choose to return to the mortal realm through a town portal or a waypoint, they will return to the keep stronghold. However, players cannot venture outside as the gate is shuttered and none of the previous &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt;s are available."}

They can be a nuisance to deal with because they can cling to the ceiling, out of sight, and although they can be attacked while \"nesting\" a melee character may have to walk a fair distance to attack such a creature.

The network features both &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; and co-op play.\nBattle.net is supported for &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WarCraft\"&gt;WarCraft&lt;/a&gt; II Battle.net Edition, WarCraft III, StarCraft II and &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt; including expansions, except the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt; expansion for Diablo I. The network got a complete overhaul with the release of StarCraft II.\nOriginal Battle.net.\nDiablo.\nWhen the service initially launched with Diablo in December 1996, Battle.net offered only a few basic services like chatting and game listings. Players could connect to the service, talk with other gamers and join multiplayer games of Diablo. Besides user account data, no game data was stored on the Battle.net servers. When a player connected to a game, they would be connecting directly to the other players in the game. No data was sent through the Battle.net servers. While this made the service quick and easy to use, it quickly led to rampant cheating since players using cheats could modify their game data locally. However, since there was an option to create private games, many players ended up playing with people whom they knew.\nHellfire.\n&lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt; did not have any kind of &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; options, except those added by editing the &lt;a href=\"Command.txt\"&gt;Command.txt&lt;/a&gt; file.\nDiablo II.\nThe main highlight of Diablo II as it relates to Battle.net was that the game was completely client-server based. The game was no longer simulated on each player's computer, but instead was run on Blizzard's server. This also meant that all of the character data for the game was stored on the Battle.net servers. This effectively put an end to cheating. The game also had an open character feature on Battle.net which stored the player's character on the client. This allowed players to play characters locally or on a LAN, and then use those same characters on Battle.net. However, any open games played on Battle.net were not protected from cheating by other players since they could have modified their characters locally. Diablo II also had a unique feature that would show the players in the Battle.net chat room as avatars who looked like their characters did in the game. It also used a different Battle.net interface than previous games, where previously there were mainly only color differences. There was also expanded &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; support including a \"&lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;\" ladder which listed players whose characters would be removed permanently if they died in-game.\nDiablo II: Lord of Destruction.\nWith the release of the , the usage of Battle.net rose dramatically.\nForums.\nThe actual website (as opposed to the game servers) had several &lt;a href=\"Battle.net%20Forums\"&gt;Battle.net Forums&lt;/a&gt; Although the focus was mostly on &lt;a href=\"Starcraft\"&gt;Starcraft&lt;/a&gt; it had three features related to Diablo:\nBattle.net 2.0.\nSupported Games.\nThe following Blizzard games are currently supported on Battle.net:\nThe following future Blizzard games will be supported on Battle.net:\nThe following older Blizzard games do not support Battle.net:\nDiablo III.\nBeginning with \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", all \"Diablo\" games are hosted on Battle.net and require connecting to it to play. This follows the trend of other Blizzard games and the industry as a whole. It is still possible to create private games for solo play, but they do require an internet connection regardless."}

Blizzard decided to keep PVP separate from PVM (player vs. monster) to prevent griefing and so they could more fairly balance PVP gameplay.\nBalancing.\nThe separation of PVP from PVM was done to allow for greater flexibility when addressing PVP related gameplay (such as balancing) without messing up the PVM experience. However Blizzard has said they feel that they want the feeling of being powerful to be maintained. So expect the arena's to not be so balanced as to allow for fair PVP as they are leaning more towards a place to show off.\nThey have also mentioned that they do not want to make changes to PVP that would allow for an e-sport to emerge. This means there will not be hardcore tweaks to characters that one would expect of a fair and balanced e-sport game.\nSpells &amp; PVP.\nThey are not going to build spells around PVP and are concentrating more on the PVM portion of the game, as this is not intended to be a PVP game. However as in Diablo II some spells will be better for PVP for obvious reasons. i.e.: single target high damage abilities.\nLevel Design.\nAs of now expect the arena's to be single level battlegrounds as it made gameplay more fun and because of the engine's inability to aim up and down cliffs reliably. As the name suggests the PVP levels will all be arena based and not open environments."}

All instances of this type of shrine were removed and replaced with chest versions, possibly around &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 10.\nMost if not all \"five waves\" format &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Chest\"&gt;Cursed Chest&lt;/a&gt;s were formerly Cursed Shrines of this type. They functioned almost exactly the same as the equivalent Cursed Chests, including their names and presence in \"Cursebreaker\" &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt;, and requiring the dispatch of five waves of monsters. The only difference was that completion of the events cleansed shrines rather than chests, turning them into random un-cursed shrines. The bonus reward was still a &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Chest\"&gt;Radiant Chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of these shrines in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; instead functioned like \"minor\" Cursed Chests, spawning a pack of monsters or a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;, with a short timer to defeat them. Just like the chests, defeating the monsters in time cleansed the shrine, otherwise the monsters remain but the event is failed and the shrine disappears.\nPylons.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s, there exist more powerful effects from environmental objects known as Pylons. These effects are exclusive to the Nephalem Rifts, and usually last for only 30 seconds (Speed and Shielding last 60).

One of his role models growing up was &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sladyan\"&gt;Sladyan&lt;/a&gt;. As a youth, He befriended &lt;a href=\"Oza\"&gt;Oza&lt;/a&gt;, who was transferred from another monastery. \nForgotten Nightmares.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mists\"&gt;Black Mists&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Valley\"&gt;Misty Valley&lt;/a&gt; started to spread to other parts of the mountain, and the monastery was almost overrun by &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28monster%29\"&gt;Nightmares&lt;/a&gt;. Aware of &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;'s actions with Oza, who had spoken highly of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, Shura sent a &lt;a href=\"Plea%20for%20Help\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;the adventurer's contact&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, asking for help.\nWith the monastery overrun, Shura and the other Monks sought refuge at &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Sentinel's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Though they were grateful, there was tension between the Monks and the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Crusade\"&gt;old hatreds&lt;/a&gt;. After an argument with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Vereks\"&gt;Captain Vereks&lt;/a&gt; on how to proceed, Shura took a combined force of volunteers to eradicate the source of the mists. During the fighting, some of Shura's fellow Monks were lost to the mists in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctified%20Earth%20Monastery\"&gt;Sanctified Earth Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. \nShura met with the Shard-seeker, and declared his intention to travel to the monastery to use Sladyan's mantra to dispel the mists. Sladyan had used his power to dispel the mists centuries ago, and Shura believed the deed could be repeated. Together, they travelled to the Sanctified Earth Monastery, to Sladyan's statue to reveal the truths of the past and retrieve Sladyan's mantra. The vision revealed details Shura did not expect, and hinted that his idol might be connected to the origin of the mists.\nAt first, he didn't want to believe it but his companion was able to make him see reason. With the mantra they retrieved they discovered the origin of the mists; a &lt;a href=\"Silent%20Monastery\"&gt;Veradani temple&lt;/a&gt; that was lost during the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Crusade\"&gt;Zakarum Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Using the mantra, Shura cleared the mist around the entrance, but could not follow his companion inside, as he had to maintain the mantra that cleared the path.\nAfter some time, the mists slightly receded, and his companion exited the monastery with proof of the mists' source; a corrupted prayer bead that belonged to Patriarch Sladyan. After purifying the bead, the mists further receded but did not completely fade. They discovered that the mists was actually a manifestation of the hatred borne by the people of Zavain, and as long as its people still carried old hatreds in their hearts, it wouldn't completely fade. This made Shura to come to terms with his own grudges and resolve to find peace by letting his hatred go.\nIn-game.\nShura is the &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; companion for the \"&lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Nightmares\"&gt;Forgotten Nightmares&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nShura is a passionate man and cares deeply for those he holds there. This means that he holds deep grudges against those he feels wronged by (ie. &lt;a href=\"Dravec\"&gt;Dravec&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;). He is loyal to those he believes in, to the point of denying their faults. Fortunately, he is able to set aside his grudges for the greater good of those he cares about.\nShura is a skilled combatant, showing proficiency with the , &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Kick\"&gt;Flying Kick&lt;/a&gt; and skills. In the &lt;a href=\"World%27s%20Crown\"&gt;World's Crown&lt;/a&gt;, he used &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Rush\"&gt;Tempest Rush&lt;/a&gt; to rampage through a horde of demons.

Their primary weakness lies in their slow movement and lack of intelligence. Ranged classes may employ fire-and-move tactics to easily bring them down.\nSiege Beasts also serve as beasts of burden for the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Imp\"&gt;Demon Imp&lt;/a&gt;s.

Leading the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Army of Sin&lt;/a&gt;, his forces emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt;. The crater served as a staging ground, and his army marched south.\nBy this point, the keep's garrison had been reduced from an intended 3000 to 1000. In contrast, the Army of Sin's numbers were practically without limit, as more demons emerged from Hell to join it with every passing hour.\nThe demons' assault was relentless. They seemed without number, and kept up their attack through both night and day, while Azmodan's war machines bombarded the walls. Morale among the besieged defenders dwindled, The demons were able to take the &lt;a href=\"Stonefort\"&gt;Stonefort&lt;/a&gt;, which prevented the catapults from being raised from their berths below. During the siege, a &lt;a href=\"Siegebreaker%20Assault%20Beast\"&gt;Siegebreaker Assault Beast&lt;/a&gt; was unleashed upon the fortress, and while it fell, it took over 100 men to bring it down.\nAt some point, a request for reinforcements was made of Westmarch.\nOn the ninth day of the siege, Commander &lt;a href=\"Calderos\"&gt;Calderos&lt;/a&gt; decided that a \"righteous show of force\" was what was needed to send Azmodan's army into retreat, and intended to lead a charge from the fortifications the following day. Come the tenth day, Calderos led his charge, and he and his men were slaughtered at the gates.\nDefeat neared. Bastion's Keep was close to falling, and Azmodan's minions knew it, as many demons paused in their assault to feast upon the flesh and blood of their mortal foes. Azmodan called an end to their indulgence and ordered a final assault, wanting the keep to fall before the next dawn. On the tenth day of the siege, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and his allies arrived. By this stage, the keep's soldiers were scattered, the original bastion of 1000 reduced to 300, and Azmodan was throwing everything he had against the keep. Legions of demons crashed against the walls, sending tremors through the bones of the fortress, and fiery projectiles rained down against the walls. That the damage from twenty years ago had yet to be repaired didn't help matters. Tyrael, taking command of the keep's defenders, ordered &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; to light the keep's signal fires, which served to boost the defenders' morale. Azmodan was aware of the Nephalem's presence, but kept up the attack nonetheless.\nThe Tide Turns.\nThe Nephalem made their way across the keep's &lt;a href=\"Skycrown%20Battlements\"&gt;battlements&lt;/a&gt; successfully lighting the signal fires even as demons spilled over the walls. The Nephalem met with &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Dalen\"&gt;Sergeant Dalen&lt;/a&gt;, who informed them that the catapults could break Azmodan's lines, but couldn't be raised due to the presence of demons on the walls. Afterwards, the Nephalem, with the aid of the keep's soldiers, was able to raise the fortress's catapults into position. With that done, projectiles rained down upon Azmodan's army. His lines fell into disarray almost immediately.\nAzmodan mocked The Nephalem, revealing that while the catapults were being raised, his forces had breached the keep in its lower levels. The Nephalem and the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep%20Stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;'s defenders were able to repel them, and The Nephalem headed into the depths to seal the breach in the lower walls. There were few defenders down there, just soldiers gathering supplies. In this, they succeeded, defeating the demon &lt;a href=\"Ghom\"&gt;Ghom&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Messenger%20Martyns\"&gt;messenger&lt;/a&gt; arrived from &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, informing Tyrael that &lt;a href=\"King%20Justinian%20IV\"&gt;King Justinian&lt;/a&gt; would not send reinforcements to fight \"imaginary demon lords.\" Tyrael bitterly commented that the king might believe when his kingdom was burnt to ashes around him.\nThe Nephalem proceeded to deal with the new threat as demons entered the keep through its lower levels, even killing &lt;a href=\"Ghom\"&gt;Ghom&lt;/a&gt;, one of Azmodan's &lt;a href=\"Sin%20Lieutenants\"&gt;Sin Lieutenants&lt;/a&gt;. However, while the demons had been repelled from the fortress, Azmodan's war machines continued to bombard it. The Nephalem headed out onto the battlefields, destroying the constructs. However, demons continued to emerge from the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt;, prompting The Nephalem to descend into the crater to confront Azmodan. By this point, Azmodan had dredged up &lt;a href=\"Sin%20Heart\"&gt;Sin Heart&lt;/a&gt;s from his &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Sin\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; to empower his legions. \nThe Nephalem fought their way through the crater, killing the Sin Lieutenant Cydaea, and destroying the Sin Hearts. Finally, Azmodan himself was defeated, ending the siege days after they had arrived.\nAftermath.\nBy the end of the siege, the bodies of Azmodan's legions littered the battlefield. With the news of Azmodan's defeat, many of the keep's defenders rejoiced, believing that they could head home. However, Victory was short lived, as &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; revealed her true colors, turning on the defenders and killing many of them. While Azmodan was defeated, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, reborn as the Prime Evil, was let loose upon the world. Many of the survivors were demoralized not only by Adria's betrayal and the death of &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, but by the capture of &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Archangel of Hope, which brought despair to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and Sanctuary until her rescue by the Nephalem. While Diablo was defeated, Bastion's Keep was left in a precarious state, as all of its food stores had been spoiled by Ghom. Sister &lt;a href=\"Frances\"&gt;Frances&lt;/a&gt; wondered how the garrison would cope over the next season.\nDuring the battle, Tyrael commented that even &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt; would have been hard pressed to have held the keep against Azmodan's forces, and that the world owed its defenders a great debt."}

He did not consider himself to be superstitious, though had faith in the existence of gods, and believed that a curse would befall anyone who defiled an unbroken grave.\nBiography.\nEarly Life.\nSiggard arrived at Bear's Hill with his father when he was a young boy. The two did quite well together as farmers. The two travelled down the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Road\"&gt;Queen's Road&lt;/a&gt; several times, and his father showed him burial mounds where ancient kings were buried. While at Bear's Hill, he met a girl named &lt;a href=\"Emilye\"&gt;Emilye&lt;/a&gt; at one of the village dances and it was, in Siggard's words, \"love at first sight.\" The two later married and owned a farm set outside the village proper. Siggard promised that he'd always protect her.\nAt times, they would go hunting for deer, and whenever they could, they would pick mushrooms in the countryside. This remained true even after Emilye became pregnant, despite Siggard's concerns that she was pushing herself too hard. Eventually, their daughter was born. However, two weeks afterwards, with the girl still unnamed, Siggard received a summons to march in the army of Earl Edgewulf. He told her that he'd return home, and they'd name their daughter then.\nBlackmarch.\nSiggard fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Blackmarch\"&gt;Battle of Blackmarch&lt;/a&gt; as a shield-man. Much as he was loathe to leave his wife and newborn child he marched alongside Edgewulf's forces. At the site of battle, he stood alongside his friend &lt;a href=\"Banagar\"&gt;Banagar&lt;/a&gt; as they waited for the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; army of &lt;a href=\"Assur\"&gt;Assur&lt;/a&gt; to arrive. Alongside all the earl's other men, he fought against the army. It came to a point where it looked like they might win, but then Assue himself emerged. Moments later, demons attacked the Entstegians from behind. Siggard fought desparately, but the men were crushed together, and Siggard found that he couldn't move. In the last part of the battle, he was stabbed in the back by a &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;. However, he returned to &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;, as his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was so powerful that &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; could not claim him. However, when he awoke on the side of a road, he was left without the memory of his final moments, or the details of the battle. He knew that he had taken part in the battle, but against whom, he could not say. He knew he had to rejoin his fellow though. With little idea of how to get to &lt;a href=\"Blackmarch\"&gt;Blackmarch&lt;/a&gt;, he picked a direction and started walking, before eventually falling asleep by a fire.\nWhen he awoke, he found himself in the company of a stranger. The stranger told him that this was the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Night of Souls&lt;/a&gt;, and that his name was &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;; a servant of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Siggard told his story of his fighting at Blackmarch, but that he couldn't remember what happened to him in the final moments. Nevertheless, he had to get back. Tyrael warned him not to go, and advised him to head to &lt;a href=\"Entsteig%20%28City%29\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt; instead. Siggard glanced down the road Tyrael had referred to and thanked him for the advice, but when he turned back, found himself alone by the fire. The following day, he wondered if Tyrael had been a ghost, or perhaps simply a figment of his imagination. Whatever the case, instead of following the stranger's advice, he took the road to Blackmarch.\nAs he headed north, he noticed a wrongness in the nearby forest\u2014it smelt of decay. After a full day's walking, he settled down again, where he was approached by another man\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sarnakyle\"&gt;Sarnakyle&lt;/a&gt;. He told him he was headed for Blackmarch, and Sarnakyle said that he had heard terrible stories of that place. That this was the second man who had spoken ill of Blackmarch didn't do Siggard's state of mind any favors, but regardless, he found peaceful sleep this time. However, the following morning, as Siggard pressed to leave, Sarnakyle revealed that a battle against a demonic army had taken place at Blackmarch. The men there had been slaughtered, with less than ten survivors. Aghast, Siggard stated that he had to get to his family. Sarnakyle deduced that the demons were heading for the capital, and they set off together.\nHomecoming.\nThe two made good progress as they headed for the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Road\"&gt;King's Road&lt;/a&gt;, from which Siggard knew he could get his bearings. Reaching it, Siggard declared that they should set out from &lt;a href=\"Brennor\"&gt;Brennor&lt;/a&gt;, from which they could head to Bear's Hill. They smelt a nearby fire, and while Siggard thought it might be a harvest festival, it was in fact the smouldering remnants of a &lt;a href=\"Gellan%27s%20Pass\"&gt;destroyed village&lt;/a&gt;. Investigating it, they found that the demons had slaughtered every inhabitant, and even all of the livestock, leaving a pyramid of severed and decaying heads behind. The two pressed on to Bear's Hill, but found that it had met the same fate, alongside the same macabre display. Sarnakyle suggested that Emilye might have made it out, but Siggard found her severed head in the pyramid, staring out at him with dead eyes, the flies consuming her flesh. He fell backwards, weeping, knowing that if the demons returned now, he wouldn't have the will to defend himself.\nSarnakyle didn't give in to emotion as readily, and cautioned Siggard that three strangers were watching them. They revealed themselves, and Siggard recognised one of them as &lt;a href=\"Tylwulf\"&gt;Tylwulf&lt;/a&gt;. Sarnakyle was uneasy, more so as Tylwulf relayed his story of how he and the others had fled when the demons arrived. Tylwulf revealed that Siggard's daughter was dead, as were all the other children of the village. Tylwylf offerred the pair lodgings at his farm, to which Siggard accepted.\nTylwulf's wife, &lt;a href=\"Camylle\"&gt;Camylle&lt;/a&gt;, served them dinner, but Siggard barely ate. He and Siggard retired to a single room, and Sarnakyle warned him that there would be trachery tonight. How, he asked, had Tylwulf and the others survived? How had Tylwulf known he was of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt;? Third, why were there no graves? Siggard and Sarnakyle stood in wait, and indeed, Tylwulf and his wife attempted to kill them in their sleep. However, having planned ahead, Siggard easily overpowered Tylwulf, while Sarnakyle put a dagger to Camylle's neck. Tylwulf revealed that he and the other survivors had pledged themselves to the demons ahead of time, and had been spared while everyone else was slaughtered. Furthermore, he had consumed Siggard's own daughter. Enraged, Siggard killed Tylwulf, Camylle, and headed outside to confront the other eight traitors. He killed all of them, but found it brought him no joy. Sarnakyle told him that based on what they had seen, an archdemon was leading the demonic army. Siggard swore to kill the baron of Hell to avenge his family.\nBrennor.\nAfter treating Siggard's wounds, the two headed for Brennor, as Sarnakyle reasoned that it was better to wait for the demon to come to them than seek him out. To this end, they headed down the Queen's Road. They arrived at an inn Siggard had once stayed at in his youth, but that too had been burnt down. To take shelter, they headed into a nearby burial mound, and inside, found a &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; forged by &lt;a href=\"Velund\"&gt;Velund&lt;/a&gt;. Sarnakyle stated that Velund's swords were forged to pick their wielders, and that this sword had chosen Siggard. Taking it, the sword 'sung' to Siggard, telling him tales of armies of angels and demons, before giving him its name\u2014&lt;a href=\"Guthbreoht\"&gt;Guthbreoht&lt;/a&gt;. As they slept, the sword continued to 'sing,' and Siggard was able to recall more of the battle at Blackmarch.\nAt midday the next day, they arrived at Brennor. Entering the town, they headed to Earl Edgewulf, Reaching the castle that served as Tilgar's seat, they were met by &lt;a href=\"Hunfirth\"&gt;Hunfirth&lt;/a&gt;, Steward of Brennor, who revealed that Edgewulf had been slain at Blackmarch, and that his son, &lt;a href=\"Tilgar\"&gt;Tilgar&lt;/a&gt;, had succeeded him as earl. Hunfirth was disinclined to let them see Tilgar, and less inclined to believe their stories of a demonic army. He accused Siggard of being a deserter, having survived Blackmarch, but unable to explain how. He told Siggard and Sarnakyle to get out. They headed for an inn, Siggard suggesting that they try tomorrow. However, the demons laid siege to the town, and the two joined the &lt;a href=\"Brennor%20City%20Guard\"&gt;town guard&lt;/a&gt; in fending off the attack. Afterwards, they were met by Hunfirth and Tilgar, the latter of whom telling them to meet them at his castle tomorrow. The two headed back to the inn to get some sleep.\nThe following morning, they met Tilgar in his office. He introduced them to &lt;a href=\"Hagan\"&gt;Hagan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wulfgar\"&gt;Wulfgar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guthwulf\"&gt;Guthwulf&lt;/a&gt;. They discussed their strategy for defending the town, Sarnakyle informing them that their only hope was to slay the archdemon who led the army. They helped prepare the defense, before Tilgar sent them a letter, informing him that his scouts had confirmed that the demonic army had destroyed all the surrounding towns and blockaded the roles, cutting off Brennor from the outside world. Furthermore, the army was estimated as being 3000\u20134000 strong. Siggard and Sarnakyle were stationed at the eastern wall, and come night, the demons approached the town. Sarnakyle recognised the archdemon who led the army as being &lt;a href=\"Assur\"&gt;Assur&lt;/a&gt;; favored baron of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. Siggard counted the army as being 5000\u20136000 strong, but according to Sarnakyle, the battle was already lost. The two of them headed to see Tilgar.\nThey found the earl with his commanders, including Tyrael, who had joined him. Sarnakyle informed them that they faced Assur, and Tyrael revealed that he could offer nothing more than advice, given his difficulty in manifesting upon the mortal plane. Sarnakyle explained that Assur possessed the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Invincibility\"&gt;Glyph of Invincibility&lt;/a&gt;, and ergo, Tyrael explained that their best hope was to simply defeat his army. If they failed, Hell could establish a foothold on Sanctuary in order to assault Heaven.\nSiggard and Sarnakyle returned to the war, battling the demons which climbed over it. Two waves were launched, but the defenders held. In the aftermath, Assur gave the town an ultimatum\u2014surrender now, and only half of them would die. Fight, and all of them would die. Tilgar refused Assur's terms, and in response, arrows were fired at the defenders on their own side of the wall, courtesy of &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt;. Tilgar ordered a retreat into the castle, before heading out a secret passage. Siggard refused to go with them however, declaring that he would head back into Brennor at nightfall to kill Assur. Sarnakyle and Tilgar pointed out that this was tantamount to suicide, but Siggard was undeterred.\nAssur.\nSiggard approached what was left of the gates of Brennor. He approached a dog-like demon and told it that it had come to serve Assur. The demon told him that he would take him to his lord. Siggard was brought face to face with Assur, who immediately deduced that the human had come to kill him. Assur laughed, telling Siggard that know living man could kill him. Not even a sword forged by Velund. Siggard nevertheless attacked the demon, and the two engaged in combat. Siggard thrust his sword through Assur's glyph and body, killing the demon. A possessed human attacked him, but Siggard cut him down, and proceeded to do the same for any demons left in Brennor.\nAs the sun rose, Siggard sat on a hill near Brennor. Despite Assur's death, he felt empty inside. Tyrael approached him, and Siggard revealed that he'd realized the truth. His missing days, his lack of appetite, the fact that he'd killed Assur...he was dead. He'd died at Blackmarch, a fact which Tyrael confirmed. However, it was not Heaven that returned him to life, but Siggard himself. Tyrael explained that rarely, perhaps but twice in ten millennia, there was a soul so full of life that death cannot claim it. Siggard possessed such a soul. All Tyrael had done was point him in the right direction. He further explained that Siggard was not &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, but rather trapped between life and death. Only if Siggard found a way to rest his incredible vitality would death take him. He stated that vengeance would not give him peace, but rather an act of life. He suspected Siggard would find it someday, though it might take centuries. In the meantime though, Siggard could be a valuable ally in the fight against Hell. Tyrael big Siggard farewell and faded away.\nSiggard headed back to find Tilgar and his men. He had a long road ahead of him, but at least knew his first destination.\nLegacy.\nSiggard remained with Tilgar for several years to help rebuild Brennor. He then began to roam the world, fighting agaisnt the forces of Hell. It was said that he fought battle after battle over the centuries. After 500 years, he disappeared from sagas and epics. Whether Siggard finally found peace or just grew tired of the conflict, none can say. However, it is still held among Entsteigians that if one goes to the ruins ofa certain village on the Night of Souls, one will see a lonely figure standing a silent vigil in the mist, seeking a glimpose of lived ones long gone to dust."}

It has the ability to maintain contact across realms, and give insight into the future.\nHistory.\nThe Eye was once possessed by the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Philios%20%28Nephalem%29\"&gt;Philios&lt;/a&gt;. He used it to maintain contact with the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lycander\"&gt;Lycander&lt;/a&gt;, after she fled &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in light of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;'s purge. When her fellow angels learned that she was communicating with someone outside &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, she ended the romance and insisted that Philios hide the Eye so that &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; would not learn of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s existence. \nPhilios hid the Eye on &lt;a href=\"Skovos\"&gt;Skovos&lt;/a&gt;, where it was recovered by his twin daughters, where they made their home on the island. Though they did not use the Eye to communicate with Heaven, they found that they were able to see the future through its mirrored surface. So it was that &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt; culture developed, with the Sightless Eye at the heart of their society. Even today, it is held as one of the most sacred objects in Askari culture. The &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Caste\"&gt;Oracle Caste&lt;/a&gt; used the Eye to see into the future.\nThe Eye was stolen from Skovos by a group of &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; dissidents called the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;. They stole the artifact and fled to &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. The means of using it were a closely guarded secret within the Sisterhood. It forsaw a time of great glory, but how far ahead, the Eye could not say. With the loss of the Eye, the Oracle Caste's ability to look into the future was hindered, but not removed, as their handling of the artifact had imprinted the gift of divination on them. Their visions were no longer as clear, however.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt; fell to &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, the Sightless Eye's fate remained clear. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; noted that it falling into the Maiden of Anguish's hands was one such possibility.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; possessed the .

Towards the end of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Crusade\"&gt;Zakarum Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, it was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of Light&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a regiment sect of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to purge the land of &lt;a href=\"Veradani\"&gt;heretics&lt;/a&gt;.\nLed by a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Martanos\"&gt;ruthless commander&lt;/a&gt;, they slaughtered every inhabitant that they could. Even the &lt;a href=\"Sladyan\"&gt;patriarch&lt;/a&gt; of the monastery was defeated. In a desperate bid to stop the invaders, the the patriarch unleashed an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nightmare\"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt; which was sealed beneath the monastery.\nIts corruption spread in the form of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mists\"&gt;Black Mists&lt;/a&gt;, that killed all the combatants and turned them into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. The mists covered the &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Valley\"&gt;surrounding valley&lt;/a&gt;, killing everything and birthing &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28monster%29\"&gt;nightmare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Over time, the monastery at the heart of the mist was forgotten, only tales of the great battle surviving.\nForgotten Nightmares.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231271\"&gt;1271&lt;/a&gt;, foreboding black mist began emanating from the monastery, rolling off the peaks of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt; and creeping into &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Sentinel's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. The fog threatened to encase the entire area in incomprehensible darkness. A &lt;a href=\"Shura\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; wrote a &lt;a href=\"Plea%20for%20help\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;(s) asking for help. The Shard-seeker(s) were able to clear the mists.\nGameplay.\nThe Silent Monastery is located a little to the north east of the Misty Valley Waypoint. It is first accessed as part of the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Nightmares\"&gt;Forgotten Nightmares&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal%20quests\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;; \"&lt;a href=\"Seeker%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Seeker of Truth&lt;/a&gt;\". Navigating the monastery allows players to relive the history of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; crusades through &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28Country%29\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe inside of the Silent Monastery is home to eternal night, making it nearly impossible to navigate. Fortunately, some of the temple\u2019s statues can be illuminated. Make haste in lighting these statues, they are the only thing that can weaken the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s lurking in the shadows. As players light additional statues and rid the dungeon of monsters, the darkness will be cast out of that area for good."}

{"id": "1682", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1682", "title": "Sin War (Event)", "text": "The Sin War was a secret struggle fought between the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the goal being the allegiance of &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. It was a war that would inexorably link Man to the war between &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, even after the conflict's supposed end.\nLore.\nOrigins.\nThe war between the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; was an everlasting conflict and as such, a stalemate. Attacks on one side would be repaid by counterstrikes; legions of demons and angels were obliterated in the process, but without causing a significant breakthrough. It was &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, tactical advisor to the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; of the High Heavens, who would eventually grow tired of the constant planning, counterplanning, and even counter-counterplanning. With the other members of the Council, even Tyrael, refusing to see Inarius's \"reason\", he gathered like-minded individuals from both Heaven and Hell, and led them far away from the carnage. After stealing the primal Eye of Anu, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, Inarius created a realm he called &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, where the renegade angels and demons could live in peace. Inarius also fell in love with a like-minded demoness, &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. Inarius made certain his former masters - and enemies - would not find his refuge as he shielded the realm from outside interference.\nFrom the union of angel and demon the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; were created. Inarius wanted to eradicate the nephalem or 'first born', whom he eyed as abominations, but it was Lilith who first saw their potential. She realized the nephalem had the potential to become more than both angel and demon, and wanted to harness their power for her own ends. To this end she murdered most (if not all) of the renegade angels and demons. For her transgressions, Inarius banished her to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Not fully able to eradicate the nephalem, Inarius now sought to contain their abilities, manipulating the Worldstone to dampen their powers.\nFor a while all seemed right, but eventually both sides of the Conflict were bound to take notice of Sanctuary. It was the Burning Hells which first discovered the realm, because of the reckless actions of &lt;a href=\"Jere%20Harash\"&gt;Jere Harash&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt; had long sought to summon \"spirits,\" but having discovered the existence of demons, they began to summon them frequently and in ever increasing numbers, hoping to learn more about the universe and magic. What they did not know was that their actions had alerted Hell to the existence of Sanctuary. The demons took notice of the mortal inhabitants of Sanctuary and realized its strategic value. Control over Sanctuary and its mortal population could gain the decisive advantage in the Great Conflict. In order not to alert the High Heavens, the forces of Hell opted for the subtle approach. The &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; sent his son, &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt;, to the realm, where he established a cult - the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;. This cult would win over humanity to its side, gradually turning them over the side of Evil. However Inarius noticed the intrusion, and created a counter-sect - the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; - that preached the teachings of the Light. And so the great game had begun: a secret war of subterfuge and manipulations, with humanity as its grand prize.\nCourse of the War.\nThe rise of these two religions polarized &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt; society as their ideological battle continued over the next decade. The status quo between the two bodies was maintained, as agents of both religions carried their messages to the people, building bases of power, constructing monuments, and winning the absolute loyalty of faithful supplicants. While the Triune had been established long before the Cathedral, within a decade, the two bodies were at parity in terms of the scope of their influence. With the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt; on the verge of war themselves, many in Kehjan found themselves flocking to one of the two religions.\nAt the war's end, 3000 years before the darkening of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, the precarious balance between the Triune and the Cathedral dissolved due to the return of Lilith, who once again sought to bring the power of the nephalem under her control. To this end, she weakened the dampening effect of the Worldstone and manipulated a simple farmer - &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt; - into removing the main obstacles: the Triune and the Cathedral. Uldyssian led a band of followers called the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; against the two bodies, for they saw them as the source of Kehjan's strife. Uldyssian's followers also had access to their nephalem potential, allowed for by Uldyssian's alteration of the Worldstone's attunement, allowing the Edyrem's powers to grow.\nThough this proved effective at first - Uldyssian and his nephalem banished Lucion and toppled the Triune - Lilith eventually lost control of the situation. Uldyssian managed to severely weaken Lilith, allowing Inarius to once again banish her to the Void.\nAs the nephalem now turned on the Cathedral and Inarius, the High Heavens finally discovered the mortal realm as well. With the Cathedral in ruins and Inarius defeated, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, reacting against Uldyssian's apparent injustice against Inarius, unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; upon the mortal realm. In turn, the &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Legion\"&gt;armies&lt;/a&gt; of Hell erupted from the ground, and a three-way battle began between the angels, demons, and Edyrem. Uldyssian released his full power, driving the armies of Heaven and Hell back. However, in doing so, he realized that the untamed nephalem energies were threatening to destroy the world. It was too much power gained too quickly, and he could feel himself losing his humanity to his nephalem birthright. Thus, he brought the raging energies into himself and released them one last time, the release of said energies resetting the Worldstone and stripping the Edyrem of their abilities, but at the cost of his own being. In the end, Uldyssian had chosen humanity over godhood and sacrificed himself so that humanity might survive. So it was that he sacrificed himself.\nIn the aftermath of Uldyssian's sacrifice, the Angiris Council and Mephisto convened in order to decide the fate of the mortal realm. Though the Council was torn over a decision whether to spare the mortals or to eradicate them, they eventually voted for Sanctuary's continued existence, Tyrael himself casting the deciding vote, so moved was he by Uldyssian's sacrifice. In exchange for the renegade Inarius, Mephisto proposed a truce: the forces of Hell would no longer interfere in the mortal realm. Humanity was left to its own devices and left out of the Great Conflict.\nAftermath.\nA condition of Sanctuary's continued existence was a mind wipe of sorts for the surviving Edyrem. None were to remember the events of the war, so that humanity could choose between light and dark from an unbiased perspective; none would know of the existence of demons, angels, or nephalem. As far as most knew, the lives that had been lost in the conflict were the result of a plague, a lie that the altered memories of the Edyrem reinforced. People knew that battles had been fought, but that demons and angels had been involved, of that, they were ignorant. The Worldstone was altered so that yet again, humanity was prevented from developing its latent nephalem abilities. There were exceptions however, including &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;, who enforced new rules to ensure no demon would ever be summoned into Sanctuary again, and that Heaven and Hell would stay out of mortal affairs forever. The general population of Kehjan believed the Sin War to be nothing more than a clash of faiths. They went so far to rename their land as \"&lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;\" as a means to separate themselves from the conflict, and popular sentiment swung in favor of the mages rather than religious bodies, thus heralding the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Age of Magic&lt;/a&gt;, However, some retained their memories of the war, and stories of the Sin War were passed down through subsequent generations.\nTyrael was honored for the decision he'd made at the war's end. During the Age of Magic, depictions of him varied wildly, from crude drawings on stone walls to the most exquisite pieces of armor.\nEventually, the Mage Clans' decree was breached, which led to the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, the Prime Evils refused to give up from their goal of converting humanity to their cause, and would return to plague the mortal realm in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;.\nThousands of years later after the Sin War's end, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would write that, in a sense, the Sin War never ended. The conflict itself was testament to the power that human beings carried within them, and that the Sin War was a conflict that raged in human hearts long after the war itself ended.\nOriginal Lore.\nThe Sin War as is currently presented in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" lore stems primarily from its portrayal in \"The Sin War Trilogy\" of novels and subsequent lore. Prior to this, the Sin War was treated in a different light. Two key differences are its origins, and indications that the war did not have a genuine end, along with a different timeframe. These can be treated as retcons and/or inaccurate history as per the mind wipe enforced on the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigins.\nThe Sin War was first mentioned in the manual for the first \"Diablo\" game, detailed in the \"&lt;a href=\"Librarius%20Ex%20Horadrim\"&gt;Librarius Ex Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;\". Here, it is stated that Heaven and Hell became aware of the mortal realm simultaneously, and that both were content to see what path humanity would take. Hell discovered that mortals responded much more to brute force rather than subtle coercion and so began to terrorize Man into submission. Heaven fought to defend humanity against this demonic oppression, but all too often their austere methods and severe punishments succeeded only in alienating those whom they sought to protect.\nThe violent battles of the Sin War occurred very often, but they were seldom witnessed by the prying eyes of Man. Only a few \"enlightened\" souls were aware of the supernatural beings that walked amongst the huddled masses of humanity. Powerful mortals arose and accepted the challenge of the Sin War, allying themselves with both sides in the Great Conflict. The legendary deeds of these great mortal warriors served to earn both the respect and hatred of the netherworlds. Although the lesser demons kneeled before those possessing power and strength, they also cursed the very existence of mortal man. Many of these fiends believed that the deadlock brought about by the emergence of Man was a perverse offense to their \"higher\" role in the great scheme of things. It was this state of affairs that led to the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe origin of the war's name was also altered in the trilogy. According to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Realms%20Beyond\"&gt;The Realms Beyond&lt;/a&gt;\" (as found in the first game in the series), the term \"Sin War\" was a term used by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; to describe the battle for Sanctuary when conversing with &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, the \"Sin War Trilogy\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Cain\"&gt;Book of Cain&lt;/a&gt;\" establish that the term was in use long beforehand, not long after the war's end.\nTimeframe and Continuation.\n\"The Sin War Trilogy\" and subsequent lore establish that the Sin War, as an actual event, distinctly came to an end with the pact between Mephisto and the Angiris Council. Prior to this however, the indication was that not only had the Sin War never ended, but had a different timeframe as well:"}

It deals 300% damage as &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt;, generates &lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt; and heals the Necromancer each attack cycle. It hits instantly and lasts until the Necromancer stops channeling or the target is out of range. It can drain blood over other enemies, but not through impassable solid obstacles. The effect stops if the target becomes untargetable, immune, invisible etc.\nNote that Essence is only generated if Siphon Blood actually deals damage. Since the healing percentage and Essence gain is fixed per tick, faster &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; actually allows healing up very quickly, making faster weapons more preferable for this skill.\nAlso note that Siphon Blood does not count as a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"missile\"&gt;missile&lt;/a&gt; since the effect does not travel further and instead relies on the space between the Necromancer and the enemy or designated location.

Known only as wandering &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s in the West, the Sisters conceal their secret affiliation by posing as simple travelers. Many pompous fools have made the mistake of underestimating these steel nerved women in combat and paid a terrible price for their vanity.\nLore.\nThe members of the Sisterhood are unmatched in their use of the &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, rivaled only by the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;s. Sisters often also carried &lt;a href=\"Eun-Jang-Do\"&gt;Eun-Jang-Do&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;. The Sisterhood recruits women from all walks of life who seek refuge at &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt; and a means to forge a new destiny for themselves.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Sisterhood branches from the &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt;. Originally a group of Amazon dissidents, they stole an Askari artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; and fled to Eastgate Keep in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. Here, they established their own unique style of martial training, focusing on bows.\nThe Coming of the Three.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; caught the guild's attention. Rogues as far as the Eastern dunes traveled to the town to test their skills against the evil that had taken hold of the village. It was also believed that untold riches waited to be discovered among the ruins of the town's &lt;a href=\"Horadric\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Among these Rogues was &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt;, who led a Rogue band to the town. Along with the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt; and Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt; of Khanduras, the trio were able to defeat Diablo himself. Moreina returned to Eastgate.\nDiablo's defeat was only temporary however, and possessing Aidan, he took upon the guise of the Dark Wanderer. &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, casting in her lot with the Lord of Terror, was able to corrupt the sisterhood. Moreina, who had brought a darkness with her from Tristram, was one of the first to be corrupted, taking on the moniker of \"Blood Raven.\" Many of the Rogues turned against their brethren, and they were driven out of Eastgate Keep, either dead, scattered in the wilderness, or taking up residence in an &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;encampment&lt;/a&gt;. The Rogues were left in a precarious position, as Andariel remained in their monastery, and Blood Raven raised an army of their &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; to her side. The sight of their own sisters marching against them drove the surviving Rogues to despair. Salvation came in a group of heroes who were able to defeat Blood Raven and Andariel, allowing the Sisterhood to rebuild.\nThe Sisterhood recovered from Andariel's corruption and moved back into Eastgate Keep. The keep's training grounds hummed again with the sound of bowstrings and battlecries.\nThe Bloodsworn.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the Sisterhood was once again a viable force. However, a number of their members had formed the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;; a group of cultists operating from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Bloodsworn razed &lt;a href=\"Blackstone%20Village\"&gt;Blackstone Village&lt;/a&gt;, and closed in on its &lt;a href=\"Alyssa\"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;survivors&lt;/a&gt; who were trying to escape, but were repelled by a group of Rogues led by &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt;. They engaged in pursuit, but were ambushed by the Bloodsworn, wounding and killing many Rogues, and forcing them to retreat. Kashya had the survivors retreat to their battlecamp, while sending a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the Bloodsworn. \nKashya later led a band of Rogues against the Bloodsworn in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt;, but the Bloodsworn fought back savagely. Kashya sent &lt;a href=\"Flavie\"&gt;Flavie&lt;/a&gt; to request aid from Akara. At round about the same time, Rogues in the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Ruins\"&gt;Sanguine Ruins&lt;/a&gt; were ambushed by the Bloodsworn and either killed, or taken to the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt;, so that their blood could be fed to it.\nThe Countess was slain by the hero/group of heroes. With the Countess dead, the Sisterhood remained in the Dark Wood to ensure that the Bloodsworn did not return. They provided safe haven for travelers passing through the wood.\nBounties.\nAfter the defeat of the Countess, the Sisterhood intended to cleanse the Dark Wood of the evil that festered within it. They started with the &lt;a href=\"Fetid%20Swamp\"&gt;Fetid Swamp&lt;/a&gt;, and requested aid from adventurers in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;.

She informs the player that a corrupted Rogue named &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Blood Raven&lt;/a&gt; has been raising the dead as &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and she must be stopped. The quest involves defeating &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Blood Raven&lt;/a&gt;, which, in turn, earns &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt;'s respect.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Blood Raven&lt;/a&gt; is located in the &lt;a href=\"Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, located just off of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Plains\"&gt;Cold Plains&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Blood Raven&lt;/a&gt; has been defeated, her death animation, which most quest super uniques have, will kill any remaining undead monsters in the cemetery itself but not those outside of the perimeter of the burial grounds. Return to &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt; for the reward. She will grant access to her Rogue &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; for a fee, as well as a free mercenary if the player currently does not possess one.\nThe area has a &lt;a href=\"Crypt\"&gt;Crypt&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Mausoleum\"&gt;Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;. It is worth checking out for that extra experience and items for low-level characters.\nCompletion of this quest prompts &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; to give the next Act I quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Search%20for%20Cain\"&gt;The Search for Cain&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nOnce there, it may be useful to kill all the skeletons and hungry dead found at the outer edges of the Burial Grounds (outside the cemetery gates). This ensures that there will be fewer creatures trying to surround and attack the player while he/she takes on Blood Raven in the center of the cemetery. Blood Raven moves around quite fast while shooting arrows and flame arrows at you, so a weapon or charm that adds cold damage will prove very useful here to slow her down. Blood Raven can be found within the cemetery gates, surrounded by her army of Zombies and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s; in fact, she will continue to raise the dead as the battle progresses, so she should be the top priority. All remaining undead minions die shortly after Blood Raven falls.\nBlood Raven is, statistically, the third strongest Super Unique in Act I, after &lt;a href=\"Treehead%20Woodfist\"&gt;Treehead Woodfist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. However, the former does not need to be killed and it is likely the player is of sufficient level the first time Andariel is met in order to battle her properly. Even in mid-teen levels Blood Raven can still take some time to kill.\nReward.\nKashya will grant the player a free &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt;, if they don't already have a hireling, and allow them to hire further mercenaries at any time. Should the quest not be completed, Kashya will allow players to buy her mercs anyway after players reach level 9."}

He is one of the chaos gods of the &lt;a href=\"Sahptev\"&gt;Sahptev&lt;/a&gt; faith as the God of Retribution and Damnation.\nBiography.\nLittle has been recorded of Skarn, despite his high standing in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. Skarn was once &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful lieutenant, though has also been described as a minor demon. He came to develop an interest in humanity, specifically in their so-called \"angelic sin\" (per their &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; heritage).\nEternal Conflict.\nDuring the Eternal Conflict, Skarn was an &lt;a href=\"overseer\"&gt;overseer&lt;/a&gt; in the armies of the Burning Hells. He had fought in many battles, even witnessing the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Gates of Hell&lt;/a&gt; put under siege by the &lt;a href=\"Angelic%20Host\"&gt;Angelic Host&lt;/a&gt;, and fought under the Lords of Hell as they assault the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt;. However, he believed that the war would never end.\nEven then, he was ambitious, and saw himself as a visionary second only to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Exile.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;the banishment&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; from Hell, the realm fell into civil war, as it was split between the followers of &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;. Skarn flourished during this age, but demonologists cannot say whether he led an army, or simply used the conflict as an opportunity to capture parts of the Hells for himself.\nSkarn siphoned power from Diablo's remains (whose spirit he kept bound to prevent him from returning.), and used it to create his own realm in Hell, the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Realm of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;. He ruled his realm from the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;Halls of Punishment&lt;/a&gt;, where he tortured &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and demons alike.\nThe Power Vacuum.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, Skarn beheld a power vacuum he could take advantage of. If he could obtain just one &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20shards\"&gt;shard of the Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, he would be able to remove the angelic side of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, leaving only their demonic half. \nSkarn pulled demons from the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Pit of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; to reinforce his armies, as well as using &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Gate\"&gt;Demon Gate&lt;/a&gt;s to summon demons from other parts of the Hells into his realm for the same purpose. In the mortal realm, Skarn gained a massive &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt; of followers dedicated to him. Over a period of a few years, they swelled their ranks from recruits taken across the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Contact with humanity reinforced Skarn's belief that the nephalem had been spoiled by their parentage. Humankind could win the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt; for him if only they were purged of their angelic essence.\nImmortal.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, Skarn rallied a new &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic army, intending to gather the fragments of the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;; to reignite the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, and to bring &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; to its knees.\nSkarn's Cult of Damnation abducted villagers from &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt; for sacrifice. &lt;a href=\"Aelin\"&gt;One villager&lt;/a&gt; made it back to Wortham, but this was possibly intentional, as upon his arrival in the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;, Skarn spoke through the villager, mocking those who looked on in horror, before leaving his host's body a charred &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;. Later, in their &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eskara\"&gt;Eskara&lt;/a&gt; and her fellow cultists attempted to summon Skarn into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, but they were interrupted by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;. Skarn bid that his followers slay the intruder(s), but they failed, and the summoning was averted. \nLater, in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;, Skarn spoke through one of his &lt;a href=\"Damned%20Cultist\"&gt;cultists&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lakrii\"&gt;Lakrii&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;. He demanded that he deliver the Worldstone fragment that had fallen in the forest, and in return, he would give her whatever her heart desired. Otherwise, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; would cleanse &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Lakrii responded that the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20shards\"&gt;shard&lt;/a&gt; was in the possession of &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the one&lt;/a&gt; whose heart she desired, and besides, if Skarn had the power to scour Sanctuary, he'd be taking the stone, not asking for it. Lakrii slew Skarn's vessel.\nFall of Damnation.\nSkarn succeeded in getting a shard from &lt;a href=\"Dravec\"&gt;a Monk&lt;/a&gt;. He then turned him into &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Souls\"&gt;a demon&lt;/a&gt; and retreated to &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;his domain&lt;/a&gt; where he would attune the shard to himself. Once the Shard-seeker followed him to Hell, with his control over the domain he began corrupting them, but they were saved by &lt;a href=\"Yl%27nira\"&gt;an angelic dagger&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Shard-seeker found his &lt;a href=\"Pits%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;demon pits&lt;/a&gt;, where Skarn creates his demonic legion using the stolen Light of angels. The heroes destroyed almost all of them using Yl'nira. Unknown to them, Yl'nira gained a little bit of corruption with each pit destroyed. By the time they attempted to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;last pit&lt;/a&gt;, the dagger was corrupted enough for Skarn to safely steal the dagger and corrupt it. \nThe corrupted Yl'nira was enough to power the last pit that it created a &lt;a href=\"Zaka\"&gt;collosal worm like demon&lt;/a&gt;. Alas, it was killed by the heroes when they went to destroy the last pit from within.\nWith the help &lt;a href=\"Verathiel\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mikayel\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andalon\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt;, the Shard-seeker were able to breach Skarn's throne room where they battled and killed him.\nAfter Skarn was killed, his soul was trapped in the Worldstone shard and when the shard was shattered with a corrupted Yl'nira, his spirit was released.\nChained Damnation.\nAfter Skarn's spirit returned to Hell, it was captured by Diablo. Diablo would later call upon Skarn's bound spirit to aid him when fighting the Shard-seeker.\nDawn of Damnation.\n\"Note: The following events are exclusive to the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt; beta. The timing\u2014and validity, of them is unclear.\"\nSkarn led his forces of Hell against &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; directly, wrecking havoc against &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Only the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; was able to halt his advance. Enraged, an apparition of Skarn appeared before the Shard-seeker and Westmarch's defenders, promising to unleash Hell upon Sanctuary until they begged for his salvation. The Shard-seeker was dispatched to hunt down his forces.\nIn-game.\nSkarn is one of the central antagonists of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". He is the final &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; of the baseline game, fought in the Realm of Damnation.\nSkarn doesn't use melee attacks. His attacks are similar to some skills from the and classes:\nPersonality and Traits.\nCruel, calculating and smart, Skarn sees himself as a visionary. Unlike most demons, he doesn't wish the destruction of the heavens and end of the Eternal Conflict. Instead he seeks to despoil and corrupt the angels in every manner, to twist them, until they become the very thing which they hate.\nWith the discovery of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, Skarn took interest in them and their so-called \"&lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic sin.\" He saw humans as being \"true kin\" to demons, neglected, and that only through &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, could mankind find salvation. He extended similar views to the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, considering them to be \"spoiled\" by their angelic heritage. Ergo, humanity could serve him (a view not dissimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;), but only if the angelic side of their heritage was removed.\nDespite his high standing, Skarn was a somewhat obscure demon\u2014few demonologists even knew his name."}

Practitioners perform certain rites to attain states of clairvoyance or to perceive past and future events. The followers of Skatsim strive for a higher state of being\u2014a transcendence of self. The belief is that all the misfortunes, pains, and disasters of life are not obstructions, but gateways to perfection that await any bold enough to pass through them. Its practices are similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Taan%20Clan\"&gt;Taan Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpirits exist in the context of the religion, as do priests. Runes were used as part of the religion's writing style.\nHistory.\nSkatsim's history goes as far back as &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23The%20Dawn%20of%20Civilization\"&gt;early history&lt;/a&gt;. Originally existing as a cult, Skatsim's followers practiced their beliefs in hidden temples located in the east.\nPrior to the rise of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, Skatsim was one of the most widely practiced religions in &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. However, even before that, the popularity of the faith had been waning. Prior to Zakarum gaining dominance over the land, Skatsimi &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; was studied by &lt;a href=\"Lam%20Esen\"&gt;Lam Esen&lt;/a&gt;. He compiled his studies in a &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; titled the \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Book%20of%20Lam%20Esen\"&gt;Black Book of Lam Esen&lt;/a&gt;\". The book was lost when Zakarum gained dominance. \n&lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; speculated that Skatsim found its way to the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;; that a local variant of the faith was practiced there.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Inquisition\"&gt;Zakarum Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; was launched, Skatsim was one of the religions that was brutally suppressed by the church. The Inquisitors captured the relics of Skatsim and murdered their keepers. By &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, only a few Skatsimi relics remained. One of these artifacts, &lt;a href=\"The%20Gidbinn\"&gt;The Gidbinn&lt;/a&gt;, was retrieved by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; in their efforts to overcome the forces of Zakarum, which had been corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;. By the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, only a handful of Skatsim artifacts remained."}

In combat, Skeletal Guardians do not attack in melee, but instead hurl bolts of magical energy according to their type:\nAll four types are countered by fast movement. When dealing with Guardians, it is advisable to separate the skeletons of various types, dealing with them one by one, as when shooting uncontested, Skeletal Guardians make it very difficult to withstand their volleys of spells.\nFrom time to time, one may see the Skeletal Guardians in the ghostly \"stasis\" form. In this state, they are harmless, but also immune to damage. Approaching them causes the constructs to materialize, becoming fully corporeal in a few seconds."}

They &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; very effectively, thwarting most attacks launched straight at them, but are very slow to turn and can be flanked or simply run past without much difficulty. Blocked attacks will be completely nullified, but after absorbing enough damage, their shield breaks (remaining damage transfers to the skeleton), resulting in the skeleton acting much like their normal brethren. A very powerful hit will kill the Skeleton even with the shield intact.\nThe shieldmen are slow in moving to and attacking their foes, and their &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; is not a great number. Once the shield is destroyed, the skeletons are a minor threat, if any, and they are usually taken down easily.\nIn , they are replaced by &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20Shield%20Guard\"&gt;Revenant Shield Guard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Shield%20Guard\"&gt;Summoned Shield Guard&lt;/a&gt;, except for their shields do not break.\n, when used on a &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt; from skills (instead of monsters), will raise a Skeletal Shieldman fighting for the ."}

Animated through &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; rites or the spells of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s skeletons do not seek to consume the flesh of the living, but only to extinguish the life of their victims. While they may seem mischievous or imbecilic, skeletons are unrelenting in their goals, move faster than &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, and have some spark of intelligence, the extent of which varies on the based on the power and scope of the spell involved in the skeleton's creation. Theoretically one could have a single astute skeleton servant or a rather dense army of a hundred for the same expenditure of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al energy. While physically frail, skeletons never lack in number. Those who fall to skeletons in combat are damned to an eternal lust for living blood. Coupled with their unthinking rage, this makes skeletons dangerous opponents. Skeletons will swarm their targets unquestioningly until their commanding force orders them otherwise.\nSkeletons have demonstrated the use of a wide variety of weapons, including &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"club\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, and even &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s, and are often equipped in the same armament in which they fell or were buried with. Often these weapons are of poor quality. Even more terrifying are the animated skeletal remains of expired magic wielders, who prove that even &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Mage\"&gt;the dead&lt;/a&gt; can wield the forces of magic.\nMost skeletons are actually constructed from bits and pieces of any number of different skeletons, not a single one. Their diverse composition gives them the ability to form and reform, and makes them easily summoned, permitted there is adequate raw material at hand. For instance, one would have an easier time summoning skeletons in a graveyard than in a forest. They are usually found in places where they were laid to rest or the site of a great battle. An exception to this was during the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, when skeletons rose up due to &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s evil. Skeletons were encountered in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, and it was believed that these were the remains of &lt;a href=\"Horadric\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; monks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, through necromancy, have the power to animate the remains of the deceased into skeletons. Animated partially through their own will and partially through the summoned &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of ancient warriors, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s often maintain a small host of these reanimated soldiers to do their bidding. As the Necromancer's knowledge of the undead improves, (s)he is able to harness and divert more powerful spirits to inhabit the corpses of the recently dead. At least some Necromancers are able to communicate through their skeletons, superimposing their image over the bones, talking through the skeleton even from miles away.\nSome say that skeleton eyes contain magical properties, despite the fact that skeletons are eyeless by definition.\nIn-game.\nSkeletons are a recurring monster in all four of the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Series\"&gt;\"Diablo\"&lt;/a&gt; games. Often among the most common enemies in the game, skeletons are counted among the lowest forms of undead along with &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s. They are generally fragile, but often appear in large groups.\nDiablo I.\nSkeletons are commonly found throughout the Cathedral section of the labyrinth, and some appear in the upper Catacombs as well.\nThere are several types of skeletons. Some use &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, another group wields &lt;a href=\"axes\"&gt;axes&lt;/a&gt;, while others still are &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Archer\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, players will also encounter Skeleton Captains that wield shields in addition to one-handed swords. Along with zombies, skeletons share a resistance to &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. There are three other variants: Corpse Axes, Burning Dead, and Horrors, along with their corresponding Captains.\nDiablo II.\nSkeletons return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", still one of the most common enemies found throughout the game. They wield numerous types of weapons including &lt;a href=\"Swords\"&gt;Swords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Axes\"&gt;Axes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Military%20Pick\"&gt;Military Pick&lt;/a&gt;s, s, &lt;a href=\"Mace\"&gt;Mace&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;s. Skeletons also have several differences in appearance, some completely naked though others can be seen wearing , shoulder pads, ripped pants and .\nThe &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Skeleton\"&gt;Raise Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; skill of the Necromancer allows them to be used as minions.\nSome of the skeletons encountered in &lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt; even wear the remnants of feminine chest armor, revealing that they are the skeletal remains of long dead &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, and that at least some skeletons may be female.\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s excel in dealing with large groups of Skeletons due to their ability to utilize &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Bolt\"&gt;Holy Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20%28Skill%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and similar abilities to full effect. While Skeletons are vulnerable to most attacks, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; elements are not effective against them, while they take extra damage from blunt weapons, such as s, s and s. Ranged weapons have less effect on Skeletons.\nThere are five variations, the basic Skeletons, Returned, Bone Warriors, Burning Dead and Horrors.\nA tougher type of skeleton which is in a separate category are the &lt;a href=\"Reanimated%20Horde\"&gt;Reanimated Horde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lord_of_Destruction_%28Act%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt;. They drag massive two-handed swords and move very slowly, but are capable of unleashing a fast, short range charge attack. Unlike regular skeletons, Reanimated Horde can spontaneously reanimate often repeatedly, with the self-resurrected monster is made anew, fully restored in hit points, worth normal experience and capable of dropping items again. The Reanimated Horde serve &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, unlike regular skeletons that are mostly associated with &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo Immortal.\nSkeletons are encountered as enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", and can be &lt;a href=\"Command%20Skeletons%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. Types include:\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", plain Skeleton Warriors (with no special abilities) are joined by:\n&lt;a href=\"Royal%20Henchman\"&gt;Royal Henchmen&lt;/a&gt; also serve Leoric.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20Soldier\"&gt;Revenant Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Soldier\"&gt;Summoned Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s are the skeleton variants in the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; ranks in .\nThese skeletons spawn in mixed packs and work together with much better AI than they have shown in the previous games in the series. Often skeletons will hide in barrels, piles of bones and other breakable objects. Summoners may raise skeletons, though the numbers are not unlimited.\nPlain skeletons are a regular, fragile, numerous and weak cannon fodder, which will be massively encountered in Acts I, II and III. In later Acts, they will mostly be of red color, dealing small &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage on each melee hit.\ns can summon skeletons via &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Command%20Skeletons\"&gt;Command Skeletons&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nDiablo IV.\nSkeletons appear as enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". They are one of the game's &lt;a href=\"monster%20family\"&gt;monster families&lt;/a&gt;."}

They appear often in large packs, and they can be quite deadly; on higher difficulties, only a few volleys are enough to kill even the sturdiest of warriors. They can be found normally with other monsters and act as suppressive fire until the melee units get close enough. A good tactic to deal with Skeleton Archer groups is to lure their melee comrades away until out of range, then deal with the Archers. Since the Skeleton Archers can deal devastating damage in groups, a good way to kill them is to use ranged spells or anything that can do an area-of-effect such as .

He is a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, but is much taller, wears a and wields a huge &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20Sword%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;two-handed sword&lt;/a&gt;. In Single Player games with the &lt;a href=\"Quests\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;, he appears in a mini-level called &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;King Leoric's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; which is accessible from &lt;a href=\"Level%203%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Level 3&lt;/a&gt;. After pulling the necessary lever to open his chamber, he attacks the player with a small company of skeletons. The King can create more skeletons to replace the ones that fall in battle, so the player should make him their primary target.\nIn multiplayer games, Leoric will appear anywhere on the third floor itself. A dead giveaway to where he is often lies in the massive horde of skeletons around him. Players should be especially careful if the Skeleton King is surrounded by a great gang of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Archer\"&gt;Skeleton Archer&lt;/a&gt;s; this usually leads to a great deal of arrows fired in the hero's general direction, often resulting in worrisome amounts of damage in a quick timeframe. In these times it's advantageous to wear armor giving -Damage from enemies to prevent the health from rapidly going down. If the player can get rid of the archers somehow, be it through luring the King himself, or outright destroying them, he will not be as hard. He is however, considerably more powerful than the monsters around him, and will take much more damage to kill. It should also be warned that Leoric's attacks possess 100% &lt;a href=\"Life%20Steal\"&gt;Life Steal&lt;/a&gt;ing, that is to say, \"every\" single point of damage he inflicts on the player is returned to him as &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; up to his maximum, it may even exceed the maximum this way.

As a quest reward in Single Player he drops &lt;a href=\"The%20Undead%20Crown\"&gt;The Undead Crown&lt;/a&gt;.

Unlike their second generation counterparts, Diablo III's Runes are not used in &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed items but are used in conjunction with skills to give many additional effects that may aid the player suit his/her playing style. They function in a manner very similar to &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Awow%3AGlyph\"&gt;Glyphs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Awow%3AWorld%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;.Originally, they were actual items that were manually applied to each skill. Known Runes included Lethality Rune (boosted &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s), Multistrike Rune (allowed the skill to hit more targets) and Striking rune (effect unknown). Later, each rune was dubbed for its color: , , , or . However, over the course of development, the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Tree\"&gt;Skill Tree&lt;/a&gt;s were simplified, and actual items called Skill Runes were removed.\nInstead, each skill in Diablo III has a total of five runes, one of which may be selected to augment this skill in a certain way. Most of the time, Skill Runes offer the following effects:\nSome runes offer a combination of effects listed above, or add unique properties, changing skills beyond recognition.\nOnce the skill is unlocked, five runes will be unlocked for it one by one, every few levels. A skill rune may be changed at any moment when out of combat and while the skill is not on cooldown, free of charge. However, changing a rune counts as changing skill, therefore canceling all current ongoing effects. Prior to the pre-expansion patch, changing runes triggered a cooldown if not in town, dependent on the difficulty setting.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; items add a skill rune (or even\u00a0\"all\u00a0\"possible runes) to a skill, in addition to the one already chosen by player, effectively allowing the skill to have more than one rune at a time. Note that some skill-enhancing effects, and even some runes, are mutually exclusive, as their effects may not be combined due to the way they work (for example, may not gain both Wormhole and Reversal runes at once; Reversal will be suppressed). It is up to player to decide, and yet some runes may render a specific bonus completely useless. Elemental Damage type for a skill with multiple runes is usually determined by the rune that is selected manually, or by highest bonus to elemental skill damage the player has.\nEach rune is visually distinct from others: textures and graphics change with every rune compared to unmodified skills and to other runes of the same skill.\nSkills triggered by items may or may not benefit from runes and other enhancements; however, even if they do, they will only do so as long as player has this skill and has augmented it with a rune."}

{"id": "3995", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3995", "title": "Skill Trees", "text": "A Skill Tree is a kind of a categorized spellbook where players can see what &lt;a href=\"skills\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; are available to their character.\nOverview.\nSkills in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", unlike the first game, are tied to certain categories. A skill can only be used when learned (equipped or invested &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; into), and the total number of skills character may have at a time is limited (unlike the first game, where one could, in theory, learn \"all\" spells that exist in the game world).\nThere are many ways to categorize skills, such as by &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; type, by being tied to certain game mechanics, etc. They can be divided by the degree of action required to use them:\nDiablo II.\nIn\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\",\u00a0it has three tabs at the right side. Clicking on the tab will take player to the corresponding skill tree.\nThe tree consists of rows of skills. The row indicates the level requirement to acquire the skill. The first (top) row of skills are available as soon as the character is created. The second row has a level requirement of 6, with each following row's level requirement increasing by 6, up to 30 for the bottom row.\nSome skills have one or more arrows pointing to them. Any skill on the tree that points to another skill is a prerequisite. For example, in the image to the right, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Claws\"&gt;Fire Claws&lt;/a&gt; has arrows pointing to it from &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Rage\"&gt;Feral Rage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maul%20%28Skill%29\"&gt;Maul&lt;/a&gt; . This means that in order to get Fire Claws, one must already have at least one skill point in both Feral Rage \"and\" Maul.\nSkills &lt;a href=\"synergy\"&gt;synergize&lt;/a&gt; with each other, passively enhancing \"other\" skills, usually in the same tree.\nDevelopment.\nThe idea for skill trees in Diablo II came from &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt;; according to Brevik himself, the idea came to him while he was in the shower. He likened the idea to the tech trees of \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Civilization_II\"&gt;Civilization II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo III.\nDevelopment.\nIn the early versions of Diablo III, skill trees were working in the same way they did in Diablo II: three separate trees, unlocking more passive and active skills as players invest more skill points in them (also similar to \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" pre-MoP design). However, eventually this concept has been canceled, although most of the skills were more or less transferred to the new system of skill categories (see below). This allowed making mixed builds and prevented players from wasting points on skills they do not want just to get to the next skill in the category. However, details about two older skill trees (Barbarian and Wizard) still exist:\nCurrent System.\nIn Diablo III, skill trees were replaced with skill categories. Each class has six, and each category includes three to five skills. The system below is approximate, in fact, &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s have their categories slightly different from those of other classes. s have their categories totally different, and grouped mostly by the type of resource these skills use.\nPassive skills have a separate category. At level 10, a character has one passive skill slot, but can acquire the second one at level 20, the third one at level 30, and the final (fourth) one at level 70. &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Amulet\"&gt;Hellfire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; allows having five different passives at a time. Passive skills can be taken in any combination, regardless of which active skills have been chosen.\nOriginally, characters can only have one skill of each category, and may not change the default button. However, with the so-called Elective Mode turned on in the Options, one can take any skills in any combinations, unless specifically stated otherwise (such as Wizards only being able to use one Armor spell).\nSkills can be changed or assigned new &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Runes\"&gt;Skill Runes&lt;/a&gt; (counts as changing skills too) at any moment when out of combat, and when the skill in question is not on a cooldown. If performed in town, the new skill is ready instantly, otherwise it has a 10 seconds cooldown before it can be used.\nNote that each item can only have \"one\"\u00a0\"Increases (Skill Name) Damage by X%\" Primary affix.\nDiablo IV.\nSkill Trees return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". They are considered separately from the &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20Board\"&gt;Paragon Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skill Tree provides players with a variety of playstyles for each class through Skills, Passive Skills, Enhancements, and Key Passives as their character levels up and hones their abilities. Skill Points are earned from Leveling up and Zone Progress Rewards. Up to 5 Skill Points can be spent on each Skill to increase its rank.\nThe Skill Tree can be broken down as thus:\nDevelopment.\nFollowing the initial criticism of the Talents system that essentially forced the player to choosing one of the pre-determined paths (with just a few alternate selections, mostly in the end), the entire system was revamped to allow more liberty, fashioned in the form of an actual tree.\nSkill Trees were originally divided between 'branches' and 'roots.' \nPlayers were not able to pursue every branch on the tree. The developers intended that 30-40% of nodes could be filled in by the end game."}

As they grow in power, so too does their class skill. In this manner:\nThe Monk and Bard classes in the \"Hellfire\" expansion are, for the most part, exceptions to this ruling, as the Bard's skill is arguably the best class skill present in the game, while the Monk's class skill is available as a book.\nA character's knowledge of the spells that he/she knows is measured in spell levels, which in turn, are defined by the amount of &lt;a href=\"books\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; the character has read. To increase one spell's level by one, they must find a book for that spell, and possess the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Attribute%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; requirement needed, which generally goes up by a multiplicative 20% per level of the spell (i.e, to advance from level 1 to level 2, the character must have 20 Magic, while the next level requires 24 Magic). An &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Enchanted Shrine&lt;/a&gt; also affects a character's knowledge in all of the spells that is already known. A character's innate knowledge of a spell may never exceed level 15 at any point. However, some special items, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Bovine%20Plate\"&gt;Bovine Plate&lt;/a&gt;, may further modify spell levels when equipped, either in a positive or negative fashion. Positive spell levels from equipment can go over the cap of level 15. Note that there can be times when a spell \"may\" be brought to level 0, which makes it unusable under any circumstances.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"Diablo II\", all characters have a preset skill layout in form of a &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;Skill Tree&lt;/a&gt;, and skills must be learned by investing \"skill points\" in them. There are multiple restrictions to this system:\nSkill points can be earned by:\nIt is advised to think in advance what kind of character one wants to play, keeping in mind that skill allocation determines a build, and vice versa.\nAlso, ideal equipment (specific &lt;a href=\"Set%20items\"&gt;set items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;runeword&lt;/a&gt; armor, etc.) must be selected in accordance with chosen skills.\nAt Level 99 a character will have 110 skill points, if they have completed all skill quests on all 3 difficulties.\n&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkill points do not exist in the third game, instead all skills are interchangeable for free, and have &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Runes\"&gt;Skill Runes&lt;/a&gt; to choose from. However, players may only equip 6 active and 4-5 passive skills at once, effectively bestowing limits similar to those of the old system."}

Amazon Islands) are a group of islands located in the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt;. They consist of four main islands: Philios, Skovos, Lycander, Skartara, and are the home of the &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt;. \nLore.\nSkovos is the main island of the chain, while Philios, Lycander, and Skartara are outlying islands.\nThe isles possess a dense rain-forest environment that teems with life. It is in the forest canopy in which the Askari have constructed their cities. The canopy is so dense that little light reaches the ground. Hunting through the forests' undergrowth is fraught with many obstacles; confining overgrowth and fierce indigenous animals conspire to make combat difficult, if not impossible, though the Amazons have adapted to their forest home in this regard. Some of the native flora is toxic.\nFor the most part, the islands possess an ever-balmy climate, and winter never seems to arrive. \nA number of wars were fought in Skovos in ages past. They have their own trading language.\nTrivia.\nCut Location.\nSkovos was originally intended to appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", but was cut as it didn't seem to fit in. Another issue is that the visuals of Skovos were reminiscent of \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//titanquest.fandom.com/wiki/Titan_Quest\"&gt;Titan Quest&lt;/a&gt;\". At the time the developers were deciding whether to cut Skovos or not, \"Titan Quest\" was the most recent isometric ARPG. Visually, it felt too similar, and it was felt that there were better opportunities elsewhere (in terms of location). However, &lt;a href=\"Wyatt%20Cheng\"&gt;Wyatt Cheng&lt;/a&gt; has expressed hopes that the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;franchise&lt;/a&gt; will revisit Skovos one day.\nIt was revealed during the 2008 &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;'s Lore &amp; Art Panel for \"Diablo III\" that Skovos would not be accessible to the player during the events of the game, but was internally fleshed out so it could be referenced by the characters in the game world. The isles receive mention in , as &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; discuss that a &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; expedition sent to the isles has not returned."}

When Rakkis's crusade reached &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, Sladyan came to symbolize victory.

In doing so, his body became a suitable vessel for a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mists\"&gt;long-sealed darkness&lt;/a&gt; to inhabit; forming &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nightmare\"&gt;a new demon&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Corruption spread out as a dark mist that turned all the warriors (both the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s) to &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nForgotten Nightmares.\nSladyan's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; still persisted within the Ancient Nightmare, but was continually tormented by it.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231271\"&gt;1271&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;(s) was/were investigating the source of the mists spreading throughout Mount Zavain. They discovered the Silent Monastery and the Ancient Nightmare that laired within it. When fighting the Nightmare, it tried to consume them with &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mists\"&gt;Black Mists&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the Nightmare's soulscape, they saw Sladyan's tormented soul.

Activating any of the &lt;a href=\"Ytar%27s%20flame\"&gt;Ytar's flame&lt;/a&gt;s temporarily disables his shield, and &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;s him and his minions.

Enemies such as the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;Fallen Shaman&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mummy\"&gt;Greater Mummy&lt;/a&gt; are made much more vulnerable as they will no longer be able to bring their guardians back to life, however resurrection skills that require the presence of a corpse will also be rendered useless. This can be especially harmful to &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, who depend on bodies for multiple skills.\nDespite the extreme rarity of this effect on items, it is not particularly valuable, as shattering frozen enemies grants the same basic results and is much easier to accomplish than finding an item with the Slain Monsters Rest in Peace effect.\nMechanics.\nSlain Monsters Rest in Peace will prevent a monster from being able to be resurrected, but it will also destroy the effectiveness of player skills that require a corpse, such as &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Lance\"&gt;Corpse Lance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Find%20Potion\"&gt;Find Potion&lt;/a&gt;.

Note that on &lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, the presence of resurrectors (like s or &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Shaman\"&gt;Flesh Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s) does not allow the corpses to be destroyed by any means other than Critical Hits. Also remember that monsters that explode on death (&lt;a href=\"Accursed\"&gt;Accursed&lt;/a&gt; or s, to name a few) will still do so; there is no way to prevent their final attempt at revenge.\nAll &lt;a href=\"Holy%20damage\"&gt;Holy damage&lt;/a&gt; skills and &lt;a href=\"skill%20runes\"&gt;skill runes&lt;/a&gt; destroy corpses of enemies they kill, effectively having this property as a free trait. The only classes utilizing this damage type are &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;, though.\nThese effects only destroy corpses that monsters can use: secondary resource of s, the corpses only visible to them, remain intact.

A barracks is also maintained.\nUnfortunately, the outpost lacked sufficient funding and its guards regularly underfed. &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; occasionally sent supplies but it was not enough.

Meanwhile, the Shard-seeker and Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Ralvar\"&gt;Ralvar&lt;/a&gt; would clear out the khazra in the village. A bold plan, but as Ralvar pointed out, bold plans were all the outpost had left. Before the plan could be enacted, however, the khazra launched another assault, giving the defenders barely enough time to react. The khazra quickly made it into the outpost, killing at least &lt;a href=\"Cavil\"&gt;one guard&lt;/a&gt;, along with taking a number of captives.

It was inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Ascenian\"&gt;Ascenian&lt;/a&gt;s, and situated in a highland region also occupied by &lt;a href=\"Partha\"&gt;Partha&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nSeram was only a small village, with no more than two-hundred inhabitants at most. There were only five buildings of any importance in Seram: the &lt;a href=\"Boar%27s%20Head\"&gt;Boar's Head&lt;/a&gt; tavern/inn, the meeting house, the trading station, the village guard quarters and the smithy. All shared the same general design as the other structures of Seram, making it hard - if not impossible - to tell one building from another from a distance.\nThe buildings consisted of frames of several layers of stone and clay, plated with wooden planks. The roofs were pointed and thatched, and each side of the buildings had three sharply arched windows. This style was typical for the Kehjan area.\nAs Seram was mostly a trading village, the trading station was by far the busiest area of the village. Here the locals brought in their goods to trade for other necessities or to sell to passing tradesmen. Trade caravans sometimes passed through Seram on their journey from Kehjan to the sea.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Lylia\"&gt;Lylia&lt;/a&gt; awoke the dormant powers of Uldyssian, the farmer was confronted by emissaries, of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. In a fit of rage Uldyssian supposedly accidentally conjured a magical storm that killed many of Seram's inhabitants and destroyed many buildings. It was later revealed the storm had in fact been summoned by Lylia.\nAfter the conclusion of the original &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, all humans had their memories wiped. The survivors of Seram attributed the deaths of their friends and family to plague. "}

She was considered to be beautiful, with ivory skin, naturally red lips, thick, long hair, and blue eyes.\nBiography.\nBackground.\nSerenthia was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Cyrus\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;, a rich and influential merchant of Seram whose family ran the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;'s trading station. Serenthia had several older brothers, but had learned to fend for herself: she had learned how to handle a &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; from her father. A black-tressed and beautiful woman, Serenthia had a crush on the much older farmer &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;. Her interest in him had begun as a child, even though he was over ten years her senior. Sadly for her, Uldyssian always saw her as his little sister. Still she did not give up, even though &lt;a href=\"Achilios\"&gt;Achilios&lt;/a&gt; was attracted to her. While she was aware of his infatuation, and knew that as Cyrus's daughter, him courting her should be welcomed, she was unable to give up of her dreams of having a life with Uldyssian. Unlike Uldyssian, she was open to listening to missionaries from the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. She believed in some of the tenets of both religions, but did not commit to either one of them.\nThe Sin War.\nBirthright.\nWhen Uldyssian met the strange noblewoman &lt;a href=\"Lylia\"&gt;Lylia&lt;/a&gt; and was subsequently infatuated with her, Serenthia was overcome with jealousy, reflecting that Lylia had done with her looks what she'd tried to accomplish over years. After Uldyssian was imprisoned for the suspected murder of two missionaries (one from the Triune, one from the Cathedral), she and Achilios saw Cathedral &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s arrive. She met &lt;a href=\"Mikelius\"&gt;Mikelius&lt;/a&gt;, their leader, informing him that yes, this was indeed Seram. She was perturbed as to how Mikelius had apparently already concluded that Uldyssian was guilty.\nThey led Mikelius to Seram's graveyard, where the body of the murdered Cathedral missionary was buried. However, they found that it had been defiled. Uldyssian was brought out to the Inquisitors, but a storm struck the village, one that took the life of her father. She and Achilios ran to find Uldyssian, which they achieved. Along with &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt;, they rode out of Seram, Lylia riding on the same horse as Uldyssian (much to Serenthia's annoyance).\nCome night, they made camp near the jungles that blanked &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;. Serenthia, Lylia, and Uldyssian ventured out to gather berries and find water, while Achilios went off to find game. Around the fire, Serenthia vented her frustrations to Mendeln, whose awkward conversation only aggravated her further. Achilios returned, and in the confusion, inadvertently revealed that Cyrus was dead. Serenthia broke into tears.\nAfter the party left the town of &lt;a href=\"Partha\"&gt;Partha&lt;/a&gt;, Serenthia finally fell in love with Achilios. Sadly it was not meant to last, as Achilios was killed by the demon &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt; shortly after. Still this did not in the least mar her faith in Uldyssian.\nScales of the Serpent.\nAt some point of their travels, Serenthia was briefly possessed by the demoness &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. This allowed the demon to briefly take control of the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; army. She was later expelled by the now undead Achilios. Serenthia became more and more proficient with using a spear - her weapon of choice. \nAlong with many of the Edyrem (including Uldyssian), Serenthia became more and more confident, if not arrogant, with her powers as they increased. She became increasingly warlike, often opting for a harsh, head-on approach without fearing any repercussions. Her love for Achilios remained unchanged, even despite his undead state and the latter's assassination attempt on both herself and Uldyssian.\nThe Veiled Prophet.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Golden%20Path\"&gt;Battle of the Golden Path&lt;/a&gt; (the final confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;), Serenthia took charge of the Edyrem army as Uldyssian was locked in battle with Inarius. She fought side by side with Achilios, killing both Angels and Demons. When her love was threatened by an Angelic attack, Serenthia did not hesitate to save her love - even though it would cost her own life. \nHowever, before Uldyssian sacrificed himself, he granted both Serenthia and Achilios renewed life. After the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; voted for the continued existence of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Serenthia's memory was erased in order to give humanity a 'new start', unburdened with the dark knowledge of the past. \nSerenthia supposedly lived out her days along with Achilios in her hometown of Seram, believing that those persons killed during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt; - including Uldyssian - to have died of plague."}

Note that a dash is not a valid character in player names, so having a name with a dash may be perceived as a limited-edition cosmetic.\nAccursed Towers.\n&lt;a href=\"Accursed%20Towers\"&gt;Accursed Towers&lt;/a&gt; are affected by the server merge, since the same tower might be occupied by a different clan on a different server. To keep things fair, all Accursed Towers are reset to no owner after the merge. The season number is reset to 1. The season start date is updated to the date of the server merge, but the end date is not changed. There is no compensation for the lost towers other than the unclaimed rewards being sent out. Therefore it is advised to max out the reward chests on any towers owned at the start of the week of the merge.\nLeader Boards.\nAll leader boards are re-ranked with all the players from the merged servers. The first clear leader boards for &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Rift\"&gt;Challenge Rift&lt;/a&gt; will display all the first clears from every server, but still only one reward can be claimed per 10 levels no matter how many players are listed.\nShadows.\nCharacters and clans retain their &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; status, Marks and Shadow task progress through the merge. &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20War\"&gt;Shadow War&lt;/a&gt; is skipped during a week of the merge - the sign up button does not work, and the brackets will be empty. The \"Top 10\" page will display no clans for the rest of the week after the merge.\nBecause of the re-ranking, clans that were in Class A before the merge can find themselves downgraded to Class C. If there are not enough weeks left in the reign, they may be unable to regain their Class A standing and participate in the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Exile\"&gt;Rite of Exile&lt;/a&gt; to get a chance at winning the next reign.\nImmortals.\nSince there can be only one alliance of &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt; after the merge, the alliance with the highest dominance is chosen to be the Immortals after the merge. All other clans who were Immortals are reverted to &lt;a href=\"Adventurers\"&gt;Adventurers&lt;/a&gt;.\nCycle of Strife.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Cycle of Strife&lt;/a&gt; counter is set to the length of the reign of the Immortal alliance that was chosen to be the Immortals on the merged server. The Cycle of Strife event on Sunday evening is skipped, including the prediction challenges. At the start of the next week, the reign counter increases, unless it was already at 7/7, in which case it stays the same.\nIf there was a reign change on the last Sunday before the merge, the Cycle's Turn daily rewards and the &lt;a href=\"Cycle%27s%20Turn%20Chest\"&gt;Cycle's Turn Chest&lt;/a&gt; option from the &lt;a href=\"Hilts\"&gt;Hilts&lt;/a&gt; vendor are cancelled before their regular end date.\n&lt;a href=\"Deeds%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Deeds of Valor&lt;/a&gt; scores are set to the maximum for all players as part of the merge.\nCompensation.\nA compensation mail with 3 &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Crest\"&gt;Legendary Crest&lt;/a&gt;s and one &lt;a href=\"Normal%20Gems\"&gt;Normal Gem&lt;/a&gt; of every type is sent out.\nFestival of Dawn.\n&lt;a href=\"Festival%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;Festival of Dawn&lt;/a&gt; runs for 11 days after the server merge, although the actual start may be delayed.\nHistory.\nA large number of servers was merged on June 26, 2024."}

{"id": "21", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21", "title": "Sescheron", "text": "Sescheron was the capital of the s, prior to its fall to the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Army of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;. It is located roughly to the south of &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nSescheron was an extraordinarily large city; a living symbol of united Barbarian tribes. Its gates guarded the lone path to the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, and the Children of Bul-Kathos were tasked with defending them. It was believed that the city would never fall, and the people of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt; would always stand vigilant.\nHistory.\nThe Day All Hope Was Lost.\nBy the time of the city's fall, the Barbarians had guarded Sescheron for countless generations. In its last days, it was ruled by Chief Elder &lt;a href=\"Kanai\"&gt;Kanai&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, Sescheron was besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Army of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; during their assault on Mount Arreat. Barbarians from various tribes were present at the city during the siege. Baal was greeted by a lone emissary who demanded that Baal and his forces withdraw, and that the Worldstone would never be his. Infuriated, Baal summoned demonic forces to tear the emissary apart, before letting loose his forces upon the city. Baal had drawn first &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;, but in what would be called \"the day all hope was lost,\" far more blood would be spilt.\nChief Elder Kanai and his people stood their ground against the impossible flood of Baal\u2019s army with every fiber of their being. However, the defenses were overcome and the city was sacked over the course of a single day. There were only a few survivors, and they described Baal as remaining atop his litter, surveying the city with ravenous malice and an insatiable lust for destruction. With Sescheron having fallen, Baal's forces marched on &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Sescheron in ruins, along with the hopeless madness of a failed people, and the cold, empty shadows of a once mighty civilization.\nThe Ruins of Sescheron.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;Five years&lt;/a&gt; after its fall, Sescheron lay infested by &lt;a href=\"Baal%27s%20Minion\"&gt;Baal's Minion&lt;/a&gt;s and other demons. With the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Portal\"&gt;Hell Gate&lt;/a&gt;, demons from Hell had clear access to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and began moving into the mortal realm, moving against &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Hearth\"&gt;Bitter Hearth&lt;/a&gt;. The Barbarians there requested aid from &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to thin out the demons before they reached the village.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Twenty years&lt;/a&gt; after its fall, Sescheron lay empty, standing in a frozen wasteland. The Hell Gate that had been opened 15 years prior had apparently closed by this point. &lt;a href=\"Monster\"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;s came up from the forests and down from the mountains to infest its ruins. Months after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins were explored by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, as they sought to recover a &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Barbarian artifact&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city ruins are now a dangerous place, infested to the core with &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;, lost demons and all kinds of beasts. However, they all pale in comparison with &lt;a href=\"the%20Unclean\"&gt;the Unclean&lt;/a&gt;, survivors of the Siege driven mad by Worldstone's destruction. Now a tribe of vicious cannibals, they are the only inhabitants of the ruined city. Other Barbarians spent years trying to rid the Ruins of Sescheron of both vermin and flesh-eaters, but with little to no success.\nIn-game.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Sescheron\"&gt;Ruins of Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; are available in the &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" as of patch 2.3.0. Specifically in , near the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "32724", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=32724", "title": "Set Dungeon", "text": "Set Dungeons are a feature in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", introduced in patch 2.4.\nOverview.\nSet Dungeons are designed for players at near peak performance with their armor &lt;a href=\"set\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; bonuses. These dungeons revolve around set bonuses for specific 6 piece armor sets. They \"can\" be completed while in a group, but only the dungeon creator needs to wear the set, and only they will get the completion and credit for the objectives (still, however, other players may support them with extra kills and buffs). Monsters within drop no loot (but still grant &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;).\nEach Set Dungeon has three normal objectives and one mastery objective.\nThe goal is to complete the \"first\" (kill the specified number of enemies without dying) objective, and at least one of the two (\"second\" and/or \"third\") in one run. Mastery rating is optional, and requires killing all enemies, and completion of \"all\" objectives within the time limit (Mastery objective). Most objectives display tips when attempted: for instance, if one needs to hit a certain number of enemies with a single cast, a number of enemies hit will be displayed each time.\nSet Dungeons are not randomized: they always have same layout, enemies, tasks etc. There will be a large (hundreds) amount of regular monsters of fixed types, and several identical &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt; (always of same type), who will have fixed affixes. However, Elites spawn at random positions each time (unless stated otherwise). Originally, there was also an idea of a boss spawning at the end of each dungeon, designed to 'test' the set the player has acquired, but that idea was scrapped.\nThere are four dungeons per &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; (total of 24, plus 4 more for s): &lt;a href=\"Patterns%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Patterns of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Aegis of Valor&lt;/a&gt; do not have their dedicated dungeons. If a player completes the objectives for each of a class's four dungeons, they will receive a special &lt;a href=\"Ascendant%20Pennants\"&gt;class pennant&lt;/a&gt; reflecting their achievement, and &lt;a href=\"Mastery%20Pennants\"&gt;another pennant&lt;/a&gt; for completing them all with Mastery rating. If all 24 dungeons of classes except Necromancers are completed, special wings will be received: &lt;a href=\"Wings%20of%20the%20Dedicated\"&gt;Wings of the Dedicated&lt;/a&gt;. If the 24 dungeons are completed with Mastery rating, another set of wings will be received: &lt;a href=\"Wings%20of%20Mastery\"&gt;Wings of Mastery&lt;/a&gt;. Also, a &lt;a href=\"Banner\"&gt;Banner&lt;/a&gt; Sigil is granted for each of the 28 dungeons regardless of rating.\nA player needs to have the set bonus active for all 6 items to enter the dungeon. With &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Royal%20Grandeur\"&gt;Ring of Royal Grandeur&lt;/a&gt;, it drops the requirement to 5 pieces of the same set to enter a dungeon.\nPlayers cannot die in a Set Dungeon, but are forced to restart should they lose all Life or fail both second and third objectives. As of 2.6.0, the easiest way to restart the dungeon, to avoid dying or moving all the way to the entrance, is to use &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;, which is not interrupted by damage in Set Dungeons, and then take a portal back.\nSet Dungeons are scattered across the world, their locations hinted at in the Leoric's Library of &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarters\"&gt;Royal Quarters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monsters\"&gt;Elite Monsters&lt;/a&gt; in Set Dungeons periodically drop lore entries on the dungeons' nature. If player enters the Library wearing a set of 6+ items, they will find a lore book with hints to finding their current set dungeon.\nSet Dungeon difficulty is static (somewhere near T4 or T5), and cannot be changed. The current difficulty setting has no effect on it. However, most objectives are specifically designed in a way so that game difficulty has minimal impact on the difficulty of their completion.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; or Set items make Set Dungeon objectives much easier or even trivialize them. However, one must be wary that certain objectives require player to complete a specific action without killing foes prematurely, therefore too powerful gear may sometimes be a disadvantage. Unequipping or changing items and even skills can solve these issues if need arises. However, one cannot change skills and/or gear while within the dungeon, so this must be done in advance.\nAs of patch 2.6.0, all monsters within Set Dungeons are highlighted on the map from the start.\nSet Portals.\nPortals to Set Dungeons are hidden in fixed locations (see details below). A transparent silhouette of an obelisk is barely visible, materializing as player approaches. A portal opens when one comes next to an obelisk. The obelisks will only appear and allow entrance if the character is wearing a complete matching set.\nList of Set Dungeons.\n&lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Raiment%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Storms\"&gt;Raiment of a Thousand Storms&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Note\": &lt;a href=\"Pylons\"&gt;Speed Pylons&lt;/a&gt; appear in this dungeon\nMastery Walkthrough.\nBeating all 28 Set Dungeons is very easy if one goes for just one objective, but for Mastery rating, some effort is required. See the guides page for more information.\nDevelopment.\nThe idea for Set Dungeons originated from a \"game jam\" session in 2015. The key idea was that it would be something extra for a completed set, with one dungeon per set, with a hidden entrance somewhere in the world. When a set was completed, a &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; would appear at the player's feet, providing a hint as to where the entrance to the dungeon was.\n&lt;a href=\"Alex%20Sulman\"&gt;Alex Sulman&lt;/a&gt; was the lead designer for the Set Dungeon project. Sulman dwelled on the idea for a long time before implementing it; little iteration of the original concept was carried out. Originally, Set Dungeons were designed as an exclusively solo experience. If a player died in the dungeon or left it, the dungeon would reset. A problem was run into with the console version, as players play on the same screen, so one player couldn't enter a Set Dungeon by themselves. The system was altered to have a primary player (the \"dungeon owner\") within a Set Dungeon, and let other players join in to help. The Set Dungeon code had to be rewritten to factor in multiplayer.\nLeaderboards were considered for Set Dungeons, but were not implemented. It was believed that as a Leaderboard filled up, new players would be discouraged from participating.\nThe Delsere's Magnum Opus dungeon was the first one designed. Some dungeons were easier to design than others. For instance, the Thorns of the Invoker dungeon underwent a full rework. &lt;a href=\"Wyatt%20Cheng\"&gt;Wyatt Cheng&lt;/a&gt; worked with Sullman on defining the dungeon's objectives. However, the Barbarian dungeons were easily designed. The Shadow's Mantle dungeon was another early dungeon designed."}

{"id": "96", "revid": "2011810", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=96", "title": "Set Items", "text": "Set Items are special items introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and continued on into \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". They are like &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique Items&lt;/a&gt;, in the way that every time you find the same item, it has the same attributes. However, in general,\u00a0 are a tad weaker than\u00a0, or so called \"\". This is because\u00a0 are each part of specific sets, and moreover, if you equip the entire set, you will gain an extra set of Bonus &lt;a href=\"Affix\"&gt;Affix&lt;/a&gt;es, hence the name \".\" Set Items are denoted by their name appearing in .\nDiablo II.\nIn \"Diablo II\", sets can be completed even on the &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt;, who fully benefit from the Set Bonuses.\nPartial Set Bonus.\nAt first, you had to equip an entire set of items to get any bonus effects at all. With the \"Diablo II\" expansion pack \"\", a Partial Set Bonus feature was added to the sets that include more than two &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;. For each item you equip past the first, there is an extra bonus added to the item itself, until you put together the whole set. This means that it is no longer necessary to equip an entire set to get some very useful bonuses. The partial set bonus concept was kept for \"Diablo III\".\nMoreover, in Diablo II, some set items gain new affixes as players equip more and more items of the same set. These bonuses are separate from the set bonus, and depend on which pieces the player has got.\nNew Full Set Bonuses.\nSome of the new sets added in \"Lord of Destruction\" give particularly interesting bonuses upon completion. Many will give you bonuses that are normally not found on\u00a0 nor . One of them (&lt;a href=\"Trang-Oul%27s%20Avatar\"&gt;Trang-Oul's Avatar&lt;/a&gt;, a set for &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s) will even transform you into a &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; enemy, and give you three of the Sorceress' &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Skills\"&gt;Fire Skills&lt;/a&gt;!\nClass Sets.\nEach class in \"Diablo II\" has a set specifically built for them. Upon the completion of these sets, Your character will receive a\u00a0 light shining around them, except for when using Trang-Oul's Avatar, your character will transform into a &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Lord\"&gt;Ghoul Lord&lt;/a&gt;, and moreover, when using &lt;a href=\"Natalya%27s%20Odium\"&gt;Natalya's Odium&lt;/a&gt;, your &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; will appear faded. These sets always include class-specific items, i.e. only the class to whom the set is intended for can complete it.\nThere are other sets beyond these which are also intended for only one &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, however they do not award a\u00a0 graphical feature. \"Diablo III\" has got generic class-specific sets as well.\nDiablo Immortal.\nSet Items return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". Here they are restricted to secondary gear (neck, hands, wrists, fingers, waist and feet equipment slots). Unlike other games, set items here are not class specific.\nSet Items can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as rewards for limited-time events. Unwanted Set Items can be salvaged for a &lt;a href=\"Fabled%20Wisp\"&gt;Fabled Wisp&lt;/a&gt; corresponding to the item's &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt; rating. These wisps can be used to craft new Set Items of the player's choosing.\nSome events reward a Mystery Set Item, which is an item that appears in the last page of the inventory, and turns into a random unidentified Set Item when used. The level of the resulting item is determined when using the Mystery item, not when identifying the result. Mystery Set Items are stackable.\nThe available Set Item slots depend on the highest Difficulty unlocked:\nA character can equip one belt, boots, gloves, necklace, and two rings and bracelets. Duplicated items (e.g. two identical rings) only count as one item towards the set bonus. Each set has 3 set bonuses, unlocked at every 2 pieces of the set. There is no bonus for equipping more than 6 items from the same set.\nHistory.\nOriginally Mystery Set Items didn't stack, and they could take up considerable space in the player's inventory. In the update, the Mystery items were changed to be stackable.\nDiablo III.\n\u00a0in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" are, essentially, a type of &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; Items, but have some differences though. They can roll &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Legendary\"&gt;Ancient Legendary&lt;/a&gt; bonuses as well, with the exact same chances.\nSet Items are highlighted similarly to other , however a pillar of light will be \u00a0instead. The minimap star icon is different as well.\nCraftable Set Items drop one recipe for the entire set. There is no need to find extra recipes.\nSome sets exist in two variants: pre-70 and 70. Note that different versions of the same set cannot be used to complete each other, but different level items (of the exactly same set, check its name carefully), just obtained at different levels, can. Example:\u00a0 of &lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Fate\"&gt;Pre-Level 70 variant&lt;/a&gt; are different from their &lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Destiny\"&gt;Level 70 versions&lt;/a&gt;, and cannot complete each other; but &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Elements\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Elements&lt;/a&gt; dropped at Level 60 \"can\" be used to complete a set of\u00a0 dropped at Level 70.\nIn addition, Legacy Sets (obtained before patch 2.0) are considered different sets from their post-Expansion counterparts, even if they bear the same name.\nWhile technically being Legendary Items, Set Items in Diablo III \"very rarely\" have unique affixes unlike Legendaries, as those are replaced with set bonuses. They can still have affixes that normally are not allowed on that item type, though.\nMost sets have two, four or six item types, but some can even number up to seven.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Royal%20Grandeur\"&gt;Ring of Royal Grandeur&lt;/a&gt; is known for reducing set items requirements (i.e. number of set pieces to complete the set) by one, to a minimum of two. This allows player to complete more sets on the same character, gaining more set bonuses. Alternatively, it allows boosting sets with Legendary items that have unique and irreplaceable properties: the best example is &lt;a href=\"Raiment%20of%20the%20Jade%20Harvester\"&gt;Raiment of the Jade Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, which doubles its damaging potential with &lt;a href=\"Quetzalcoatl\"&gt;Quetzalcoatl&lt;/a&gt;, but the latter can only be equipped if the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; makes use of the mentioned ring. An alternate method may be using &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; to extract a specific power to complement the set.\nUnlike Diablo II, Set items equipped on followers provide no bonus neither to the player nor to the follower. Pieces of the same set on both follower and player cannot complete each other.\nUnlike Legendary items, if a new patch changes the set bonuses, set items are typically changed retroactively, while legendary items that gain new special affixes must be obtained anew. The reason for this is that set items work in tandem, and making these changes non-retroactive would force players to find the whole set anew.\nSet items may be transmuted in Kanai's Cube, in order to extract their Legendary power (if they have one), reforge the items (with a chance for Ancient item), upgrade a Rare item to (potentially) a set piece, or randomly change a set piece into another item of the same set. The latter, though, has some limitations, but it is a good method of obtaining the last missing part of the set in case player has any duplicates.\nClass Sets.\nEach class has five \"class sets\" of six or seven pieces with very strong set bonuses which dramatically affect gameplay; most character &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s are defined largely by which class set(s) are used. Some classes also have a minor set consisting of two class-specific items in weapon slots. The equipment slots used in each major set are mostly the same, preventing use of large amounts of two class sets at once, although the variations that do occur as well as allow for some interesting combinations. Not all items in these sets are class-exclusive, but the bonuses are always related to class-specific stats and skills, making them generally useless to other classes. Each class's \"fifth set\" was added after the other four, during patches 2.6.7 through 2.6.9.\nCompleting Chapter 2, 3, and 4 of a &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;al Journey grants &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Haedrig's Gift&lt;/a&gt;, which contains pre-determined pieces of a class set. Two pieces are included in most Gifts, although a third is included in the last Gift if necessary to complete the set. Opening all three Gifts on one class ensures a complete class set, although one account can mix and match across different characters if desired. The seasons rotate through which class set is Gifted to each class.\n&lt;a href=\"Set%20Dungeon\"&gt;Set Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s were introduced in patch 2.4 as a way for players to test their skills using the full bonuses of the 28 class sets that existed at the time. Each class has 4 Set Dungeons, with each \"5th class set\" not receiving a Set Dungeon. They are accessed through green portals only visible while under the benefits of the full set. Each dungeon has predetermined enemy types and objectives to complete. They have no loot, and the focus is on timing and positioning rather than intense combat. Completing some or all of them grants many &lt;a href=\"cosmetic\"&gt;cosmetic&lt;/a&gt; rewards as well as progress in &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDiablo IV.\nSet Items don't return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", though may return down the line. The developers felt that Set Items \"guided players too strongly,\" and designed the game to allow greater flexibility."}

It is initiated by talking to &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt; after either completing &lt;a href=\"Radament%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Radament's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Staff%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Horadric Staff&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Sun\"&gt;Tainted Sun&lt;/a&gt; quests or after the player character reaches level 20. The goal of the quest is to find the true tomb, gain entrance to &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, and destroy &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; manages to free him. The quest is completed after the defeat of the demon &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; and then having the player character speak to the Archangel &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drognan\"&gt;Drognan&lt;/a&gt; concluded that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; who had passed through &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the arrival of the player character was Diablo himself. Diablo was set on freeing his brother Baal, who was imprisoned within &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; centuries ago. Tal Rasha's Tomb lay hidden deep in the desert amongst six other tombs.\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest is more or less embedded within the other quests. First, a &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Staff%20%28item%29\"&gt;Horadric Staff&lt;/a&gt; had to be created in order to gain entrance to Tal Rasha's Chamber in &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Staff%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Horadric Staff&lt;/a&gt; quest. Then, &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;'s Tomb itself had to be found by searching the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; for clues in the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; quest. Once &lt;a href=\"Horazon%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Horazon's Journal&lt;/a&gt; has been read, the glyph of the True Tomb is recorded in the quest log, and a portal opens to the &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Canyon of the Magi&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Canyon of the Magi, the tomb that bears that same glyph is the true tomb of Tal Rasha. The true tomb is considerably larger than the false tombs. It might be worthwhile to explore the false tombs though, since there are plenty of &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; and golden &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; waiting inside.\nIn the depths of the true tomb, there is a circular formation on the ground with an Orifice in the center. Click on the Orifice and place the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Staff%20%28item%29\"&gt;Horadric Staff&lt;/a&gt; into the slot of the special window that pops up. A passage opens up in the wall, which leads to &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Chamber&lt;/a&gt;. This is where &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; stands guard to fight intruders. After defeating Duriel, explore the Chamber and find &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. After listening to Tyrael, a portal to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; opens. Take the portal and speak to &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt;. He will inform the player that &lt;a href=\"Meshif\"&gt;Meshif&lt;/a&gt; will take him/her east to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, the location of &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nUse a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; scroll \"before\" entering the Chamber, in order to stock up on &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potions\"&gt;Healing Potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thawing%20Potion\"&gt;Thawing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s in preparation for the tough battle. The Chamber has no exit, so opening another Town Portal upon entry is recommended for a quick ecape route. Duriel is a tough melee boss that is oriented around cold-based attacks. He also has a cold aura identical to the Paladin's &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was designed to tear through flesh rather than slice it; its design \u201ca jagged and thorny branch of bone shards bount together with sinew and uncured strips of hide. As it was specifically designed to fight &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, the sword reacted poorly to being drawn against &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. \nSeverian was reforged by &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; into a new weapon (its history is also covered here). The second blade was broader and heavier than its forebear, but gave its user the strength to wield it when they were in pursuit of its purpose (the slaying of &lt;a href=\"Corvik\"&gt;Corvik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helgrotha\"&gt;Helgrotha&lt;/a&gt;). There is evidence that the blade may have possessed a malign intelligence.\nHistory.\nThe First Blade.\nSeverian was created by &lt;a href=\"Corvik\"&gt;Corvik&lt;/a&gt; from the bone and flesh of &lt;a href=\"Gratian\"&gt;Gratian&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in a sense, Gratian \u2018\u2019became\u2019\u2019 Severian. The sword was gifted to Bersarik, who set off to confront his makers, to demand answers for Gratian\u2019s &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. His hatred seeped into Severian itself, termpering its pores until they were stronger than iron.\nOutside the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, Bersarik confronted &lt;a href=\"Kalmor\"&gt;Kalmor&lt;/a&gt;, and the two came to blows. Severian balked in Bersarik\u2019s own hand, as it had not been made to fight against nephalem. This, in part, allowed Kalmor to slay Bersarik, who in his dying breath, entrusted Severian to Kalmor.\nKalmor presented the blade before &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, and their council, who ordered him to destroy it. &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, however, led Kalmor into a place deep within the fortress-temple, where she altered the blade. She kept its strength, pain, and rage, but twisted and imprisoned its &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; within a new weapon of her own design. The gleaming sword that emerged was gigantic, far too broad and heavy for even a nephalem to wield, yet Kalmor was gifted the blade upon completion.\nThe Second Blade.\nKalmor was ordered to slay Corvik and &lt;a href=\"Helgrotha\"&gt;Helgrotha&lt;/a&gt;, for like Bersarik, they had turned against their makers. Kalmor used the blade to slay Corvik, who recognized it as Severian (or rather, \u201cGratian\u201d) in her last moments, despite having been reforged. Kalmor had trouble finding Helgrotha, and the blade felt heavier in his hands, as if it knew of his failure and was no longer affording the strength to wield it. One night, at a fire, Kalmor talked to the blade, suggesting that Helgrotha might already be dead. The sword replied with a dark glint that reminded Kalmor of the midnight sky. He came to realize that Helgrotha did not move under the sun, but only during night.\nKalmor later found Helgrotha, but chose to let her live. As such, when he went to retrieve the blade, he found it almost too heavy to pick up, but with effort, he raised it over his head and brought it flat against a standing stone. The weapon broke in two, and Kalmor buried the pieces in the glade."}

Sevrin was arrested by the city guard for the murder, but because of his wealth and influence, he was able to secure a pardon. During this time, Adria lingered outside the jailhouse, and when he was released, the two returned to their dockside abode.\nNot long after this event, Sevrin would die in a horrific blaze that consumed the home that he and his family shared, a fire that was speculated to have been started by Adria herself.

Their damage and &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; do not scale with those of the character, but are immense compared to normal monsters, therefore each Shadow Clone is a formidable foe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Haunt%20of%20Vaxo\"&gt;Haunt of Vaxo&lt;/a&gt; also allows the summoning of Shadow Clones of the player, but these clones fight at the player's side for 15 seconds.

These clones (and the &lt;a href=\"%23Season%2022%20Bonus\"&gt;Season 22 clones&lt;/a&gt;) will follow the hero within the current zone but will not move to a new zone with the player. This includes &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt; levels and Greater Rift floors. If the player returns to the zone within the lifespan of the clone, it will be there waiting. &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;s have the same effect, leaving the clone behind, waiting. \nIn the console version of the game, a &lt;a href=\"Nemesis%20Kills\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; may summon a Shadow Clone of each player it has slain.\nIn battle, Clones use the characters' own skills, not necessarily those currently equipped. Each clone has a fixed set of 1-3 abilities, randomly chosen in each game (meaning that in each battle, no matter how many Clones spawn and no matter the number of attempts, their skill set will remain same). Each ability will benefit from a predetermined &lt;a href=\"skill%20rune\"&gt;skill rune&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Note\": on some occasions, other skills or skill runes have been reported; however, Shapeshift skills, summoning of &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of ), &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"absorption\"&gt;absorption&lt;/a&gt; skills are never used by Shadow Clones.\nSeason 22 Bonus.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 22, activating a or Pylon will spawn in a shadow clone of the same class. This clone will chosen at random out of 3 predetermined builds with 6 active skills and no passives. The shadow clone's power will scale with the stats of the player and will last for up to 1 minute or until the player dies.\nNote that while some pre-set variations are themed around certain &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt;, others are centered around thematic ability mechanics. Equipped items and sets have no effect on Shadow Clones besides empowering their stats: their skills only have the basic and Skill Rune effects. However, the effects that increase damage taken by enemies from allies do work."}

Though this can be useful, using Master instead of Warrior does have pros and cons.\nOverall the shadow master is stronger and tougher, with a random assortment of items, which can gain magical bonus as the skill level grows, including ones that boost skill levels, or resistance boosts that are capable of giving the Master immunity to certain elements (her resistance does not suffer from Nightmare and Hell's penalty, nor are they capped at 75%). The Master can also use skills that the assassin does not possess - for example, it can throw death sentries for a martial artist, or use &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Strike\"&gt;Phoenix Strike&lt;/a&gt; for area of effect freeze for trappers.\nOn the other hand, the Master's ability to use all skills can be a hindrance. For trap-oriented assassins, the Master's traps share the same 5 trap limit, so she may end up laying a relatively harmless &lt;a href=\"Charged%20Bolt%20Sentry\"&gt;Charged Bolt Sentry&lt;/a&gt; that overrides a deadly &lt;a href=\"Death%20Sentry\"&gt;Death Sentry&lt;/a&gt;. The Master's fondness of spamming &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Blast\"&gt;Mind Blast&lt;/a&gt; can disrupt a martial artist assassin's rhythm, as it may convert the monster that the assassin is charging up on, causing her to end up running aimlessly in place while trying to click the now untargetable monster, or maybe even straight into the heart of a horde of monsters. Also, against enemies that are capable of destroying the shadow minion in a few hits, the fairly long casting delay on this skill will prevent the Assassin from refreshing her tank in time.\nUsing which shadow depends on preference and situation. As the Assassin gains levels and becomes more experienced as a player and has better gear, Warrior might be a better choice in some situations, allowing you to tweak what skills the shadow uses.\nThe Skills a Shadow Master uses are:\nThe Items for Shadow Master:\nThese items are generated randomly on each cast and are based on skill level."}

{"id": "41160", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=41160", "title": "Shadows", "text": "The Shadows are a secret group, formed to keep the &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt; from going mad with power or becoming complacent. They are spies and saboteurs that overthrow corrupt Immortals.\nLore.\nThe Shadows are overseers, saboteurs and spies who keep the Immortals in check. The Shadows constantly test the Immortals, including conducting numerous raids on their &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Immortals\"&gt;vault&lt;/a&gt;. During this period, individual Immortals that are deemed unfit for their responsibility are eliminated. If the Shadows declare that the Immortals have become too corrupt, they invoke the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Exile\"&gt;Rite of Exile&lt;/a&gt;. Before commencing the rite, the Shadows will initiate a congregation of war, before sending their strongest members into battle.\nThe Shadows admit new members only after strenuous evaluation, and meet in secret throughout &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, though they are rumored to gather in a \"&lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;Court of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;\" below the city. All Shadows members have to sign a contract before joining.\nWhile created to keep the Immortals in check, the motivations of Shadows vary. Some Shadows nobly want to check the Immortals' tremendous power, and see their duty as a holy one. Others, however, are drawn to the violence and mayhem that ensues as they test &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s defenders. The Shadows' spies relish inflaming the Cycle of Strife. Competition within the order occurs as the Shadows fight amongst themselves to discover the strongest candidates to take on the Immortals before initiating the Rite of Exile. Groups of Shadows can rally under their own banner. To improve their standing within the group, Shadows undertake the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Path of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, pitting them against &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and other creatures. \nThe Shadows utilize their own currency, called \"&lt;a href=\"marks\"&gt;marks&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHistory.\nThe Shadows were formed by &lt;a href=\"Akeba\"&gt;Akeba&lt;/a&gt;, who at &lt;a href=\"Daedessa\"&gt;Daedessa&lt;/a&gt;'s request, formed a group that would constantly test the Immortals, to ensure that they were always capable of defending &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, if the Immortals ever fell against Hell, the Shadows were to step in and take their place. \nWorking in secret, Akeba found those brave enough to help her constantly test and challenge the Immortals. They would look for cracks and weaknesses and they would do everything they could to make sure the elite defenders of Sanctuary were always up to the task. She called this group the Shadows. It was agreed that if the Shadows ever overthrew the Immortals, they would take the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Crown\"&gt;Eternal Crown&lt;/a&gt;, and become the Immortals themselves. After the Immortals battled against a force of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Rakanoth\"&gt;Rakanoth&lt;/a&gt; (a battle that apparently ended in their defeat), Akeba and her Shadows moved in, attacking the Immortals. The Shadows prevailed, with Akeba becoming the next Immortal. Knowing that she could not rest on her laurels however, Akeba created the &lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Cycle of Strife&lt;/a&gt;, where the Shadows would continuously test the Immortals, culminating in the Rite of Exile. This remained true well into &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, by which point the strife between the two factions was escalating. Both groups fought for control of the &lt;a href=\"Accursed%20Towers\"&gt;Accursed Towers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; unleashed his forces on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, his growing influence warped sections of the mortal realm into a nightmarish hellscape. Witnessing their home being slowly overtaken by dark forces, the usually warring Immortals and Shadows put out a contract on their shared enemy.\nIn-game.\nThe Shadows are a faction in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" that players can join (the system is entirely opt-in). There is no limit to the number of Shadows that can be on a server. \nShadows players can form \"dark clans.\" After a player's clan is made, that clan's members will join the Shadows together. A clan can hold up to 100 players. A clan name can be 2-25 characters long including spaces.\nIf that player\u2019s dark clan succeeds in besting the other dark clans and overthrowing the Immortals, then that winning Dark Clan will become the Immortal Clan. Players in an Immortal Clan will stay together as a unit and can invite up to two other Dark Clans to become Immortal Allied Clans. When the Immortals\u2019 reign ends, as all reigns must, the Immortal Clan will return to being a normal Clan as the Cycle begins anew. \nOnce the Shadows reach a point in their overall progression, the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Exile\"&gt;Rite of Exile&lt;/a&gt; is triggered.\nShadows have exclusive access to &lt;a href=\"Contracts\"&gt;Contracts&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecoming a Shadow.\nA player can join the Shadows once they've reached &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 43, and finished the &lt;a href=\"Bilefen\"&gt;Bilefen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line. Once they do, they can enter the Shadows Lottery. Every day at 12 pm, 6 pm, and 9 pm server time, Shadow hopefuls can talk to the &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Patron\"&gt;Mysterious Patron&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20City%20Tavern\"&gt;Wolf City Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. If luck is on their side, he will invite them to a room behind him to fight three &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Champion\"&gt;Ancient Champion&lt;/a&gt;s. Players who come out victorious will be full-fledged Shadows. \nIf a Shadow aspirant isn\u2019t invited to fight the Ancient Champions or cannot beat them, there\u2019s an alternative solution. Existing Shadows can invite other players to become new Shadows. This requires an &lt;a href=\"Akeba%20Signet\"&gt;Akeba Signet&lt;/a&gt;, which is consumed upon inviting another player. The only way to get a new signet is by going through the Shadows Lottery as a member and defeating the three Ancient Champions again.\nEvents.\nAside from the Rite of Exile, Shadows have access to the following events:\nDevelopment.\nShadows players could originally form and join &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Houses\"&gt;Dark Houses&lt;/a&gt;. This was replaced by the \"dark clan\" system."}

Her father was an alchemist. However, he didn't want her to follow in his footsteps. At his funeral, she pilfered a medallion from his neck before his coffin was lowered into the ground. Throughout her life, she was never seen without it.\nAt some point she studied under a group of sages who taught her subjects such as runecraft and the history of the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Children of Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt;, and their vigil.\nSword of Justice.\nMeeting Jacob.\nShanar became aware of the &lt;a href=\"Lightsong\"&gt;Lightsong&lt;/a&gt; that emanated from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;. She thought that this resonance might shape the path of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s as well as &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s. In this, she was correct, and found a way to detect the flows of resonance from the arch. This sparked a hunt for the sword &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt;, which had been separated from &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. At some point she was present in the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt; while looking for the sword. She eventually found it in &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, but was ensnared by it. The blade imparted glimpses of the life of &lt;a href=\"Jacob\"&gt;Jacob&lt;/a&gt; to her, and she found herself compelled to record what she had seen on the surrounding stone. The blade staved off hunger and thirst, but also forced her to stand guard until a worthy bearer arrived.\nMonths later, Jacob arrived, freeing Shanar from her vigil. She explained how she had found the sword, but introductions were cut short as a group of soldiers from &lt;a href=\"Staalek\"&gt;Staalek&lt;/a&gt; arrived, seeking revenge on Jacob for the murder of his father. Jacob begged her not to kill them, and while Shanar was able to use her &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to keep them at bay, not taking their lives was becoming exceedingly difficult, under the proviso of keeping hers at the same time. Jacob was taken prisoner, and they threatened to kill him unless Shanar departed.\nShanar tracked the men west, and rescued Jacob as his kinsmen tore into a boar, having succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rage\"&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt;. Within the forest, Shanar departed to search for herbs. Whether intentional or not, she encountered some bandits, defeated them, and retrieved some new clothes for Jacob. As they mulled things over the fire, Jacob suggested returning home, though Shanar cautioned against it, having seen what had become of his kinsmen. Jacob expressed his disgust for the s, for it was they who had brought the &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Plague\"&gt;Rage Plague&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Staalbreak\"&gt;Staalbreak&lt;/a&gt;, but Shanar cautioned against such hatred. The Barbarians that Jacob had encountered were not those that the histories wrote about.\nJacob's kinsmen once again caught up with them, but Shanar &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed them both away, ending up in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. With the soldiers closing in, they were forced to hide, as they saw a band of &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Journey North.\nBecause of the Rage Plague, the khazra were willing to cooperate with Jacob's countrymen. They were also willing to join them in the attempt to kill their quarry. Shanar unleashed her magic against their foes while Jacob swung El'druin. He struck &lt;a href=\"Ivan\"&gt;Ivan&lt;/a&gt;, drawing a lot of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;, but the man remained alive. Jacob eventually surrendured, and agreed to return home, on the condition that he be allowed to do so freely, and not as a prisoner. Aside to Shanar, he expressed his concern for his people, and that he still felt responsible for his father's death. The two had a falling out, as Jacob mocked Shanar's suggestion that the sword was acting through him. She headed north with him, but the two remained on non-speaking terms for much of the trip. She was nonetheless intent on finding out the source of the evil that was plaguing Jacob's people.\nShanar eventually responded to Jacob's words as they entered the Dreadlands. Shanar eventually relented, and discussed the marks Jacob had made on Ivan's chest, how they resembled &lt;a href=\"divinity%20glyph\"&gt;divinity glyph&lt;/a&gt;s. She pointed out that Jacob couldn't have known what they were, but the sword might have guided his hand. As they approached Staalek, Shanar commented that there was something...wrong, with the place. Even some plants she'd found in the snow appeared diseased. Regardless, they marched on, encountering the corpses of some soldiers who had been slain by Barbarians. Shanar didn't deny what she saw, but this still didn't make sense, given what she knew of Barbarian history. And there was also the people of Staalek themselves. Outside the walls, they encountered heads on pikes, and moving through the gates, found khazra skulls arranged like trophies.\nEntering the town, Jacob was pelted with stones until Constable &lt;a href=\"Varik\"&gt;Varik&lt;/a&gt; calmed the crowd, taking Jacob into his custody. Shanar slinked away while Jacob gave himself up in order to speak. However, he was instead strung up and tortured. Shanar freed him, but a group of soldiers descended upon them.\nA Thwarted Execution.\nShanar teleported them both away into the Gray Wards\u2014 a particuarly disreputable area of the city. They came under attack by feral animals (also infected by the plague), but she fried them with her magic. They headed to their goal; a structure that was owned by &lt;a href=\"Bertram%20the%20Apothecary\"&gt;Bertram the Apothecary&lt;/a&gt;. Only his body remained as a twisted, distorted mess. Shanar revealed that he was actually a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had been studying &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; and an artifact. When the plague hit, he tried to study its effects. While dead, his writings gave the pair insight into its origins and means of transmission. His body was the end result of the infection.\nThe guards caught them, and Jacob once again gave himself up, still intent on trying to save his people by explaining what had happened to them. Shanar once again slipped away. Before dawn, she encountered Ivan, who'd indeed been saved by Jacob earlier thanks to the cuts he had made on him with El'druin. Ivan helped her cure the other members of his band by mimicking the rune cuts, curing them of corruption. Ivan returned to his post as executioner as dawn came. Jacob was given his right to speak, but his people were too far gone. Ivan rose his awe, but instead turned it on the soldiers as fighting errupted. Shanar arrived and freed Jacob, joining the fight herself. Jacob slew Varik, and Ivan and his men were able to take control of the town. Which was just as well, as they now had to deal with a Barbarian attack. Shanar, Jacob, and the soldiers under Ivan's command charged out the gates to meet them.\nThe Lifting of the Plague.\nAs the battle waged, Jacob was empowered by El'druin. He charged ahead, despite Shanar's warnings. The Barbarian chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Khelric\"&gt;Khelric&lt;/a&gt;, goaded him, but Shanar got Jacob to pause in his pursuit. Khelric retreated, but Ivan stated that he had to go on. His blood was tainted, and if this continued, cities to the south would be infected as well. Jacob and Shanar thus traveled north together, Jacob explaining that he had heard an &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;'s voice talk to him through the sword, telling him of the Barbarians and their vigil over the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. He admitted that his view on them had softened, but the attacks had started before Arreat's destruction. As they headed north, they encountered &lt;a href=\"Gynvir\"&gt;Gynvir&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Owl%20Tribe\"&gt;Owl Tribe&lt;/a&gt;; the same group of Barbarians that had attacked earlier. She was not infected however, and told them the origins of the Rage Plague, how it had come from the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maluus\"&gt;Maluus&lt;/a&gt;. She took them to Khelric's fortress, where her honor guard awaited.\nThe group descended into the depths of Khelric's fortress. Eventually, they found Khelric, and a horde of infected Barbarians with him. Jacob slew Khelric (and Mallus, who had become one and the same with him), and lifted the plague. The two said their farwells to Ivan and they departed for the East.\nSeparation.\nShanar and Jacob remained together for nineteen years, fighting against injustice in Sanctuary. Ivan occassionally helped them. Over that time, Jacob developed romantic feelings towards her, but could never express them. Shanar underwent no aging over the next two decades. During the period, El'druin was ripped from his hands as it returned to Tyrael, per his reconstitution in Heaven. Jacob was deeply affected by the loss, and Shanar offered sympathy.\nIt was Jacob's inability to express his feelings that contributed to them parting ways. At some point, Shanar came into contact with the demon &lt;a href=\"Bar%27aguil\"&gt;Bar'aguil&lt;/a&gt;. She survived, but it stole her medallion. Over this period of time, she remained in touch with the Lightsong.\nStorm of Light.\nThe New Horadrim.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;One year later&lt;/a&gt;, Shanar reunited with Jacob in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, helping him slay the demon &lt;a href=\"Bar%27aguil\"&gt;Bar'aguil&lt;/a&gt;. She retrieved her father's medallion from him, and told him of a new 'adventure.' That she had been following the Lightsong. Jacob agreed to follow her. Their destination turned out to be &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, where they met with the &lt;a href=\"Mikulov\"&gt;Mikulov&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;Zayl&lt;/a&gt;, Gynvir, &lt;a href=\"Thomas\"&gt;Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cullen\"&gt;Cullen&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, Tyrael, who had gathered them all (and in Shanar's case, drawn her to him through the Lightsong), with the intent of reforming the Horadrim. He told them of his intent to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, lest it corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this, they would find the lost &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Corvus\"&gt;Corvus&lt;/a&gt;, which Tyrael believed could store the stone safely. It was insanely dangerous, and Shanar was only the second person to point it out. She remembered how El'druin had ensared her years back, and had little intention on undergoing a suicide mission. The conversation was cut short as they came under attack by a group of demons. The group survived the encounter, and rested in the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Calf%20Inn\"&gt;Slaughtered Calf Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin their rooms, Shanar and the others discussed their prospects. Shanar fumed at being manipulated by Tyrael, and wondered if he'd had a hand in guiding her to El'druin twenty years ago. Culllen vouched for Tyrael, citing his history in the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, but as Shanar pointed out, that was then. The Tyrael of the now was mortal. Her companions decided to trust the archangel, and Shanar relented to the group's will. They subsequently departed for &lt;a href=\"Bramwell\"&gt;Bramwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nBramwell.\nThe Horadrim found Bramwell to be 'off', as it had been plagued by an &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;unknown foe&lt;/a&gt;. Shanar talked with the townsfolk and learnt that they had suffered abductions; people vanishing in the night. They stayed in the house of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Nahr\"&gt;Commander Nahr&lt;/a&gt;. Later, in the woods, they came under attack by more demons. Shanar fought alongside Tyrael, keeping them at bay. But these paled in comparison to the &lt;a href=\"Sicarai\"&gt;Sicarai&lt;/a&gt; that was unleashed upon them. Shanar unleashed a torrent of attacks on the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;, but it shrugged off her assault. She rushed to Gynvir's aid as the angel struck her. Finally, the Sicarai was felled, and the group returned to Bramwell to heal Jacob. Following clues gleaned from artifacts they had gathered, they headed for &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, Shanar noticed that Jacob had gained some of his old swagger back.\nWestmarch and the Wastelands.\nThe group entered Westmarch, hoping to gain entrance to Corvus through the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Cathedral\"&gt;Zakarum Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. They stayed at the &lt;a href=\"Inn%20of%20the%20Snapping%20Dog\"&gt;Inn of the Snapping Dog&lt;/a&gt; while trying to get word to &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt;. Listening in on the patrons' conversations, Shanar and the others could sense the undercurrent of tension within the city, per the abductions, and tensions between the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Templar%20Order\"&gt;Templar Order&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Lorath arrived, who elaborated on the knight-templar tensions and the disappearances of Westmarch's people. Lorath told them that he might be able to help them gain entrance to the cathedral.\nIn this, the Horadrim gained entrance as the Knights of Westmarch assaulted the cathedral, the Templar trying to hold them off. Shanar fought alongside Gynvir. The Horadrim cornered the Templar in the lower chambers of the cathedral. Many Templar fought to the death before their &lt;a href=\"Norlun\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; gave the order to surrender. General &lt;a href=\"Torion\"&gt;Torion&lt;/a&gt; gave the Horadrim until nightfall to search the cathedral. They found the entrance to Corvus, and proceeded to search for the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Tomb of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin Corvus, Tyrael trained the Horadrim for the coming assault on Heaven. Tyrael took Shanar and Jacob to the &lt;a href=\"Wastelands\"&gt;Wastelands&lt;/a&gt;, a murky realm located on the edges of &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;. Shanar was trained to listen to the Lightsong while overcoming her personal demons alongside Jacob. Other members of the Horadrim were likewise trained. Shanar was also trained in honing her abilities. Before they departed, they came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s. Shanar fought alongside Tyrael.\nAssault on Heaven.\nShanar and Jacob entered Heaven first, emerging in the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Pools of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;. The pools bombarded them with visions, but they were able to resist, and the plan proceeded. Shanar used her magic to cloak the Horadrim as they made their way to the Black Soulstone. Along the way, they lost &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;Zayl&lt;/a&gt;, who was enticed by the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Library of Fate&lt;/a&gt;. They entered the &lt;a href=\"Gardens%20of%20Hope\"&gt;Gardens of Hope&lt;/a&gt;. Jacob snapped due to the realm's psychological effects, and in doing so, robbed the Horadrim of the safety of Shanar's spell. Tyrael gave the order to run. They sprinted to the &lt;a href=\"Courts%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Courts of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, though Thomas, Cullen, and Tyrael fell behind. Jacob, Shanar, and Gynvir made it into the Courts, and once again, the psychological effects of the realm hit them. Yet they withstood it, and headed towards the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council%20Chamber\"&gt;Angiris Council Chamber&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the chamber, they found the stone, and reunited with Zayl. Shanar wanted to leave, but Jacob insisted on helping Tyrael. They rescued him from &lt;a href=\"the%20Fist\"&gt;the Fist&lt;/a&gt;, fighting through the Sicarai. Jacob was badly wounded in the fight. Tyrael ordered them to head back to the portal. Shanar beged Zayl to help Jacob; Zayl managed to do so using &lt;a href=\"prime%20magic\"&gt;prime magic&lt;/a&gt;, reviving Jacob, but temporarily incapacitating himself in the process. Shanar dragged Zayl along as Gynvir carried Jacob. Making their way back to the Gardens of Hope, they encountered &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;. However, she let them go, having recognised the adverse effect the soulstone was having on Heaven.\nThe Horadrim returned to Corvus, Shanar briefly kissing Jacob and asserting that he \"owed her one.\" Tyrael returned safely, congratulating the Horadrim.\nPersonality and Traits.\nShanar possesses a slender frame, and is considered to be beautiful. She has black hair that was originally long, but by the time of her recruitment into the Horadrim, it had been cut to be shoulder length. She otherwise looks the same at the age of 40 as she did at the age of 20.\nShanar held respect for the Barbarians. She generally worked alone, and claimed not to be good at rescues. She has a practical mindset, and often displays a dry wit. Tyrael was of the belief that Shanar used humor to hide her true self.\nAbilities.\nShanar is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;. Her abilities include &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ation (a spell she finds particuarly useful), &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Rays of Frost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Pulse\"&gt;Shock Pulse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Orb\"&gt;Arcane Orb&lt;/a&gt;s, s, and the . She holds a low opinion of Mages, considering them cowards and \"frustrated poets.\" She remained in tune with the song of the Crystal Arch, which can guide her actions."}

The formerly deceased may also be turned into Shardborne, and similarly, the transformation can kill the unlucky soul, and subsequently resurrect them. Organic matter can also be turned into a Shardborne.\nThe transformation may be halted, or in its late stages kept at bay, by exposure to &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. However, one's inner light cannot stop the transformation. This might be due to the curse &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; placed on the Worldstone (to bleed the light of humanity away, thereby turning them into demons).\nPeople who were scratched, not pierced, by splinters of the Worldstone do not change to Shardborne. \nIf a being is transformed into a Shardborne, the process is usually total; it is very rare for vestiges of the original being to remain, at least physically. Psychologically, some Shardborne can be considered a &lt;a href=\"Iscea\"&gt;separate persona&lt;/a&gt; from their pre-corrupted self, while &lt;a href=\"Elsauli\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; can be considered one and the same.\nShardborne are driven to kill by endless visions of terror, and the slightest exposure to Worldstone shards sends the Shardborne into a rabid craze. Despite this, Shardborne have displayed a modicum of intelligence; intentionally using Worldstone shards on creatures to create more Shardborne, for instance. References have been made to a \"chorus of voices\" that link the Shardborne, with some voices more dominant than others.\nShardborne appear to willingly seek out shardstorms.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;When&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; was sundered, the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Dreadlands\"&gt;Southern Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt; was subjected to horrifying red storms that carried tiny splinters and particles of the destroyed Worldstone. When a storm passed through a settlement, it either cut the inhabitants to pieces or transformed them into Shardborne. \n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;Seven years later&lt;/a&gt;, the Shardborne were wielded by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, who hoped to unleash the Shardborne on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;reanimated dead&lt;/a&gt;, shaped into lethal attackers.\nIn-game.\nThe are a group of monsters in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

It has been indicated that the Shassar Sea was once an actual body of water, but if so, this ceased to be the case. The ruins of docks and boats can still be found on the sands. During the reign of King &lt;a href=\"Fahir\"&gt;Fahir&lt;/a&gt;, Shassar was far from the wasteland it would eventually become.\nSandstorms are a potential threat for anyone traveling across the desert. It is said that the three most dangerous killers in Shassar are scorpion stings, snake venom, and time itself.\nA number of desert gangs vie for control of Shassar, foremost among them the &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Scorpions\"&gt;Sand Scorpions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Blades\"&gt;Amber Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly History.\nThe Shassar Sea was once home to the &lt;a href=\"Fahiran%20Empire\"&gt;Fahiran Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time of its fall, was ruled by King &lt;a href=\"Fahir\"&gt;Fahir&lt;/a&gt;. After his &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, the people turned on each other, trying to claim his riches. His &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;scepter&lt;/a&gt;, the symbol of his authority, was split into three parts, which appears to have hindered his subjects' ability to have found an heir. \nBy the 13th century, the Shassar civilization had collapsed, its people scattered throughout the land. Shassar itself turned into a wasteland.\nRecent History.\nOver the years, many adventurers came to Shassar, seeking to loot its tombs. However, none of them made it out alive.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the Shassar Sea had a grim reputation. &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; sought to trade with Shassar's merchants, but the &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s that prowled the sands hindered this. It offered &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; to clear them out, but adventurers in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; refused to take bounties that would take them to the region. &lt;a href=\"Vataos\"&gt;Vataos&lt;/a&gt; terrorized Shassar's scattered people. However, with the reconstituted Scepter of Fahir coming into the hands of &lt;a href=\"Tabri\"&gt;Tabri&lt;/a&gt; (leader of the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Blades\"&gt;Amber Blades&lt;/a&gt;), she declared that she had the right to rule the land, and a symbol through which Shassar's people could rally behind, against Vataos. &lt;a href=\"Peth\"&gt;Peth&lt;/a&gt; later stated that the Blades intended to retake Shassar. Despite this, the Blades' attempts at retaking Shassar were stymied by the &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt;, who attacked one of their villages, killing dozens and causing the survivors to flee. Unable to retake it on their own, the Blades requested aid from any able-bodied fighters in Westmarch.\nIn-game.\nThe area can be explored in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". It is a 'hub zone,' and has a recommended &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; of 28-36."}

I sell jewels.\nPlayer:\nWhat you do does not define you. Where do you come from?\nCovetous Shen:\nXiansai! Great Families warred in the streets! Political intrigue and bottomless wells of treachery around every corner!\nPlayer:\nI notice that you still tell me nothing of yourself.\nCovetous Shen:\nOh dear. Perhaps you are not asking the right questions.\nThe Restless Dead.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: A Shattered Crown (Act I)\nCovetous Shen:\nYou are very brave to venture outside the town gates. I hear there are all sorts of dangerous things crawling around out there.\nPlayer:\nThe spirits speak of the risen dead.\nCovetous Shen:\nThat's terrible! I only meant the rats and snakes.\nDeckard Cain.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: A Shattered Crown (Act I)\nCovetous Shen:\nHm, I do like this Deckard Cain fellow. It's rare that I can find someone I have so much in common with.\nPlayer:\nYou do not seem very similar.\nCovetous Shen:\nWe both had rather interesting experiences with the Zakarum priestesses in our youths.\nJewels.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Northwest Gate (Under A Shattered Crown) (Act I)Disappears at Reign of the Black King.\nCovetous Shen: \nYou know, there is nothing in the world quite so perfect as jewels. They have color, size, shape... transparency.\nPlayer: \nYou do have a powerful love for them, it seems.\nCovetous Shen: \nOh yes! If only I could eat them, I would need nothing else in life. Not that you can't. I hear some people even shave certain crystals atop their food!\nKing Leoric.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Reign of the Black King (Act I)Disappears at Sword of the Stranger\nCovetous Shen:\nWell... though I never knew him personally, I saw Leoric himself when he was building his manor.\nA troubled man with a heavy burden upon his fragile mind. Is it any wonder that he built such a home for himself?\nWhat he needed was someone to teach him how to laugh once in a while.\nThe Fallen Star.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Khazra Den (Under Sword of the Stranger) (Act I)\nCovetous Shen: \nOh, perhaps it was a jewel that fell from the sky. Did you ever consider that?\nPlayer: \nIt was not a jewel; it was a stranger. A man.\nCovetous Shen: \nA man? Now, that is strange. Where do you suppose he came from? And how did he survive his fall? Did he have any jewels on him?\nThe World.\nAvailable at the start of the Sub Quest: Talk To Alaric(under Quest: Broken Blade)(Act I)\nCovetous Shen:\nSuch a strange place this world is. You never know what you might find over the next rise, or what the next day might bring.\nA man who fell from the sky, a king who cannot die. I can tell I will have no dull days, traveling with you.\nDark Visions.\nAvailable at start of the Quest: The Doom in Wortham (Act I)(You Must Talk to The Stranger First)\nCovetous Shen: \nI can see the fires from here. Wortham burns.\nIt is only the truly evil who force innocents to suffer for a battle they have no part in.\nGrieving.\nAvailable after start of the Quest: Khazra Barricade (Under Trailing the Coven) (Act I)\nCovetous Shen: \nIt's a cruel world that would take Deckard Cain away from us. His was never an easy life, and he gave much for us all.\nPlayer: \nI will not rest until Maghda and her coven have paid for Cain's death.\nCovetous Shen: \nWe all pay. Just look at the face of Leah, the poor girl. What price could the Coven pay that could be greater than that?\nThe Stranger.\nAvailable at the Cursed Hold part of : The Imprisoned Angel (Act I) (You must speak with Leah first)\nCovetous Shen:\nA strange man. I know a thing or two about a man with secrets.\nPlayer:\nLike your self?\nCovetous Shen:\nMe? Oh, no. I'm a simple man. Give me a good meal, a warm bed, and a handful of jewels. But you, I think, are different. Complicated.\nThe Journey Ahead.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Return to New Tristram(Act I)\nCovetous Shen:\nWhere do we go next? To the great desert?\nPlayer:\nWe go to Caldeum.\nCovetous Shen:\nCaldeum! Yes, the great Jewel of the East!\nPlayer:\nCaldeum is not actually a jewel.\nCovetous Shen:\nI knew that.\nA Special Jewel.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Shadows in the Desert (Act II)Unlocks The Legend of Zei the Trickster/A Case of Mistaken Identity (see below)\nCovetous Shen:\nI knew you would lead me to exciting and mysterious places! We should encounter the jewel I seek any day now!\nPlayer:\nTell me of this jewel. What does it look like?\nCovetous Shen:\nSometimes, a ruby. Other times, a glorious emerald or a stunning diamond. It is very good at hiding.\nPlayer:\nSo it is aware. There is a dark spirit within?\nCovetous Shen:\nA very good question. A dangerous question. You are getting better at them.\nPlayer:\nI notice that you did not answer me.\nCovetous Shen:\nHmm. Yes, well, a good question answers itself.\nA Case of Mistaken Identity.\nThis conversation is labeled as The Legend of Zei the Trickster in the achievements menu, but A Case of Mistaken Identity in Shen's conversation window. (probably referring to the journal received afterwards)\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Shadows in the Desert (Act I)Unlocked after the conversation, A Special Jewel.\nCovetous Shen:\nYou try to give a young man some advice, and he assumes you are the Xiansai god of thieves, traveling in disguise as an elderly jeweler!\nI understand his confusion. Zei and I do share certain features.\nPlayer:\nHow strange. The spirits tell me that you are often mistaken for this god.\nCovetous Shen:\nThat would be correct! But enough about me. Who are these \"spirits\" you speak to?\nPlayer:\nAll who die pass from this world to Mbwiru Eikura, the true one. They speak to me, and some of them say they knew you from times long past.\nCovetous Shen:\nOf course they do! I am very memorable!\nThe Legend of Zei the Trickster (Journal Unlocked).\nThe people of Xiansai worship fifty-nine gods, but few are more revered than Zei, the exiled trickster god who travels the face of the world, disguised as a humble merchant. Tales of his adventures range from ingenious thefts and practical jokes to more... lurid exploits, none of which I am comfortable recording here.Abd al-Hazir\nA Mysterious Rumor.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Shadows in the Desert (Act II)\nJeweler Covetous Shen: \nI heard a rumor that there is a strange and mysterious jewelcrafting device hidden in the aqueducts of the Dahlgur Oasis.\nI have a mind to go search for it myself. Don't worry, I won't go alone. I'm sure I'll find someone to show me around.\nThe Desert Heat.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Shadows in the Desert (Act II)\nJeweler Covetous Shen: \nUgh, it's even hotter than I remembered it. I'm afraid I'm growing weak. I need a drink, and a bath, and something to keep the sun off.\nOr maybe just a nice, cold jewel to put on my forehead. That will fix everything.\nCaldeum.\nAvailable at the start of the quest A Royal Audience (Act II)\nJeweler Covetous Shen: \nThe Jewel of the East! Caldeum is really quite amazing. I have never seen anything quite like it, and I have seen many things in my life.\nPlayer: \nCaldeum is not actually a jewel. It is just a name.\nCovetous Shen: \nThat explains quite a bit, actually.\nZoltun Kulle.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Betrayer of the Horadrim (Act II)\nCovetous Shen: \nI think I might have met Zoltun Kulle once. He seemed like a perfectly reasonable sort, for a mage, that is.\nPlayer: \nAre mages so different?\nCovetous Shen: \nOh yes, well, you know how they can be, with the waving hands and the mumbling all the time. They can be a little strange.\nLegends and Myth.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Blood and Sand (Act II)\nCovetous Shen: \nYou are looking at me in a very strange manner.\nPlayer: \nThe spirits are confused. This is not something that happens. Some think you a god; others, a man. Which are you?\nCovetous Shen: \nAh, philosophy! Can a man not be both? Can I not live well, and give generously, and live a perfectly holy life?\nPlayer: \nI do not know. Can you?\nCovetous Shen: \nOh, definitely not. It's tremendously boring. I'd rather eat too much and sleep late.\nThe Jewel's Price.\nAvailable at the start of the quest The Black Soulstone (Act II)\nCovetous Shen: \nI think I was wrong about the jewel I seek. It is not in this land either. What a pity.\nPlayer: \nWhy do you search for this jewel so persistently?\nCovetous Shen: \nBecause... it has killed thousands, and because I am the only one who can hold it without harm.\nPlayer: \nBecause you are a god?\nCovetous Shen: \nNo. Because it has already taken everything from me that matters.\nBut enough of that! I have gone too long without spiced beef and spicier wine!\nThe Black Soulstone.\nAvailable at the start of the quest The Scouring of Caldeum (Act II)\nCovetous Shen: \nDo you think I could take a close look at that Black Soulstone? It's like nothing I've ever seen before.\nPlayer: \nIt is no ordinary stone. It is an object of great evil.\nCovetous Shen: \nYou think to little of me. The object of my search is as dangerous as anything. My expertise may be of some use to you. I am, after all, quite well versed in the knowledge of jewels and stones.\nThe Frozen North.\nAvailable at the start of the quest The Siege of Bastion's Keep (Act III)\nCovetous Shen: \nIt's just unnatural to go from a place so hot to a place so cold. The change isn't good for my old bones.\nPlayer: \nI had to come here.\nCovetous Shen: \nAnd what is all this noise? It's as though we're right in the middle of a battle!\nPlayer: \nThis is a great battle we are in.\nCovetous Shen: \nI know; isn't it?\nMemories.\nAvailable at the start of the quest The Siege of Bastion's Keep (Act III)\nPlayer: \nYou look distant, my friend. Your mind casts itself into the past, I think.\nCovetous Shen: \nOh, yes, yes, yes. Well, memories are useless, aren't they? You can't eat them or sell them for food. I'm glad that I'm starting to lose them!\nOh, I was just remembering a time when I tracked the jewel to Skovos. A long story, but let us just say that between the sea monsters and poison arrows, it managed to slip away again.\nPlayer: \nA disappointing conclusion.\nCovetous Shen: \nOh, it was. But when the theater's ceiling collapsed, I fell right into the lap of my soon-to-be seventh wife! She managed to console me.\nPlayer: \nSeven wives?\nCovetous Shen: \nOh, no, no, no. I've been married many more times than that. But never to more than two women at a time. Never let it be said that I am greedy!\nMore Memories.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Turning the Tide (Act III)\nPlayer: \nI would enjoy another story from your past.\nCovetous Shen: \nDuring the Festival of Masks many years ago, a lady stole my money pouch and a kiss from me. Of course, I had to catch her.\nIn those days, I was quite an athlete. I chased her halfway across the city's moonlit rooftops, wearing nothing more than a mask with a gigantic nose.\nI never caught her, but I still remember her laugh.\nHard Questions.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Tremors in the Stone (Act III)\nCovetous Shen: \nOh, dear. That's a very resolute expression you're wearing. You may as well say what you're thinking.\nPlayer: \nThe spirits say you are a fraud and a god, husband and thief of wives, a chieftain and a vagabond. You cannot be all these things.\nCovetous Shen: \nAnd why not? People can be anything they want, I say. The only limitation s time, and I have been alive for many years.\nPlayer: \nFor more years, perhaps, than a normal man would live.\nCovetous Shen: \nOh yes. And I think everyone would agree that I am far from normal.\nThe Battlefields.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Machines of War (Act III)\nCovetous Shen: \nYou're going out there?\nPlayer: \nThat is why I came here.\nCovetous Shen: \nMake sure you bundle up. You should probably wear an extra layer or two. You can never be warm enough, I always say.\nPlayer: \nAnd yet you have not put on more since Caldeum.\nCovetous Shen: \nOh, well, it's quite simple. I just tuck a few fire opals in my pockets and under my shirts, and I never get cold. As good as a pair of long underwear.\nThe Nature of the Jewel.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Siegebreaker (Act III)\nPlayer: \nI wish to learn more about this jewel and the spirit trapped within.\nCovetous Shen: \nOh, all you wish to hear is my most guarded secret. Well, certainly. If you cannot be trusted, then the world is in trouble, I think.\nThe jewel contains a... powerful creature named Dirgest. He was trapped within it for terrible crimes against his people.\nPlayer: \nThe spirits have never heard this name. That is a strange thing. They know everyone.\nCovetous Shen: \nThe spirits of those who know him are trapped with him in the stone.\nNow a flaw has developed in the jewel. Through it, Dirgest can consume the holder's life. I intend to seal his prison, trapping him in it forever.\nThe End.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Heart of Sin (Act III)\nCovetous Shen: \nYou are so close now. Only Azmodan is still out there, waiting for you. What do you suppose you will do after he is dead?\nPlayer: \nWe can discuss that after he is dead.\nCovetous Shen: \nOh, you're too modest. I saw how easily you took care of Belial. And you've already beaten Azmodan's army. How much more trouble could he be?\nLet me tell you what I think. After Azmodan is dead, you come with me, and we'll go on a grand adventure! Just you and Shen. The wind at our backs, and the road stretching out before us.\nPlayer: \nIt is not an unpleasant thought.\nThe Hunt Continues.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)\nCovetous Shen: \nWhen you have lived as long as I, you learn that life is filled with betrayal. But the cruelest always comes at the hands of those we love.\nI know it must be hard to think of other things, but now we must. All creation rests upon your shoulders.\nPlayer: \nYou sound more serious than I have ever heard you.\nCovetous Shen: \nWell, these are dark times. Even I must set apart thoughts of Dirgest's jewel and dwell upon the fate of the world.\nBut that doesn't mean you have to frown so.\nHope.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)\nCovetous Shen: \nHope... Do not look down, my friend. Even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.\nHope for a better day, hope for a new dawn.\nOr just hope for a good breakfast. You start small, then see what you can get.\nA Dark Day.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)\nCovetous Shen: \nI never quite expected my life to... end this way.\nPlayer:\nAnd what did you expect?\nCovetous Shen: \nWell, smothered by a harem! Or, more likely, killed by the jewel I seek. Who would have thought that the entire world would die together?\nI can't complain. It's not as though I can say my life was not long enough!\nPlayer:\nAll is not yet lost, my friend.\nCovetous Shen: \nI'm glad my boundless confidence is rubbing off on you. Could you give some of it back?\nLeah's Soul.\nAvailable at the start of the quest The Light of Hope (Act IV)\nCovetous Shen: \nDo you think that Leah is lost forever?\nPlayer:\nDiablo consumed her. She is gone.\nCovetous Shen: \nDo you not think Leah's soul is stronger than that? But, oh, but then sometimes I-I forget that you have not seen everything that I have seen.\nPlayer:\nYou always dodge the truth. Who are you?\nCovetous Shen: \nEr, what am I? I am Covetous Shen, of course-no more, no less. To some, that has meant one thing; to others, another.\nPlayer:\nWhen will you give me a real answer?\nCovetous Shen: \nWhen the sun sets in the east and the shore swallows the tide. When the moon smiles upon the day and the blind man sees once again.\nGod or Man.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Beneath the Spire (Act IV)\nPlayer:\nThe time for mysteries is past. I wish to know who you are.\nCovetous Shen: \nWhy? Do you think it will help you face Diablo?\nPlayer:\nKnowledge can aid us at unexpected times. The spirits say you are long-lived. Perhaps you know something that will help me.\nCovetous Shen: \nOh, yes, yes, yes! I most certainly do. The last time I saw someone more intelligent than you, I was looking in a reflection. Fight intelligently, my friend, and you cannot fail.\nAt any rate. When you defeat Diablo, don't laze about. We have other lands to explore, you and I. Dirgest's jewel is still out there somewhere.\nRuin and Corruption.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Beneath the Spire (Act IV)\nCovetous Shen: \nAll is falling to ruin and corruption. Nothing in all my days and all my years has ever compared to this.\nPlayer:\nDo not lose hope. Terrible things have come and gone before.\nCovetous Shen: \nBut nowhere near as terrible as might happen if you do not defeat Diablo. All the jewels in Heaven or in our world would mean nothing then. Oh, I weep to think of such a day.\nThe Lord of Terror.\nAvailable at the start of the quest Prime Evil (Act IV)\nCovetous Shen: \nI know what I fear. For long years I feared the jewel of Dirgest would fall into the wrong hands, that its evil would be unleashed upon our world.\nBut in the sight of this, in the sight of all this destruction, I can hardly look or even think upon a jewel, even one as terrible as Dirgest's.\nYou must save us.\nVictory.\nAvailable at the end of the quest Prime Evil,After killing Diablo. (Act IV)\nCovetous Shen: Oh, victory at long last! I never dreamed our humble quest might lead to this, it's a story I will tell for many, many years.\nAnd of course, I won't leave\u00a0 out the part played by one simple jeweler."}

Both pieces are Monk-only.\nSet Bonuses (2 pieces):\nThe second part of set bonus is not passive: it triggers when maximum Spirit is actually reached, and lasts until the Monk loses all Spirit. The zero Spirit regeneration is also \"not\" passive, and only active during the damage amplification phase: it sets spirit regeneration to -65 per second, regardless of previous value.\nWith proper build, this allows Primary skills to deliver tremendous amounts of damage, especially when coupled with &lt;a href=\"Raiment%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Storms\"&gt;Raiment of a Thousand Storms&lt;/a&gt; set and passive effects like &lt;a href=\"Depth%20Diggers\"&gt;Depth Diggers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 350% damage modifier at maximum Spirit is multiplicative to other similar bonuses.\nSpirit Generators only include Primary skills, not other skills that replenish any Spirit: &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Fists of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Reach\"&gt;Deadly Reach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crippling%20Wave\"&gt;Crippling Wave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Hundred%20Fists\"&gt;Way of the Hundred Fists&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the Spirit drain is static (65 per second, \"not\" per tick), this bonus is especially effective with &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; boosts like &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Dragon\"&gt;Flying Dragon&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "2429", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2429", "title": "Shields", "text": "Shields are an excellent way to improve a character's defense. Shields increase &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Defense Rating&lt;/a&gt; and provide heroes with a &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Chance To Block&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0incoming attacks (effectively reducing damage of those attacks by a fixed amount). Some classes like &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s rely more heavily on shields than others, though in &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode, there are respectable builds for all classes that involve a shield.\nAll shields occupy the &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; slot, so equipping a &lt;a href=\"Two-handed\"&gt;Two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapon with a shield is impossible unless one of two conditions is fulfilled:\nDiablo I/Hellfire.\nShields in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;\"Diablo I\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;\"Hellfire\"&lt;/a&gt; function at their most basic levels. Provided you have a Shield but no melee weapon equipped, you can use a shield to minimally damage your enemies. They are best in the hands of a &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; or a Barbarian wishing to use blunt weaponry, because not only do they possess the natural &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; needed to equip the higher end shields, but they naturally possess &lt;a href=\"Faster%20Block%20Rate\"&gt;Fast Block&lt;/a&gt; as well which means that they do not need any shield giving faster blocking like &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt;, therefore they're better off with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magical&lt;/a&gt; Shields in their hands giving even greater &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; than the formerly mentioned one, combined with bonus &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;. A hero's Chance To Block is not limited by a hard cap, so one could bring their &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; high enough to guarantee blocks against melee and ranged attacks.\nDiablo II/Lord of Destruction.\nShields in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;\"Diablo II\"&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;\"Lord of Destruction\"&lt;/a&gt; have some new tricks unto them, compared to \"Diablo I\"/\"Hellfire\". To name one, there are certain &lt;a href=\"Shrunken%20Heads\"&gt;Totems&lt;/a&gt; only usable by the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, and there are certain &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Shields\"&gt;Paladin Shields&lt;/a&gt; which only the Paladin can equip. Another example is the Paladin's &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt;, which allows him to stun and knock back his foes by bashing them with his shield (and cannot be used if no shield is equipped). &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Chance To Block&lt;/a&gt; has a hard cap of 75% when immobile, walking or attacking, and 25% when running. Having an increase in &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; will contribute to a higher block chance, as well as the Paladin's &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shield\"&gt;Holy Shield&lt;/a&gt; Skill.\nDiablo III.\nShields return in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;\"Diablo III\"&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;\"Reaper of Souls\"&lt;/a&gt;, but their functions are nerfed down from that of Diablo II / Lord of Destruction. A successful Chance to Block is a bit more difficult to attain, due to the fact that Shields cannot roll higher than 20% Chance to Block without affixes that increase said chance (up to 31% total). They also do not block \"all\" damage when they do block an attack. Instead, each shield carries a Block Amount, seen under its Chance to Block. They do, however, contribute the most &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; out of any equipment type, being the only piece able to achieve 1,000 Armor (on level 60) and 2000 Armor (on level 70) without &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Legendary\"&gt;Ancient Legendary&lt;/a&gt; bonus or affixes that increase Armor or &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;.\nShields may also roll reduced damage from &lt;a href=\"elites\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt;, bonus damage to elites, reduced damage from melee / ranged attacks, &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt; chance, &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; reduction, reduced resource costs, increased &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Life%20regeneration\"&gt;Life regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, increased healing, , &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; duration reduction, all &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;, and various 'on hit' effects.\nLike Paladins in Diablo II, Crusaders have their own type of shields: &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Shields\"&gt;Crusader Shields&lt;/a&gt;. Some of Crusader skills can only be used with a Shield equipped in the off-hand.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;force fields&lt;/a&gt; protecting the character from harm ('bubbles' granted by certain abilities) are also generally called Shields."}
