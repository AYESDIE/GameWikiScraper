{"id": "44", "revid": "84037", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=44", "title": "Tyrael", "text": "Tyrael, formerly the\u00a0Archangel of Justice,\u00a0now the Aspect of Wisdom, is a mortal &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;. He is a stalwart defender of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mankind&lt;/a&gt;, but is considered a renegade by the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;. If not for his actions, both the mortal realm and its inhabitants would have fallen to darkness long ago.\nBiography.\nAs with all angels, Tyrael was borne from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;, millennia before the present day. and as with all members of the Angiris Council, embodied one of the virtues of the great titan &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; (in Tyrael's case, justice).\nThe Great Conflict.\nAs angels were of the great titan Anu and &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, so too were &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; and the great dragon &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;. As the Archangel of Justice, Tyrael participated in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, and his exploits in battle became the stuff of legend. Of all angelkind, none were more vehement against the forces of Hell, and all demons learned to shudder at Tyrael's might. Off the battlefield, he administered the &lt;a href=\"Courts%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Courts of Justice&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, he and Tyrael saved each other's lives countless times during the conflict. One such engagement was in battle against &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself. The Lord of Terror was captured, with Tyrael and &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; pointing out that holding him captive would serve their cause better than slaying the demon outright, knowing that he would return. However, &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt; carried out his own form of justice regardless, slaying the Lord of Terror.\nIn another engagement, Tyrael faced the Lord of Sin, &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;. However, a fellow angel, &lt;a href=\"Ardleon\"&gt;Ardleon&lt;/a&gt;, called for aid, and despite being poised to deliver a killing blow to the Lord of Sin, Tyrael came to his comrade's aid.\nTyrael only encountered the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20lieutenant\"&gt;Sin lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vidian\"&gt;Vidian&lt;/a&gt; once during the Eternal Conflict. On the occassion, the Heavenly Host did not recognize Vidian as a threat, and focused their attacks on his more powerful breathren. It did not take long before the angels themselves were beginning to turn on each other, and question their leaders. By the time they figured out what had happened, the battle was lost.\n&lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; served as Tyrael's lieutenant during the aeons of war, but was captured by Hell during an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; also served under him, and the two were close, regarded as being brothers among their kind. Inarius tried to make him see the futility of the conflict, but Tyrael would not be swayed. Regardless, the Great Conflict ground to a halt on its own\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; had disappeared, and the forces of Heaven and Hell could only blame each other before realizing that a third party had absconded with the artifact.\nThe Sin War.\nIn the course of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, Heaven would come to discover what Hell had already done so\u2014Sanctuary. A world created by rogue angels and demons led by &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; and Inarius. A world inhabited by the race of &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;\u2014beings descended from the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, who had been brought into the world through the coupling of angels and demons. Venturing into the world, Tyrael spirited away &lt;a href=\"Achilios\"&gt;Achilios&lt;/a&gt;, telling him that he had need of him. He forced him to target his &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; comrades including their leader &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;, seeing them as key threats and unnatural blights upon the face of Creation. Achilios managed to refuse however, surprising Tyrael. He later convinced the edyrem that Uldyssian had been possessed by &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt;. Surveying the situation, Tyrael was satisfied. Despite earlier considerations, he would not have these \"abominations\" allying with Heaven. They had to be eliminated due to the threat their inherent powers posed. And with the edyrem fragmented, Sanctuary's potential defenders would not be able to stand against his justice.\nAs such, Tyrael was among the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; who descended upon the world, meeting in battle with the Edyrem and the Demonic Hordes themselves. Uldyssian, realizing that his growing power risked the destruction of the world, sacrificed himself to end the battle, saving Sanctuary, all those he loved, and perhaps most importantly of all, his own humanity. It was an act that touched Tyrael and swayed his heart\u2014he had called these beings abominations. Yet no abomination would have made such a sacrifice as Uldyssian had.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; convened to discuss Sanctuary's fate. &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt; opted to eradicate Inarius and Lilith's progeny while &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt; voted in favor of humanity, believing that humanity's potential to serve the Light could surpass even their roles and that the Conflict might be ended for good. &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; abstained. Thus, the deciding vote would be left to Tyrael\u2014were he to side with Imperius (as everyone suspected he would), Sanctuary would be destroyed, as a tie would still result in their original goal being carried out. Tyrael however, sided with humanity. They would be left to their own devices, free to choose between Light and Dark. According to &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrael saw humanity's penchant for ruin, but also unbridled hope. Humanity could become what angels could only dream of.\nThe Age of Magic.\nThe first visual depictions of Tyrael emerged with human cultures during the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Age of Magic&lt;/a&gt;. While the memories of the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; had been erased, many tales were told of his decision to spare humanity from destruction. Depictions of him ranged widely, from crude drawings on stone walls to the most exquisite pieces of armor.\nDemonsbane.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23302\"&gt;302&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrael was present in &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt;. Having taken the disguise of a golden-haired man, he met &lt;a href=\"Siggard\"&gt;Siggard&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Night of Souls&lt;/a&gt;. Siggard, having supposedly survived the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Blackmarch\"&gt;Battle of Blackmarch&lt;/a&gt; from two days past, wanted to return to &lt;a href=\"Blackmarch\"&gt;the area&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrael pointed him northwards to his destination, but recommended that Siggard instead head south for &lt;a href=\"Entsteig%20%28City%29\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt;. Siggard nonetheless headed north.\nThe two reunited at &lt;a href=\"Brennor\"&gt;Brennor&lt;/a&gt;, which was about to come under siege by the forces of the archdemon &lt;a href=\"Assur\"&gt;Assur&lt;/a&gt;. Siggard was incredulous that Tyrael was an archangel and that those around him knew so, but as Tyrael pointed out, he'd never asked. But to answer the question of what aid he could provide, all Tyrael could offer was advice. As Assur was protected by the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Invincibility\"&gt;Glyph of Invincibility&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrael advised the fortress's defenders to focus on his army instead.\nBrennor fell, but Siggard was nonetheless able to defeat Assur in single combat, despite his glyph making it impossible for any living being to slay him. Meeting him afterwards, Tyrael revealed what Siggard had begun to suspect, that he had in fact died at Blackmarch, but his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; had not been claimed by &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrael advised him that it was unlikely that he would find rest through revenge, but an act of love might suffice. Yet for the immediate future, Siggard would be a good ally against the forces of Hell. With that, Tyrael faded away and departed.\nThe Dark Exile.\nTyrael would at times make sojourns into Sanctuary, and championed many human causes. However, greater tragedy was to come\u2014Hell had not given up on Sanctuary, believing that humanity could be swayed to their cause. This was a view not shared by the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; however, and in what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s were banished into Sanctuary. However, they were still capable of bringing woe to the mortal realm, and by the time Tyrael discovered their actions, they'd been active for decades. This concerned Tyrael greatly\u2014Sanctuary had been spared by a margin of one vote when the Angiris Council had discussed its fate. If Heaven learned that Hell was focused on Man, it might carry out what he and Imperius once, and perhaps still, intended. As such, he kept silent. He would intervene on Sanctuary's behalf, and do so alone.\nTyrael fashioned three &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s out of the Worldstone, intent on using them to seal the Prime Evils. However, he did not fully understand the soulstones' true power. Tyrael gathered a number of Mages, forming a group called the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;. For them, he forged armor in light that morphed to the wearer's expertise. Over many years, they hunted down the three Primes. &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; fell first, and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; second, though he shattered the soulstone meant for him in battle. There was not enough time to reformulate the soulstone, but with the suggestion that a mortal heart could serve as a surrogate soulstone, &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward, plunging the stone into his flesh. Tyrael assured him that his sacrifice would not be forgotten, and led the mages to a tomb beneath the sands of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Horadrim built a binding stone etched with &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s of containment. Tal Rasha ordered that he be bound to the stone, and as the other mages looked on in sorrow, Tyrael jammed the soulstone shard into Tal Rasha's heart, transferring Baal's essence into the mage's body. Sorrowfully, the Horadrim departed, leaving Tal Rasha to wrestle with Baal's writhing spirit for all eternity.\nFinally, after a decade of searching, the Horadrim confronted &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; in the lands of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. The soulstone worked and was hidden away within a labyrinthine cave system near the &lt;a href=\"River%20Talsande\"&gt;River Talsande&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrael appeared before the Horadrim one last time, commending them for having achieved a victory despite their losses. He declared that the site would have to be guarded and to this end, the Horadrim erected a &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; over the site.\nTyrael had succeeded\u2014the Primes were captured, Sanctuary still existed and Heaven was none the wiser. However, he had not counted on the Prime Evils' ability to exert their will over Men. Over time, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; would corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith and Diablo would do likewise through the archbishop &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Return of Evil.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;1263&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo escaped from his prison by corrupting the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, hence referred to as the Dark Wanderer. He headed east, seeking to free his brothers, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. Baal was first, bound to Tal Rasha's body. Tyrael appeared to stop the release and did battle with the Wanderer. However, another had traveled with the Wanderer\u2014&lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to the demon's manipulations, released the Lord of Destruction. Tyrael telepathically ordered Marius to take Baal's soulstone to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, where he would find a gateway to Hell and by extension, the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;, where the stone could be destroyed. Immediately afterwards, Tyrael was ensnared by Baal and bound to the &lt;a href=\"Binding%20Stone\"&gt;Binding Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyrael came to be freed by a group of heroes who were pursuing the Dark Wanderer. They traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; arrived first, whom he greeted. He told Cain that he had known his ancestor, &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Jered&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had been waiting to meet Jered's descendant for a long time. He told Cain about &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;, where they could destroy Mephisto's soulstone. He did not doubt that Cain would provide wise counsel to his companions, but warned the scholar that one day, he might be required to do more. That one day, he may no longer be present, and Cain would have to face the darkness alone.\nThe heroes arrived after Cain, and Tyrael guided them to face Izual and Diablo himself. He dared not help them directly, as he had been weakened by Baal and feared that direct action could lead to the High Heavens discovering the danger Sanctuary was in. The heroes prevailed however, and Diablo's soulstone was destroyed, as was the stone of Mephisto.\nMarius, however, had not been so courageous. He had failed to venture into Hell and consequently, the stone was still in his possession. Possession that switched to Baal himself, now the last Prime Evil active in Sanctuary. Baal marched on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, intending to corrupt the Worldstone and in doing so, shackle humanity to Hell's cause. To this end, Tyrael transported the heroes to &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;, but weakened as he was, could not face Baal directly.\nThe heroes came to defeat Baal, but were too late to prevent him corrupting the Worldstone. By this point, he was aware that Heaven and Hell's continual warring over the stone had 'poisoned' it, altering its original nature. After transporting the heroes to safety, Tyrael cast his sword into the stone, shattering it. The resulting explosion destroyed Tyrael's physical form and rendered Arreat and the surrounding lands a &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;barren wasteland&lt;/a&gt;. Worse still, although humanity had been saved yet again by the Archangel of Justice, the destruction of the Worldstone meant the world was open to both Heaven and Hell.\nIn the moment El'druin struck the Worldstone, some s saw a vision of Tyrael's visage before the explosion.\nWithin the Shards.\nTyrael became trapped in the Worldstone, alongside Baal's spirit. They fought in a fractured realm which reflected the Worldstone's state \u2014 shattered into shards. Tyrael tried to bind Baal and stop him from reforming, but it was a losing battle as the very realm they fought in (the Worldstone) was attuned to the demon. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;Years later&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; was able to enter a shard, using the &lt;a href=\"Husk%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Husk of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. They were just in time, as Baal had finished reforming and had defeated Tyrael. Baal collapsed the realm and escaped into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, but was defeated by the Shard-seeker. Tyrael ended up as a phantom within the Shard-seeker's mind.\nSplintered Souls.\nWith Diablo having claimed the Worldstone shard, Tyrael and the Shard-seeker travelled to the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Dreadlands\"&gt;Southern Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt; in search of &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to the High Heavens.\nThe explosion of the Worldstone dispersed Tyrael's light and harmony. Without form or shape, he spent twenty years within &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;, restoring his physical form. He returned to the Heavens and summoned El'druin to his side. The act of reformation was unprecedented, as usually angels were replaced through the Crystal Arch, a new angel embodying their aspect rather than rebirthing the original angel who was deceased. At some point after this, he advised &lt;a href=\"Urzael\"&gt;Urzael&lt;/a&gt; to search Sanctuary for the missing &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, as the Archangel of Wisdom had taken an interest in humanity prior to his disappearance.\nThe End of Days.\nThe Fallen Star.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, evil threatened Sanctuary, this time from the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;. He promised that Man would not face the coming darkness alone. The &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; however, believed that Tyrael's actions with the Worldstone had endangered all of Creation, and put him on trial. Tyrael believed that Heaven was doomed unless it could enlist humanity's aid. &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, however, was unmoved, stating that the law of Heaven prevented them from interfering with the mortal world. The two came to blows before Tyrael declared that if Heaven would not intervene on Man's behalf, he'd do so himself. \nTearing off his wings, Tyrael deliberately chose to become mortal, sacrificing his angelic essence. In doing so, Tyrael hoped to demonstrate to the High Heavens that laws could be bent for a greater good. By tearing off his wings, he intended to bring the Heavens and mankind together, to show each side the other's strenghths and weaknesses, to forge a lasting an eternal peace and an unbreakable union against the forces of darkness. He had a degree of control over the process, and as he intended to walk amongst humans, taking on their form would serve his goals. Furthermore, by becoming mortal, he would no longer be bound by his nature as an angel, as the other members of the Angiris Council were. Such an act was without precedent amongst angelkind.\nNow mortal, Tyrael fell to Sanctuary as the Fallen Star. In the descent, &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt; separated into three fragments, which fell across &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, before Tyrael himself smashed through the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. As he fell, his power left his body; a process he had no control over. This awakened the vengeful dead (those slain unjustly during the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, and sent the &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; in the hills near &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; into a frenzy, causing them to rampage through the area, killing all in their path. The journey left him weakened, but he was saved by a &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrael suffered from amnesia, and could not tell them who he was. He remembered falling, and that he had come with a warning, though could not remember the details. He was taken to &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and shown to &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. Cain was skeptical as to the claim that this stranger was the one who had fallen from the sky, stating that no man could survive such a thing. Tyrael was similarly amnesiac with Cain. Over the first few days of his now mortal life, Tyrael tried to fight his body's need for sleep, something that he'd had no need for as an angel. When exhaustion took over, he dreamt\u2014another new experience that filled him with disquiet, for while his dreams were initially wondrous, they steadily became darker. As an archangel who had watched entire generations of Men live and die, studying the forces that governed their lives, he had previously come to the conclusion that he'd learnt everything there was to know about being mortal. It was an assumption that the reality of his mortality shattered.\nTyrael's presence in New Tristram did not go unnoticed by the townsfolk; he attracted some suspicion. Some were able to piece together that he had fallen with the star.\nCain pressed the issue of what Tyrael remembered, but still amnesiac, he could only recall that he had fallen with a sword, which had broken into three pieces as he fell. The heroes departed to find the fragments. Wracking his memories, all Tyrael could remember was \"surges of light\" and \"a kind of pain.\" The heroes returned with the first piece, and informed Cain that the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; was pursuing the pieces as well. The fragment did not restore Tyrael's memory, but while he had no knowledge of the Coven, he sensed a &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;darker presence&lt;/a&gt; guiding the Coven's hand. This evil felt familiar to him, and he wondered if this greater evil was something he had come to fight.&lt;ref name = \"TheDoominWortham\"&gt;\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", \""}

And now Azmodan threatens all I hold dear once again.\nPlayer:\nIt is never wrong to save the life of an ally.\nTyrael:\nI see that now. I wish my angelic brethren felt the same.\nGuilt.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Siege of Bastion's Keep (Act III)Unlocked by A Lost Opportunity\nPlayer:\nDo you feel different now that you are mortal?\nTyrael:\nI will die, of course.\nPlayer:\nThat is not what I meant.\nTyrael:\nBut that is the difference. When you are mortal, every moment is precious. Everything matters. It is exhilarating.\nKulle's Black Soulstone.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Siege of Bastion's Keep (Act III)Unlocks The Flawed Stone\nTyrael:\nI knew Zoltun Kulle was special from the moment I met him. He had a keen mind for the arcane. During the Hunt for the Three, he was the bearer of the soulstones and must have studied them intently...\nThough it is an aberration, the Black Soulstone is a testament to his genius.\nThe Flawed Stone.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Siege of Bastion's Keep (Act III)Unlocked by Kulle's Black Soulstone\nTyrael:\nThe Black Soulstone was created to be an improvement over the original three. They were crafted to contain single demons, but Kulle intended his to hold many.\nBut the Black Soulstone is flawed and cannot contain that many demons for long. We must capture Azmodan within it and shatter it... lest all these Evils be reborn.\nHuman Knowledge.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Siege of Bastion's Keep (Act III)\nTyrael:\nOf the many things I find intriguing about humans, the greatest is their endless thirst for knowledge.\nAngels believe that everything there is to know is written in the Scroll of Fate. Therefore, curiosity is not a common angelic trait.\nIronically, my suspicions have been confirmed. Angels do not, in fact, know everything. Seeing the world through mortal eyes has given me much to ponder.\nThe Thrill of Battle.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Turning the Tide (Act III)\nTyrael:\nI am once again filled with the thrill of battle. It has been too long since I have raised my blade against the forces of the Burning Hells.\nI remember countless battles within the heart of Pandemonium, as my brethren and I risked everything to drive the demonspawn back to their hells.\nPlayer:\nThe spirits do not know of these places or these battles.\nTyrael:\nYour spirits are unaware of some glorious battles, then, my friend.\nWe waged our... Eternal Conflict since the light first broke upon creation. But now, for the first time, it feels as if its end is in sight.\nTyrael's Command.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Breached Keep (Act III)*You have to kill the 3 demons which spawn at the entrance to the keep depths, from the Bastion's Keep Stronghold first.\nTyrael:\nYou are a great warrior.\nPlayer:\nAnd your leadership has guided us all.\nTyrael:\nI do what I can. Imperius himself would have been hard pressed to hold these walls as long as these soldiers have. This world owes them a great debt.\nPlayer:\nWho is Imperius?\nTyrael:\nImperius is the archangel of Valor. It is he who commands the legions of the High Heavens.\nThe Battle of the Diamond Gates.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: The Breached Keep (Act III)\nPlayer:\nWill your eternal conflict ever end?\nTyrael:\nWe thought we had lost everything at the Fifth Battle of the Diamond Gates. The Prime Evils crashed against the very entrance of Heaven itself, but one of my most trusted lieutenants, Izual, turned them back!\nStill, the day might have been lost had the demon lords not fallen to fighting amongst themselves. So confident of their impending victory, they turned on each other over the spoils they had yet to win.\nI shudder to think what the demon lords might accomplish should they ever stop betraying one another. Such is the self-defeating nature of evil.\nThe Eternal Conflict.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Machines of War (Act III)Unlocks the Creation of the World\nPlayer:\nTell me more of this Eternal Conflict.\nTyrael:\nSince time immemorial, the forces of Heaven and Hell fought for control of the sacred Worldstone... until the day it was stolen by renegades and used to forge your world.\nSince then, the forces of Hell became more interested in corrupting mankind than in facing us on the battlefield.\nPlayer:\nThey meant to use us as weapons, didn't they?\nTyrael:\nThey knew that mankind would tip the balance of power forever. And very clearly, you have.\nThe Creation of the World.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Machines of War (Act III)Unlocked by The Eternal Conflict\nPlayer:\nI would like to hear more of the creation of our world.\nTyrael:\nTo escape the Eternal Conflict, a group of renegade angels and demons came together and created a hidden paradise for themselves. They called this world Sanctuary.\nEventually, they commingled. They gave birth to mankind. That is why you have both good and evil within you... and the power of both realms as your birthright.\nThe power of your nephalem ancestors was so terrifying to their parents that they tuned the Worldstone to weaken them. They knew they had loosed something... unimaginable upon creation.\nHeavens Fall.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)*Remember, he is at The Diamond Gates at this point.\nTyrael:\nWe are lost. Diablo is too powerful. Always before, the Lords of Hell bickered and worked against each other. They undid themselves.\nWithin Diablo, within the Prime, there is no such division, and now the halls of the High Heavens quake beneath his steps.\nAdria's Treachery.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)*Remember, he is at The Diamond Gates at this point.\nTyrael:\nThe Prime Evil... I can't believe all this has come to pass. Adria played us all for fools.\nDiablo's influence twisted her inside and out. I suspect we have not seen the last of her.\nThe Dark Wanderer.\nAvailable at the start of the Quest: Fall of the High Heavens (Act IV)*Remember, he is at The Diamond Gates at this point.\nTyrael:\nI should have known that Leah's father was the Wanderer! How could I not have sense Diablo's foul presence within her?\nPlayer:\nAdria is a true monster. She sacrificed her own daughter to resurrect Diablo.\nTyrael:\nBut poor Leah... I grieve for her soul.\nPlayer:\nThere is nothing worse than what was done to Leah, but we cannot mourn her now. Diablo must be stopped.\nThe High Heavens.\nAvailable during the Quest: Prime Evil (Act IV)*Jump to Enter The Crystal Arch, he will be at The Pinnacle of Heaven\nPlayer:\nTell me more of the Crystal Arch. You've said that it is the heart of Heaven.\nTyrael:\nIt is older than time itself, and over the eons this shining realm took shape around it. It thrums with living light and sound that courses through the very fabric of the Silver City.\nPlayer:\nIt is from this arch that the angels are born?\nTyrael:\nYes. Like musical notes in a grand chorus, angels are the manifestation of the Arch's intrinsic harmony. The purest expressions of this harmony were my brethren, the archangels.\nPlayer:\nI do not sense this harmony you speak of. It is long broken, is it not?\nTyrael:\nYes. But Hope has returned. And as you mortals are fond of saying, it is not over yet.\nLeah's Spirit.\nAvailable during the Quest: Prime Evil (Act IV)*Jump to Enter The Crytal Arch, he will be at The Pinnacle of Heaven\nTyrael:\nI fear that if we defeat Diablo, Leah's innocent spirit will die with him...\nPlayer:\nThe spirits say that Leah cannot reach Mbwiru Eikura in this place. Diablo has corrupted everything.\nMalthael.\nAvailable during the Quest: Prime Evil (Act IV)*Jump to Enter The Crytal Arch, he will be at The Pinnacle of Heaven\nPlayer:\nI wish to know, if it was Auriel and you who voted to spare mankind, which angels voted against us?\nTyrael:\nImperius. Malthael abstained, but it was counted against you.\nPlayer:\nMalthael abstained? Was it out of cowardice?\nTyrael:\nHe was no coward. He was Wisdom itself... until his disappearance. The Angiris Council has been... broken ever since.\nMalthael's Fate.\nAvailable during the Quest: Prime Evil (Act IV)*Jump to Enter The Crytal Arch, he will be at The Pinnacle of Heaven\nPlayer:\nWhat became of Malthael?\nTyrael:\nLong ago, when Inarius and his ilk stole the Worldstone to create Sanctuary, Malthael became consumed with discovering its whereabouts.\nAs the archangel of Wisdom, he was tortured by his inability to recover the sacred artifact.\nPlayer:\nWhere is he now?\nTyrael:\nSome say he haunts the silent halls of Pandemonium, forever seeking answers to the unknowable mysteries of life and death.\nThe Prime Evil.\nAvailable during the Quest: Prime Evil (Act IV)*Jump to Enter The Crytal Arch, he will be at The Pinnacle of Heaven\nPlayer:\nWhat do you speak of when you say the Prime Evil?\nTyrael:\nIt is the sum total of all seven Evils housed within one body. There is an ancient legend, known only to a few, of the great Dragon, Tathamet, who was the original embodiment of evil.\nThe legend says that he was ripped apart during an epic battle with Anu, and that the Burning Hells are composed of his remains.\nPlayer:\nWho is Anu?\nTyrael:\nJust as Tathamet was the ultimate evil, Anu was the ultimate good. It is said by some that the Crystal Arch is all that remains of this great warrior.\nPlayer:\nThen Diablo seeks to become the Dragon once again?\nTyrael:\nIn a manner of speaking, yes."}

His actions saved &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; from being destroyed and touched &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;'s heart as well as changing his view of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s being abominations.\nBiography.\nBirthright.\nUldyssian used to be a simple farmer, tending to his farm on the outskirts of the hamlet &lt;a href=\"Seram\"&gt;Seram&lt;/a&gt;. He was accustomed to the hardships of farm life - virtually his entire family was wiped out by a plague, including his parents and several of his siblings. Only Uldyssian and his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; survived. This left Uldyssian embittered, especially towards the two greatest cults who, despite their promises, could do nothing to save his family. Therefore Uldyssian regarded emissaries of both the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; with hostility.\nOne day when Uldyssian was in Seram, two travelling missionaries, one belonging to the Cathedral of Light and one belonging to Temple of Triune were found brutally murdered. While Uldyssian had nothing to do with it, one of the victims was found with Uldyssian's knife lodged within his ribcage. Uldyssian was charged with murder and put into prison. Somewhere prior to the discovery of the two murder-victims, Uldyssian had met the hauntingly beautiful noblewoman &lt;a href=\"Lylia\"&gt;Lylia&lt;/a&gt;. Lylia had fled from the city of &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt; after her family had been stripped of its power and wealth by the Cathedral and the Triune. Though many of her family were thrown in Kehjan's dungeons, Lylia managed to escape. Uldyissian, infatuated by Lylia's appearance, promises to help her.\nDuring his time in prison, his strange powers manifested themselves for the first time as his cell's door spontaneously unlocks by itself.\nLater, a party from the Cathedral of Light arrived to oversee the trial. When the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Inquisitor\"&gt;Master Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; was about to declare Uldyssian guilty for the two murders, a bolt of lightning conveniently struck the Inquisitor and killed him. As a vicious storm quickly gathered, Uldyssian and Lylia managed to escape amidst the chaos. During their flight, Lylia badly sprained her ankle; however, it mysteriously heals as Uldyssian placed his hands over the bruises. Unconvinced it was his power that healed Lylia, Uldyssian tried to invoke his so-called powers to subdue the storm over Seram. Much to his astonishment, the storm dissipated.\nTo the townspeople, this proved Uldyssian's guilt at being a murderer and so everyone - even his lifetime friends in the village - rejected him from their lives. Uldyssian and his friends - &lt;a href=\"Serenthia\"&gt;Serenthia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Achilios\"&gt;Achilios&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; - fled town. Lylia convinced Uldyssian to use his powers to bring down both the Cathedral and the Triune, restoring free will to humanity. During their travel to Kehjan, Uldyssian and friends had a hostile encounter with the &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt;, whom they forced to retreat. After the battle, Uldyssian's party ended up in the large town of &lt;a href=\"Partha\"&gt;Partha&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his stay in Partha Uldyssian revealed to the local townsfolk the potential of raw &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; within all of Man. However, he also discovered that Lylia was only a disguise of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; and that she claimed that she was responsible not only for what happened in Seram but also all the display of power that Uldyssian had shown so far.\nWith her mentally mocking and abusing him before leaving him to his fate, she proclaimed just what he would be without her, and left him seemingly powerless. With his confidence in his abilities utterly shattered, the shamed farmer was eventually found by his friends. The party then decided to head out towards the &lt;a href=\"Torajan%20Jungles\"&gt;Torajan Jungles&lt;/a&gt; where they could lay low. After making camp within the jungle, Uldyssian stumbled upon a large group of Parthans who followed him. Aghast, Uldyssian fled into the wilderness, only to bump into &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nDuring the showdown with Lucion, Uldyssian rediscovered his own powers (with no reasonable explanation). With ease, the farmer dispatched the demon, but his good friend Achilios was slain. Re-convinced that the power of the nephalem was their birthright, Uldyssian and his followers headed out for the city of &lt;a href=\"Toraja\"&gt;Toraja&lt;/a&gt;, where they intended to raise an army in order to bring down both the Triune and the Cathedral.\nScales of the Serpent.\nShortly after reaching Toraja, the Triune turned against both Uldyssian's followers and the city itself, prompting the nephalem to storm the temple. The temple and its clergy were decimated, but Uldyssian did not manage to destroy the demoness Lilith, who escaped. Still, after leaving Toraja behind, the Edyrem's ranks expanded greatly. After the Edyrem left Toraja they passed by a temple within the jungles. In the jungles, there was an unnameable beast which Mendeln described as a being that has stayed between life and death because of grief and anger, during the process the beast tried to capture Serenthia but was only able to knock her unconscious leaving another trace of guilt in Uldyssian for not being able to protect her. After Serenthia was saved she seemed to have an odd power around her but Uldyssian paid it no mind, but after she was saved Mendeln went missing and the Edyrem had to move on without him.\nThe Veiled Prophet.\nIn the aftermath of the Triune's fall, Uldyssian and Edyrem set about clearing up its remnants and also setting their sight on the Cathedral of Light. Eventually, he and Inarius met in battle, but it was interrupted with the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt;. Angels, having learnt of Sanctuary's existence, were determined to eradicate the \"abomination\" that was humanity. In turn, the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; emerged as well. Thus resulted in what would be the last battle of the Sin War, as angels, demons, and the Edyrem met in a three-way battle. In it, Uldyssian unleashed the whole of his power, driving the forces of Heaven and Hell back to their domains. However, he realized that the power that he and the Edyrem possessed was tearing Sanctuary apart. It was too much, gained too quickly. He feared that he was losing himself, that his nephalem birthright was consuming his humanity.\nAt that moment, Uldyssian realized the potential for humanity's nephalem powers to do the same as what they had done to him. As such, in a final act, Uldyssian withdrew his nephalem energies back into himself. Choosing humanity over godhood, Uldyssian's energies were released one last time, negating his very being.\nLegacy.\nIt is suggested in the \"&lt;a href=\"Books%20of%20Kalan\"&gt;Books of Kalan&lt;/a&gt;\" that Uldyssian's release of energy flooded the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, resetting it, and stripping the Edyrem of their powers. More notably, his act of sacrifice saved humanity in more ways than one, as the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; met to decide the fate of humankind. Moved by Uldyssian's act of self-sacrifice, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; cast the deciding vote for humanity's continued existence instead of destroying it.\nAs the Edyrem's memories were removed as a condition of the pact made between Heaven and Hell to allow Sanctuary's continued existence, Uldyssian's actions were mostly forgotten, and it was believed that he had succumbed to a second plague. Mendeln did remember, and he recorded what he could in the \"Books of Kalan\".\nUldyssian became a figure of myth in some cultures/areas of Sanctuary. Since the end of the Sin War, various &lt;a href=\"mystic%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;mystics&lt;/a&gt; have witnessed what &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; theorized as an echo of Uldyssian's sacrifice. He believed that his act echoed on a psychic plane, and could be seen by those in deep meditation. He theorized that it was this echo that inspired &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt; to preach &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakara&lt;/a&gt;, and not &lt;a href=\"Yaerius\"&gt;Yaerius&lt;/a&gt; as the ascetic believed.\nPersonality and Traits.\nUldyssian was one of the most powerful nephalem who ever lived, his powers only equaled by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. While initially devout, after the death of his family, he adopted a more atheistic worldview, believing only what his eyes could show him. To his pride, he was able to read and write (a rarity for Ascenians), but only saw the practical aspects of such things."}

The ferocity of her unrelenting attacks was often compared to that of a lion.\nBiography.\nFaith and Exile.\nUliana was the first Monk of Ivgorod to venture out amongst the laymen while retaining her status. In her time, Monks were forbidden to leave the monasteries, with their forms being used solely to commune with the gods. While traveling in &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, her beliefs were forever altered when she was attacked on the road by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s; beings she believed to be agents of the gods of chaos, if not the gods themselves. She had never imagined beings of such horror could actually exist. After her encounter with the creatures, Uliana became obsessed with defeating the gods of chaos, and, to this end, began adapting the forms of the Veradani towards the martial style every Monk is familiar with today.\nUliana\u2019s passion to defeat the gods of chaos drew the ire of the &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt;, for a Monk was to seek balance in all things. Furthermore, she questioned the orthodoxy that the gods were actual beings, asking if they might not instead be metaphors to guide the Monks' spiritual development. For her temerity, she was ordered to wander &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt; and seek repentance. However, she was unable to view her exile as punishment, as she firmly believed the monks\u2019 true calling was to inspire the masses, not lock themselves away. She disappeared shortly after her excommunication, never to be seen again, swearing to eradicate all agents of chaos for the good of all mankind. A &lt;a href=\"Binding%20of%20the%20Lost\"&gt;belt&lt;/a&gt; was all that was ever found of her after her disappearance.\nLegacy.\nUliana's story was recorded in \"&lt;a href=\"Histories%20of%20the%20Veradani\"&gt;Histories of the Veradani&lt;/a&gt;\".. The martial style she developed continues to be used by the Monks of Ivgorod.\nIn-game.\nUliana is the lore-basis of the &lt;a href=\"Uliana%27s%20Stratagem\"&gt;Uliana's Stratagem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item%20set\"&gt;item set&lt;/a&gt;.

However, through contact with the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zagraal\"&gt;Zagraal&lt;/a&gt;, these five clans would become the &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;. They became furious marauders, driven to raid villages and caravans to sate their bloodlust and procure sacrificial victims for their demonic master. After years of this terror, the Umbaru of the lower Tengaze sent their &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; warriors to eradicate the khazra's threat to the region. Filled with otherworldly power, the Witch Doctors cut a swath of destruction through the khazra until they confronted Zagraal himself. In a now-legendary battle, the valiant heroes fought to the last man before finally bringing Zagraal down. The khazra as a race survived, but without a master, became weak and purposeless.\nAside from this, few outsiders have had contact with the Umbaru, though &lt;a href=\"Abner%20Lockridge\"&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;exist&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrently the Umbaru are in a state of upheaval due to their most recent tribal war. In this period, a &lt;a href=\"Nazeebo\"&gt;heretic Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hills%20Tribe\"&gt;Five Hills Tribe&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the elder priests had succumbed to corruption. The heretic was banished, but his words remained. It was later discovered that the tribal warfare orchestrated by the elders was unnecessary, a game to allow them to remain in power. The Witch Doctor &lt;a href=\"Benu\"&gt;Benu&lt;/a&gt;, achieving spirithood, resolved to open his people's eyes to the truth.\nCulture.\nThe Umbaru are a hunter-gatherer society (though also practice at least some agriculture) and are ruled by high priests. The high priests may take wives, who are held in high esteem, and rarely leave their huts, even in ceremony. The tribes engage in ritualistic warfare in which prisoners willingly submit themselves as sacrifices to honor the spirits of the rainforest. Only those taken in battle are considered worthy of ritual sacrifice. After such sacrifice, the victim's body is eviscarated, and its organs removed and placed in jars. The Umbaru's overriding belief is that the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt; is merely a curtain that veils a true reality called the &lt;a href=\"Mbwiru%20Eikura\"&gt;Mbwiru Eikura&lt;/a&gt;, a realm commonly referred to as the \"Unformed Land.\" The Umbaru Witch Doctors are able to see and experience this realm. In truth, the Unformed Land is open to all, and the tribal sacrifices are unnecessary. It is a truth that at least two Witch Doctors preach/have preached.\nUmbaru culture is very different to those that lie westward. They believe in concepts such as honor and heroism, but what may constitute these traits does not necessarily align with the beliefs of other cultures. Aside from the Unformed Land, the most sacred belief of Umbaru culture is their philosophy of self-sacrifice and non-individuality, of suppressing one's self-interest for the good of the tribe.\nCannibalism in Umbaru culture is regarded as an \"unthinkable\" action, and those who partake in such an act (according to their beliefs) are denied entrance to the Unformed Land.\nUmbaru utilize poison darts. This poison is derived from palms located at Lake Ymirson, located on the edge of the Torajan Jungles.\nLanguage.\nThe Umbaru possess a separate language from the other peoples of Sanctuary. The following is a list of terms/phrases/ from their language:\nIn-game.\nThe Witch Doctor class of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" is of the Umbaru."}

The rotting bodies join together hideously to form a large hulking creature which crawls out of its grave and is said to \"feed on human suffering.\"\nTheir sickly gray skins are spotted with even sicklier human heads, or what had been human heads when they were alive, complete with fangs. Their hands, devoid of fingers, arms and their backside are laden with brutal spikes. These spikes are shards of stone ripped from the earth during the development of the creature. They stand on very disproportionally short legs, which gives them a heavy stomping gait. Their spines also feature short but wicked spikes.\n\"Something is dreadfully wrong. Fear is in the air; I can feel it. I was but days out of Tristram when I saw a screaming ball of flame rip across the sky. Surely enough, soon after witnessing this harbinger of doom, I stumbled upon a badly mangled traveler. He was barely able to spit out the tale of the cursed monstrosity responsible for his broken body as his life drifted away. He called his killer \"the unburied\".Months ago, when I wrote of the undead blight upon our land, I thought them the gravest of threats. But they are nothing compared to the new undead creature described to me by this poor fellow.He was a law officer of sorts, a local guard out looking into the depraved handiwork of a crazed individual, the sort we seem to be seeing more and more of in these dark days. When the guard happened upon a mass grave dug by this sick fool, a massive, horned, disgusting behemoth was digging itself out. The dying traveler described this loathsome beast \u2013 or, as he termed it, the unburied \u2013 as being comprised of bloated parts from many fetid, rotting corpses, with a multitude of disfigured heads and slobbering fanged mouths. He was fortunate that day, but when he returned with several men to help him deal with the creature, they found to their horror that the undead spawn was too much for even their combined efforts. They fought valiantly to the last man, sacrificing themselves to keep the beast from rampaging across the countryside and taking who knows how many innocent lives. He was the last survivor, and before he passed on, he proudly told me that they were successful in eradicating the foul unburied creature.Being born out of pits of human misery, these beings feed on human suffering. Wherever bodies are dumped together unceremoniously, the unburied may rise. I cannot help but wonder if this be some sort of cosmic justice for our inhumanity to our fellow man. But what is the catalyst? What animates these things? What makes them so horrendously different from the run-of-the-mill zombies or \"normal\" skeletal undead?Some days I truly feel that the end of humanity must be at hand. Certainly our world is home to assorted disturbing and unsettling creatures, but every dawn seems to bring news of more wretchedness we must endure as a people. The darkness is coming, my friends: mark my words.\" - Abd al-Hazir\nIn-game.\nUnburied are encountered fairly early in the game, and can be considered one of the toughest opponents of this part of the game. They can take a beating and hit like trucks. It is not uncommon to encounter multiple Unburied at the same time. In return, they move and attack very slowly. Despite their sheer size, they are not immune to &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Manglemaw\"&gt;first encounter&lt;/a&gt; with the Unburied occurs in Chancellor Eamon's tomb, and it is tagged as 'the Horror of the Crypt'.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", they are encountered in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Cyrangar\"&gt;Castle Cyrangar&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips and Additional Information.\nUnburied hit hard and can take a lot of damage, so use snare or disorienting abilities to keep them from attacking. If there are multiple Unburied, try and lure them away or separate them.\nWatch out for their knockback attack as it might force you into a corner or in the middle of another pack of foes."}

Of most, undead thirst for what they are deprived of: feeling.\nIt is believed that it was Mephisto who originally installed hatred in the undead. Now they eternally seek vengeance upon the living, imbued with a hatred that defies understanding. The undead loathe the living, and seek only to consume warm flesh and &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;.

Until identified, these properties will have no effect.\nDiablo I.\nIn the original \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\",\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0items all drop in their unidentified state called Not Identified. The player\u00a0identified items by using a &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Scroll of Identify&lt;/a&gt;, paying &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, or using the &lt;a href=\"Identify\"&gt;Identify&lt;/a&gt; skill (&lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt; only).\nUnidentified items could be equipped in their unidentified form to provide the stats of their base item. In some cases, this was actually better, as there were negative effects on some items that made identifying the items worse.\nItems offered by &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt; were not technically unidentified, but considering you had to pay 50 coins before you were allowed to see them (not knowing anything, including the item type, in advance), they might as well have been.\nDiablo II.\n In \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\",\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt;, and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0items all drop in their unidentified state.\u00a0The player also had Scrolls of Identify, that could be (for the purpose of saving space in bags) stacked into a single &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Tome of Identify&lt;/a&gt;. If they completed the quest themselves, Deckard Cain would from then on identify all items in your inventory free of charge, including anything they had stashed in the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;. If they did not complete the quest, Deckard Cain is rescued by the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt; and will charge the player for identifying their items, just like the first game.\nUnlike the first \"Diablo\", unidentified items cannot be equipped. However, magic Items can no longer have negative effects except for some unique like &lt;a href=\"Veil%20of%20Steel%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Veil of Steel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andariel%27s%20Visage%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Andariel's Visage&lt;/a&gt;, so there is never a risk involved by identifying them.\nWhile unidentified items are supposed to have unknown effects, due to the fact that unique and set items are colored differently, it is sometimes possible to know what a certain item is without needing to get it identified. Because of this, the player can choose to not identify an item if they do not plan to use it. The selling price of identified item is, nearly always, covering the identification expenses.\n&lt;a href=\"Gamble\"&gt;Gambling&lt;/a&gt; was a new generation of Wirt's hidden deals. Gambled items are unidentified (not even their quality is known, all items appear to be magic) until the player purchases them, at which point they are automatically identified when they enter the inventory.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", items can be identified by right clicking them, or by using the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Cain%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Book of Cain&lt;/a&gt;, with a 5 second cast time. There is no need to pay any fee, or buy any reagents for that. During a brief period of the campaign, Deckard Cain can identify items for you as well (effect is exactly the same as if his book was used). Only\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0items need to be identified: before that, they cannot be equipped, sold, &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrified&lt;/a&gt; or used for transmogrification. Unidentified items can be salvaged, however.\nBefore patch 2.0., rare items were required to be identified as well. However, players complained that it was only wasting time, so this was removed from the game.\nItems in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kadala\"&gt;Kadala's&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0shop are sold unidentified (only the item type is known), but can be of any quality from &lt;a href=\"Normal%20Items\"&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Set\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt;.

There is usually only one Unique item for every type of weapon and armor in the game. Unique items are denoted by their names being colored gold. &lt;a href=\"Set\"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt; Items are different from Unique ones, but very similar to them in terms of how they work and rarity.\nUnique Item Appearance Limit.\nIn earlier versions of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", if any player in a game had a certain Unique item in their possession, the game would not generate another of it. However, this limitation was revised with one of the patches to the game. It is now possible for the game to generate a Unique item even if someone in the game has it already. But it will not appear more than once in a single play.\nNote that items are actually generated during &lt;a href=\"Gamble\"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt;, even if you do not buy them. This means that if a unique appeared in the gambling window, it will not be dropped by enemies until you start a new session. Therefore, it may be advisable to restart your game after spending a significant amount of time gambling.\nLevel Requirements.\nIn Classic \"Diablo II\", Unique items have no experience level requirements. In \"\", these items do have determined level requirements, to prevent players from having characters with low levels, but high stats. Also, &lt;a href=\"Exceptional%20Items\"&gt;Exceptional&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Items\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; Uniques each have higher level requirements than their &lt;a href=\"Normal%20Items\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt; counterparts. Exceptional and Elite Uniques do not appear in Classic \"Diablo II\".\nElite Uniques.\nElite Unique items are somewhat sparse. There are weapon and armor classes that don't have a Unique for every type. For instance, there is no Unique &lt;a href=\"Hydra%20Edge\"&gt;Hydra Edge&lt;/a&gt; (Elite ) or (Elite ). However, there are classes of equipment that actually have \"two\" Unique items of the \"same\" type. There are two Unique &lt;a href=\"Phase%20Blade\"&gt;Phase Blade&lt;/a&gt;s (Elite &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sword\"&gt;Crystal Sword&lt;/a&gt;); and . There are two Unique s (Elite ); &lt;a href=\"Horizon%27s%20Tornado\"&gt;Horizon's Tornado&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormlash\"&gt;Stormlash&lt;/a&gt;. There are even two Unique &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Maul\"&gt;Thunder Maul&lt;/a&gt;s (Elite ); and &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shifter\"&gt;Earth Shifter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reason for some of these instances of two Unique Elite items of the same type is because early in the release of Lord of Destruction, Blizzard added Unique Elite weapons and armor that were based on the most famous Unique items in the original \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", such as maul, bow, and two-handed sword. Later on, new Elite Unique items were added, and a few of them were of the same types as the returning items from \"Diablo I\".\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Unique items are replaced with &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; items, with only &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Breath\"&gt;Death's Breath&lt;/a&gt; having a unique (teal) level of quality, indicating its special reagent status.\nDiablo IV.\nUnique Items return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". They've been described as \"super-charged\" versions of Legendaries, and only drop at &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; onward. They are exceptionally rare, and are designed as \"pinnacle items\" for specific builds. They cannot be &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;d, nor can their essences be extracted. In \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Malignant\"&gt;Season of the Malignant&lt;/a&gt;\", a variant called \"Uber Uniques\" was added. As of Season 4, Uniques will drop in world tiers 1 and 2, and Uber uniques will be able to be dropped from &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s at level +55."}

While Champions are a group of equally powerful monsters, Uniques are single empowered creatures, and are sometimes accompanied by weaker &lt;a href=\"minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt;s to form an \"elite pack\". Depending on the game, Unique Monsters may have some randomized attributes or spawn patterns, or may have pre-designed properties. &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt; are a name for the pre-designed variety in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" (and for some of them in \"Diablo III\", informally), while the completely randomized type are called &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Monsters\"&gt;Rare Monsters&lt;/a&gt; in \"Diablo III\".\nDiablo.\nThe Unique Monsters of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" were created by hand and are always the same in every aspect, although their placement within the game's levels is random. The first game doesn't have the randomized variety of Unique or Champion monsters found in later games, so they are essentially the same as &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Unique Monsters are monsters that are stronger with random name generation, colors and semi-random magical bonuses, nearly always followed by &lt;a href=\"minions\"&gt;minions&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the Unique monsters you find will be randomly spawned throughout the game, apart of some specific spots that always have a random Unique. However, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; monsters will always spawn in every game and in the same location. Their name is always highlighted in golden color, and they always have 3-6 minions. They have one bonus on &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt;, two on &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and Three on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. Their bonuses are applied from left to right. They have these possible colors upon being generated (numbers of color palettes in the files):\n(Note that 30-37 are unused by the game because of a bug introduced in . An unintentional change in randtransform.dat file from D2Client.dll makes it so the game skips the last 7 color palettes when generating monsters, explaining why you don't see random purple Uniques, or that the purple colors of some super-uniques were changed to other colors in expansion, and there is also the consequence of &lt;a href=\"Pitspawn%20Fouldog\"&gt;Pitspawn Fouldog&lt;/a&gt; (31), &lt;a href=\"Stormtree\"&gt;Stormtree&lt;/a&gt; (35), &lt;a href=\"Battlemaid%20Sarina\"&gt;Battlemaid Sarina&lt;/a&gt; (36), &lt;a href=\"Dac%20Farren\"&gt;Dac Farren&lt;/a&gt; (36), using default colors of their monster types. Also, there are monsters that don't have a palette file, so they can't use the random unique palettes. These are: &lt;a href=\"Fetish%20Blowdart%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fetish Blowdarts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mosquito%20Demon\"&gt;Mosquito Demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Beast\"&gt;Siege Beast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Horror\"&gt;Frozen Horror&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Abominable\"&gt;Abominable&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Reanimated%20Horde\"&gt;Reanimated Horde&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Putrid%20Defiler\"&gt;Putrid Defiler&lt;/a&gt;s have a palette file, but are specified in the files not to use random colors).\nAll Uniques always have these properties:\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Unique Monsters are called &lt;a href=\"Rare%20monsters\"&gt;Rare monsters&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nThe 'Unique' category is reserved for special monsters that usually spawn for quests, events or just rarely in the same location, being similar to \"Diablo II\" Super-Uniques. Their names are colored in purple, and instead of listing affixes beneath the name, almost all of them have a title.\nSuper-Unique monsters are not officially making a return in \"Diablo III\". However, some Unique monsters spawn in every game, including all &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;:\u00a0aside from the encounters vital to the game's storyline, some of them are certainly present every time players log in. These Uniques can be considered Super Uniques for that reason.\nLike Champions and Rares, non-boss Uniques have &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;affix skills&lt;/a&gt; (and sometimes even their own special abilities), but they always have a fixed set of 1 to 4 affixes regardless of the player's level, even if those affixes are not allowed for that level. Some monsters may even have affix combinations normally not allowed, such as Plagued + Desecrator. Their affixes deal more damage than those of Rare and Champion monsters on same difficulty, and they generally have considerably more &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn very rare cases, Unique monsters may have extra skills, such as triple attack speed or additional &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage\"&gt;elemental damage&lt;/a&gt;, that are not available through affixes. Some of them can have random affixes as well.\nWhile Unique Monsters have access to Missile Dampening affix, they will never spawn with Avenger, Health Link, Horde and Fire Chains.

They have massively increased health; shown by multiple &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; bars (up to four) stacked in front of each other. &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal%20quests\"&gt;Core quests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; bosses have health bars, wanted enemies and &lt;a href=\"hidden%20lair\"&gt;hidden lair&lt;/a&gt; bosses have , &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal%20Side%20Quests\"&gt;side quest&lt;/a&gt; bosses have .\nThey also deal greater damage than common monsters. With each health bar that is depleted, the monster drops &lt;a href=\"health%20globe\"&gt;health globe&lt;/a&gt;s. Loot is dropped only after the monster is killed.\nUnique monsters almost always have affixes attached to their name. In addition to that, they have a title that is shown below their health bar. They can have up to three &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;monster traits&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other elite monsters, the traits are not shown below their health bars and are meant to act as a surprise.\nAll unique monsters are \"\"immune to &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt;\"\" and \"teleport\" &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;traits&lt;/a&gt;, though they still receive damage from status effects.

The exact damage taken is determined by the defenses of the character actually hit, so those taking damage through the link do not benefit from their own protections.

However, hits the other characters take still get transferred to the immune character in the usual proportion, where that damage is immediately cancelled, acting as overall &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; for every hit.\nWhen Unity is used by both the player and a &lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;Follower&lt;/a&gt; with the Legendary follower item that prevents them from dying (, or ), it effectively doubles the player's own &lt;a href=\"Toughness\"&gt;Toughness&lt;/a&gt;, on par with other endgame Damage Reduction powers.

The , together with the &lt;a href=\"Waning%20Sentinel\"&gt;Waning Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; circles opposed the pact but the Nightgrant, empowered by their masters silenced them. After a long battle in which many of them were killed by &lt;a href=\"Catarag%20the%20Strangling%20Sun\"&gt;Catarag&lt;/a&gt;, the Untameable Wilds were victorious.

In this they were aided by the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;Zayl&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Story of Ureh.\nThe Golden City of Ureh, one of the greatest cities in all of Sanctuary, ruled by the judicious and pious &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Khan\"&gt;Juris Khan&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known political figurehead in the region. The people were among the finest, most civilized and culturally advanced for their time. Such was and masters in every field to bask in its glory. But, for all its prosperity, it came under the evil gaze of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Lord of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, for the people of Ureh did not fear anything let alone be terrorized.\nDiablo laid siege to the city in his trademark fashion - corrupting it from within. Although the innocent inhabitants of the city were unaware of what transpired, the city's powerful sorcerers, both indigenous and foreign erected unbreachable barriers that prevented Diablo's influence from spreading within. This caused Diablo to change his tactics; he started corrupting the local flora and fauna, using them as pawns to weaken the barriers that withheld his influence from spreading. But these weak machinations were no match for the arcane powers of Ureh's united sorcerers, bent on protecting the city at all costs. But the people started to suffer, the city was surrounded, supplies stopped.\nIt was then that Juris Khan had the vision of the &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Mirakodus&lt;/a&gt;, who told him the will of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, that the people of Ureh had not been overlooked by the Heavens and that their fight against Diablo and his fiends was soon to be over. The city of Ureh was granted a place in the ultimate sanctuary any mortal could desire, the ethereal planes of the High Heavens themselves. But, Mirakodus laid down a strenuous condition - the way to Heaven was open, but it was Ureh's job to find it.\nJuris Khan, a powerful sorcerer himself, consulted with his advisors, and eventually his people regarding the new events. He initiated his daughter &lt;a href=\"Atanna\"&gt;Atanna&lt;/a&gt; to see the visions that he had seen. The initial joy that was prevalent was soon replaced by the nerve-wracking search for the way to Heaven, the perfect spell that could transform Ureh into paradise. Mirakodus assisted Juris Khan and his compatriots in their search, and eventually, they found a way.\nNo stone was left unturned in what was to be done. Juris Khan, and his close aides &lt;a href=\"Father%20Tobio\"&gt;Father Tobio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gregus%20Mazi\"&gt;Gregus Mazi&lt;/a&gt; at his side started summoning the portal that would lead them to salvation. But then...\nThe ultimate betrayal was done. Gregus Mazi was allied with Diablo all this time, he sabotaged the spell, causing it to reverse and lead them to not the High Heavens, but the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; themselves. The sudden change in the spell's configuration caused the spell to drain the life-force of all who cast it, so Gregus Mazi teleported himself outside the city, letting the inhabitants in the city fend for themselves. Juris Khan tried to realign the spell, but the damage was done. The reversing of the spell along with its subsequent realignment caused Ureh to be transported to neither Hell nor Heaven, but in a limbo between the extreme planes. But no one outside the city knew of what actually happened on the fateful day, except Gregus Mazi.\nEventually, Gregus returned to his home-city in order to have his fair share of the prize. He was captured and killed in a way that even the pious Juris Khan regrets uptill now.\nThis was narrated by the Lord of Ureh himself, Juris Khan, when &lt;a href=\"Quov%20Tsin\"&gt;Quov Tsin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kentril%20Dumon\"&gt;Kentril Dumon&lt;/a&gt; and his mercenaries reached his palace.\nThe Real Story of Ureh.\nIt seems, as said by Juris Khan himself, that legends are not always what they seem to be, for while the rest of Sanctuary believed Ureh to have \"ascended\", it had actually found itself between the mortal and immortal planes, neither living nor dead. The events that unfolded were not spoken of by any mortal. That is why, it did not take an immortal Juris Khan to brainwash Kentril and his comrades about the aforementioned \"real\" story of Ureh. What actually transpired is as follows.\nDiablo had a far more diabolical plan. He disguised himself as the Archangel Mirakodus and corrupted Juris Khan and Atanna with his visions, a captivating thought for any mortal. Eventually, both father and daughter became living vessels of the Lord of Terror, with the Lord Khan actually becoming an embodiment of Diablo, subverted by his will.\nThe portal spell was never supposed to grant Ureh passage to Heaven, but to Hell, so that the Prime Evils could use the open portal as a means to send the &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Legion\"&gt;Demonic Legion&lt;/a&gt; through to invade Sanctuary.\nGregus Mazi was never the traitor he was made out to be. He was the only one who found out the Lord Khan's association with the Dark Lord of Terror, and his reconfiguration of the spell led the city to its intended purpose, towards Heaven, but still draining the life out of the caster. He did not teleport outside the city, but was teleported by Juris Khan, who in his frenzy had all his fellow sorcerers with him.\nGregus Mazi's return to Ureh was to set things right, to destroy the evil that had crept over the Light of Lights. This time, he was not alone however, as &lt;a href=\"Father%20Tobio\"&gt;Father Tobio&lt;/a&gt; assisted him seeing the madness gripping the Lord Khan and his followers. But they were both captured. Father Tobio was killed, and Gregus was turned into a part of the mountain Nymyr so that he may watch over Ureh as a reluctant guardian.\nIn-game.\nUreh was seen in the cinematic reveal trailer for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" and was originally intended to appear in the game. However, it was cut as it did not seem to \"fit in.\"\nPart of Ureh appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". In Hawezar, there is a small zone called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20City%20of%20Ureh\"&gt;The Lost City of Ureh&lt;/a&gt;.\" While it can be reached in-game, apart from what seems to be the approach roads from both east and west, as well as the overgrown entrance to it, not much else is visible."}

After his master's disappearance from the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, he spent years pleading for the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; to allow him to search for his master. Eventually the Council agreed to his request. He was accompanied by a sect of &lt;a href=\"Death%20Maiden\"&gt;angelic maidens&lt;/a&gt; who were Malthael's closest followers. Urzael swore not to rest until he found his master, for he believed that Malthael's presence was sorely needed in Heaven. As Malthael had taken a growing interest in &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity prior to his disappearance, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; suggested that Urzael begin his search on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nSearching the mortal realm, Urzael did not find his master, but he did find humans\u2014far too many for his liking. He saw how they murdered and cheated one another while turning a blind eye to the unfortunate. While humanity had the capacity to choose between good and evil, Urzael noted that they overwhelmingly chose the latter option. Urzael became disgusted with &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;, and believed that if they should ever unlock their &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; birthright, the Heavens would be doomed.\nEventually, Urzael found Malthael, and was not surprised to find that his master felt the same way about humanity as he did. They resolved to scour humanity from the face of Creation.\nHarbinger of Death.\nMalthael's forces, dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, moved against the mortal realm, starting with &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. By this time, Urzael's form had become large and fleshy, a hulking brute of a creature. Urzael commanded the Reapers attacking &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, and aware of the Nephalem's presence took measures to &lt;a href=\"Walk%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;try to kill and delay them&lt;/a&gt;. His attempts failed however and the Soul Crucibles harvesting the souls of Westmarch were destroyed. Without the Crucibles to directly harvest the souls, Urzael rained fire down upon the city, aiming to kill its remaining inhabitants in a massive conflagration. Urzael was confronted by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; in the Westmarch tower, and claimed that the fight had already been lost. In the ensuing battle however, Urzael was defeated.\nIn-game.\nUrzael appears as the first &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Act%20V%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".

These emissaries of Athulua are called Valkyrie, and they are the spirits of the greatest heroes from the Amazon people. The power to summon a Valkyrie is the greatest honor that an Amazon warrior can receive. It is believed this gift is a sign that your place beside the Goddess is assured when you pass from this world-perhaps even as a Valkyrie. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nValkyries are powerful summoned tanks, which are especially useful for Amazons that wish to stay at range. Only one may be summoned at a time. Valkyrie receives bonuses from nearly every ability on the &lt;a href=\"Passive%20and%20Magic%20Skills\"&gt;Passive and Magic Skills&lt;/a&gt; tree.\nThis summon becomes very strong and durable with more points invested. With fully synergized &lt;a href=\"Decoy\"&gt;Decoy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Penetrate\"&gt;Penetrate&lt;/a&gt; (plus 10 points into the other four synergies) this summon gains around 11,000 Life, ~50% chance to avoid all attacks, and ~60% chance to deal twice the amount of damage. Even if somehow the enemy inflicts significant damage upon her, she may be healed to full by simply resummoning her.\nValkyries have much more endurance than Hirelings, and can be continuously summoned as long as there is sufficient mana. They attack in the form of a Melee &lt;a href=\"Spear\"&gt;Spear&lt;/a&gt; attack, regardless of which weapon and specialization the Amazon has.\nValkyries can gain other abilities and bonuses as the result of the magical spears and armor they receive when they are created. These items have a base level of 25 plus 3 points per level invested in Valkyrie, which means that they could potentially have almost any ability normally imbued to a spear or armor.\nAny points invested in Critical Strike, Dodge, Avoid, and Evade are transferred completely to the Valkyrie, giving her exactly the same chance to do any of those abilities as the Amazon.\nSometimes Valkyries may (randomly) have immunities on higher difficulties. They can be re-summoned until the desired immunities are obtained.\nValkyrie's appearance changes depending on her randomized properties, skill level (hard points only) and bonus damage type of her weapons, if any.\nThe Items for Valkyrie:\nHidden Stats.\nResistances \nThe Valkyries' resistances are equal to twice their level, to a max of 85. For example, a level 10 Valkyrie will have +20 to all Resistances. Valkyries also get a hidden synergy bonus from Decoy, in which every physical point in Decoy will add +2 to all Resistances. The whole formula comes out as: 2x(Valkyrie level + Base Decoy Level)\nMagic Level \nThe equipment that a Valkyrie is spawned with is based on her Magic Level, i.e. the ilvl that her equipment is spawned with, therefore denoting which mods can be spawned. The Magic Level of any Valkyrie is equal to a base of 25 at level 1, and increases by 3 for each level, for a total of item lv. 82 at the cap of 20 points.\nDexterity \nValkyries receive a bonus of +12 Dexterity per level. Therefore, a level 12 Valkyrie will have 144 dexterity points. Valkyries gain bonuses of attack rating and defense much like any character, but this is not reflected in their skill description."}

Unlike many Demon Hunters, her eyes do not glow, as, in her words, \"I live for more than just vengeance.\" She prefers action to waiting.\nBiography.\nEarly Life.\nThe daughter of a sawyer, Valla and her family resided in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Braylen\"&gt;a village&lt;/a&gt; close to &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, located in a forest.\nThe village was attacked and destroyed by &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. At first, she was trapped with her family in her home. After they escaped, they were attacked by demons and got separated from each other. Valla found her uncle who told her to find Halissa and escape from the village, while he looks for her parents. It was the last time she saw him. A demon nearly killed her, but its claw only cut her jaw rather than her neck. Of the whole family, only Valla and her younger sister, &lt;a href=\"Halissa\"&gt;Halissa&lt;/a&gt; survived. On a stormy night, Halissa, traumatized by the events, drowned after waking up from a nightmare, running off and slipping into a river, with Valla failing to pull her out. Left alone, traumatized, she was found by a Demon Hunter named &lt;a href=\"Josen\"&gt;Josen&lt;/a&gt;, who took Valla under his wing as a Demon Hunter in training. He taught her to harness her anger and pain and to use both as a weapon against demons.\nThe Demon Hunters.\nDuring her time with the Demon Hunters, Valla saw many towns fall. She was able to save who she could. At some point, she started to see &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; in her dreams.\nThe Shassar Sea.\nThe Chamber of Wisdom.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, Valla and Josen were in the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt;. They had caught word of a demon nest having formed there, and had come to slay the demons. Valla entered the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Chamber of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, where one of her traps caught a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;, which she realized was no demon. She explained to the hero(es) that there was &lt;a href=\"Aeshama\"&gt;a demon&lt;/a&gt; using illusion &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to sow chaos and feed upon the locals, and that she was going to kill it. She suggested that the hero(es) leave the chamber.\nStranger in the Sands.\nSometime later, Valla and her mentor &lt;a href=\"Josen\"&gt;Josen&lt;/a&gt; were following a bounty on a demon called &lt;a href=\"Aeshama\"&gt;Aeshama&lt;/a&gt; in the Shassar Sea. Following the lead on Aeshama, she was lured away by a succubus (in disguise as his brother) and her thrall on a bridge. After a short battle, she threw the succubus off the bridge and tied up the thrall at the foot of the bridge. After that, she discovered that she'd been separated from Josen. She tracked him down to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Chamber of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, filled with demonic taint and housing a &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Hell portal&lt;/a&gt; where she met the &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero(es)&lt;/a&gt;. After confirming their identity, the hero(es) informed her that they were helping Josen to find her but he was tricked into the portal by Aeshama, and that Valla was her real target.\nWith the hero(es) accompanying her they went into the &lt;a href=\"Domain%20of%20Horror\"&gt;Domain of Horror&lt;/a&gt; which had been transformed into an illusion of Valla's village during its attack by demons as an attempt by Aeshama to break her mind. After being forced to watch her family die again and kill illusions of both her family and Josen, it was only the comfort provided by the hero(es) that stopped her from breaking. They were able to arrive at Aeshama's lair were she was defeated after a battle. As a last ditch effort, Aeshama tried to devour Valla's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, stating it was special but was overpowered and defeated by Valla. Aeshama's last words hinted at Valla's heritage as a &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey reunited with Josen who was able to find them by the ruckus caused by their battle and left the Domain of Horror. Back in the Shassar Sea, Josen gave Valla his scarf, naming her a full-fledged Demon Hunter.\nThe Dreadlands.\nIn their hunt for the demon &lt;a href=\"Draxiel\"&gt;Draxiel&lt;/a&gt;, Valla and &lt;a href=\"Delios\"&gt;Delios&lt;/a&gt; travelled deep into the southern &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;. While Valla preferred to work alone, Josen insisted that the two work together. They came across the ruins of an unknown civilization. As they explored them, Valla's head throbbed, and she realized that the demon was infiltrating her thoughts. In her mind's eye its presence was black tendrils, probing, coaxing, provoking. Valla dwelled on every irritating habit, every negative quality, Delios possessed. Her agitation soon turned to anger, which turned to rage. Her rage became so great that she considered killing Delios himself. She tried following him, but found that he had disappeared. Valla realized that the demon had tricked her; the Delios she'd been following hadn't been real. She could hear the demon laughing.\nWhat followed was a series of flashes for Valla, but she beheld Josen and the real Delios battling Draxiel (she managed to fire few &lt;a href=\"crossbows\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; bolts of her own). The ruins had been a test, and Josen told Valla that she had failed it.\nHatred and Discipline.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Valla, Josen, and two other Demon Hunters came to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Holbrook\"&gt;Holbrook&lt;/a&gt;. It had been destroyed by a demon which, Valla deduced, had emerged from the town's well. One of their own, &lt;a href=\"Delios\"&gt;Delios&lt;/a&gt;, had managed to wound it, but clearly he had failed to save the village. Josen guided her to the villagers' bodies and informed her that Delios had been seen one day ago outside &lt;a href=\"Bramwell\"&gt;Bramwell&lt;/a&gt;, where he killed fifteen innocents inside an opium den. Clearly, he had fallen to the demon's corruption. Valla conceded the point, but noted that the destruction of Holbrook itself had to be at the hands of a demon. Furthermore, she noted that of all the corpses present, none of them were children.\nJosen declared that he would seek out Delios, while Valla declared that she would hunt the demon that had corrupted him. Josen told her that she was not ready, and that he would sent another hunter after it. Valla thus suggested that she go after Delios, but Josen still refused, telling her to stay in the village and search for survivors. Valla bristled at the insinuation that she \"wasn't ready\" for either task, but held her tongue. When Josen left, she got atop her own &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, intent on pursuing the demon. She chose to head for &lt;a href=\"Havenwood\"&gt;Havenwood&lt;/a&gt;, as it was the closest village, and it would make sense for the demon to travel there in its search of new prey. Camped a few miles the village, she reflected on her encounter in the Dreadlands. How where she had failed there, Delios had failed at Holbrook.\nShe reached Havenwood itself at midnight. Entering the village's inn, the innkeeper, while uneasy with her presence, told her that there had been no signs of trouble in the village. She passed a note for him to give to the village healer, that if there was any trouble, send for her. She took lodging, and wondered if she'd made a mistake. She wrote a letter to her sister before turning in. \nThe following morning, she was brought to the healer, &lt;a href=\"Bellik\"&gt;Bellik&lt;/a&gt;. In his study was the body of &lt;a href=\"Durgen\"&gt;Durgen&lt;/a&gt;, the town's blacksmith. Bellik told her that he'd come to him earlier, whispering \"my boy did this to me,\" before succumbing to his injuries. Moments later, she heard a scream from outside, and headed out to see. In the pre-dawn light, she saw a boy with a smith's hammer, standing over the body of a female merchant, her skull reduced to mush. Valla, remembering how there'd been no children's bodies at Holbrook, realized what had happened\u2014the demon hadn't done the killing. It had got the children to do its killing for it. And now, the same thing was happening here, as more children armed with weapons emerged. Valla told the adults to get inside cover.\nValla was able to incapacitate the children through sedative darts. She and Bellik put the children inside the stables, as the town only had a single jail cell. Many of the townsfolk directed their ire towards Valla, but they trusted Bellik, and followed his counsel. Inside the stable, Valla studied one of the children, &lt;a href=\"Sahmantha%20Halstaff\"&gt;Sahmantha Halstaff&lt;/a&gt;, who reminded her of Halissa, and brought back memories of the night demons had destroyed her home. Nevertheless, she realized that it was in this girl that the demon resided, and goaded it into revealing itself. She let the demon walk out into the town (still using Sahmantha's body) before it collapsed on the grass.\nValla noticed that the grass had signs of demonic contamination. A farmer told her that the town was located above the &lt;a href=\"River%20Bohsum\"&gt;River Bohsum&lt;/a&gt;, and that there was a sinkhole half a day's journey away. Valla told Bellik to gather the villagers and stay together. To bind and lock away any children under sixteen years of age, and to fetch her horse so that she could kill the demon.\nValla descended into the sinkhole, and confronted the demon, which was revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Valdraxxis\"&gt;Valdraxxis&lt;/a&gt;, a lesser demon of terror. It tried to use the memories of her childhood against her, even taking the appearance of Halissa, and later, Valla herself. Overcoming its deceptions, she confronted Valdraxxis himself and destroyed him.\nAwhile later, Valla was at the graves of her parents. Josen told her that the children were themselves again, without memory of their actions, though many were now orphans (having killed their parents while under Valdraxxis's influence). However, they would be offered homes. As for Delios, he simply replied that he'd been \"taken care of.\"\nThe two moved on to whisperings they had heard, that in seven days time, a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;star would fall&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; in seven days time. The Demon Hunters intended to send their best to investigate. Valla took out the letter she'd written earlier and laid it atop one of the graves, reflecting that if Josen was correct in saying that everything in life was a test, that while she'd failed at the ruins, she'd succeeded against Valdraxxis. She declared her intention to go to Tristram (she was, after all, the \"best\" Demon Hunter in her mind) and that if Josen intended to stop her, he do so now. Josen made no move, and Valla disappeared from his sight.\nThe End of Days.\nValla participated in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Siege of Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, backed up by a &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter slaying &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, Valla returned to the Demon Hunters and received the mantle of Ordermaster. She shared her knowledge and experience with neophyte Demon Hunters.\nValla became one of the deadliest Demon Hunters in history but mysteriously disappeared one night, although her body has never been found. Some claim that she continues her fighting in another world. Her &lt;a href=\"Valla%27s%20Bequest\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, however, was left behind.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nValla appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". She is a Demon Hunter in training at this point. She and Josen are encountered in the Shassar Sea zone, with Valla first encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Chamber of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Wisdom%27s%20Fragment\"&gt;Wisdom's Fragment&lt;/a&gt;.\" She later appears in the &lt;a href=\"elite%20quest\"&gt;elite quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Stranger%20in%20the%20Sands\"&gt;Stranger in the Sands&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDiablo III.\nValla is the canonical portrayal of the Demon Hunter class, though name and gender are still at the player's discretion.\n&lt;a href=\"Valla%27s%20Bequest\"&gt;Valla's Bequest&lt;/a&gt; is a legendary &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Crossbows\"&gt;Hand Crossbow&lt;/a&gt; named after her.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20Ballista\"&gt;Fortress Ballista&lt;/a&gt; was famously used by Valla during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Siege of Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nValla is the assigned name of the Demon Hunter in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". Players who pre-ordered \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" are granted automatic access to her in the game.\nIn-game, she retains &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Rain of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Hungering%20Arrow\"&gt;Hungering Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vault\"&gt;Vault&lt;/a&gt; skills. She also has &lt;a href=\"Hatred\"&gt;Hatred&lt;/a&gt; as her passive trait. Unlike \"Diablo III\" heroes, she can use Vault while channelling Strafe.\nHer armor seems very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Hood\"&gt;Leather Hood&lt;/a&gt; and respective armour tier, but considerably more complete, reinforced, and with custom red paint."}

He was amused at her rebellious attitude, not to mention her declarations of being a &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. The girl gave him a demonstration of her &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, but he was umimpressed. However, he was impressed with her claim of ending the drought in the &lt;a href=\"Heron%20River%20Valley\"&gt;Heron River Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Isendra offered to train the girl, much to Li-Ming's chagrin. Nonetheless, Valthek allowed the Sorceress to take Li-Ming as her apprentice.\nThe training went ahead, but Valthek was concerned as to how not only did Li-Ming treat Isendra as her equal rather than her master, but that Isendra let the girl's attitude persist. When he caught Li-Ming looking at material in the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;'s library that held forbidden texts too dangerous to study, he took over the girl's training despite Isendra's protests. He tried to introduce structure to Li-Ming's life and present a course of study that would turn her interests toward \"more acceptable pursuits.\" Isendra left, but they remained friends, and in contact. Isendra was convinced that Li-Ming would play a role in defeating the Lords of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, as per the existence of a &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20the%20End%20of%20Days\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt;, but Valthek was more skeptical.\nLut Bahadur.\nValthek became concerned as &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; became afflicted by a drought, one that persisted for over a year and caused the empire to begin to crumble. He sent a message to Isendra asking her to investigate the cause of the weather while he took Li-Ming with him away from &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; to head into the desert. After several months, they'd found nothing, and were forced to head back to the capital. Li-Ming was convinced that a mortal hand or some other great power was causing the adverse weather, and Valthek was inclined to believe her, though he maintained that it could indeed be a natural event. On the way, they stopped off at &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Bahadur\"&gt;Lut Bahadur&lt;/a&gt;, the city dying due to the effects of the drought.\nLi-Ming went to a well and caused water to rise up from further underground. Valthek was incensed; yes, rising the water would help the city, but removing water from below could possibly affect another location, given that they did not know its source or where it flowed to. Isendra, who was present in the city at Valthek's request, broke up the debate, siding with her former student. They left soon after, Valthek and Li-Ming fearing for the future of the town. Valthek, for all his regrets, remained intent on non-interferance.\nHalf a year later, Li-Ming and Valthek headed back to Lut Bahadur, as they sensed that a great spell had been cast there. They arrived to find the air teeming with electric energy and the town abandoned. Valthek claimed that Isendra had tried to use magic to take the heat away from the air, but lost control of the spell. They found her body in one of the houses. Li-Ming maintained that she had not died due to magic, and despite Valthek's feigned ignorance, she was right; he'd assigned an &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; to keep an eye on the sorceress, an order that had resulted in Isendra's death. They cremated her body and left, but a wedge had been driven between them.\nLighting a Fire.\nMuch to Valthek's concern, Li-Ming dedicated herself to researching more esoteric magics, her powers growing. One day, she met Valthek in the great hall of the Sanctum, informing him of the existence of a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;fallen star&lt;/a&gt; that had been seen in the west. She declared that her time had come, that the Prophecy of the End of Days had come to pass. Valthek refused to let her leave, and the two dueled. Unlike their first encounter years ago, their magic was more evenly matched, as well as being far more destructive, causing the floor of the great hall to cave in. Valthek fell down, his body lying in the catacombs. He warned her of the risks of not being able to control her power, but she was past caring. Valthek passed out shortly thereafter. The &lt;a href=\"Valthek%27s%20Rebuke\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; he had used disappeared not long after that.\nAftermath.\nIn the aftermath of the duel, rumors spread of the event. The youth of Caldeum quickly began exaggerating the events to \"mythic proportions.\" &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; wrote (as per the account from \"official sources\") that Valthek had been defeated through means of treachery and deceit, that the damage done was due to Valthek's own magical prowess, and that the duel had been anything but honorable.\nValthek awoke days later, his colleagues informing him that Li-Ming couldn't be found. He related the events of his time with Li-Ming to an Assassin, the same one he'd assigned to watch Isendra. While he was aware of the tomes that described the events that had come to pass, but feared what Li-Ming might unleash. Thus, he ordered the Assassin to kill his student.\nA New Look at Magic.\nValthek became aware of a &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Wraps\"&gt;pair of bracers&lt;/a&gt; linked to the fallen &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, who had led the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; against Sanctuary. He theorized that their properties might dictate a revision of the most basic understandings of the laws of magic.\nIn-game.\nValthek is referenced in flavor lore in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Valthek%27s%20Rebuke\"&gt;Valthek's Rebuke&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;, may be obtained. He also narrates all pieces of the &lt;a href=\"Delsere%27s%20Magnum%20Opus\"&gt;Delsere's Magnum Opus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"set\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Twisted%20Sword\"&gt;The Twisted Sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nValthek utilizes &lt;a href=\"elemental%20magic\"&gt;elemental magic&lt;/a&gt;, and (at least formerly) held a high opinion of his abilities. He believes that magic can be used to aid people, but not every time, and that the benefits and risks must be evaluated before each action. Isendra was of the belief that, along with herself and Li-Ming, Valthek was the most powerful living mage in Sanctuary."}

Their touch is filled with the cold unlife of the grave that will slow even the healthiest of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Vampires themselves can move at great speed.\nVampires make lairs for themselves and move from one hunting ground to the next, killing and biting &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. They require &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; to survive, and some vampires are capable of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;Blood magic&lt;/a&gt; can also be utilized by vampires. Some humans who are bitten undergo a monstrous transformation, devolving into a creature called a &lt;a href=\"thrall\"&gt;thrall&lt;/a&gt;. However, vampires can also turn humans into other vampires.\nHistory.\nVampires stem back to the days of the &lt;a href=\"Firstborn\"&gt;Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; altered the Worldstone to depower the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, those who were vampires lost their power. But among those who were slain during &lt;a href=\"the%20Purge\"&gt;the Purge&lt;/a&gt;, not all were subject to permanent &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zir\"&gt;Zir&lt;/a&gt; and his cohort were banished to the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;City of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, where it was intended they would sleep for an eternity.\nMillennia later, vampires were summoned into Sanctuary by &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt;, in order to guard the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. However, either they broke free, or other vampires emerged in the mortal realm, for they came to plague the whole of Sanctuary.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, a vampire cult led by Lord &lt;a href=\"Zir\"&gt;Zir&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Harvest\"&gt;sweeping through&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt; like a plague. It started small; nameless people that no one would miss, their bodies discarded, their throats torn open. The &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; ignored the killings, even as fear mounted alongside the &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and townsfolk fought to end the corruption, but it was too late, and entire villages were killed or turned, along with the adventurers who had tried to aid them. Other citizens were kidnapped to be used in dark rituals. The cult laid claim to entire regions of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. In at least one case, vampires fed on human blood in order to reclaim their nephalem birthright.\nAs time went on, the vampires' ambitions grew, and as such, they became sloppier and greedier. Word of their activities reached . \nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nVampires are found in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;acts&lt;/a&gt;.

Her main skill in combat is the &lt;a href=\"Cobra%20Strike\"&gt;Cobra Strike&lt;/a&gt; (accompanied with a finisher move) to ensure her survival. But it is the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Disciplines\"&gt;Shadow Disciplines&lt;/a&gt; that are heavily developed.\nSkills.\nPrimary Skills\nSecondary Skills\nEquipment.\nA pair of claw-class weapons (&lt;a href=\"katars\"&gt;katars&lt;/a&gt;) with cold damage is very important for the Vampire. Combined with Burst of Speed, your enemy will barely have time to react before you finish them off!\n&lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; with high &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; is important. Particularly ones with high elemental &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;.\nGear and charms with increased percent of getting gold is great in order to not have to depend heavily on looting (in order to sell for gold). This will save you room in your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; for the truly valuable items you come across without having to make too many trips to town.\nAs a Vampire, you'll barely need &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; to help keep you alive since you'll be stealing life and mana from your enemies during combat. This being the case, keep with you every &lt;a href=\"rejuvenation%20potion\"&gt;rejuvenation potion&lt;/a&gt; you find, and you'll soon have a hoard of them!\nWith the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; (which you will find in Act II), transmute three rejuvenation potions at a time for a &lt;a href=\"Full%20Rejuvenation%20Potion\"&gt;Full Rejuvenation Potion&lt;/a&gt;. A Full Rejuvenation potion will \"instantly\" recover 100% of your life and mana!\nIn your belt (which has four slots), fill two slots with Full Rejuvenation potions. Fill the third slot with either Health potions or Full Rejuvenation potions again. Use the last slot to put in helpful potions such as &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20potion\"&gt;Stamina potion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Antidote\"&gt;Antidote&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Thawing%20Potion\"&gt;Thawing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, and/or town &lt;a href=\"scrolls\"&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith life/mana stealing power and a belt loaded with full rejuvenation potions, you'll appear practically immortal to both your enemies and your teammates!\nThis will also dramatically reduce your need to go back to town or leave the heat of battle to recuperate. So, while your buddies are jumping in and out of combat, you can tough it out like a champ.\nHirelings.\nThe best &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;hireling&lt;/a&gt; for the Vampire is one that does long range attacks. A &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt;'s long range arrow attacks complements well with the Vampire's close range approach.\nGive the Rogue a bow with &lt;a href=\"cold\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; damage to freeze more enemies at a time along with your cold weapons. Or better yet, give the Rogue a bow with different &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; damage (&lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, , or &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;) to create a wider range of diverse elemental damage from your little party.\nConclusion.\nTried, tested, and true, the Vampire is a survivor and a cold, ferocious fighter. The fully-developed Vampire seldom needs help from her teammates, and makes a good distraction on enemies so that her teammates can pull back and recover or attack from a distance and/or prepare skills.\nOn her own, the Vampire does perfectly well with her hireling and Shadow Master to back her up.\nDue to her capabilities, the Vampire is a great Assassin Build as a &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; character.\nWhen fighting against a foe that is much too dangerous to attack head on, use the Shadow Master as a decoy and attack from a distance.\nRemember that the Vampire isn't truly immortal and can get killed. Use precaution and be alert. Full Rejuvenation potions will save your life when you're losing life faster than you're stealing it. So use them!\nWhen a situation gets overwhelming and you fear for your life, use your Burst of Speed to run like the wind to safety!\nUsing the old instinctive response of \"fight or flight\" strategically will help keep you alive."}

In the days of the Ancients, Zir gathered his kinsmen and made an offer of power.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"the%20Purge\"&gt;the Purge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; tampered with the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, robbing the Firstborn of the power they'd once enjoyed. Zir and his cohort reacted negatively to this, and for their actions, were imprisoned in the underground &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;City of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. He slumbered under Sanctuary, waiting to enact his twisted plan to rule over all.\nAt some point prior to his imprisonment, Zir feasted on &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; and achieved immortality. \nSeason of Blood.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt; Zir awoke from long slumber. He led a vampire cult and dispatched a vampire army under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodseekers\"&gt;Bloodseekers&lt;/a&gt;, under orders to conquer &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;. This campaign was referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Harvest\"&gt;Blood Harvest&lt;/a&gt;. He would not stop until he had bled Sanctuary dry. and his followers were ordered to gather &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; for a terrible ritual. His cult members hid themselves in numerous places, operating within human &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s, ensnaring victims and/or sending them off to areas where vampires could ambush them. He sealed off the City of the Ancients.\nWhen was bitten by a vampire, Zir was able to talk to them from afar, but the Wanderer did not change into a vampire for some reason. Zir later summoned &lt;a href=\"Oren\"&gt;Oren&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Hallows\"&gt;Tomb of Hallows&lt;/a&gt;. Oren believed this to be a reward for sending the Wanderer to be bitten, but when Oren entered the tomb, he was executed by Zir's vampires, despite his pleas to be given another chance. &lt;a href=\"Erys\"&gt;Erys&lt;/a&gt; later theorized that Zir had ordered Oren killed because of her presence and the Wanderer's. That he'd left a trail for them to follow, complicating Zir's plans. With Oren dead, at least one loose end was taken care of.\nErys left the tomb, while the Wanderer continued their descent. It was at this moment that Zir resumed his telepathic communication with the Wanderer. He taunted them as they descended, before they arrived in the tomb's depths, where Zir appeared as a bloody apparition before them. He declared that the Wanderer would join his Blood Seekers, but the Wanderer refused. Perturbed, Zir demanded to know why the Wanderer hadn't turned into a vampire, before he realized that the blood of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; they carried inside them was preventing their transformation. Still, it didn't matter. The Wanderer might not turn into a vampire, but they would thirst for blood all the same, and the more they thirsted, the more they would understand.\nThrough his link with the Wanderer, Zir observed them kill a number of his Blood Seekers. Unperturbed, Zir's campaign against the living intensified. &lt;a href=\"Erys\"&gt;Erys&lt;/a&gt; theorized that Zir's army was making a \"big push\" in order to gather the remaining blood required to ensure Zir's \"ascension.\" While Zir's armies were defeated, Erys feared that Zir would rally his remaining legions to gather the blood he needed. To that end, the Wanderer entered the City of the Ancients and fought their way to Zir themselves. Zir taunted them from afar until the Wanderer confronted him directly. Zir was slain in the ensuing battle.\nLegacy.\nWhile Zir had been killed, his &lt;a href=\"thrall\"&gt;thrall&lt;/a&gt;s remained. &lt;a href=\"Erys\"&gt;Erys&lt;/a&gt; feared that the strongest would try to claim his throne, and that the killings would continue.\nIn-game.\nZir was the main antagonist of \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Season of Blood&lt;/a&gt;\" in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".

These may be the spikes described in the Dark Vessel\u00a0lore, which perhaps provide access to demonic energies, or maybe control the demon once the summoning is complete.\nOwing to their being possessed, they have limited to no control over their bodies. Their head rolls and swings in a very uncontrolled fashion and they have a general twitchy vibe about them. This is very apparent in their death animations, where they stand at the same place, with their entire bodies twitching and shaking, and finally explode into many chunks of flesh and bloody bones, letting the spirits that possessed them escape into the void.\nTheir mode of locomotion is quite strange, they can hover above the ground. There are not many &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo series&lt;/a&gt; that can hover without wings, only the &lt;a href=\"Putrid%20Defiler\"&gt;Putrid Defiler&lt;/a&gt; does so. But the similarity in the lower torsos of both monsters is striking. They have their entrails and other innards hanging outside from their lower halves. How this aids them in hovering is not known.\nIn game.\nDark Thralls are mutated, half-demonic beings who fight furiously and move very quickly. It is a good idea to kill off the Dark Vessels before they can \"activate\", if at all possible. There is no extra reward (and therefore no reason) to kill them after the transformation.\nOnce fully possessed, the Dark Thralls can attack by delivering melee blows for high &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage. Their movement is very fast, and if too far from their target, they may charge for even greater damage to everything in their path. This makes groups of many Thralls especially deadly: while player is locked in combat with some of them, others retreat and then charge in.\nUpon death, they always explode, leaving no corpse behind.\nDevelopment.\nThe Triune Vessel was a type of monster revealed only in the form of &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt; Concept artwork. Their relation to the Dark Vessel is unknown; artwork in question resembled an &lt;a href=\"Exorcist\"&gt;Exorcist&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, as the resulting mindless construct of flesh and bone is highly unstable, they must start the process in combat, giving enemy time to kill the cultist before the ritual is complete.\nIn-game.\nDark Vessels look much like &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cultist\"&gt;Dark Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s, but Vessels wear hoods and lean on tall crooks, remaining still in one place and ringing the bells on top of their crooks, while chanting demonic verses until they transform.\nDark Vessels are commonly found standing motionless, amidst various other types of Dark Coven servants. Vessels are harmless in their human form, but become very dangerous melee fighters if they manage to pull a demonic entity into themselves, which takes them roughly 6 seconds once combat starts, and they do not need to be hit for that to happen. In that form they are known as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Thrall\"&gt;Dark Thrall&lt;/a&gt;s, and are ferocious melee fighters. Note that &lt;a href=\"elites\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; Dark Vessels do not transform: you encounter them in form of the Dark Thralls already. Despite being immobile, all Dark Vessels can still be &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;knocked back&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Vessels are found in the &lt;a href=\"Act%20I%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;first act&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", specifically in &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Highlands%20Cave\"&gt;Highlands Cave&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;following year&lt;/a&gt;, one of the shards of the destroyed &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; landed in the wood.\nIn the intervening years, the forest grew increasingly dangerous. A forgotten evil began returning to strength within the shadowed forest, ready to challenge those who might dare tread within. &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s plagued the forest, including the &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, which made their homes beneath the wood's darkest trees, namely those which were deeply affected by &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;'s foul &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s. They established a village in the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Grove\"&gt;Cursed Grove&lt;/a&gt;, located in the forest's south.\nThe rise of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; made the area far too dangerous for merchants to travel through, and &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; requested &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s clear them out so that the route might be used again. The Dark Wood was corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt;, but the creature was slain at the hands of a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;adventurer/group of adventurers&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; later made efforts to cleanse the wood of corruption, starting with the &lt;a href=\"Fetid%20Swamp\"&gt;Fetid Swamp&lt;/a&gt;. They requested aid from adventurers in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; to aid them in this endeavor.\nWestmarch requested aid from adventurers. A large &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt; tribe dwelled in the western side of the wood. Villagers in the area were travelling west in search of shelter, but could not pass through safely. They requested that adventurers clear the area of the Fallen, so that the roads would remain clear. &lt;a href=\"Gorja%20Caspan\"&gt;Gorja Caspan&lt;/a&gt; declared that the forest itself had to be cleared, given the corruption that had taken it.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nThe Dark Wood is a forested area in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", and can be reached by travelling through the &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Passage\"&gt;Underground Passage&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Field\"&gt;Stony Field&lt;/a&gt;.

A Super Unique Brute named &lt;a href=\"Treehead%20Woodfist\"&gt;Treehead Woodfist&lt;/a&gt; can also be found here, near the Tree of Inifuss.\nA landmark that always appears in this area is the ruins of a large house, infested with numerous &lt;a href=\"Carver\"&gt;Carver&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Carver%20Shaman\"&gt;Carver Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s. The area has far more trees than any other area in Act I, with the foliage potentially obscuring foes. Two variants of Fallen camps are exclusive to this location.\nThe Dark Wood has one exit, leading into the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo Immortal.\nThe Dark Wood appears as a zone in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". It is a hub zone, and has a recommended &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; of 20-29. Originally, it was completed after &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, but in the final version, players gain access to it after &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;.

Brevik has stated that as early as high school he was thinking about what kind of games he'd like to make, and what their names would be. He played the Atari 2600 in his youth. He began designing what would become \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" when he was 16.\nBrevik obtained a degree in computer science. While in college, he was exposed to Roguelikes, which influenced his early \"Diablo\" ideas.\nAfter college, Brevik worked at a digital clip art company named FM Waves that eventually went under. While there, Brevik worked on \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordo_106\"&gt;Gordo 106&lt;/a&gt;\", alongside &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Max%20Schaefer\"&gt;Max Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;. Brevik disliked his time working there, and the three dreamed of leaving the company.\nBrevik left the company after 4/5 months, after which he began working at Iguana Entertainment. He worked on \"Aero the Acro-Bat\", which was his first team collaboration. He also briefly worked on \"NBA Jam\". He left Iguana when it moved to Austin, Texas, as he didn't want to move himself.\nCondor.\nIn the aftermath of FM's closure, a few of its former employees went on to launch their own company, named after a secret project the clip art company had been working on: \"Project Condor.\" Alongside &lt;a href=\"Max%20Schaefer\"&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;, Brevik was one of the founders of Condor, later known as Blizzard North.\nBrevik worked on its first game, \"NFL Quarterback Club '95\", and later, the Genesis version of \"Justice League Task Force\".\nBlizzard North.\nBrevik thought of the name \"Diablo\" when he lived in Danville, California, which is situated at the base of Mount Diablo. The name appealed to him, though he did not realize that Diablo translates as \"devil\" in Spanish until much later. He worked as the lead programmer and senior designer for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\". Brevik protested against the decision to turn it from a turn-based game to a real-time one, but relented as the rest of Blizzard North agreed with the change in direction. In late 1996, Brevik was offered a position in a company started by Sabeer Bhatia, where he would have a 10% share. Brevik refused, and Bhatia's company eventually became Hotmail. Brevik has since estimated that as of 2016, had he taken the position, he would have earned $280 million.\nAlongside the Schaefers, Brevik was one of the principal designers for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". Among his contributions was the game's skill tree. According to Brevik, the idea came to him while he was in the shower. He didn't work extensively on the game's , as he was suffering from burnout on \"Diablo II\". When interviewed, Brevik reflected that work on \"Diablo II\" had cost him his marriage and forever marred his relationship with his two oldest daughters.\nBrevik worked on &lt;a href=\"Starblo\"&gt;Project X&lt;/a&gt;, but ideas shifted every few weeks. Brevik was suffering burn-out at the time, and was struggling to come up with ideas for the game.\nPost-Blizzard.\nBrevik left Blizzard North shortly after Blizzard Entertainment's purchase by Vivendi. &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; and Allen Adham asked Brevik if he would stay after Blizzard North's reorganization, but Brevik refused. Blizzard North closed soon afterwards.\nBrevik co-founded &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_Studios\"&gt;Flagship Studios&lt;/a&gt;, once again with the Shaefers and other former Blizzard North members. He later moved on to become CEO at Gazillion Entertainment, working on \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Heroes_%2528video_game%2529\"&gt;Marvel Heroes&lt;/a&gt;\". He has since left Gazillion to found Graybeard Games, as he wanted to get back to game development rather than be a CEO.\nBrevik has expressed a dim view of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", and has cited \"Marvel Heroes\" as its spiritual successor. As of 2017, Brevik appears to have taken a more charitable view on the game. This remained true in 2018, with Brevik stating \"I thought that they added a lot of really great stuff to it that fleshed it out and made it a much better game than I thought that it was at launch.\" \nBrevik visited Blizzard's campus in October, 2016. The same month, he tweeted that \"for 20 years, Diablo-like games have evolved &amp; surprised us. I'm proud to be the adviser for the game that pushes this genre to new heights.\" The tweet was accompanied by an image of the constellation of Libra, which, in sidereal astrology, covers the period of October 16 to November 17 (a period in which &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt; would fall into). He confirmed soon afterwards that he wasn't returning to the series. It was later revealed that he was acting as an adviser for the Chinese release of \"Path of Exile\", a game that he had previously called \"Diablo 2.5.\" He featured in the 20th anniversary panel for the series at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 2017, Brevik confirmed that he'd talked to Blizzard a few times about returning to work on the \"Diablo\" series (or another Blizzard project), but stated that he was focusing on his own work for now, working on an action-focused RPG.\nIn an interview published in January 2018, Brevik announced that he was working on a new game called \"It Lurks Below\". The game is a spiritual successor to \"Diablo II\" and features game mechanics similar to ' and '. On April 25, 2018, the game entered Early Access mode on Steam. The game released on Steam on May 29, 2019. Brevik created the game singlehandedly; a first for his career.\nIn an interview before the announcement of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", Brevik stated he would be open to working on a fourth mainline entry in the \"Diablo\" series. However, to best knowledge, Brevik played no role in the development of the game."}

{"id": "3142", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3142", "title": "Death", "text": "Death is the cessation of life for a being.\nLore.\nEarly &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; were unaware of death, at least in as much as it applied to themselves. &lt;a href=\"Gratian\"&gt;Gratian&lt;/a&gt; was the first of their number to be slain, followed closely by &lt;a href=\"Bersarik\"&gt;Bersarik&lt;/a&gt;. Even as the nephalem grew in number, many more were found by death, as it spread across the world.\nMost mortal creatures are instinctively repelled by death. The spirits of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s who have died have sometimes described death in different ways. &lt;a href=\"Isendra\"&gt;Isendra&lt;/a&gt; likened her moment of death as being akin to a bowstring\u2014as she died, she found herself being stretched over all of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the 'string' was drawn back, and her spirit wound up in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20%28Reaper%20of%20Souls%29\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; stated that it was impossible to describe death to one who was still living. When pressed, he asked whether someone could describe their own birth. A &lt;a href=\"Master%20Crusader\"&gt;Master Crusader&lt;/a&gt; described death as \"the coldest night on the plains, with a warm fire at your feet. The Crusader told their former apprentice that when they died, they would know whether death was the fire or the night, and that they had known what death was all along.\n&lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; of Wisdom, embodied death as the Angel of Death. &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; in turn became one with death.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Death\"&gt;Lord Death&lt;/a&gt; is the supposed personification of death in at least one of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s cultures. Legends say that ravens serve as his couriers, carrying &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s to the afterlife. There is a popular belief in Sanctuary that wearing the feathers of carrion birds delays death for a year. &lt;a href=\"Balazan\"&gt;Balazan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Guardian\"&gt;Spirit Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, is associated with death, and the manifestation of humanity's beliefs about life, death, decay, and new life.\n&lt;a href=\"Ku%20Y%27leh\"&gt;Ku Y'leh&lt;/a&gt; became famous for his studies of life beyond death, though &lt;a href=\"Ormus\"&gt;Ormus&lt;/a&gt; maintained that \"there is no life beyond death. There is only life.\" &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; once wrote of the \"veil of death,\" of being a place where the departed passed beyond.\nIt is from death itself that &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; gains its power. The corpses of those who died a violent death contain the anguish of the corpse's final moments. Through spellcraft, a Necromancer can call upon these energies and focus them into a single violent force. This force then expels itself from the carcass with such power that it causes a dramatic explosion.\nSome corpse body parts are venerated, such as teeth, fingers, and femurs.\nGameplay.\nDiablo I.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", death ends the game, and the player is forced to restart from their last save.\nIn the game's &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer\"&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; death would cause the player to drop all their carried items at that spot.\nMultiplayer also has a &lt;a href=\"Spellbook\"&gt;Spell&lt;/a&gt; which another character can use to revive the deceased, or the fallen character could respawn in town with reduced &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonsters who die in the game die permanently and do not respawn (unless resurrected by some other monsters). Hence, the game's number of enemies are finite.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", the player is revived without any equipped items or minions, in the act's town. To regain their lost items, the character has to return to the place they died, and pick up their 'corpse' - often a dangerous proposition, as any monsters in the area remain. Further deaths (even of an itemless character) result in more corpses. A corpse will appear in town only if the player restarts their game, but only the most recent corpse would appear - thus, if a character died multiple times, they might lose all items they had equipped.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode of Diablo II, death is permanent, and a deceased player can no longer create or join games.\nIf a monster dies, it leaves behind a corpse on the ground. In \"Diablo II\", the corpse has several possible functions:\n&lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Spitter\"&gt;Corpse Spitter&lt;/a&gt;s could consume corpses as means of generating projectile attacks.\nSome monsters are able to revive their allies. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;Fallen Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s are able to revive fellow &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;. Some bosses, such as &lt;a href=\"Radament\"&gt;Radament&lt;/a&gt;, are also able to revive minions.\nMonsters often drop items upon death; this is one of the main methods of item collection. Some bosses drop more powerful items, whether randomly spawned items (such as 'rare' or 'set' items in \"Diablo II\"), or specific, pre-determined items (such as the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Skill\"&gt;Book of Skill&lt;/a&gt; dropped by Radament).\nSome monsters may also cause effects upon death. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Embalmed\"&gt;Embalmed&lt;/a&gt; and similar monsters release a cloud of poison when they die. The most drastic of these are caused by bosses - for instance, the death of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Blood Raven&lt;/a&gt; killed any &lt;a href=\"Hungry%20Dead\"&gt;Hungry Dead&lt;/a&gt; she had summoned. Some monsters may even revive upon death, like the &lt;a href=\"Returned\"&gt;Returned&lt;/a&gt; in the game's &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Destruction%20%28Act%29\"&gt;fifth act&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", player death wears down the player's equipment, damaging its durability by 10% (from level 10 and upwards). The equipment is kept when respawning in town. There exist no corpse runs, unlike Diablo II. Due to the physics system introduced, if Blizzard had implemented Diablo II's method of corpse retrieval, it would have frustrated many players. If one cannot get one's equipment back easily, it might resemble forcing something approaching &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode on players who may not feel up to the challenge.\nOnce a Softcore character is dead, they have four options:\nReviving at corpse or checkpoints will place hero in a 'phased out' state, in which they are immune to damage, cannot perform any actions other than movement and picking up &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;, are invisible and may move through enemies unhindered. Their followers, however, are vulnerable as normal during that time (and may distract monsters from the character, buying them time to recover and rebuff).\nIn &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s, players may not revive in town; only at corpse (with timer increasing from 5 to 30 seconds with each death) or at last checkpoint.\nDeath imposes no penalty on the player aside from item damage (unless the item is &lt;a href=\"indestructible\"&gt;indestructible&lt;/a&gt;) and losing the &lt;a href=\"Pool%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Pool of Reflection&lt;/a&gt; experience buff, as well as any other buffs (and nearly all debuffs). However, death does not stop (and does not reset) any ongoing &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s (with exception of those applied as debuffs, which are removed normally).\nMonsters do not have permanent death and will respawn each time a game is loaded (akin to \"Diablo II\").\nHardcore mode Heroes who die, of course, cannot be brought back from the dead. However, upon such circumstances, the player can elect to place that hero in a special Hall of Fallen Heroes, for other players to see. Customer Support will not revive dead Hardcore characters, even if death came on fault of anyone other than the owner: according to EULA, by starting a Hardcore game, the player agrees on the terms that they and they alone are responsible for their character's death.\nFor monsters, death is not always permanent even for the duration of the game: some of them may revive their fallen allies. To prevent this, one must kill them with &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s, which destroy their corpses irreversibly. Some abilities, like &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Harvest\"&gt;Soul Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, have a &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Enemies%20Rest%20in%20Pieces\"&gt;Slain Enemies Rest in Pieces&lt;/a&gt; trait, but it is a purely cosmetic effect: if there are resurrectors nearby, only a Critical Hit may lay the monster to permanent rest.\nThere are abilities and effects in game that save the character from dying (usually with a considerable cooldown). These effects trigger only when all other methods of &lt;a href=\"absorb\"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt;ing or otherwise evading fatal damage were used up:\nNecromancer Corpses.\ns use monster corpses as a secondary &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s, such as detonating them with , raising them with , consuming them with &lt;a href=\"Devour\"&gt;Devour&lt;/a&gt; or creating deadly projectiles from them with &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Lance\"&gt;Corpse Lance&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly Necromancers can see these corpses, and this resource is \"unaffected by abilities that normally destroy corpses\", so the Necromancers do not leave themselves without fresh bodies with attacks, nor do their allies.\nThese corpses have alternate graphics (see picture) and appear at the site of every slain monster. In multiplayer, each Necromancer sees their own corpses, and cannot affect those of other Necromancers in the party.\nThe copses remain behind nearly all monsters, even those that explode on death (s, for instance) or are not made of organic matter (such as &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Golem\"&gt;Sand Golem&lt;/a&gt;s). The only enemies leaving no usable corpses are stationary towers, traps and similar constructs, as they are considered more of objects rather than creatures.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"skill%20runes\"&gt;skill runes&lt;/a&gt; can generate corpses for later use, so even without any supplemental monsters around, a Necromancer can still use their corpse skills, though to lesser effect. &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Land of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; skill is specifically designed to give a short period of unlimited corpse-consuming skill use.\nA maximum limit of 15 corpses can remain available for a necromancer to consume at any one time. If new corpses are created once this limit has been reached, old corpses will disappear and become unavailable for use as they are replaced by new ones being created. The only exception to this limit is when using &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Land of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, which will not cause any existing corpses to disappear (since it does not actually create any new corpses, only treats any ability as if it \"had\" 10 of them per cast).\nThe game's code had to be rewritten for the inclusion of corpses as a resource, as monsters can often go flying away after death, and some monsters are too large to generate reasonably sized corpses.\nDiablo IV.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", when the player dies, their ghost hovers above their corpse for a few seconds before release.\nCheat death abilities return in form of &lt;a href=\"Undying%20Rage\"&gt;Undying Rage&lt;/a&gt;."}

They tended the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Pools of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, and once sang refrains that could draw anyone into a deep trance and reveal insights and visions.\nThe Maidens joined &lt;a href=\"Urzael\"&gt;Urzael&lt;/a&gt; in his search for their master after Malthael departed the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. They later reappeared as part of his Reaper forces, which he unleashed upon &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Serving as Malthael's lieutenants, the Death Maidens wield giant scythes, using them to decapitate their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; foes, along with raising the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; to do their bidding. The most powerful Death Maidens were entrusted to maintain and control the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Crucible\"&gt;Soul Crucible&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn-game.\nDeath Maidens are relatively uncommon, and one will rarely see more than one in the same location (except elite packs). However, they are never fighting alone: each Death Maiden comes with a retinue of Reapers at her side, and can summon more at will (usually they spawn two &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Shield%20Guard\"&gt;Summoned Shield Guard&lt;/a&gt;s or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Archer\"&gt;Summoned Archer&lt;/a&gt;s per cast in any combination; generally a Maiden will summon archers if enemy is afar, and guards to support her in close combat). The total number of Reapers one Death Maiden can summon is not limited, and they will call create more continuously as long as there are enemies nearby.\nDeath Maidens' movement is quite quick. Their attacks are very slow, but deal high damage. They also have two signature circular attacks, indicated by blue ring around them. These charged attacks hit all enemies within roughly 20 yards: the one that charges longer (indicated by Death Maiden hovering in the air) is also knocking enemies back.\nAfter defeating &lt;a href=\"Urzael\"&gt;Urzael&lt;/a&gt;, Death Maidens retreated from Westmarch. What little was left of them launched an assault on &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, led by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Maiden%20Lamiel\"&gt;Lamiel&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to destroy the portals leading to &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;. The last Death Maiden to encounter in game is is &lt;a href=\"Seraziel\"&gt;Seraziel&lt;/a&gt;, the Guardian of Malthael, who guards the soul construct in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are the only type of angelic Reapers who, upon being killed, release a &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;-like essence which dissipates from the broken body.\nMaidens of Flame.\nMaidens of Flame\u00a0are a different type of Death Maidens, who rely on direct damage attacks rather than on minions. There are only three of them, though, and they are only encountered during one quest (The Harbinger). They all count as Super-Uniques, have Molten affix (as well as some other), but cannot summon other Reapers.\n&lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Maiden\"&gt;Infernal Maiden&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt; variant of Maidens of Flame. &lt;a href=\"Peleil\"&gt;Peleil&lt;/a&gt; is a Unique Maiden of Flame, spawned for the &lt;a href=\"Firestorm%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Firestorm&lt;/a&gt; event."}

Deceivers will cloak themselves in the familiar forms of their enemy's companions and friends, waiting to strike when the moment is opportune. It is only then that their true forms are revealed. Deceivers have been stated to 'drain the minds' of those around them, allowing them to fuel their illusions. They carry two-pronged weapons that can quickly rip a target to pieces. The metal used in these tridents is freezing cold to touch.\nDeceivers have genders.\nA number of Deceivers serve &lt;a href=\"Aeshama\"&gt;Aeshama&lt;/a&gt;, guarding her &lt;a href=\"Domain%20of%20Horror\"&gt;Domain of Horror&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, Deceivers were used in bulk, either replacing members of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt;, or becoming the Guard itself.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nDeceivers are encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Domain%20of%20Horror\"&gt;Domain of Horror&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

The player first encounters them when they enter the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, where a bunch of Deceivers led by &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt; are impersonating the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as their deception is disclosed, they transform back into their original forms, and are to be fought. Later in game, most Deceivers will either attack the player openly or throw their disguise of Imperial Guardsmen (whose ranks, most likely, consist entirely\u00a0of Belial's demons), or sometimes regular citizens, at the sight of the player.\u00a0\nIn addition to that, Deceivers may appear out of nowhere (for scripted events), and their most dangerous skill is invisibility. When they are away from player (not in close combat), they may vanish, becoming invisible (only slight ripple in the air betrays their location) for roughly 3 seconds. In this form, they are impervious to damage, and the first melee hit they deliver will deal double damage, ending the effect. Being ninja-stabbed by multiple Deceivers can prove deadly for an average hero. Fortunately, while they are locked in close combat, they cannot enter invisibility again.\nSerpent Magi.\nSerpent Magi are lacking melee attack (technically they can use it, but will not do so willingly), and may not turn invisible (but may appear out of nowhere or take forms of humans). In return, they create a circular Lightning field around themselves (must stay immobile to channel it) that causes increasing ticks of Lightning damage. Several fields in one area stack. Their goal is to make players flee so that Deceivers may enter invisibility again."}

As to what may or may not have happened between him and them, he would later comment \"they don't take vows of chastity you know.\"\nIn adulthood, Cain served as a schoolmaster and storyteller in Tristram. Cain didn't get on well with the children, and found it difficult to connect with them. He'd give lectures, but they didn't share his love of books. Of the fellow townsfolk, he counted &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt; as perhaps his closest friend. He also had fondness for &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt;, and respect for &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Cain married &lt;a href=\"Amelia%20Cain\"&gt;Amelia&lt;/a&gt; and had a son, &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain%20%28The%20Order%29\"&gt;Jered&lt;/a&gt;, who bore the name of Cain's Horadric &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;ancestor&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"timeline%231233\"&gt;1233&lt;/a&gt;. As the years drew on however, Cain became absorbed in scholarly pursuits, shutting out friends and family, and leaving no time for them. Tension rose between him and Amelia and often they argued, usually concerning Cain's lack of presence in his son's life. In &lt;a href=\"timeline%231237\"&gt;1237&lt;/a&gt;, with Cain now at the age of thirty-five, Amelia took Jered and left Tristram. However, bandits attacked their wagon, killing them. Cain received written notification of their deaths and later visited the site of the attack.\nCain served as the tutor for Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;. He grew greatly fond of the boy and found himself loving him akin to a son, despite Aidan's self-absorbed nature.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nDark Tidings.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Cain noticed (as did the rest of the town) how &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;'s mood had steadily darkened.\nReflecting on the events of the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231262\"&gt;past year&lt;/a&gt;, Cain began recording his thoughts in a &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;. He began to reflect on the tales that his mother had told him, as to whether there was truth to them. Could there really have been some evil entity buried underneath the town? He spent time in the library of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, going over old Horadric texts. They contained the stories that his mother had once told him, and he couldn't help but notice that the texts treated the accounts of angels and demons as history, not as myth. From what he read, and given how Leoric was acting, he could only guess that, based on what he had read, that &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself had affected the king.\nCain soon came to regret not acting upon his concerns, as the situation went from bad to worse. After the disappearance of his son, &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;, Leoric lashed out in a crazed frenzy &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt; told him of the events, of how the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20of%20Khanduras\"&gt;Royal Army of Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;'s superior forces (sent in a suicidal attack by the king). Gillian begged him to leave the library, vacating in time to escape the fight that erupted between &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;Lachdanan&lt;/a&gt; (who'd returned from the futile attack) and those of the king's men who remained loyal to him. He saw the bodies that Lachdanan and his men left in their wake as they hunted their former king, and could only wonder how things had come to this.\n&lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; led a group of villagers into the depths of the cathedral to look for Albrecht, only to lead them into the clutches of a demon called &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt;. Cain wondered if Lazarus was acting on his own accord, or was an unwitting pawn. The nights dragged on, and sleep did not come easily, as he heard the hellish drones emanating from the cathedral. He resolved to return to his texts, believing that they would hold the answer to defeating the evil that plagued them. Amid the chaos, horrific creatures began roaming the town by night, which reminded him of the ones he had read about in the old Horadric tomes. He came to realize that the tales his mother had told him of angels and demons were true. Although humbled, he was filled with a sense of purpose, believing that the Horadric knowledge could be used to fight the demons. From that day forward, he vowed to arm whomever he could with enough wisdom to defeat the evil that had arisen.\nMore and more townspeople left the village. They did however, receive a newcomer in the form of the &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, whom he met at the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;Tavern of the Rising Sun&lt;/a&gt;. That she was a witch was something she made no secret of, and Cain saw that she had access to arcane knowledge that he didn't. He wondered why she came to Tristram now, of all times, and felt that something was amiss with her. Eventually, he wound up the courage to speak to her, and Adria told Cain that she had come to Tristram to stop Diablo. She shared what she knew of demons, and he offered her stories about the Horadrim, &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, and other subjects in return. He found her knowledge of mysticism and demonology to be most valuable, and the two spent many nights pouring over the history of the Horadrim, the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith, and the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, she had interest in the Horadrim and tales related to &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. Adria's curiosity never alarmed Cain, though he suspected that she was looking for some kind of 'truth' among the old stories. Having immersed himself in their lore, Cain began to see himself as a Horadrim.\nAfter Adria's arrival, adventurers began to arrive at Tristram, either to test their mettle against the &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; that plagued it, or to obtain the rumored riches that lay beneath the cathedral. Cain could not consider any of them to be worthy of the name of \"hero\" however, and remained sequestered away, still scouring the old texts for answers. He did warn them against descending into the cathedral, and one by one, they ignored him. Their screams echoed out from the cathedral's depths.\nThe Lord of Terror.\nThe course of events changed with Aidan's return. Cain was impressed that the spoiled boy he'd tutored had returned from war a man, and began to refer to Aidan as \"the hero.\" Aidan was eager to plunge headfirst into the catacombs, but Cain urged caution, given their numbers, and that Aidan would be facing the reanimated bodies of those he had once known. He urged Aidan to let others accompany him, pointing to the likes of &lt;a href=\"Moreina\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;). Aidan consented, and Cain provided advice for Aidan and his allies. As the days passed by, Cain came to accept that it was indeed Diablo who was the root of the evil that plagued Tristram, even if he'd been unable to admit it. Aidan brought him the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Lazarus\"&gt;Staff of Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, further confirming his suspicions. There was now no longer any doubt that Lazarus was the one who kidnapped Albrecht, and perhaps even freed Diablo from his ancient prison. However, he suspected that Lazarus didn't have much longer to live, and Aidan proved him correct.\nEvents reached a head when, one night, the wail of a child emanated from the depths beneath the cathedral. Cain awoke, and realized that Diablo had met his end. Unable to return to his sleep after such an unsettling cry, Cain ventured outdoors to await Aidan's return. He finally emerged, covered in &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. Cain was glad that Aidan had survived the ordeal, and that the horrible events that had plagued Tristram were behind them. However, he remained troubled, wondering if the recent horrors could have been avoided if he had not dismissed his legacy so lightly.\nThe Fall of Tristram.\nThe defeat of Diablo kickstarted celebrations in Tristram that lasted weeks. Aidan humbly endured them, but Cain could see that the scars he carried weren't just physical. Despite the celebrations, Cain was reserved\u2013 the ground was cursed, and he thought it better to just burn the town to the ground. He gathered some books from the cathedral, where he learnt of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. To commemorate their victory, Cain addressed the town, and tossed the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Lazarus\"&gt;Staff of Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; into a fire. He noted that the fire seemed to 'embrace' the staff, and watched as it emitted green smoke as it burnt, emitting a high, hissing scream as it did so. Eventually the staff was completely incinerated. Afterwards, he discussed matters with Griswold, while out of the corner of his eye, he saw Aidan walking away with Adria.\nIt was days before Aidan related his experiences to Cain, describing his battle with Diablo in an area that he referred to as \"the threshold of Hell itself.\" He further told Cain of how Diablo had forced him to relive his worst nightmares, and how in killing Diablo, he had killed his brother, Albrecht, whom Diablo had taken as his host. As he reached the end of his tale, Aidan began murmuring \"I thought I could contain it\" over and over. He rambled further about his \"brothers,\" but Cain interpreted them as meaningless ramblings. He offered Aidan counsel, but he remained distant. However, while Cain thought that Aidan's melancholia was simply a reaction to the horrors he had experienced beneath the cathedral, in truth, he had become enthralled by Diablo himself. The day after his conversation with Cain, Aidan left town. Adria informed him that he had headed east to find mystics that might help him expunge his nightmares. Adria herself left town shortly after Aidan did. Adria's departure filled Cain with a deep and overwhelming sense of loss. He later learned that she had taken &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt; with her into the East.\nShortly after Adria's departure, and mere weeks after the death of Diablo, a legion of demons attacked the town. The townspeople were slaughtered and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;reanimated&lt;/a&gt; afterwards. Cain was severely wounded, and was placed in a cage as the town burnt and the people were slaughtered, awaiting his own end while he was forced to watch his people die around him. With plenty of time to reflect and mourn, he thought back on Aidan's words\u2013 \"I thought I could contain it.\" Cain wondered if he was referring to Diablo, and if so, what were his true intentions in going east?\nThe Dark Wanderer.\nAlthough having lost hope, Cain was rescued from his cage by a new &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;. They were in pursuit of Aidan, though knew him only as \"the Dark Wanderer,\" and informed Cain of the corruption he had inflicted upon &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. The Wanderer had departed east, but &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; barred the passage from &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Cain decided to join them in the hope that his ancient knowledge might be of some help. He shared his fears with them that Diablo was guiding Aidan east to release &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; from their &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s, and urged them to give chase.\nCain resided at the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt;. While at the camp (or potentially in the following years), Cain entrusted Akara with a &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Bestiary\"&gt;Horadric origin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAndariel was slain, and Cain and the heroes across Aranoch to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. Though he told no-one, Cain had been marked by Diablo's terror. He often woke up in the night, suffering unholy visions of the destruction of Tristram, the slaughter of its people, and the dark acts carried out beneath the earth. He hoped that they would pass in time, but feared that he would never escape them. While in Lut Gholein, he gathered what information he could about the Wanderer, and while information was scarce, learnt that a man traveled with him named &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;. He could only wonder what part this man played in the Wanderer's goals.\nAt some point during his travels, Cain learnt that Adria had given birth to a daughter, and that Gillian was raising her in Caldeum. He made a note to come to Caldeum to see her when time permitted.\nCain and his fellows arrived in &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Valiant as the heroes were, they could not stop the Wanderer from freeing &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tomb of Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;. The group assumed that Baal and the Wanderer were now en route to &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt; to free &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;. Travelling across the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, Cain caught a fleeting glimpse of the Wanderer in the jungles that now strangled the area. He simultaneously wept for the man that Aidan had once been, and cursed him for the arrogance that had led him down this path. His companions brought news of their defeat of Mephisto, and that the Wanderer had become completely subsumed by Diablo. While in Kurast, he met with &lt;a href=\"Ormus\"&gt;Ormus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCain journeyed to Travincal, and was pained greatly in beholding the carnage that the heroes' conflict with Mephisto's thralls had caused. However, he knew that it wasn't over, for if Diablo was able to rally an army in Hell, he would most assuredly return to wreck havoc on Sanctuary. Thus, the heroes plunged through the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt;, and Cain followed them.\nThe gateway did not lead into Hell, but instead, to the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Cain found himself overwhelmed by the place, but remained committed to provide whatever assistance he could to the heroes. It was also here that Cain laid eyes on the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, who the heroes had first encountered in the Tomb of Tal Rasha. Tyrael greeted Cain, telling him that he knew his ancestor, Jered, and that he had been waiting to meet him for a long time. He told Cain about &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;, where Mephisto's soulstone could be destroyed. He stated that he had no doubt that Cain would be able to provide counsel to the heroes, but warned him that someday he might be required to do much more than that. That someday, he might not be here, and Cain would be required to face the darkness himself.\nThe heroes plunged down into Hell to destroy Mephisto's soulstone, and defeat Diablo. He found himself unnerved by the fortress, and welcomed the heroes' presence whenever they returned to the fortress.\nLord of Destruction.\nThe heroes brought Cain news of their defeat of Diablo, along with the destruction of his &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; (and that of Mephisto's). However, the news brought Cain little joy, as word reached them of a &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;demonic army&lt;/a&gt; marching upon &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of Baal. The group departed for the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to help stem the tide. Cain remained in &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; while his companions climbed the slopes of Arreat to confront Baal. However, although the heroes succeeded in defeating Baal, it was only after he had corrupted the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Cain knew little of the object, but &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; had informed the heroes that it had to be destroyed. Cain could only hope that Tyrael was making the right choice. Before he did so however, Tyrael warned him that destroying the Worldstone would leave Sanctuary vulnerable to both Heaven and Hell.\nAftermath.\nThe resulting explosion from the Worldstone destroyed Baal, Tyrael, Mount Arreat, and much of the land around it. Cain and his fellows survived the blast however, and parted ways shortly afterwards. Cain warned the heroes as to what the destruction of the Worldstone could mean for Sanctuary, but the heroes departed, wanting to return to their loved ones and rebuild their lives. Cain supposed he could hardly blame them, but with Tristram destroyed, he had no home to return to. Remembering Tyrael's warning, Cain began searching for information that might aid him in defending the world against the invasion he feared was coming. His focus on the coming invasion caused him to renege on his former promise to see Gillian when time permitted.\nAt some point after the destruction of the Worldstone, Cain traveled to a burnt out sanitarium, where Marius had been killed by Baal. Marius had been driven mad by his experiences with Diablo, and he'd carved his story into the walls of his cell with his fingernails. They were still legible, despite the damage to Marius's room.\nCain headquartered himself in a &lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, burning candles through the night.\nImmortal.\nWortham.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;Five years&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, Cain conducted a Horadric ritual that allowed him to ascertain the location of three Worldstone shards; one at &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;, one at &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, and one in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;. He sought to obtain and destroy all the shards, lest they bring calamity upon the mortal realm.\nHe came to Wortham to destroy the first shard, but found that the town had come under attack by &lt;a href=\"Damned%20Cultist\"&gt;cultists&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of townsfolk had disappeared, much to the terror of those who remained inside the town. &lt;a href=\"Lyra\"&gt;Lyra&lt;/a&gt; told Cain that a &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; had saved &lt;a href=\"Korrin\"&gt;Korrin&lt;/a&gt; from the cultists. Later, &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; himself appeared before the villagers, who flocked to Cain in terror. He tried to get the villagers to remain calm, and greeted the adventurer(s) who had answered the mayor's call for aid, but informed them that the mayor had been killed before they'd arrived. He told them that most of the missing townsfolk had been taken west, but none among the &lt;a href=\"Wortham%20Guard\"&gt;Wortham Guard&lt;/a&gt; were able to make the journey.\nThe adventurer(s) told Cain that the &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;cultists' leader&lt;/a&gt; had mentioned a \"Lord of Damnation,\" and that he was seeking some \"prize.\" Realizing that \"the prize\" had to be Wortham's Worldstone shard, he told the adventurer(s) to find the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Lair\"&gt;cultists' lair&lt;/a&gt;, and put an end to things. They returned and informed Cain that the cultists had been calling out to a demon named &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Damnation. Cain was unfamiliar with the name, and to his knowledge, no \"Lord of Damnation\" existed. He revealed that he had come to Wortham to search for the Worldstone shard that had landed nearby, and advised them of the existence of the Ashwold shard. \nTheir meeting was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Xul\"&gt;Xul&lt;/a&gt;; one of the heroes who had aided Cain against the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; five years prior. Talking through a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, the Necromancer told Cain that his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Lethes\"&gt;Lethes&lt;/a&gt;, had acquired a shard of the Worldstone, and brought ruin upon Ashwold. Cain told the hero(es) to retrieve the shard and then meet him at &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, where it would be safer to destroy them.\nWestmarch.\nAfter arriving in the city, Cain asked &lt;a href=\"Piri\"&gt;Piri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt; to meet with the hero(es) outside the city and send them to him. He met with the hero(es), who delivered the Wortham shard. However, he had no means of destroying such a powerful artifact, and for now, all they could do was hide it from sight. He revealed that the Horadric ritual he'd conducted had located the third shard within the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;. Before they left, he informed them about &lt;a href=\"legendary%20gems\"&gt;legendary gems&lt;/a&gt;, and advised them to find Charsi for more information.\nCain sent a message to &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; to pass onto the hero(es); that he'd arrived in the city, and was awaiting their arrival.\nCain met with the hero(es) inside his &lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;, and attempted to conduct a ritual that would destroy the Worldstone fragments they had obtained. He noted that they still pulsed with a \"corrupting power;\" the result of Baal's attempt to corrupt the artifact five years ago. However, the ritual had no effect, and he requested the hero(es) join him, trying to mirror the actions of the ancient Horadrim. However, even this wasn't enough, as a wave of force sent Cain flying against the wall, and the shards spawned a number of demons that the hero(es) were force to destroy. The hero(es) slew the demons, but while Cain was fine physically, emotionally, he despaired. Baal had corrupted the shards absolutely, which meant that they could not be destroyed. He found himself at a loss as to how to proceed, at least at first. Reasoning that there had to be a way, he began consulting Horadric texts. He advised the hero(es) to see Charsi, who wanted to show them Westmarch, and return after awhile.\nWhile the hero(es) wandered Westmarch, Cain looked up information on &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;\u2013 how he knew of the construction of the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s, how the Horadrim had killed him, and how they had subsequently attempted to expunge Kulle's knowledge from the world. However, the Horadrim were not as thorough as they believed. The hero(es) returned, and Cain told them that he believed that &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;one of Kulle's libraries&lt;/a&gt; had survived, buried beneath the &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt;. If they traveled there, they might be able to uncover information as to how to destroy the corrupted Worldstone shards. The hero(es) agreed to head there immediately. To this end, Cain wrote a letter which they handed to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rehm\"&gt;Captain Rehm&lt;/a&gt;. The two had crossed paths before, and Cain called in the favor Rehm owed him by having him transport the hero(es) to Shassar by ship.\nThe letter worked, and Cain met the hero(es) at the docks. He bid them farewell, and told them he would be at his workshop when they returned.\nThe Helliquary.\n\"Note: The following events can potentially occur at any point during &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAt some point, the hero(es) returned to Westmarch, where they met Cain at his workshop. He directed them to &lt;a href=\"Rayek\"&gt;Rayek&lt;/a&gt;; a he'd befriended while they'd been away. They later returned, telling Cain that they had discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Einfrinn%20Tree\"&gt;Einfrinn Tree&lt;/a&gt; was holding back demons called \"&lt;a href=\"Wrathborne\"&gt;Wrathborne&lt;/a&gt;.\" Cain told them of the Wrathborne's history, urging the hero(es) to stop them if they had the means.\nFall of Damnation.\nThe hero(es), with Cain's help were able to destroy most of the Worldstone shards, but not before Skarn obtained a shard for himself. Fortunately, the hero(es) were able to kill Skarn, but his death allowed Diablo's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; to return from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnfortunately, that was not the end of bad news. Upon destroying Skarn's shard, his soul was freed and returned to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;\nWith the return of Diablo's soul, Cain began to research ancient tomes for legends about the End of Days.\nThe Fractured Plane.\n\"Note: The following events can potentially occur at any point during &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;, though are implied to take place after the end of the main questline.\"\nCain obtained the &lt;a href=\"Sumina%20Glass\"&gt;Sumina Glass&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; from a member of the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Blades\"&gt;Amber Blades&lt;/a&gt;. He believed that the Blade had little idea as to what they were pawning, as the relic provided passage to the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Plane\"&gt;Fractured Plane&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote to the Shard-seeker, asking them to him when next they were in Westmarch.\nCain repeatedly tried to use the artifact to gain access to the Fractured Plane, but had no success. He asked the Shard-seeker to aid him, similar to how they'd done so with the Worldstone shards, but success still evaded him. Since the relic had come from Kulle's library, the Shard-seeker suggested taking it to &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt;. Cain agreed.\nThe Shard-seeker returned with the Sumia Glass, its power fully restored. Cain used it to open a gateway to the Fractured Plane, and advised the Shard-seeker that traversing the realm could aid them in their fight against Diablo.\nForgotten Nightmares.\nCain continued to research tomes about legends of the prophecy of the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;. He received a &lt;a href=\"Plea%20for%20Help\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt;. The letter was from a &lt;a href=\"Shura\"&gt;Veradani Monk&lt;/a&gt; requesting help from the Shard-seeker to stop a resurgent darkness that threatened to overwhelm both &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Sentinel's Watch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sanctified%20Earth%20Monastery\"&gt;Sanctified Earth Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.. \nThe Shard-seeker was able to stop the darkness and uncover a &lt;a href=\"Seeker%20of%20Truth\"&gt;hidden truth&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Crusade\"&gt;Zakarum Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Cain was refused audience with King &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt;; whose ears had been poisoned by Westmarch's nobles that did not want to believe that the world was \"falling to ruin\". Because of this, Cain sent word to &lt;a href=\"Ormus\"&gt;Ormus&lt;/a&gt;, seeking help to stop the rising forces of Hell He made efforts to gather allies to stand against Hell.\nStarsign.\nOrmus sent his his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Karshun\"&gt;Karshun&lt;/a&gt; in his stead, who had spent much time studying cults of the Great Evils. Cain ordered the Shard-seeker to meet Karshun and show him the way to his workshop.\nKarshun was able to astral project himself and the Shard-seeker to scry the closet sect of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately they were discovered and narrowly managed to escape, but Karshun was injured by the backlash. Cain bid the Shard-seeker on a journey to &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint\"&gt;Stormpoint&lt;/a&gt; island, while he took Karshun to a healer.\nCult of Terror.\nThe Shard-seeker returned with bad news the Cultists were able to make off with the shard. Fortunately, they needed to figure out a way to send it to their master, and had the shard delivered to the &lt;a href=\"Bride%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Bride of Hell&lt;/a&gt; in order to fulfill that purpose. Karshun rebuked the Shard-seeker for not having the retrieval of the shard as their highest priority (even if it was because they had to save &lt;a href=\"Esmund\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fern\"&gt;orphans&lt;/a&gt;). Cain rebuked him for that, reminding him that no life saved is a waste. He announced a good news; King &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt; was sending reinforcements to Stormpoint, though it'll take some time for them to get there. He then promised to search ancient texts to find information about the Bride.\nLater the Shard-seeker returned with &lt;a href=\"Zatham\"&gt;Zatham&lt;/a&gt;; an ally they made while at Stormpoint. Zatham announced that he had a contact who identified possible Terror Cultists in Westmarch, and sent the Shard-seeker to follow the lead. They returned with news that the cult were going to meet in Wortham. Zatham and the Shard-seeker then left to investigate. They returned with news that the cult failed to deliver the shard to Diablo, and were looking for a way to purify the shard. They also brought back the partly burnt pieces of a parchment. After reconstructing it, Cain found out that it was a marine map, with an island within the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Sea\"&gt;Forgotten Sea&lt;/a&gt; marked on it. Zatham identified the island as the &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt;, but said that they would need the &lt;a href=\"Pathstone\"&gt;Pathstone&lt;/a&gt; to navigate the waters. After recovering the Pathstone, they had to wait for Zatham to find a way to attune it to the island. Cain then announced that he had to prepare for a journey\nAfter finishing his preparations, Charsi and Karshun helped him to pack his belongings, while Rayek went to arrange for a cart. Karshun tried to dissuade him from the journey, citing his advanced age, but Cain was adamant. The Shard-seeker arrived with news that Zatham had found a way to harness the Pathstone. After inquiry about the activity in the workshop, Cain informed them that he was leaving to follow a rumor about the end of days. He told them to inform his his companion for the journey (a paladin named &lt;a href=\"Akarat%20%28paladin%29\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt;), who was at the docks, that he'll be joining him in a short while. Before he left, he handed over his workshop to the joint supervision of Karshun and Rayek, and told Charsi that she was free to make use of it if needed.\nThe Order.\nThe Secret Repository.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;Seven years&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of the Worldstone, Cain met the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Akarat%20%28Paladin%29\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. He told him his stories, and they set out into the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt; in search for an ancient &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; repository. Recently, before this, Cain had started dreaming about his childhood and his mother's stories, waking up in a cold sweat each night. Regardless, they made their way into the repository, and Cain found himself being reminded of Aidan by Akarat, given their similar youth and naivete. Making his way into the repository, Cain realized that he'd entered a ritual chamber, where Vizjerei had summoned demons into Sanctuary. One demon was still present, and tried to torment Cain, taking the form of Aidan before dividing itself into replicas of Jered and Amelia. Akarat came in and tried to strike the demon with his sword, but it was no use, as it went straight through its body. Akarat might have strength of steel, but he was suffering from the demon's psychological assault even more than Cain, and the demon ended up possessing him. As the demon mocked Cain, it let slip that others had come to the repository before he'd arrived, and hinted as to the &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;true master&lt;/a&gt; that he served. Cain was able to reverse the summoning spell that had brought the demon into the world, sending it back to Hell, and with it, Akarat's body.\nCain made his way back to the surface, and found that among the texts he'd scavenged from the repository were Horadric ones. One referred to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Al%20Cut\"&gt;Tomb of Al Cut&lt;/a&gt;, and the rise of a false leader arising from the ashes after Heaven laid waste to Sanctuary. However, the demon had also mentioned a savior, \"hidden among thousands in plain sight, not three days' journey from here.\" Cain set out for Caldeum, as it matched the distance/travel time the demon had referenced, plus, it would have vast amounts of literature that he could study.\nCaldeum.\nArriving in Caldeum, Cain went to Gillian's house. To his dismay, he could see that Gillian's experiences in Tristram had taken a toll on her, both physical and psychological. He also kept his eye on &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, whom he knew to be Adria's daughter. He could also sense that she had some magic about her. Regardless, he asked for Gillian's help in identifying the makers of a replica book he'd found in the depository; the one of Horadric text. Looking at the binding, Gillian mentioned a bookseller named &lt;a href=\"Kulloom\"&gt;Kulloom&lt;/a&gt;. He was confronted with the severity of Gillian's madness, and was wrecked with guilt that he hadn't come sooner.\nCain stayed the night, and the following morning, found Gillian in much better spirits. He set off in search for Kulloom, and was advised to search for him in the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Sands%20Inn\"&gt;Searing Sands Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Cain attracted a few stares from people who thought he was of the Zakarum faith, but finding Kulloom, he recognised Cain as just being a wanderer. His impressions of Gillian and Leah were less favorable however. Cain showed him the book he'd found, and Kulloom's mood darkened, telling him of a group that was calling itself Horadrim. As for the book, he opined that it had been bound in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. He offered to make some inquiries, but Cain said he'd go to Kurast himself. To that end, Kulloom told Cain to speak with a man named &lt;a href=\"Hyland\"&gt;Hyland&lt;/a&gt;. On a final note, Cain asked him if he'd ever heard of a man named &lt;a href=\"Al%20Cut\"&gt;Al Cut&lt;/a&gt;, but Kulloom responded in the negative.\nCain left the inn, intent on heading for Kurast. However, Kulloom's words about this group of \"Horadrim\" weighed heavily on him, and he was guilty about leaving Gillian with Leah given the former's state. He doubted that the Horadrim were real (likely just a mage group), but did worry about the Tomb of Al Cut. He spent the rest of the day in the city, searching for any information on a group of mages who might refer to themselves as Horadrim. He had no luck, as people weren't keen on talking to him, especially when he mentioned Kurast. Hours later, with nothing to show for his efforts, he returned to Gillian's house as night began to fall. He found that Gillian's mood resembled that of their first meeting rather than the one earlier in the morning. Cain realized that Gillian was in more dire straits than she'd let on, as she'd lost her job as a barmaid and was low on money. Suddenly, Leah sat up from her bed, though with her eyes closed, she let out a wave of magic that slammed Gillian against a wall. Leah woke up, terrified, and Gillian lost it, screaming about the dead coming for Leah. Cain used some powder to incapacitate both of them.\nLeft with time to reflect, Cain surmised that Leah had reacted defensively to Gillian. However, the magic she'd used was unlike any he'd seen before, and he knew that without training, Leah could become very dangerous. Cain fell asleep, and when he awoke, realized that Gillian's house was on fire. Cain called out for Gillian, but heard no answer. He found Leah though, who begged him to help save her adoptive mother, but Cain explained that she was likely already dead. A man named &lt;a href=\"James\"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; broke down the door and managed to get Cain and Leah out, while men used buckets of water to attempt to extinguish the blaze. James took them to his house, and Cain reflected that given the rumors that already existed about Leah and Gillian, the blaze likely wasn't going to improve their reputation. Gillian was drawn out of her house, but ranted at the crowd, claiming that she'd lit the fire herself to \"burn away the sin.\" She yelled that the world was coming to an end and accused Cain of being a demon. Cain tried to get her to calm down, but failed, and the people were whispering. Gillian eventually calmed down, begging Cain to \"make it stop.\" A nobleman suggested that Gillian be taken to a madhouse. Cain grieved for Gillian, knowing that none of the people could comprehend the horrors Tristram had marked her with, but also knew that there was nothing he could do for her. He told the nobleman that he would take Leah with him, and that he would leave Caldeum at first light. Gillian yelled at Cain, briefly slipping back into madness, before whispering \"go to Kurast. They are waiting for you there, Deckard. Your brothers. Take Leah and go, please, and search for Al Cut. It is our only chance.\" Cain tried to get more out of her, but she was dragged away to the &lt;a href=\"Caldeum%20Madhouse\"&gt;Caldeum Madhouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith a heavy heart, Cain returned to James and Leah. He told her that her mother could no longer care for her, and that she had to come with him. Leah remained mute, and Cain said that they would leave immediately.\nThe Road to Kurast.\nCain and Leah left Caldeum, travelling down the road to Kurast. While he was concerned about bringing Leah to Kurast, he had to consider the possibility that these &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s who called themselves Horadrim would be found there. They travelled all through the day, exchanging few words, before settling down to camp. Sitting by the fire, Cain told Leah that Gillian wasn't her real mother. Her real mother was &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, who'd travelled with Gillian to Caldeum and given birth to her there. Leah accused Cain of lying. She ran off into the night, and Cain could sense her magic energy crackling in the air around him. He found her lying motionless and unresponsive on the ground near a river, and carried her back to the fire, where she sat slumped in shock. Eventually she opened up, wanting to know everything. He answered her as best as he could, telling Leah abut how Adria had arrived in Tristram, but that he'd read a report months ago that Adria had perished in the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;. This brought Leah to tears, but she eventually fell asleep. And likewise, so did Cain.\nThey set out the next day, not discussing events from the night before. However, Leah noticed the lack of anyone else on the road they were travelling down, and Cain revealed that they were headed for Kurast. Leah, knowing Kurast's reputation, accused Cain of being a Sorcerer, wanting to sacrifice her. Leah ran off, and given his age, Cain had no hope of keeping up with her. He headed on down the road, but found Leah waiting for him at the top of a hill, stating that she had nowhere to go, and no-one to help her. Cain assured her that he was trying to help her, but that she couldn't run off like that. Leah noted that Cain was speaking to her a lot like Gillian had, plainly stating that he was strange and that she didn't like him much. She pointed to a town on the bottom of the hill, wondering if the people there could help them. Cain consulted his map, but found that the town didn't appear on it. Still, he led Leah down the hill to the town.\nLord Brand's Manor.\nBy the time they neared the town, night was close. The town guards were suspicious, but stood down with the arrival of Lord &lt;a href=\"Brand\"&gt;Brand&lt;/a&gt;. Brand told the pair that they could stay at his &lt;a href=\"Brand%20Manor\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt;. Passing through the gates, Cain noted how empty the town's streets were. Only a dozen townsfolk were present, and all of them looked terminally ill. He began to wonder if he and Leah should have taken their chances in the jungle, but it was too late, as Brand led them to his manor. The two were served supper, and Brand inquired about their travels. Cain and Leah remained silent though, and after finishing, Cain evaded answering as to why they were headed for Kurast. He offered Brand payment for the hospitality, but Brand refused, instead offering them a card reading via &lt;a href=\"Taratcha\"&gt;Taratcha&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, the two were led up to their rooms, both of them showing symptoms akin to being drugged.\nCain had nightmares before he woke, and when he did awake, found himself in a bare room with his arms and legs immobile. His rucksack and staff were out of reach, and he couldn't see Leah. Brand entered the room and mocked Cain, telling them that he would stay in his manor for now. That his master commanded it. The Hell would destroy the world and the gates of Heaven would fall. That they couldn't stop it, but they might be spared if they sacrificed the girl. On cue, Cain heard a high-pitched scream from the adjacent room. Afterwards, Leah came into his own room, displaying the magic that had previously manifested itself. Cain used her magic to tear Cain's bed to pieces and sent the surrounding cultists flying against the walls. Cain, no longer immobilized, got to his feet, but was unable to wake Leah from her trance. Grabbing her hand, Cain led Leah out of the manor and into the town. The fog was thick, and townspeople crowded around, chanting. However, they were slow and clumsy, and he was able to swing at them with his staff. Looking back at the manor, he saw Brand, and a dismal, one story house in its place. Leah, having returned to her senses, ran. Cain did as well, but lost sight of her in the fog. Someone called out to him, telling him that the girl was safe. Cain slipped into an alley, following the voice. He found a man, along with Leah, and he led them out of the village. Cain recognised him as being a &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;. Heading into the jungle, the Monk told them that his name was &lt;a href=\"Mikulov\"&gt;Mikulov&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had been tracking Cain since Caldeum. They briefly spoke, Mikulov explaining that he had written scrolls written by the &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; scholars that warned of a demonic invasion of Sanctuary. Scrolls that were similar to Cain's Horadric texts. Doing the bidding of his gods, he had come to correct an imbalance in the world. Afterwards, Cain and Leah fell asleep.\nMikulov.\nThe following morning, Cain reflected on what the demon had told him in the Vizjerei ruins, that his savior was \"so close, hidden among thousands in plain sight, not three days' journey from here.\" He was wary of putting too much stock in the words of a demon, but he also knew that their lies could be hidden with the truth. Regardless, Mikulov announced that they had to wake Leah and head for Kurast. Cain told Mikulov that he could not take her there\u2013Kurast was no place for a child, and it was a mistake for him to have taken her this far with him. Once he found a home for her, he could get back on the road. Mikulov told him that there was no time for it, that the month of &lt;a href=\"Ratham\"&gt;Ratham&lt;/a&gt; was only days away. He further explained that he had had visions of hidden chambers underground, filled with the dead. And a man who called himself the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20One\"&gt;Dark One&lt;/a&gt;, who in the visions, called the dead to light. The scrolls he possessed spoke of a coming war and the rising of the dead, which would occur on the first day of Ratham. Cain read the scrolls and noted that they were similar to his own, albeit with an exact date. Assuming they were correct, that meant they only had seven days to avert the coming disaster.\nCain reflected on Brand's words, of the master he had claimed to have served. They guessed that this was this \"Dark One\" that Mikulov spoke of. Mikulov revealed that this Dark One served another evil, and going by its description, Cain recognised it as Belial. He told Mikulov of his encounter with the demon in the tomb, and Mikulov concluded that they had to find the group who called themselves Horadrim. Which left them the issue of Leah. When he raised the issue, she begged him not to leave her. Relenting, Cain announced that they would head for Kurast together.\nKurast.\nCain suffered nightmares on the trip, recalling his imprisonment in Tristram. Finally, they arrived at Kurast and began their search for Hyland. One of the people they met, aghast they'd come to \"stay\" here, rambled of people coming from &lt;a href=\"Gea%20Kul\"&gt;Gea Kul&lt;/a&gt;. The man led them to &lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Circle\"&gt;The Red Circle&lt;/a&gt;, an inn, where they met &lt;a href=\"Cyrus\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;. They asked him about Hyland, to whom Cyrus was less than positively inclined. However, he told them to head to the docks tomorrow, that Hyland would be there.\nThe following morning, the three of them headed for the docks. They found Hyland there, trying to rally a crowd, but when Cain mentioned that he had studied the ways of the Horadrim, the crowd turned on them, accusing him of being a &lt;a href=\"Feeder\"&gt;Feeder&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20One\"&gt;Dark One&lt;/a&gt; himself. Two men attacked, but Mikulov easily dispatched them. Afterwards, Cain talked with Hyland in a makeshift building that doubled as his 'office.' Cain showed him a Horadric book, and Hyland, after studying it, told Cain that it was likely made by a man who had come to stay in Kurast. A group of young scholars had come here looking for someone who could reproduce some ancient literature, and had found Gareth Rau. Eventually, impressed with the works the scholars had brought him, he joined the order and left Kurast. However, from what Hyland had heard, Rau had been killed by a &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; who was called the Dark One. He further explained that the scholars who had come here spoke of the Horadrim as if they were Horadrim themselves, hence why the people had reacted so negatively, fearing that the Horadrim had been corrupted. The people believed that the Horadric texts, and the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; they contained, had brought the Dark One here.\nHyland told them about the Feeders, and that the people believed the scholars had summoned them into Sanctuary. However, he doubted that the scholars had willingly done this, venturing that they had been corrupted. He showed Cain some sketches he had retrieved from a dying boy. On one of them were the words &lt;a href=\"Al%20Cut\"&gt;Al Cut&lt;/a&gt;. He warned Cain that if they stayed in Kurast, they might not have to worry about finding more about the Feeders. Chances were they'd see one in person soon enough.\nCain talked to Mikulov about what Hyland had told him. Cain had little doubt that the Dark One was the false leader from the book of Horadric prophecies he'd found in the ruins, and most likely the same man Mikulov had seen in his visions. Also likely the master Lord Brand had served. Mikulov suggested that they head for Gea Kul. They returned to The Red Circle, but Cain shunned the Monk's company. He needed to search for answers, and they had only five days left until the 1st of Ratham. That night, they were attacked by a Feeder, which incapacitated Cyrus. However, Mikulov was able to drive it off. Tomorrow, they would head to Gea Kul.\nGea Kul.\nThe three traveled to Gea Kul, finding it dilapidated and its people gripped by fear. They were approached by &lt;a href=\"Hanos%20Jeronnan\"&gt;Hanos Jeronnan&lt;/a&gt;, who took them to the &lt;a href=\"Captain%27s%20Table\"&gt;Captain's Table&lt;/a&gt;. He gave them food, and Cain sensed a kindness about the man, agreeing to trust him. Cain asked him about the supposed Horadrim that existed. He explained that the people held them accountable for the ills that had befallen the town. He told them about the man who'd led them, &lt;a href=\"Gareth%20Rau\"&gt;Gareth Rau&lt;/a&gt;, who had come with the Horadrim months before. A large &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tower\"&gt;stone tower&lt;/a&gt; had been built on the edge of the sea. However, Rau disappeared, the group went into mourning, and that was when the troubles began, as Feeders began invading people's homes in the night. He explained that the order had vacated the area a couple of months ago, but there was a hidden place in the town where they'd gathered to study. He didn't know its exact location, but offered to take the trio to the area where it was.\nCain wondered if Jeronnan might be leading him into a trap, but decided to trust the man. He followed him back into the streets while leaving Mikulov with Leah. He took Cain to a street with rundown shacks, telling him that they'd meet here, then disappear. He gave Cain a horn, telling him that blowing it would keep those corrupted by Feeders at bay. Jeronnan left, and Cain inspected the sight. If this new group of Horadrim was like the old one, they'd be hiding in plain sight using a spell of concealment. Using the Vizjerei spellbook he had picked up in the ruins, he was able to find a Horadrim symbol carved on one of the larger stone buildings. He ducked into it, closing the door behind him.\nCain descended down stone steps into the gloom. At the bottom, he found a slashed Horadric tapestry, finding that it had been slashed with claws rather than a blade. A creature emerged from the gloom, but was saved by a white-hooded figure, who led him down a corridor beyond the tapestry. He introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Egil\"&gt;Egil&lt;/a&gt;; a member of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;\u2013 the Horadrim. Cain's mind started to race, but he had no time to contemplate the questions within it as he followed Egil through the gloom. He told Cain that the creature was an &lt;a href=\"Unburied\"&gt;Unburied&lt;/a&gt;, and that this place was the original First Ones meeting site before they left Gea Kul. He was trying to retrieve some texts, but was afraid that they might now be ruined. He explained that the First Ones were in a state of transition. Cain asked if it was because of Rau, to which Egil responded \"it is complicated.\" They returned to the Captain's Table, where they reunited with Leah and Mikulov. Egil took them into the wilds outside the town, leading them to the First Ones.\nThe First Ones.\nThe men they met with were initially suspicious, but after Cain showed them his reproduction of the Horadric text, they became more animated. Some of the First Ones treated Cain with adulation, others ignored him. Egil explained that there were those who believed in the future of the Horadrim and those who didn't, hence the divide. Mikulov explained about the urgency of their situation, given how Ratham was approaching, but Cain noticed that the men before him knew few actual details about the dangers approaching Sanctuary.\nEgil told Cain about the formation of the First Ones, and it matched up with what Hyland had told him. He further elaborated on Rau, and how the First Ones had forsaken him when he'd gone down a dark path. Cain concluded that one of the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; had corrupted him. Cain beheld the tension between Egil and other members of the group, some pressing heading for their homes, while Egil pointed out that because of what Rau had done to the land around the Black Tower, there were no homes for them to go back to. Disheartened, Cain walked outside the caves\u2013 the group was a disaster, he reflected. Mikulov approached him and correctly deduced the source of Cain's discomfort. Egil also approached him, explaining how some had lost faith in the Horadrim's mission. He hoped Cain would be their leader, that there were those still eager to learn. He showed Cain the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt;, which they had retrieved near the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. He begged Cain to take it, to pass on his knowledge to the First Ones. Cain acquiesced and headed back into the caves, telling Egil to tell him everything he could remember about his time in Gea Kul.\nCain, in addition to helping sort out the group's misconceptions, pressed for information on the Tomb of Al Cut, or any mention of &lt;a href=\"Al%20Cut\"&gt;Al Cut&lt;/a&gt; himself. Egil revealed that the First Ones had been in the same tomb that Cain had been in with Akarat. Egil told him that more texts might be inside their Horadric library in Gea Kul. They approached the town using the tunnels located under it. On the way, Cain told the group stories of his role in the persuit of the Dark Wanderer, and Baal's actions at Mount Arreat. He did this to inspire the First Ones, but recounting it now, he found himself inspired by his own words. Arriving in the library, Cain was impressed with the collection. The companion text was found, which detailed a battle between &lt;a href=\"Horazon\"&gt;Horazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Bartuc had prevailed, and had returned to the city under the cover of darkness and used his demonic powers to bury the city beneath the ground. The city's name was Al Cut. Gea Kul had been built atop of it.\nThe Dark One.\nAfter the moment of realization, they discovered that Egil had gone missing. They were able to find a hidden chamber, and Egil there, or rather, something that had possessed him. Cain realized that Egil had been possessed by Rau. Mikulov attacked him, but Rau easily incapacitated the Monk with a flash of green light. Rau tormented Cain with visions; a memory of the day when he'd learnt of Amelia and Jered's death. When Cain came to, he found Egil's fingers around his throat, and that the man's face had changed. No longer Egil or Rau, but this time, Belial, talking through his servant. Belial mocked him, and claimed that everything Cain had done had been in service of the Lord of Lies. Cain began to believe Belial's words, but Mikulov came to and plunged a knife into Egil's body. Belial reacted with mild amusement in regards to his vessel being killed. Cain, however, fled the chamber, as Belial's words echoed in his mind. That, and the demon's instructions to \"check the book.\" Returning to the library, he found the book Belial was referring to, and the words written in &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; upon it...\n\"The girl is mine.\"\nThe Eleventh Hour.\nCain returned to the First Ones, and learnt that Leah had been taken. &lt;a href=\"Farris\"&gt;Farris&lt;/a&gt; explained that townspeople from Gea Kul had attacked the group, alongside &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. They fought back, and Leah was able to kill several of the attackers with her &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, but she was abducted, and her &lt;a href=\"Lund\"&gt;protector&lt;/a&gt; killed. His grief turning to anger, Farris turned on Cain, holding him responsible for what had happened, and suggested that the First Ones disband. Cain, caught up in his own despair, didn't challenge the assertion. Mikulov tried to bolster his spirits, but Cain didn't want to hear it. In his view, he was not even a Horadrim, just a crude shadow of what he might had been. The truth was that they were alone, and that the month of Ratham was upon them. Mikulov went to pray to the gods while Cain returned to the clearing where the First Ones had been. He found what was left of the group packing up their personal items. The attack had shattered the group, and Cain knew that what was left of the First Ones would be no match for Rau. Thinking of Leah however, shook him out of his self-pity and despair. He knew, deep down, that Leah was still alive, and rallied the spirits of the First Ones. Mikulov returned, and Cain declared that they would assault the tower. As a show of strength, he utilized the Horadric Cube, empowering his staff. The First Ones were behind him, and he began planning their assault.\nAssault on the Dark Tower.\nCain met with Jeronnan on the edge of the jungle; the only way the plan was going to succeed was if the captain made a distraction, which Jeronnan agreed to. In the meantime, Cain and the First Ones studied maps of the tunnels that ran directly under the tower. The First Ones gathered roots and minerals for Cain to make explosives, and the plan fell into place. Jeronnan and the few remaining citizens not in Belial's service would march on the tower directly, while Cain and the First Ones would use the tunnels to gain access to the tower. It was a small group of 25 men, and poorly armed at that, but they were able to enter the tower and fight their way through Belial's servants. Heading through the tunnels, they came into a large open area, which Cain realized was Al Cut, buried beneath the surface. As awe inspiring as the city was however, Cain knew that they couldn't linger, as they had until dawn for the sun to rise on the 1st of Ratham.\nAs they made their way through, Cain heard a voice, which he recognised as belonging to Rau. Rau bid Cain find him and \"learn the truth.\" Rau claimed that Jeronnan and Leah were dead, and Cain reminded himself that this was a servant of Belial, and that he should not listen to him. However, he couldn't help but wonder if he and Rau did have things in common...and that in listening to him at all, if he'd made a terrible mistake. Whatever the case, the group came under attack, and Rau possessed Farris in a similar manner he had Egil. To make matters worse, some of the First Ones had thrown in their lot with Farris as well. Thanks to Mikulov however, the attack was repelled, and Farris and his men subdued. Some of the First Ones stayed behind to guard the traitors while what was left of the group assaulted the Dark Tower directly. Mikulov led the charge, but the other First Ones were able to pull their weight as well, holding the enemy at bay while Cain looked for Leah.\nMoving through the tower, Cain found his mind enter a new state, as if he was observing his own body. This became an observation of his entire life, but when he heard Leah scream, he was able to pick up the pace. He found Leah, guarded by Feeders. Using the powers of his staff, Cain was able to get the Feeders to retreat, and while Leah was unconcious, she was still alive. However, he was confronted by Rau, this time face to face. Rau revealed that he was the descendant of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, betrayed by the Horadrim. Cain said that Tal Rasha was not betrayed, that he had willingly taken it upon himself to contain &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s essence, but Rau claimed that this story was a lie. That &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt; had used demonic magic to trick Tal Rasha and forced the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; upon him, in an effort to spare his own life. Cain refused to believe it; he knew the histories of the Horadrim. Tal Rasha had never had children. All of this was Belial corrupting Rau's thoughts, a claim which Rau didn't take kindly to. Rau tried to attack Cain, but a wave of magic emanated from Leah, and in the moment afterward, Belial contacted him directly. He showed Cain images of his wife and son being tormented in Hell, showing him a vision where demons, not bandits, were the ones who had killed them. He claimed that Cain had known this truth all along, and stated that soon, he would directly control Rau as his host. That soon, Sanctuary would fall, and after that, Heaven. Cain beheld the vision Belial forced upon him, of Sanctuary as a tortured hellscape with humanity either enslaved, or left in piles of corpses.\nCain opened his eyes and found the vision gone. Leah's magic had brought some time, but had awoken thousands of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; soldiers below; those who had perished in the Mage Clan Wars. Cain attacked Rau, smashing his staff against the man's forehead, and then plunging the shaft into his chest. Cain tended to Leah, and was able to awake her from the drugs that had been forced upon her. Yet despite everything, Rau was still alive, quite able to remove the shaft from his chest as if it meant nothing. However, while his body was continuing to function, his mind was beginning to falter, as because of Cain's words, he began to doubt what Belial had told him. Cain said that Belial had lied about his ancestry. That when Belial took full control of his form, Rau would cease to exist. Rau looked set to come to, but Belial began to manifest himself. Leah came to however, and a moment of recognition caught Belial offguard, commenting &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;\"I know that face...\"&lt;/a&gt;. What this meant, Cain couldn't deduce, but it didn't matter, as the charges he had entrusted to the First Ones began to go off, due to the wave of magic that Leah had set out earlier. The tower began to collapse, and the sea flooded into the buried city. Beholding Rau, Cain could see that he was fighting for control. With a single, strangled cry, Rau threw himself out of the window, into the sea. Cain grabbed Leah and the two fled.\nAftermath.\nCain and Leah reunited with the First Ones, Mikulov, Jeronnan, and the remaining townsfolk. After exploring the ruins left behind from the tower, and finding no sign of the horrors that had served Belial, Cain, Leah, Mikulov, and some others returned to the Captain's Table. Leah remained unresponsive for most of the time, but began to regain her sense of self at the inn, though had scant memory of what had transpired. Cain decided to keep the events hidden from her, reasoning that her childhood would be better spent without those memories to haunt her. He declared that they were family now.\nOver the next few days, life slowly returned to Gea Kul. Every time Cain left the Captain's Table, he found a small crowd of people waiting for him outside, akin to religious pilgrims. Cain wasn't sure about how the people treated him as some sort of hero, but Mikulov told him that he was, that he was indeed the last Horadrim. Cain didn't contest the point, and returned his attention to Leah; she was incredibly powerful, but her trauma had blocked out most of her memories. Not just of the tower, but most of their adventure. He also wondered about Belial, doubting that the Lord of Lies would give up on his attempts to conquer Sanctuary. Whatever the case, he and Mikulov parted ways.\nHe told the First Ones that he would be leaving them, assuring Cullen and Thomas that they were more than capable of leading others into the light. Cullen protested that Cain was the last Horadrim in Sanctuary, and therefore best to lead them. Cain refused however\u2013 if he \"was\" the last Horadrim, his first priority was to deduce what the destruction of the Worldstone meant for the mortal realm. Thomas accepted his decision, which left Cain to deal with Leah. He knew he had to find a place for her to stay where she'd be safe. Before he could tell her this however, Leah said that she wanted to stay with him. Cain warned her of the dangers they would face if she stayed with him, but Leah said that she didn't care. Cain was the only family she had left now, and she wanted to stay with him. Cain accepted her, and took Leah under his wing. The two of them sat at the docks by the water, and Cain was reminded of his wife and son. For the first time in as long as he could remember, he felt at peace.\nArtifact Hunting.\nOver the next thirteen years, &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; and Cain hunted for artifacts and lore that would help them piece together the &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20the%20End%20of%20Days\"&gt;Prophecy of the End of Days&lt;/a&gt;. They travelled all over the world. They encountered little danger, and no-one paid a weaponless and penniless couple crossing their lands. However, more than once, Leah had to drag Cain away from &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s as he investigated \"some dusty old tapestry.\"\nCain also tried to teach her how to control her abilities. His Horadric knowledge formed the basis of his teachings, but it never really helped. Still, he never gave up on her. During this period, Cain carried out research into Adria. He decided to keep what he learned a secret, and hid the truth from Leah. He came to suspect that Leah's father was Diablo. During their travels, they visited the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Library\"&gt;Great Library&lt;/a&gt; in Caldeum, though Cain knew that Leah was spending her time exploring the sewers.\nOver the years, Leah remained plagued by bad dreams, and Cain too was at times plagued by them. In one dream, he saw angels and demons, and Leah, standing between them, appearing as she would at the age of 21, not as the child that was still beside him. Cain came to learn of the \"&lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20the%20End%20of%20Days\"&gt;Prophecy of the End of Days&lt;/a&gt;\"; a prediction of the End Times which he came to fear might be inevitable. He would talk about it non-stop, much to Leah's annoyance.\nEventually, after &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231284\"&gt;twelve years&lt;/a&gt; of travel and with Leah now a young woman, the two came back to what was left of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, with Cain still in pursuit of the prophecy. Cain had avoided returning to Tristram for a long time, still haunted by the memories of what had transpired there. When Cain told her they were setting out for &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Leah began asking about her mother with growing frequency. Cain had expected that this would happen, but still, it vexed him. On the first day of their arrival, Leah sketched a portrait of Adria that filled him with disquiet. Despite having never seen her mother before, Cain was put off by the perfect likeness. He wondered if straying near Adria's hut had awoken some kind of dormant memory. He warned Leah not to linger around the place, but Leah refused to listen. Cain wondered if he could blame Leah for wanting to know more about her mother, and in truth, his thoughts were lingering on Adria as well.\nCain spent his days poring over the tomes and manuscripts found in the ruined &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Leah split her time between helping him, and helping out in the town. He spent some time in the &lt;a href=\"Slaughtered%20Calf%20Inn\"&gt;Slaughtered Calf Inn&lt;/a&gt;. He would spend hours chatting with &lt;a href=\"Bron\"&gt;Bron&lt;/a&gt;, or simply sit at a table, listening to the other patrons talk, smiling to himself.\nThe End of Days.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, Cain's fears proved justified, as he beheld the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;. It hit the cathedral, blasting Cain into the depths of the structure.\nAfter being rescued by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;a group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, from the ruins of the cathedral, Cain led them back to New Tristram. He happily reunited with Leah and told the heroes that in regards to the Fallen Star, the Prophecy of the End of Days indicated that the end had begun. Leah dismissed such a claim, and was just glad to have him back. That aside, he told the heroes that in light of Leoric's return, they had to put him to rest. He told them to seek out &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%20Eamon\"&gt;Haedrig Eamon&lt;/a&gt;, who knew the locations of Leoric's old crown. That, he explained, was the key to defeating him. After they departed, he told Leah that she should not dismiss the signs of the End Days so lightly, asking her what further proof she needed in light of what was happening around them. Leah, however, still wasn't convinced, pointing out that the lands had endured similar horrors before.\nThe heroes returned with the crown. Cain told them to put the crown on Leoric's head, and thus destroy him. In doing so, they would be able to gain access to the Fallen Star. In doing so, they encountered a stranger; a man without memory. He was taken to Cain, who was skeptical that this man was the Fallen Star, stating that no-one could survive such a fall. Leah could tell that her uncle was disappointed; that he'd expected something more miraculous.\nThe stranger was amnesiac, and could not recall who he was, or why he had come, only that he had come to deliver a warning. Cain commented that the stranger's warning might be the thing that could save them from impending doom. \nCain asked the stranger to tell them everything he remembered. The stranger mentioned a sword that had been with him in the fall...part of him, before splitting into three pieces. Cain declared that they had to find the pieces, as he believed that restoring the sword would restore the stranger's memory. Leah pointed out that that the &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; were rampaging through the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Misery\"&gt;Fields of Misery&lt;/a&gt;, and Cain deduced that just as the stranger's fall had caused the dead to rise, so too had the sword fragments driven the goatmen to madness. The heroes headed off to retrieve the fragment.\nOver time, Cain began to realize who the stranger really was, and had suspicions about the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;true nature&lt;/a&gt; of the heroes that were aiding them.\nThe heroes returned with the first fragment, but reported that the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; were also trying to obtain the pieces. The stranger stated that he sensed a &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;darker presence&lt;/a&gt; guiding the Coven's hand. The hero mentioned that the Coven's leader, &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;, had told them that the second piece was located \"where only &lt;a href=\"ancients\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; may tread.\" Leah commented that the term reminded her of the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Temple\"&gt;Drowned Temple&lt;/a&gt;, remembering when Cain told her about it. Cain agreed, and had Leah head to the temple with the heroes, since her knowledge of the temple could prove invaluable.\nWith two of the three pieces recovered, the stranger mentioned a third heading towards a fishing village. Leah realized that he was referring to &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;. Cain bid Leah and the heroes head there via ferry. However, the Coven burnt the village, retrieving the third piece. Worse, Maghda and her cultists took Cain and the stranger prisoner and New Tristram, as well as Leah, who had returned to New Tristram early to check on Cain. Maghda threatened to kill Leah if he didn't use his Horadric arts to fix the sword. She used her magic to wound Cain, which caused Leah's powers to erupt, killing Maghda's cultists. Maghda retreated, leaving the fragments, but taking the stranger with her.\nMaghda's blow had fatally wounded Cain. His final act before dying was to use his Horadric arts to repair the sword, revealing it to be of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and the stranger's identity as that of an &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;. He then died, and Leah broke down crying.\nLegacy.\nAlthough Cain and Leah had only been living in town for about a year, Cain was well liked and respected by everyone. His death brought great sadness and anger among the townsfolk, not to mention hopes for merciless revenge against Cain's murderer.\nAfter the Nephalem defeated &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt; and freed the angel - revealed to be the former &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; of Justice, Tyrael, Cain was laid to rest on a funeral pyre outside Tristram. Leah and Tyrael paid their final respects before cremating his body, Leah promising to carry on his work.\nCain left behind a final note to Leah in his &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Cain%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt;, which she took into her own possession. She missed her uncle dearly, and Cain's death was avenged by the Nephalem when they killed Maghda. As she continued to study his writings, Leah realized that she had taken Cain's wisdom for granted. Cain's death was avenged by the Nephalem when they slew Maghda in &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Leah's death, Cain's writings passed into Tyrael's hands, and he incorporated them into his &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Tyrael\"&gt;own work&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Diablo's assault on &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, he used an apparition of Cain in an effort to break the will of his foes.\nBy the end of his life, Cain had become well known by scholars of demonic lore. His writings survived long after his death.\nDecades after Cain's death, &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; stated that he believed history would judge Cain amongst the greatest Horadrim, representing the best of what the Horadric Order could be. That Cain's contributions, and to humanity as a whole, could not be overstated. He also noted that Cain would likely scoff at such a claim. He relied on Cain's writings extensively when compiling his &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Lorath%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;own tome&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDiablo.\nCain appears as an NPC in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. He identifies items for a cost and gives the player(s) background info for quests. Towards the end of the game, Cain reveals his true identity as the last of the Horadrim, and sends the player(s) to destroy both &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nFor his dialogue, see &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain/Dialogue\"&gt;Deckard Cain/Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"Diablo II\"'s &lt;a href=\"Search%20for%20Cain%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Search for Cain&lt;/a&gt; quest, Cain is rescued by the player(s), and afterward follows the player through each of the game's Acts. Once Cain has been rescued by the hero(es), he will identify items free of charge. If the player neglects to rescue Cain, the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s will do so after the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20to%20the%20Slaughter\"&gt;Sisters to the Slaughter&lt;/a&gt; quest and the player must pay 100 gold for each item identified, though he will still follow the player through each act.\nFor his dialogue, see &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain/Dialogue\"&gt;Deckard Cain/Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo Immortal.\nCain appears as an NPC in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". He is encountered in &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the game, and later in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, where he can be found inside &lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Workshop\"&gt;Cain's Workshop&lt;/a&gt;. After the player completes the Bilefen questline, they return to Cain's workshop, where he introduces them to Rayek, and in turn, the &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt;. After players complete the game's main questline, Cain gives them &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain%27s%20Vision\"&gt;Jered Cain's Vision&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn an early build, Cain was found in the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Ruins\"&gt;Forsaken Ruins&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Bilefen\"&gt;Bilefen&lt;/a&gt;. This appears to be absent from the game's final build.\nDiablo III.\nDeckard Cain returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", though only for the game's &lt;a href=\"Act%20I%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;first act&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, his &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain%27s%20Journal%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; entries can be found, along with his writings that form the basis of many of the game's collectible &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn addition, in the last quest of &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt;, the nephalem has a chance to meet with his spirit in the second level of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Spire\"&gt;Silver Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, after insulting the heroes on their choosing to side with Tyrael, the 'spirit' reveals itself to be the &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Aspect of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;. Players can skip him, however, if they feel they are not up to the fight.\nDiablo IV.\nDeckard Cain, along with many Diablo II characters, appears in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Vision of Tristram&lt;/a&gt; in Diablo IV.\nDevelopment.\nCain was killed off in \"Diablo III\" as &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; wanted to up the emotional stakes, both for Leah and Tyrael, but for the player as well. Additionally, it was intended to carry and undertone of how had he survived Maghda, some of the tragedy of future events might have been averted. Originally, the death was to occur later than it did in the final product, but it didn't seem fitting from a gameplay point of view. As Tyrael and Adria had taken on the role of advisors by this point in the story, there wasn't much for Cain to do at this point. Having Cain be accidentally killed by Leah as per her not being able to control her powers was also considered, but as Maghda has established herself as the \"villain of the hour\" at this point in the story, this idea was abandoned.\nHeroes of the Storm.\n&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aheroesofthestorm%3ADeckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; appears as a Healer in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". His appearance combines elements from both his \"Diablo II\" and \"Diablo III\" designs, and his abilities draw references on the series. He can toss &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; on the ground which can be picked up to heal himself and his allies, and can also use the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; as an offensive ability, lobbing it into the air to damage and slow down his enemies. He also can also cast the Scroll of Sealing to root enemies in place, which references at the Horadrim's ability to seal off demons. His Heroic Abilities include \"Stay Awhile and Listen\", which allows him to make enemies fall asleep in a wide area, and the \"Lorenado\", a reference to the &lt;a href=\"Archivist\"&gt;Archivist&lt;/a&gt;, a 2009 April Fool's joke for a new class in \"Diablo III\".\nDeckard's gameplay operates by setting up healing potions on the ground beforehand, making him perfect for defending static map objectives. His offensive abilities provide large area of denial and zoning potential, which, when packed with talents, makes Deckard capable of disabling the entire enemy team, allowing his own team to capitalize on it. Deckard has access to gems talents at levels 1 (&lt;a href=\"Sapphire\"&gt;Sapphire&lt;/a&gt;), 4 (&lt;a href=\"Ruby\"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;) and 7 (&lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt;), which can be used to imbue his next cast of the Horadric Cube with increased damage and special properties depending on which gem was actived. His Super Healing Potion talent, at level 13, further improves his healing output by increasing the size and potency of his potions a few seconds after being tossed on the ground.\nMost of Deckard Cain's talents references abilities, items and even lore from the \"Diablo\" universe:\nPersonality and Traits.\nA kindly, humble, and avid scholar, Deckard Cain dedicated his life to the pursuit of knowledge and the protection of Sanctuary from demonic threats. He had a soft spot for storytelling. In life, he served as a symbol of hope to many.\nCain's wisdom of history and the occult made him well know in Tristram. The inhabitants of the village respected him, but some, particularly &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt;, felt that Deckard knew far more than he was letting on. \nAt the age of eleven, Deckard was narrow across the shoulders. His face was thin and drawn, so he looked older than he really was. At one point in time, he had the intent of writing a history of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, starting from the myth of Anu and Tathamet.\nDeckard had an innate ability to discern the true nature of many things. This included gleaning the potential of artifacts and weapons. He was proficient in sketching and could utilize &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to a limited degree.\nAfter losing his wife and son, Deckard became a recluse and lonely man, from his time at Tristram until his last days. Always lost in his books, Adria wrote that Deckard was \"looking for his purpose by digging through the past.\" And as such, a man who didn't know himself was too eager to trust. He remained haunted by the physical and psychological wounds he'd suffered at Tristram for the rest of his days. Wracked by guilt over his failure to save Tristram, he spent the rest of his life trying to make up for his perceived failings. By the end of his life however, Cain had made peace with himself, believing that he had done what he was meant to do.\nCain generally preferred books to people. He could empathize with people, but found himself struggling to offer comfort a lot of the time. He struggled to connect with most children, even as a schoolmaster. However, he had great love for Leah, and regarded her as a daughter. In his final note to her, he wrote that she was \"the single greatest joy of my life.\" He had similar affection for Aidan, though not to the same extent. He had great love for the city of Caldeum.\nHe always prayed that the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s would one day actively fight on mankind's behalf, but carried some resentment towards them, claiming that they had never helped humanity as much as they could have. &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, for her part, considered Cain to be a validation of her belief in the worth of mankind. He believed in the existence of an afterlife, one beyond the reach of Heaven and Hell, and that when he died (and presumably, all humans), he would go there. He believed that given humanity's propensity for both good and evil, it was clear that the 'essence' of their nephalem ancestors remained in them, as taken from angels and demons. He wondered if it might be possible for mankind to become something more, and suspected (correctly) that the powers of the nephalem might again manifest themselves within humanity. However, he also believed that mysticism and rationalism were two competing ideologies that humans would always be torn between.\nCain was not normally given to hysterics. He considered his greatest strength to be his measured, calm approach to crises.\nReferences.\n__NOWYSIWYG__"}

It narrated the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"\" from the point of view of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. The journal was taken down along with the original site.\nThe journal is somewhat imprecise in that &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt; is referred to as a nameless &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the prince of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; he would become in later lore. Additionally, the dates given by Cain do not match the current &lt;a href=\"timeline\"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt; (in which the events described stretch across years 1263-'65) nor the order of months (Kathon comes after Ratham in the same year). Regardless, the journal is recorded here for reference and posterity.\nEntries.\n29th Day of Jeshasan, 1265 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"The events of the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231263\"&gt;past year&lt;/a&gt; are unbelievable and have driven me to again write my thoughts. No matter how hard I try, the facts are unavoidable: our King &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; has gone mad, lashing out in crazed frenzy at the abduction of his son &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;, and our steady losses of the ill-advised war against &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, leading to an open revolt among the guards. There is something almost palatable in the air. It feels like...&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;terror&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n1st Day of Dasnhar, 1265 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"Can the old stories be true\u2014can the tales of the brave &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Lords&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; be more than a legend, a fairy tale told to me by my &lt;a href=\"Aderes%20Cain\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;? I used to thrive on those tales of bravery and heroism. I'd imagine myself; the mysterious Horadrim led by the inscrutable &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;! I was so proud to be the 'Last of the Horadrim', the one who would travel &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;the world&lt;/a&gt; fighting evil wherever it dwelt. Ah, the boundless energy of youth.\"\n\"Could there be some basis in truth to all these tales? The signs all point to this, but how is someone with my education, my knowledge, to take these tales seriously?\"\n\"Is there really some dark entity buried beneath our &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;? If only my ageing mind could remember the tales as vividly as I did in my younger days.\"\n12th Day of Dasnhar, 1265 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"I am a fool. If I had acted sooner, if I had voiced my concerns, they would not be dead. &lt;a href=\"Farnham\"&gt;Farnham&lt;/a&gt; would not be the drunken sot he now is. &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, supposed Archbishop of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, has led a group of villagers to their horrific end under the guise of searching for the king's missing son. Is he the architect of the evil that has befallen the town, or simply an unwitting pawn?\"\n\"The nights are long and as I sit and listen to the hellish drones emanating from the cathedral, I begin to see my path clearly before me. I shall return to the texts. There must be an answer, a way to defeat this evil that torments us.\"\n20th Day of Dasnhar, 1265 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"Each new terror sends more townspeople fleeing. There are only a few of us left now. &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt;. Farnham, the unfortunate &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, the fair &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt;. There is someone else however, someone who has come while others flee. I am not sure what to make of this &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, who openly calls herself &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;. She has access to all manner of arcane knowledge that even I do not. Why has she come here now, at this heinous time? I feel there is something amiss about her.\"\n27th Day of Dasnhar, 1265 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"Every dawn seems to bring more adventurers into our midst. But none who can yet be called hero. I hide each time and continue scouring the old texts for answers. If only I had taken them more seriously, not dismissed them so lightly?\"\n1st Day of Ratham, 1265 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"Finally one of our adventurers seems to stand out from the rest. Though a man of few words he radiates a calm and focus that unnerve the others, who are only interested in pillaging and looting. I feel I have come to know this hero, this wanderer. I have revealed my history and shared my knowledge with him. I hope it is enough.\"\n21st Day of Ratham, 1265 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"I have suspected for a time now the true nature of the evil that is at the heart of our troubles, but it was too horrible to admit the truth of it. But the time for denial is past: it is the Dark Lord of Terror, Diablo himself, who plagues us.\"\n\"The vile &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Lazarus\"&gt;staff of Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; was brought to me today, further confirming my suspicions. There is no longer any doubt that he is the one who kidnapped Albrecht and perhaps even freed Diablo from his ancient prison. Who knows what further treachery he has planned? Luckily, I suspect Lazarus has not long to live if our champion has anything to say on it.\"\n6th Day of Esunar, 1265 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"I dreamt of the death wail of a small child tonight. It tore up from the depths, shattering the windows of the decrepit cathedral. As I started awake, it became apparent that it was actually the shriek of Diablo's tortured end. Unable to return to my sleep after such an unsettling cry I ventured outdoors to await the warrior's return. He finally emerged, covered in blood - much his own, much his enemies'. I am greatly relieved he survived the ordeal and these horrible events are now in our past. But my mind is troubled, for could this not have been avoided if I had not dismissed my legacy so lightly?\"\n18th Day of Esunar, 1265 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"I have never seen Tristram bursting with so much joy in the weeks since Diablo's defeat. The town's quiet, brooding hero which I am proud to call friend, has humbly endured these celebrations. Yet it seems clear to me the scars he gained beneath the church run deeper than those upon his skin and may have changed him forever. I have offered counsel, but he remains distant. Time, perhaps, is the only thing that may heal him.\"\n20th Day of Esunar, 1265 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"How could I have been so blind? I believed my friend's melancholy to be a natural reaction of the horrors he lived. How could I not have seen that he carried within him the very being of Diablo? After brooding for weeks, he finally slipped away in the night. Perhaps he had gone to \"the east\" that he so often woke screaming about in the days following his victory over the Lord of Terror.\"\n\"Shortly after he left us, legions of foul &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s attacked and burned our town to its foundations. None of the townspeople were spared, and not even the women or children were allowed the peace of the grave. Instead, all were reanimated in grisly &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. And Griswold, who had so faithfully armored the one I had called friend, suffered perhaps the worst fate of all, being corrupted into a slavering demonic beast thirsting after &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; flesh.\"\n\"This is no simple madness. It can be nothing less than possession by the Lord of Terror himself. The fool, he thought he could contain Diablo's evil. His reckless overconfidence has proven costly to us all.\"\n\"I sit now, caged, amongst the screams and the hellfire, as I await my own end.\"\n2nd Day of Kathon, 1266 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"Although I had long given up hope and surrendered to my inevitable fate, the impossible happened today. I was rescued. Heroes have come to &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; to combat the corruption of the man I've come to call the Dark Wanderer has brought upon these lands. He had long since departed on some unknown mission, but they could not follow until they defeated the vile demoness, &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, who barred the only passage east. I have decided to join them, in the hopes my knowledge of the ancient ways might be of some help.\"\n28th Day of Kathon, 1266 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"Our sense of relief is overwhelming now that our passage through &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;the desert&lt;/a&gt; is finally over and we have arrived in &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. Though I tell no one, Diablo's terror has left its mark upon me as well. I wake in the night, suffering unholy visions of the destruction visited upon my home, the slaughter of the helpless villagers, and the echoes of dark acts perpetrated beneath the earth. I hope that these will pass in time, but I fear I will never escape them.\"\n\"I spoke with the people of the town for a clue to the whereabouts of my former friend, but information is scarce. We have learned that he does not travel alone: he has a companion named &lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;. I can only wonder what part he plays in all of this.\"\n11th Day of Solmaneth, 1266 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"We are too late. My companions followed the trail of the Dark Wanderer to the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, only to be confronted by the demon &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s Soulstone was nowhere to be found. We can assume that Baal is free once again, and that he and the Wanderer have departed for &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt; to free their brother, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;. This must not be allowed to happen.\"\n1st Day of Montaht, 1266 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"Today I have seen what has become of the man who once risked everything to save us from the Lord of Terror. It was here in the jungles outside &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; that we caught our first fleeting glimpse of the Dark Wanderer. It saddens me to think that even as steadfast and noble a hero as he has proven insignificant beneath the corrupting influence of the Lord of Terror. I weep for what he once was, and yet I curse him for his arrogance that has led him to this path, sowing pain and death across the world.\"\n\"Mephisto's resurrection in this world was brief; my companions have seen to that. They fought through horrors I can scarcely imagine to defeat him and reclaim his Soulstone. They also brought back the devastating news that the Wanderer was no more. All traces of humanity had been eradicated; he has completely been overtaken by Diablo in mind, body, and spirit. Fortunately they have succeeded in driving him back to his fiery home, and they tell me they mean to assault the Burning Hells in order to put an end to his existence once and for all. I can only wish them luck.\"\n4th Day of Ostara, 1266 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"Diablo is dead. I have long desired to hear those words, but now that they come, I feel little joy. News has reached us of a &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;demonic army&lt;/a&gt; marching upon &lt;a href=\"Arreat\"&gt;Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. This is Baal's doing, no doubt. We depart for the north with the tide.\"\n\"Still, we must count our blessings: the Soulstones of Mephisto and Diablo have been destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt; and they will trouble us no further. Only one remains.\"\n2nd Day of Navan, 1266 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"The cold of the northern mountains chills me to my old and weary bones. Baal's army holds the mountain passes from our haven in &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Summit\"&gt;summit&lt;/a&gt;. The honor, strength, and dedication of my companions never cease to amaze me. They are even now braving the demons and snow to reach Baal himself. Rumors of betrayal swirl through the town. This time, we must not be too late.\"\n10th Day of Navan, 1266 Anno Kehjistani.\n\"It seems we are cursed. Even in victory, we face defeat. Although the heroes defeated Baal, the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; has delivered grave news. An object of great power he calls the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; was held in secret at the mountain's summit, and it has been corrupted by Baal. He believes the only option open to him is to destroy it. I know too little of this Worldstone and what powers it may hold to guess what might come of this, but I fear our actions may scar the world in ways we cannot know. I pray Tyrael is making the right choice.\"\nExternal Links.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMQqh5vc7-Hk\"&gt;YouTube Recording&lt;/a&gt;"}

It was used not only to create our world, but also to control mankind.\nThe original humans were known as the nephalem, and their power was such that it was feared they would tip the balance in the Eternal Conflict between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells.\nSo the Worldstone was tuned to lessen our powers, turning mankind into what we are today.

The higher this number is, the more protection the hero possesses. In the first two games, it does little in the way of avoiding spells, but in later games it may protect against magic as well.\nDiablo/Hellfire.\nDefense was first seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\"/\"&lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;\" in the form of Armor Class. It is improved by equipping armor and shields, and by upgrading one's &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible for &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; to go into the high 200s, if not the 300s, providing an excellent defense against melee and ranged physical attackers, improved only by choosing to equip a &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;ing chances.\nDiablo II/Lord of Destruction.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", a defender's Defense Rating is compared to an attacker's Attack Rating to determine the chance of a damaging hit. All types of &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belts\"&gt;Belts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boots\"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gloves\"&gt;Gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helms%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Helms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shrunken%20Heads\"&gt;Shrunken Heads&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 contribute to your character's Defense rating. Natural Defense rating also improves by 1 for every 4 points of dexterity. Defense drops to zero while running. Defense rating only works on melee and ranged attacks; it does not prevent hits from magical attacks.\nNOTE: Your &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; determines what types of armor you can equip.\nDiablo III.\nDefense returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", however, it is renamed to Armor, and the functions are completely different from earlier installments in the series. While means of increasing Armor are generally unchanged, rather than giving the hero an increased chance to avoid enemy attacks, it instead provides damage reduction % against those attacks.\nDexterity originally did nothing to improve that Armor rating, unless the player was a &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; with the passive skill, &lt;a href=\"Seize%20the%20Initiative\"&gt;Seize the Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Awareness\"&gt;Awareness&lt;/a&gt;. As of Patch 2.1, the system is changed to allow Dexterity to boost Armor (1:1) instead of .\nStrength contributes to the Armor rating in the exactly same way. This means that Monks, Demon Hunters,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s will have an innately high Armor rating just because of their Dexterity and Strength. The damage reduction % suffers from diminishing returns, and the formulae involved depend on the level of the monster attempting to attack the hero, resulting in lower damage reduction the higher the level. Armor damage reduction stacks multiplicatively with that of &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt; and plays a part in forming the character's &lt;a href=\"toughness\"&gt;toughness&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to skills and items, one may also gain up to +25% Armor (not multiplicative with other modifiers) from &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; levels.\nUnlike other stats, Armor is naturally rolling on any non-&lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, non-&lt;a href=\"jewelry\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; gear. Maximum innate Armor per item at level 70 is 759 (&lt;a href=\"helms\"&gt;helms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chest%20armor\"&gt;chest armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pants\"&gt;pants&lt;/a&gt;), 674 (&lt;a href=\"pauldrons\"&gt;pauldrons&lt;/a&gt;), 590 (&lt;a href=\"gloves\"&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;), 506 (&lt;a href=\"belts\"&gt;belts&lt;/a&gt;) or 421 (&lt;a href=\"bracers\"&gt;bracers&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt; have the highest level of protection, up to 2024 base Armor (before the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Legendary\"&gt;Ancient Legendary&lt;/a&gt; bonus, which adds another 30% to base Armor).\nBonus Armor (which is an affix, not an innate property) can roll up to 397 on any piece of gear except Chest Armors, Shields, Pants, Helms and Amulets, which may roll up to 595 (before Ancient bonus, which adds 30% on top). With the exception of possessing either Dexterity or Strength, weapons may never provide a bonus towards the wielder's Armor rating.\n&lt;a href=\"Bottomless%20Potion%20of%20the%20Tower\"&gt;Bottomless Potion of the Tower&lt;/a&gt; can add up to 20% extra Armor for 5 seconds when used.\nDiablo Immortal.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" keeps the Armor nomenclature of \"Diablo III\".

The newly transformed Fetish's normal attack is a headbutt. While Delirium can be made in any type of &lt;a href=\"Helms%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;helm&lt;/a&gt; and can be used by any &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, it is best used by a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; since he can transform back from this Fetish form by using the &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Werebear\"&gt;Werebear&lt;/a&gt; skills.\nFor this reason, Delirium should be made in a &lt;a href=\"Druid%20Pelts\"&gt;Druid Pelt&lt;/a&gt; that provides bonuses to key &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Skills\"&gt;Elemental Skills&lt;/a&gt;, such as a pelt having +3 to &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; and +3 to &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20Armor\"&gt;Cyclone Armor&lt;/a&gt;. This will give the player a bonus of 5 skill levels to their most used skills.\nBesides the potentially great bonus to skills if used in the correct base pelt, the other modifiers on Delirium are pretty lackluster. &lt;a href=\"Jalal%27s%20Mane\"&gt;Jalal's Mane&lt;/a&gt; is arguably an overall more useful helm, especially since it can be socketed with an additional &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"jewel\"&gt;jewel&lt;/a&gt; for further item bonuses and customization and won't force the player to put an unnecessary skill point into Werewolf. These advantages may outweigh the extra skill bonuses potentially offered by Delirium.\nAnd if one wants to go &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Find\"&gt;Magic Find&lt;/a&gt;ing, is still a better option compared to Delirium, especially since it can be acquired in trade for much less than an .\nHowever, no matter how good the base pelt is for Delirium, it is quite possible to find an even better &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt; Druid Pelt that provides bonuses to &lt;a href=\"Druid%20Skills\"&gt;Druid Skills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faster%20Hit%20Recovery\"&gt;Faster Hit Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, 1-2 &lt;a href=\"Sockets\"&gt;Sockets&lt;/a&gt; (which can be then be used for &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;All Resistances&lt;/a&gt;, more Life and/or more Faster Hit Recovery) and\u00a0+3 to Tornado (or another desired skill). Of course, finding or trading for such a rare pelt can be quite difficult, so Delirium or Jalal's Mane can act as temporary helm in the meantime.\nLooking beyond Druids, Delirium is also a possible choice for a mercenary. Aside from the Iron Wolves (who need to cast spells), the Bone Fetish transformation is much less debilitating to mercenaries. It offers next to no mods that are useful for them personally (since they also do not benefit very much from +skills), but it does throw disruptive curses all over the place, which can be greatly helpful for keeping hostilities away from the player themselves. However, if the player is reliant on any curses of their own, Delirium can annoyingly overwrite them.\nAlternatively, it is arguable that this helm is useful on a bowazon or act 1 rogue mercenary. Being able to hit at distance with a very high level, high percentage confusion proc makes it so enemies often tear themselves apart and you remain in very little danger, only having to pick off the few who even make it up to you- which your Valkyrie more often than not will tank as you shoot and reapply the curse to whoever is left. Multishot(appropriate used against 3+ mobs) and strafe(if talented into it) practically guarantee a cast of confusion very quickly and the typical Amazon control kit of freezing arrow kiting and recasting Valkyrie's make this a remarkably safe playstyle. The drawback of the 1% delirium chance isnt an issue if you're never getting hit. \nResult:"}

When he showed &lt;a href=\"Fierce%20Gauntlets\"&gt;gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; to Master &lt;a href=\"Valthek\"&gt;Valthek&lt;/a&gt;, he asked how they made the teacher feel. When Valthek explained that he did not understand the question, Delsere stormed off. For his &lt;a href=\"Harness%20of%20Truth\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, he described it as resplendant. When asked why that mattered, he ranted that \"form is function,\" and any praise for his &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al crafting abilities only infuriated him more. Even the &lt;a href=\"Leg%20Guards%20of%20Mystery\"&gt;leg guards&lt;/a&gt; were crafted repeatedly, with only minimal increase to their magical properties. When Valthek pointed this out, Delsere called him a \"visionless cretin\".\nFinally, Delsere reached the last stage of his magnum opus: a &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Mask\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt; that he declared would be the jewel of his work. Not long after making such a declaration, however, he broke down, weeping that he had to start over. Delsere disappeared soon afterwards, along with his armor set. Valthek reflected that his madness and departure was a tragic loss. Delsere had melted down so many pieces of armor in his work, calling them inelegant. Yet even these had been more beautiful than one most artisans could hope to create.\nIn-game.\nDelsere is referenced in the &lt;a href=\"Delsere%27s%20Magnum%20Opus\"&gt;Delsere's Magnum Opus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item%20set\"&gt;item set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Shame%20of%20Delsere\"&gt;The Shame of Delsere&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"belt\"&gt;belt&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\"."}
{"id": "30613", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=30613", "title": "Delsere's Magnum Opus", "text": "Delsere's Magnum Opus is a 6 piece class &lt;a href=\"item%20set\"&gt;item set&lt;/a&gt; for s for level 70, focused on constant use of &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt;. This set can only drop at &lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; difficulty. It was added in patch 2.2.0.\nAll set pieces are restricted to Wizards only. Even\u00a0&lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0of these items is only available to Wizard class.\nPieces.\nThe set consists of six pieces. All six are required to complete the set, and all of them are Wizard-restricted.\nSet Bonus.\nThe first bonus creates Slow Time bubbles with most secondary projectiles of the listed skills, such as Arcane Torrent's Static Discharge shocks and Arcane Orb's Frozen Orb shards. Slow Time does not need to be in the player's action bar.\nThe Teleport cooldown reset happens the moment the Wizard enters a Slow Time and remains in effect constantly; they may cast Teleport as fast as their cast speed allows while inside bubbles. Teleporting from inside to outside the bubble has a normal cooldown.\nThe second and third bonuses work with the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; version of Slow Time, although considering the nature of the third bonus, it is pointless to use this set in tandem with Archon.\nThe third bonus effect is multiplicative, and applies to any enemies even partially touched by at least one Slow Time sphere, even if they are immune to &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;.\nSynergies.\nFor extra effect, one may combine this set with &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Crown of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;. If Slow Time is in player's action bar, the Crown will cause a Slow Time bubble to follow the player (no casting required), and the player can still cast Slow Time manually and cause them with the set 2-piece bonus; these latter bubbles do not move. The bubble that follows the player does not provide the 2-piece Teleport bonus, but works with all the others.\nAlso helpful are items that empower the other skills affected by this set, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Twisted%20Sword\"&gt;The Twisted Sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Scepter\"&gt;Unstable Scepter&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gesture%20of%20Orpheus\"&gt;Gesture of Orpheus&lt;/a&gt; is generally not useful with the updated version of this set, since active casting of Slow Time is done rarely or not at all.\nBugs.\nA quirk occurs when &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt;'s Wormhole rune is used, which normally allows a second Teleport within 3 seconds before its cooldown activates. The 3 second period is \"not\" reset by being in a bubble, so exiting a Slow Time bubble within 3 seconds of Teleporting into or within it causes Teleport to go on cooldown 3 seconds after the cast. This may be a bug, since this occurs even if the Teleport into the bubble is the second cast of the Wormhole pattern, in which case it would've gone on cooldown immediately, and therefore should be reset.\nSome players have reported Slow Time not always activating when enemies are hit with the appropriate skills.\nPrevious Set Bonus.\nThis set formerly required active casting of &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt;, worked with slightly different abilities, and was tuned differently:\nThe first bonus triggered even if the skills did not hit an enemy."}

{"id": "3601", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3601", "title": "Demon", "text": "Demons, otherwise known as Hellspawn, Demonkind, Hell-beasts, and the Minions of Darkness are evil entities native to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;, and are the primary enemies of the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" series. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can wield a wide range of magical powers depending on their type. They propagate and serve to spread pure chaos, making them diametrically opposed to the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; (who stand for Order and fight for the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;). The never-ending war between angels and demons is known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. \nLore.\nCharacteristics.\nHell's servants number many and will stop at nothing to see &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; crumble in their maw. There are demons \"beyond counting\" who reside in Hell alone. \nDemons can wield powerful &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. The presence of powerful demon(s) in an area can warp the environment, and even affect the weather. Some powerful demons (including the Great Evils) exhibit an affinity to a concept (an \"evil\", if you would call it) which forms the theme most of their abilities are based on. They can absorb this concept to empower themselves, heal, and even revive themselves.\nAt least some demons can possess humans and masquerade as angels. To best knowledge, demonic possession of a human cannot be forcefully ended without killing the host in the process. There are measures that can be taken which can ward off demonic possession, though some practices make humans more vulnerable to possession (e.g. practicing &lt;a href=\"dark%20magic\"&gt;dark magic&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Corpse\"&gt;Corpse&lt;/a&gt;s (at least ones in good condition) can be possessed by demons. The possession halts the decay of the corpse.\nAngels can be turned into demons (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Overlord\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Angel\"&gt;Corrupted Angel&lt;/a&gt;s), as can humans.\nDemons are cowardly, and will attack using strength of numbers to their advantage whenever possible. They are prone to \"unnatural\" levels of distrust, even towards their own kind. Many demons are vain to the point of self-denial.\nWounds suffered from demons' blades don't close easily (at least wounds inflicted against humans). &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; urged mortals to never use a demonic weapon, no matter how rightous their cause may be. He warned that inevitably, a demonic weapon would always turn a human to serve its will.\nPhysiology.\nDemon physiology differs greatly. Thick hides and claws may be possessed by demons, but that aside, demons of the same dimensions may still have dramatically different weaknesses, depending on their master. Different species of Demons share similar features, but a powerful individual may evolve to a unique form. Demons have high pain tolerance, but this can be a weakness as a hidden injury can fester and kill the demon hours later. &lt;a href=\"Megademon\"&gt;Megademon&lt;/a&gt;s are considered to be archetypal demons. Some demons possess wings. Red is the most common color for demons (in appearance). Every demon possesses a withered, beating heart (or a core that functions as one) that propels it forward.\nDemons, unlike angels, are physical beings, and their bodies remain after death. Some make use of demonic remains, and demonic remains can (and have been) used in experiments, giving birth to new monstrous creatures. This is considered to be an \"unspeakable act.\" Demon skin is durable and protective, and &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt;s written by the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; suggested that it could be forged into &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. However, there was uncertainty as to how this armor would affect the user's mind, as to whether it would turn them into a mindless spawn of damnation.\nDemons do not age, or at least not in a manner recognisable to mortals. They do not require sleep.\nThe skulls of some demonic creatures are said to work much like &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;. As with mortals and angels, demons carry &lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt; within their bodies. At least some demons possess blood. Dry demon's blood left on armor can react adversely to water, causing the armor to be destroyed in a flash of green light, after generating sulphur/blood-scented smoke. At least some radiate &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy. Most greater demons possess lots of horns.\nDemons need to consume meat to sustain themselves. Demons have been known to devour their young if no other nourishment is available. Humans may be consumed by demons for nourishment.\nReproduction.\nThe souls of deceased demons are always reborn in Hell, even the lowest of their kind. Humans who have been transformed into demons also gain this ability. Demons are apparently spawned from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, and if killed, will return to the Abyss to reform. Oftimes, this process gives the demon a new form.\nExamples exist of breeds of demon being created through artificial means. Reference has been made to demons being birthed from flame, even emerging as twins.\nDemons are wont to breed with each other. They have demonstrated the ability to crossbreed with &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s (the results being &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;), and with humans, usually to the horror of the latter. Few children of such couplings survive childbirth, and fewer still survive into adulthood, as they are generally killed by those who know them for what they are. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; also suspected that &lt;a href=\"Barbed%20Lurker\"&gt;Barbed Lurker&lt;/a&gt;s (a type of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Beast\"&gt;Ancient Beast&lt;/a&gt;) are partially demonic as well. Encounters with demons by humans can result in psychological scarring that lasts potentially indefinitely, though measures can be taken to minimize harm.\nWorship and Summoning.\nMany &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s do not believe in the existence of demons, though stories of demons became common in folklore of some human cultures. Some philosophical writings within the East have postulated that demons are nothing more than a representation of Man's nature (i.e. \"his demons\"). Yet demons do indeed exist, and some mortals worship(ed) demons, and have engaged in summoning practices. Examples include the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; (a font for the Prime Evils as benevolent entities during the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; (remnants of the Triune, turned to the worship of &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;) and the worship of &lt;a href=\"Kabraxis\"&gt;Kabraxis&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to eclipse the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith. The Zakarum faith itself was corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;. Mortals have also summoned demons to the mortal realm, a practice which dates as far back as the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt;. While such a practice has since been banned by the clan, groups such as the Coven continue it. Centuries past, when summoning demons was common, it was common to invoke lesser demons and subdue them in order to gain their power. Many &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s ended up being enslaved to their &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Imp\"&gt;intended servants&lt;/a&gt;. Possession by a demon may grant a human increased power, but this comes at the cost of one's sense of self and eventually, a demon can completely overtake the human's form with its own.\nIf summoning a demon, one is not recommended to do so during the months of &lt;a href=\"Vasan\"&gt;Vasan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lycanum\"&gt;Lycanum&lt;/a&gt;, as during this time, demons are erratic and easy to anger. In contrast, the most ideal times to summon demons is the period of time between the last days of &lt;a href=\"Jerharan\"&gt;Jerharan&lt;/a&gt; and the first days of &lt;a href=\"Damhar\"&gt;Damhar&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, if summoning a demon, one should never attempt to do so alone. Rather, the summoning should be conducted in a group consisting of three, four, or seven individuals (representing the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;combination of the two&lt;/a&gt; respectively). Some humans are better suited for ritual sacrifice than others when it comes to summoning demons.\nSome rituals involve summoning demonic larvae inside a living vessel's stomach, which will deposit eggs and create a nest. As the ritual is close to completion, flies will start to pour from the victim's orifices, which is a sign that the possession has taken hold. At this point, the vessel can be unbound and disposed, allowing the fully formed demon to erupt, bound to the will of its summoner. \nWhile not necessarily summoning or possession, at least some demons within Hell can speak through humans on the mortal plane.\nIn ages past, it was common in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; to decorate buildings with stone statues of demons that were enchanted to serve as guardians and protectors of those within. The misshapen figures of the statues were designed to taunt and anger any demons that attempted to gain entrance.\nDemons can be unintentionally summoned to Sanctuary through uncontrolled magic, which weakens the fabric between the human world and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. Some individuals can become literal portals to summoning demons, and are said to have \"cursed burning blood\", as they literally ignite in flames while rifts on the ground open, with demons emerging from them. While these flames don't kill the cursed person, it inflicts excruciating pain to them.\nAnother way of summoning demons (at least powerful ones) is to turn a person into a beacon for a specific demon to arrive. This involves tattooing sigils of the demon using willingly given blood on a victim, or for a person to willingly carve the sigils on themselves. This beacon works across realms, and can summon demon to an otherwise sanctified location.\nBeliefs and Culture.\nDemons believe that absolute chaos is the true nature of Creation. Many lesser demons despise humanity, seeing the existence of Man as offensive to their \"higher\" position in the greater scheme of things. Many demons hoard wealth. Attitudes of demons otherwise depend on their master\u2014the legions of Mephisto were driven by a hatred of all living things, especially those who were pure of heart. The soldiers of Baal sought the undoing of Creation, striving for disorder and destruction. To them, order was an abhorrence. The minions of Diablo used illusion and fear as their greatest weapons, preferring to wait for an opponent to show weakness before they attacked. Demons frequently scheme against one another, but otherwise, a hierarchy of sorts can be observed for demonkind:\nOf these Evils, many believe that if there can be said to be one single ruler of demonkind, it is Mephisto. At the very bottom of the hierarchy are the &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, who are despised by all of demonkind.\nLesser demons will not follow one of their own kind. Only a demon of higher standing can lead them. Most demons rely on force to enact their will.\nThe Primes and Lessers (collectively known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt;) each had their own realm of Hell, while the Mallet Lords control the outer reaches of Hell. It was rare for the Primes to work together. Few demons are allowed the honor of direct contact with one of the Lords of Hell. Many servants of the Great Evils exist(ed), such as the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20Lieutenant\"&gt;Sin Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;. \nDemons maintain a symbol-based writing system. Few, if any humans are capable of reading it.\nMany demons fear the light of the sun.\nMany demons hoard all the wealth they can find, even if they have no use for the &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; used by mortals.\nDemons have a sense of \"justice\" (such as it is), but it is a cruel and sadistic form of it. Demons can be notoriously clever, and should not be trusted by mortals. However, they hide their lies within the truth.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nDemons originated from the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;, whose body became the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. For ages they fought against angelkind in the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. It came to a halt with the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. It was eventually revealed that the Worldstone had been used to create the mortal realm, a revelation that gained the interest of the Prime Evils. The result was the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with a pact between Heaven and Hell to allow Man the freedom to choose his own path.\nThe Dark Exile and Civil War.\nThe aftermath of the Sin War led to a falling out between the Prime and Lesser Evils. Not only had the Lesser Evils been kept in the dark about the existence of Sanctuary, but they were furious that the Primes were intent on weaponizing humanity's nephalem potential rather than continuing the Eternal Conflict against Heaven. As the centuries plodded along, many in Hell began to wonder just what it was they were fighting over. The Lesser Evils of Hell were growing tired of the endless ebb and flow in the tides of mortal favor, as well as those in the elaborate schemes of the Primes. The Lesser Evils longed to return to the epic days of the Great Conflict, and lay siege again to the gates of the High Heavens. In their ignorance, the Lesser Evils began to believe that the Three were afraid to continue the war with Heaven. Believing themselves superior to mortalkind, and frustrated by the cessation of the war, Azmodan and Belial saw the situation as their chance to overthrow the Prime Evils and take control of Hell for themselves. The two demon lords made a pact with their minor brethren, assuring them that the wretched plague of humanity would not deter the ultimate victory of the sons of Hell. Azmodan and Belial devised a plan to end the stalemate, achieve victory in the Sin War and ultimately ride the bloody crest of the Great Conflict straight into the very arms of Armageddon. Thus, a great revolution was set into motion as all of Hell went to war against the Three Brothers. The Primes, despite their efforts, were defeated and banished into the mortal realm, bodiless, where Azmodan hoped they would remain trapped forever. Furthermore, with the presence of the Primes in the mortal realm, Azmodan believed that Heaven would be forced to divert its attention towards humanity, thus potentially leaving Heaven vulnerable.\nThe few demons who still pledged allegiance to the Primes entered Sanctuary to serve their masters. Yet relations between Azmodan and Belial quickly soured as they began arguing over who should ascend to the highest rank in Hell. When the bickering turned to violence, their alliance ended, and the remaining denizens of Hell found themselves in a second civil war. This state of affairs continued until at least the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, by which point Azmodan had gained the upperhand for quite awhile. However, the two demons nonetheless came to share the same goal of subjugating humanity into their fold.\nThe Reawakening of the Three.\nThe awakening of Diablo in Tristram sparked a chain of events that upset the status quo for demonkind. Andariel and Duriel concluded that the Primes would inevitably use the powers of Man to reclaim Hell, and thus endevoured to gain favor by allying themselves with the Lord of Terror as he traveled across Sanctuary with a &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;mortal host&lt;/a&gt;. It was believed that with Andariel's presence on Sanctuary, the forces of Hell were once again aligned with the Primes. Diablo, Baal, and Mephisto gathered in &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, where they enacted their final stratagem to retake Hell and gain vengeance against those who overthrew them. Opening the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo entered Hell to rally demons still loyal to the Primes. Baal journeyed north to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, which would corrupt humanity in turn and enslave Man to the will of Hell. Mephisto stayed behind, intent on destroying any who would attempt to thwart their plan. In truth, the Three had masterminded the Dark Exile and their banishment with the aid of the fallen &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; Izual, who had told them of the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s and how they might use them to further their own ends.\nYet the Primes' plans were thwarted by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;. The group that had slain Andariel and Duriel, Mephisto, and Diablo in Hell itself. Baal himself was slain on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, though not before the Worldstone was corrupted. To save humanity, the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the stone. While this saved humanity from corruption, it left Sanctuary open to demonic invasion. \nDawn of Damnation.\nWith the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, demons were able to travel east further than they'd done so in the past, coming into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;Five years&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of the Worldstone, &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt; rallied a demonic army in order to obtain its fragments, intending to resurect Diablo and reignite the Eternal Conflict. Skarn's demonic forces launched an &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Sanctuary, sweeping over &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, only the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; stood against them. Similarly, the &lt;a href=\"Wrathborne\"&gt;Wrathborne&lt;/a&gt; also launched a series of invasions. Demons also sought control of the &lt;a href=\"Accursed%20Towers\"&gt;Accursed Towers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Diablo's manifestation in Sanctuary neared, demons ran rampant, paving the way for his arrival.\nThe End of Days.\nBelial and Azmodan came to share the same goal of subjugating humanity into their fold. Belial sank his claws into &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, ruling &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; through his &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;mortal host&lt;/a&gt;, yet his plans were thwarted by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned inside the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. In a bid to retrieve the stone, Azmodan unleashed his &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Sin\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; upon Sanctuary and laid &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, yet was also defeated and imprisoned. Yet it was here that Diablo's plan was revealed as the artifact was turned on the mortal &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, bred as a vessel for the Lord of Terror by her own mother, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, for his rebirth as a singular Prime Evil. Now, as a singular Prime Evil, Diablo led the legions of Hell in an assault on Heaven. For the first time in the history of the Eternal Conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt; were breached, and demons ran rampant throughout the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt;. Yet once again, Diablo was defeated, and the demon invasion thwarted.\nThe Great Enmity.\nIn the aftermath of Diablo's defeat in Heaven, and that of Belial and Azmodan on Sanctuary, lesser demons still wandered Sanctuary, thirsting for the blood of the innocent. However, the loss of their leaders meant that they acted without larger organization, and did not make much of an impact (at least in the eyes of Heaven). During the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, demons still roamed Sanctuary unchecked. Demonic invasion reduced &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; to ruins, and after the empire's fall, demons continued to roam the desert sands. Demons gained influence over various areas of the mortal realm, the most afflicted being those subsumed by &lt;a href=\"Helltide\"&gt;Helltide&lt;/a&gt;s. After &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; was summoned into Sanctuary, more demons rose from Hell to infest the mortal realm.\nAfter Lilith's &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, demons from the darkest depths of Hell made their way into the mortal realm, ushering in a new era of death and wanton destruction. Endless waves of demons threatened to overwhelm Sanctuary's meager defenses.\nInspired by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Harvest\"&gt;Blood Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, the legions of Hell regrouped to coordinate a most formidable display of force through &lt;a href=\"Helltide\"&gt;Helltide&lt;/a&gt;s. Furthermore, the ferocity of caught Hell's attention.\nIn-game.\nIn all &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Series\"&gt;\"Diablo\"&lt;/a&gt; games, demons are one of the three (the others being &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;) major types of enemies the heroes will encounter, and perhaps the most numerous category. Within the user interface, a demon is usually associated with the &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; indicator.\nDiablo.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", demons are \"normal\" enemies, and receive full &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; from all weapons. In return, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Bolt\"&gt;Holy Bolt&lt;/a&gt;s have no effect on them. Demons are vulnerable to some specific weaponry, however.\nDiablo II.\nThe concept of demons as enemies was further expanded in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". Many items offer bonus damage or &lt;a href=\"attack%20rating\"&gt;attack rating&lt;/a&gt; against demons. Most demons are immune to &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20difficulty\"&gt;Hell difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nDemons are more or less encountered in nearly every location of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Bonus effects against Demons are less common than in the second game, but still exist: for example, . The only act that has less demons than other enemies is ."}

The Demon Hunter was introduced as a character built around ranged combat. They can dual-wield crossbows, launch explosives, place traps, and cast shadow magic (which complements their dark nature). Due to these capabilities, this class is apparently a combination of both the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; classes from &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;. Blizzard made the Demon Hunter darker than the other classes as they wanted a character that would have a different feel from the others.\nDemon Hunters mostly use &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage, with a portion of &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; skills, but can tune their skills to deal &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Damage\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; damage. Some, very few, runes were originally dealing &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage as well, but were changed to Cold after patch 2.1.2.\nUnlike the other classes, the Demon Hunter uses two resources \u2013 the fast-regenerating &lt;a href=\"Hatred\"&gt;Hatred&lt;/a&gt; (used for offensive skills) and the slow-regenerating &lt;a href=\"Discipline\"&gt;Discipline&lt;/a&gt; (used for tactical skills and evasion). The class resource orb is divided in two halves accordingly \u2013 the left half (red) represents Hatred and the right half (blue) represents Discipline. Demon Hunters are very poor at absorbing damage, but have the largest assortment of skills that allow evading it altogether. In group, they deal very high damage from considerable range, supporting their allies by &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"Immobilize\"&gt;Immobilizing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;ning enemies.\nThree types of Demon Hunter-exclusive items exist in game: &lt;a href=\"Quivers\"&gt;Quivers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Crossbows\"&gt;Hand Crossbows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cloaks\"&gt;Cloaks&lt;/a&gt;. Demon Hunters typically use ranged weapons in combat, although some custom builds for melee combat exist as well. Demon Hunters can &lt;a href=\"dual-wielding\"&gt;dual-wield&lt;/a&gt; Hand Crossbows, but not any other weapons.\nThere are six Demon Hunter class sets in game:\nSkills.\nThe Demon Hunter's dual resources grants them access to a wide variety of offensive and defensive abilities, making them uniquely suited to deal with a large variety of situations. Hatred fuels offensive abilities while Discipline fuels the Demon Hunter's tactical abilities. Both ability types must be used in tandem to exploit the maximum efficiency of the class.\nThe Demon Hunter's split resources can be a double edged sword however. Exhausting all of one does not leave them completely helpless, but locks them out of half of their skillset, greatly reducing their capabilities. Learning to balance the two resources effectively is a key pillar of mastering the Demon Hunter.\nThe Demon Hunter's Active Skillset is divided into six sub-categories: Primary Attacks, Secondary Attacks, Defensive Maneuvers, Hunting Skills, Devices, and Archery Skills. Many of these require a &lt;a href=\"Ranged%20Weapon\"&gt;ranged weapon&lt;/a&gt; to be equipped. &lt;a href=\"Rocket\"&gt;Rocket&lt;/a&gt;s are a special mechanics of the Demon Hunter skills, providing independent fire support when necessary.\nPopular Demon Hunter skill combinations:\nExotic Builds:\nDevelopment.\nThe Demon Hunter was the last class developed for Diablo III's base game, and it was intended that the class reflect &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;the series's&lt;/a&gt; dark themes. The developers always knew that the game's fifth class would be a ranged one. The earliest designs depicted a woodland hunter, but the character was deemed to lack an edge. Revisions showing him with a pair of swords were popular, but this drifted away from the class's original intent. A desert ranger class was also explored, but the designers ran into artistic problems\u2014his cloth clothing made him look too bulky, and as more gear was added, the problem only got worse. Thus, it was decided to reboot the class's development.\nIn the revised concept, the hero was designed to have a gothic feel. The designers wanted the class to have a unique insight into the coming demonic invasion, and began exploring how the class might wield demonic artifacts and runes against his foes. With this \"hunter of demons\" taking shape, the demon hunter class was thus settled upon. The idea was pitched to make the Demon Hunter half-demon. However, the idea was not followed up. &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt; saw the character as \"more Batman than Blade,\" and the presence of demonic limbs made the Demon Hunter look like a melee-based class.\nPhysically, the class was meant to be quick and agile. The legs and body were free moving, while a cape was added to symbolize the enigmatic nature of the demon hunters. Further inspiration was taken from characters such as &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Astarwars%3ABoba%20Fett\"&gt;Boba Fett&lt;/a&gt;, , and even . An early idea for the class was to have the Demon Hunter stand on the shoulders of the , shooting from atop him/her."}

When Legendary items drop, both types are labeled as \"One-Handed Bow\" when they drop. Bows for the weapon slot do significantly more damage than those in the offhand slot, and cannot be equipped there.\nIn PvP, the Demon Hunter has an innate 15% reduction of incoming damage from enemy players."}

They crouch and take aim far from danger, relying on &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crossbows\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt;, deadly traps, and projectiles to swiftly bring an end to the creatures that haunt &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;their world&lt;/a&gt;. With sweeping blasts of shot, wide salvos of arrows and timed explosives at their disposal, Demon Hunters excel at devastating groups of foes who cluster together. Hunters\u2019 pinpoint accuracy also allows them to deal with stronger monsters at a distance: they can snipe at key targets or fall back while snapping off kill shots at advancing foes. However, Demon Hunters\u2019 focus on ranged combat and limited melee-weapons training leave them in danger when they\u2019re cornered or surrounded. Evasive skills like defensive rolls and jumps, as well as targeted attacks that hamstring and slow enemies, are as crucial to survival as any arrow or bolt in a hunter's &lt;a href=\"Quivers\"&gt;quiver&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the Demon Hunters were just starting to form. Sworn to the destruction of the creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;, the Demon Hunters are few in number\u2014only in the hundreds and do not owe their allegiance to any one king or country. Rather, Demon Hunters are those who have lost their homes and loved ones to &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;spawn. When their homes are burned down and their families butchered by demons, most newly scarred refugees give up on living \u2013 but a few bury their dead, band together, and swear vengeance. It was from one such act that the creed of the Demon Hunters was created. \nThere is something in all Demon Hunters that gives them the strength to resist the demonic corruption that would drive lesser men to madness. They hone this power, for their resistance to this taint enables them to use the demons' power as a weapon. Yet they dare not dream of victory, or, even less likely, peace. They cannot hope to return to their former lives, and are perpetually at war within themselves, striving to balance their hatred for demons with the need of discipline. But still, they hunt, hoping that if they can save even but one life from the forces of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, the world will be better for it. Haunted by their pasts and fueled by vengeance in the present, they can do nothing else. However, the hatred bubbling inside every demon hunter cannot be quelled. Eventually, it boils to the surface.\nDemon Hunters are feared by some of the same people they aim to save. Some say that Demon Hunters are no better than the demons they hunt, that they bring death and destruction with them. And indeed, sometimes, a Demon Hunter loses their ability to control their fear or hatred, and consequently lose themselves to their violent impulses. Criminals among the Demon Hunters are given three days worth of food and water and banished. Many Demon Hunters' eyes glow with hellfire, due to peering into demons and seeing vengeance. There are some moral lines the Demon Hunters refuse to cross. However, even a seasoned Demon Hunter can be overtaken hate by their hatred. Aides regularly inspect veterans' &lt;a href=\"helms\"&gt;helms&lt;/a&gt;, looking for signs that &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20magic\"&gt;shadowed power&lt;/a&gt; has seeped from their bodies.\nAt any given point in time, over half of the Demon Hunters are operating outside the Dreadlands, hunting down hellspawn wherever they may be found in Sanctuary. \nRecruitment and Training.\nThe Demon Hunter order is currently based in the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;. This is so they can live and train without the interference of any nation that would worry over having such a group camped within its borders. Additionally, the abundance of demons and other foul creatures in the area gives recruits plenty of opportunities to hone their skills.\nDemon Hunters do not force anyone to join them. Rather, upon coming across those who have suffered from demons, their first priority is to feed, shelter, heal, educate, and train them. After that, they may choose to become a Demon Hunter. Most Demon Hunters are recruited into the order as children.\nFew traditions exist within the order, as every Demon Hunter must walk their own path. One such path is that of Hellbinders; who treat incendiary arrows as the focus of their fighting style and the core of their spiritual beliefs. However, a master can still train an apprentice Demon Hunter, and may even pass on their armor to their apprentice\u2014an honor that few apprentices would refuse. The Demon Hunter order is led by the Order-masters; only those who fully temper their hatred with discipline earn the right to bear their sigil. Trainee Demon Hunters are referred to as neophytes. Fledgling hunters train their strength by wearing weights on their shoulders, then pulling greatbows to full draw and holding them until their arms lose feeling.\nTactics and Capabilities.\nDemon Hunters train to hold back the darkness with unconventional combinations of weaponry and fighting styles that only they can employ. They are masters of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Crossbows\"&gt;hand crossbow&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 quick-reloading, fast-firing ranged weapons that they use to turn demons into their temporary quivers. Demon Hunters are so adept in the hand crossbow\u2019s use that they can dual wield them. Other elements of their arsenal include longbows, grenades, and hand-thrown weapons. When hunting packs of demons, Demon Hunters rely on traps to deal with their foes. Demon Hunters can also wield &lt;a href=\"shadow%20magic\"&gt;apocryphal magics&lt;/a&gt;, to sneak through the shadows and deal with their prey, or escape their foes' notice.\nFledgling Demon Hunters wear light, flexible leather to guard their wrists and throat, and hoods to hide their faces and blend in with shadows.

They were made to counter the flight advantage of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThey ascend from the infernal abyss with a clear purpose: spread &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; to the highest reaches, fill the shallows with their acid breath, and feast upon the ashes left behind.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nHellflyers appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

They are fragile, but may 'deep strike' by descending from the sky over 2 seconds anywhere on the battlefield (once they descend, they may not lift off again). While descending, they can be damaged and even killed (even before they are actually visible).\nThey can also be seen swooping down on human soldiers and carrying them away. Sometimes they break through the roof, getting into the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Keep Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn combat, they may attack in melee with their claws (if cornered), but prefer to spit fireballs that deal average &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage. A Firewing subtype uses a breath attack (similar to that used by &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;s). In Act IV, they often bombard the battlefield with fireballs, but these are scripted events and not the actual attacks.\nIn , Banished Firewings briefly appear in battle with &lt;a href=\"Belphegor%20%28Siege%20Runekeeper%29\"&gt;Belphegor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s can call upon Shadow Beasts which look like pitch-black Hellflyers to cast down &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Rain of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;."}

Their attacks are slow and hit hard (often knocking victim back), and in addition to large Life pool, they can enter a 'block' state (indicated by Tremors being covered with a translucent sphere). In this stance, which usually lasts 5 seconds, they cannot move or attack, but are 95% resistant to all damage, making you seek other targets. Once the Demonic Tremor ends his block state, it will enrage, gaining increased attack speed, movement speed and damage.

It consisted of at least five volumes.\nVolume 5 Excerpt.\n\"Fallen Ones (NANUS IMPROBUS)\"\n\"As hard as it is to believe, the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20One\"&gt;fallen ones&lt;/a&gt; were once exalted &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. They served as &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;'s hands, performing acts that he would not, could not involve himself in. They were the instrument of Azmodan's first failed attempt to usurp power from &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;brothers&lt;/a&gt;, and after that failure, the fallen were subjected to the full wrath of Diablo. They were twisted into small, ridiculous imps, in contrast to their previously powerful forms. Moreover, if they expected Azmodan to reverse their condition, they were sadly mistaken. The infuriated Azmodan held them responsible for the Prime Evils' continued reign, and so he left the fallen in their new bodies, where their degradation would serve to amuse him for all eternity. Their failure provided him with the information he required to succeed in dethroning Diablo and his brothers - the event now known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;\" - but that fact did nothing to soften his heart toward the fallen.\"\n\"When unleashed upon &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;our realm&lt;/a&gt; by their master, Azmodan, these impish terrors display a tendency to swarm like flesh-hungry locusts, and they have been known to tear apart a sleeping village in minutes. Small of stature and simian in appearance, these creatures possess surprising strength and unnatural agility. Other than feasting on &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; flesh, the only act that gives these unspeakable horrors pleasure is breeding; hence the tendency to encounter them in large packs.\"\n\"However, due to their small size, cowardice appears to be one of the chief features of this species. They quickly retreat when one of their brethren falls in battle.\"\n\"Fallen ones display no obvious tendency towards greater organization beyond their predisposition to swarm. This is fortunate for humanity, for they are so numerous that if they were to band together in large numbers, they might easily overwhelm a small city.\"\n\"Through further research, I have identified five distinct types of fallen:\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Imp\"&gt;IMPS&lt;/a&gt; - \"These are the commonest of the fallen family of demons. They are the stereotypical fallen ones in look and behavior: small, red, swarming, bloodthirsty, and cowardly.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;SHAMAN&lt;/a&gt; - \"Fallen shaman priests lead camps of fallen. I have also heard it rumored that they possess the ability to raise imps from the dead!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Lunatic\"&gt;LUNATIC&lt;/a&gt; - \"These enraged, oversized fallen creatures are bloated seemingly to the point of bursting, an impression buttressed by the fact that these insane demons rush their intended victims and then stab themselves until they explode. A more fitting name could not be found for these maniacal beings.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Overseer\"&gt;OVERSEER&lt;/a&gt; - \"The fallen overseer drives his smaller impish charges into a frenzy with his ape-like leaping and growling. An overseer among a group of fallen is a dangerous thing, as the cowardice that usually characterizes them is overwhelmed by fear of their much larger brethren.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Hound\"&gt;HOUNDS&lt;/a&gt; - \"These slobbering abominations are commonly found among groups of the fallen and are utilized as guard animals, beasts of burden, or even food by their demonic masters. These beasts are loyal to a fault, regardless of the abuse heaped upon them.\"\n\"I suspect the existence of at least two other types of fallen, but I will need to conduct further research before I reveal my theories as to the ultimate familial structure of these fiends.\""}

Marks&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt appears in print in the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Archive\"&gt;Diablo Archive&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\n&lt;a href=\"Siggard\"&gt;Siggard&lt;/a&gt;--the only survivor of the battle of &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt;, unable to remember the battle's final hours--is driven to avenge those slain by the army of darkness. As he hunts the demonic army, &lt;a href=\"Siggard\"&gt;Siggard&lt;/a&gt; pieces together the truth of that terrible battle...and finds his nightmare is just beginning.\nDevelopment.\n\"Demonsbane\" was a book published in the spirit of the \"e-book revolution.\" However, the market for e-books was quite small at the time and despite months of advertising on &lt;a href=\"battle.net\"&gt;battle.net&lt;/a&gt;, sales were in the hundreds rather than the projected thousands. It was the first of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;'s tie-in novels for its major franchises.\nBefore being written, it was decided that \"Demonsbane\" should set the tone for the series, and help establish &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; not only as a living and breathing game world, but also as a living and breathing world in literature. As such, Marks did a lot of world building using flavor quotes at the beginning of each chapter. Marks was given access to a writer's bible for the \"Diablo\" universe, the main proviso being that the story not touch on anything related to \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", which was planned at the time. This resulted in an early idea for the novel being shot down, as it took place in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. As such, Marks chose an area of Sanctuary that hadn't been fleshed out yet (Entsteig), and placed his characters in the area.\nElements of the novel are incongruent with later \"Diablo\" lore, such as conflating the timeframes of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt; (later established to be separated by centuries), and taking place at least centuries after them. No elements of the novel have ever been referenced in any other piece of \"Diablo\" media."}

As a rule of thumb, a \"large\" monster is anything that appears larger or bulkier than the character itself. When it hits a non-large monster, the monster is knocked back. This can cause large amounts of repeated damage on a single small target, with the monster being knocked back, then running into the boulder, just to be knocked back again.\nThe knockback direction of the boulder is, surprisingly, not along its path, but always away from the caster. If the druid moves after casting, the repeated knockback may not work, since the boulder may knockback the &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; away from the path of the boulder.\nThe boulder creates a temporary &lt;a href=\"Blaze\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt; effect as it travels along the ground in a straight line, leaving a trail of fire. This is effective as it slows monsters down, burns them while they are knocked back, and allows the Druid to have his own version of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Wall%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fire Wall&lt;/a&gt;."}

A tank, such as a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Master\"&gt;Shadow Master&lt;/a&gt; is used to gather enemies together into a tight group, allowing for maximum damage from the area-of-effect powers.\nStat Points.\n&lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; should be equal.\n&lt;a href=\"Vitality\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; is important to all characters, so a few points may be useful. But because the Monk typically relies on her tank to do most of the up-close fighting for her, do not over-invest in this stat.\n&lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt; should be left alone. The Monk's mana usage is typically fairly low and can easily be compensated for with some mana leech and/or mana regeneration items.\nEquipment.\nClaw.\nBecause Monks are a hybrid build, any claw that gives bonuses to primary or secondary skills may be used. Because they typically rely on charge-up attacks, kicks, and traps, only one claw is needed. The other hand should be free to carry a shield (see below).\nGood claw options may include:\nArmor.\nMonks should not typically be right in the thick of combat, so having armor with the highest-possible defense is not required, but as with all characters, they benefit greatly from good armor.\nGood armor options may include:\nShield.\nA &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; is very highly recommended for this build. Because Monks typically do not invest any points in weapon block, and they use charge-up attacks, kicks, and traps dual-wielding claws is not suggested.\nIdeally you should use a shield with a high chance to block. High defense is good, but a good chance to block is preferable.\nGood shield options may include:\nHireling.\nTake cold-based &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Iron Wolf&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries. Their &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Spike\"&gt;Glacial Spike&lt;/a&gt; will cause massive groups of monsters to be slowed or even frozen for a few seconds.\nAlternatively a cold aura &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Desert Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; may be taken. Their &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Freeze\"&gt;Holy Freeze&lt;/a&gt; aura will have the effect of an \"unavoidable\" slow on enemies within a large area, but will not freeze them. The Desert Mercenary, when well-equipped, can act as an additional tank to augment your &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Master\"&gt;Shadow Master&lt;/a&gt;.\nTactics.\nIn PVM games the Monk should let her &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Master\"&gt;Shadow Master&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hireling\"&gt;hireling&lt;/a&gt; gather monsters together into a tight group. Using &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Talon\"&gt;Dragon Talon&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt;, optionally charged-up with &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Strike\"&gt;Phoenix Strike&lt;/a&gt;, the Monk can strike at the fringes of the group. Once there are corpses on the ground she can retreat and cast &lt;a href=\"Death%20Sentry\"&gt;Death Sentry&lt;/a&gt; to cause massive damage to the group.\nThe Monk must be careful about getting surrounded by enemies. Because as she focuses most of her stat points on strength and dexterity, she tends to have lower HP than other physical fighters. Always make sure you have an avenue of escape (either on foot or teleportation) in case things start to look ugly.\nJoining PVP with this build is a bad idea."}

It is of the &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monks of Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nAmong Sanctuary's most deadly warriors, the monks of the &lt;a href=\"Sahptev\"&gt;Sahptev&lt;/a&gt; faith train their bodies and minds so that they may become the foremost holy warriors of the land of &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28Country%29\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;. Within the cloisters of the &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt;, the Monks endure harsh trials both physical and spiritual, proving their devotion and attaining unmatched focus in battle.\nDaily ritualistic cleansings help monks purify their spirits and overcome the corruption that gnaws at the hearts of all men. In the pursuit of martial perfection, they also hone their legendary balance and clarity, skills that allow them to master both unarmed combat and a diverse array of weapons.\nAfter a lifetime of preparation, anointed monks are permitted to leave their monasteries' halls to serve the decrees of the Patriarchs. The emblem on their foreheads marks them as survivors, achievers, and pillars of their society.\nMonks embody the will of Ivgorod\u2019s one thousand and one gods in every step and every strike.\nGameplay.\nThe Monk's \"core fantasy\" is to be fast and agile, standing in contrast to the heavier and &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; classes. The class's skills mostly incorporate &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Holy%20%28Damage%29\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0damage (and a few &lt;a href=\"cold\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; runes), but at its core the Monk is focused on mobility, being able to dash to enemies and move quickly around the battlefield. In comparison to \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", the Monk has similar gameplay elements to the &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs they are overall a melee class, Monks gain a +30% built-in damage reduction. Prior to patch 2.1, Monks relied heavily on their ability to .\nMonks can equip the class items: &lt;a href=\"Daibo\"&gt;Daibo&lt;/a&gt; (combat staves), &lt;a href=\"Fist%20Weapons\"&gt;Fist Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Stones\"&gt;Spirit Stones&lt;/a&gt;. Monks can &lt;a href=\"dual-wielding\"&gt;dual-wield&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the Hero Creation screen, the following is stated: \"Holy and elemental magic infuse the Monk with the ability to heal and deliver crippling damage to adversaries. The force of spirit powers the Monk's abilities. Spirit is gained through the Monk's primary attacks.\"\nMonks have six class sets in game:\nSkills.\nThe primary skills are unique in that each have three separate attacks that are triggered in often increasingly powerful stages. Monks can create a 'combo' third-level strike that either does more damage, does damage in a wider area, or reaches out farther to more enemies.\nThe monk resource system relies on &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, which is refilled by normal attacks; while Spirit does not decrease over time, it also does not regenerate in that way.\nAccording to the Monk's color palette (white, silver, gold and blue), and the runes which appear on the ground when the Monk uses certain skills, their skills focus on Holy energy and ancestral knowledge. The runes also mark a skill's area-of-effect radius.\nThe monk's melee attacks are more potent when they\u2019re used in careful succession; they generate additional spiritual energy, deal increased damage and produce unique effects that can enable a monk to defeat nearly any enemy. In addition, unlike Barbarians and Crusaders, Monks rely on movement, attacking enemy from different angles and becoming more deadly as they move. Monks can even &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;, although their teleportation is actually a very rapid movement rather than use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a group, Monks use Mantras, skills resembling the Paladin's &lt;a href=\"Auras\"&gt;Auras&lt;/a&gt;, and can protect and heal their allies with some other abilities. Note that while same effects from same Mantras from different Monks do not stack, they do stack with other similar modifiers, and two identical Mantras with different runes will apply the basic effect (once) and the effects of both runes.\nMonks are the only class with innate abilities of direct healing. Many of their skills also provide themselves and allies with increased &lt;a href=\"Life%20Regeneration\"&gt;Life Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Absorb\"&gt;Absorb&lt;/a&gt; shields, further increasing the healing effects from the Monk's own (not granted by other skills) &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; attributes.\nPopular Monk Skill combinations include:\nDevelopment.\nThe Monk was perhaps the most debated class during the development of \"Diablo III\". The situation was that either Blizzard would develop the Monk, and then have the as an expansion class, or vice versa. Ultimately, the Monk got priority, as it was felt that it would be a better counterpart to the in terms of kit and appearance. Despite the Monk-Crusader dichotomy, the Monk was designed as \"a twist on the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;\" (from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\"), in that the Monk was themed around Holy attacks. Inspiration for the Monk was taken from \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar%3A_The_Last_Airbender\"&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/a&gt;\".\nChallenges with the Monk came around making its melee abilities \"cool,\" the idea that combo attacks were \"cool\" even if they didn't have huge gameplay impact. There was also the issue of reconciling the Monk as a \"shirtless dude with no weapons\" in a game that was based around item drops. There was debate about making the Monk larger and overweight, but this was dropped, as the developers felt that this would be too similar visually to the Barbarian, and the intended future Crusader class.\nThe class was announced at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; 2009 and was playable in the \"Diablo III\" demo at the event.\nWith the release of the Crusader in \"Reaper of Souls\", and being closer to the Paladin, the Monk was freed to explore elemental attacks."}

{"id": "35", "revid": "44564686", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=35", "title": "Monk (Hellfire)", "text": "The Monk is a powerful unarmed combatant. They are &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;strong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dextrous&lt;/a&gt;. Monks have some skill with fighting with &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;, and though it does less damage than their bare hands, &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; enable them to execute a sweeping attack and block incoming blows. Likewise, heavy armor actually gives them less defense than lighter armor. Since they possess great natural damage already, they search out staves which will give them faster attack. Dexterity adds to their damage equally to strength, however Dexterity also increases their ability to block incoming attacks with their &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;. Their high natural defense makes searching for high defense armor less of a necessity. They try to find armor that gives them effects instead. In unarmed combat they prefer to use their feet as weapons rather than their hands. Their kicks are very fast and do a lot of damage at high levels.\nThe Monk search skill is very useful. In &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;, items could not be highlighted on the ground with the magical spell search. This caused problems when trying to find &lt;a href=\"rings\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"amulets\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Potions%23Elixirs\"&gt;Elixirs&lt;/a&gt; on the ground, especially if they fell behind an object. This necessitated a tiring search by the player to find the tiny item on the ground. The &lt;a href=\"Search\"&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; spell highlighted not only the item on the ground, but also all items that had fallen on the map. Other classes could learn Search as a spell.\nHistory.\nMonks of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Bough\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Bough&lt;/a&gt; are a rare sight. It is said that they come \nfrom a desolate wilderness, where their people were forced to flee after being conquered \nby an invading horde. Because of their great defeat, these people vowed to master \nthe arts of combat. Lacking resources such as iron, they learned to use their bare hands\nand simple wooden staves as deadly weapons, and do not depend on metal armor to provide \nprotection in battle. Instead, they rely upon speed and concentration. In their harsh \nnative climate, they have been forced to find food and other essentials in the most \nunlikely of places. Over time, this careful searching has honed their visual perception\nto an almost supernatural level.\nIt is rumored that a dark sickness has fallen upon the homeland of the Monks, and many\nof their people have died. The Brotherhood of the Bough has sought to unearth the source of the foulness,\nto no avail. Desperate for answers, lone Monks have ventured to distant lands, searching \nfor regions suffering a similar affliction. Tales of the evils besetting &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; \nwill have already attracted the attention of the Brotherhood.\nCharacter Attributes and Information..\n\u00b9 Rounded down. Additionally, the rounding down is done separately for each source of vitality or magic, so while monks will get the full 1.5 life or mana per point of vitality or magic given to them by magic items, they only get 1 life or mana per stat point allocated to magic or vitality. Rogues also suffer from this glitch.\n\u00b2 Monks get 3 mana instead of 2 upon hitting level 33. Rogues also experience this glitch.\n\u00b3 These are what the values theoretically should be according to the other numbers in these tables. Real results will differ due to bugs, Shrines, etc."}

This set can only drop at\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0difficulty.\nThe set is named after\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sunwuko\"&gt;Sunwuko&lt;/a&gt;, the Monkey King.\nWhile this set can be used by any class, it is specifically designed for Monks.\nPieces.\nThe set consists of six pieces. All six are required to complete the set, but none of them are Monk-restricted.\nSet Bonus:\nThe first bonus is always at 50%, regardless of current number of stacks.\nThe second bonus summons an illusion near the target, as close as possible. Taunt range is roughly 10 yards, and it lasts for less than half a second; as a result, it can only damage those that are really close. Once the decoy explodes, taunted enemies will turn their attention back to the Monk. &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; type of the decoy explosion is chosen by the Monk's highest elemental skill damage bonus. Decoy does not spawn at \"every\" target touched by the Sweeping Wind, and its internal &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; appears to be equal to attack period.\nFor the last bonus, damage buff is multiplicative to all other modifiers. With &lt;a href=\"Vengeful%20Wind\"&gt;Vengeful Wind&lt;/a&gt;, it can award up to 19,500% additional damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyoshiro%27s%20Soul\"&gt;Kyoshiro's Soul&lt;/a&gt; is very helpful for this set, as it allows keeping Sweeping Wind active between battles without need to refresh it (which costs a healthy portion of &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;).\nDevelopment.\nOriginally, this set was also giving a 20% increased damage with a &lt;a href=\"Daibo\"&gt;Daibo&lt;/a&gt; (despite the Game Guide saying that it required a \"combat staff\", &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"polearms\"&gt;polearms&lt;/a&gt; would not suffice). It was removed in patch 2.1.2. It also summoned decoys based on &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; spent, not casting skills. In result, the most popular skills to spend Spirit were Mantras, which had no &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; and no animation.\nPrior to 2.4, it had different set bonuses: decoys were summoned by &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20Strike\"&gt;Cyclone Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Palm\"&gt;Exploding Palm&lt;/a&gt;, Lashing Tail Kick, Tempest Rush or Wave of Light, exploding for 1000% damage within 10 yards radius. When decoys exploded, damage of Cyclone Strike, Exploding Palm, Lashing Tail Kick, Tempest Rush and Wave of Light would be increased by 500% for 3 seconds.\nPrior to 2.6.1, the 6-piece bonus worked differently: it would make the skills consume a stack of Sweeping Wind in exchange for 3000% increased damage. This was eventually replaced with a passive buff dynamically based on the number of active stacks."}

Rarely seen outside &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, these holy warriors undergo intense mental and physical training to hone their minds and bodies into living instruments of divine justice.\nLore.\nAmongst Sanctuary's most deadly warriors, the Monks of the &lt;a href=\"Sahptev\"&gt;Sahptev&lt;/a&gt; faith train their bodies and minds so that they may become the foremost holy warriors of the land of &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28Country%29\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;. Within the cloisters of the &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt;, the Monks endure harsh trials both physical and spiritual, proving their devotion and attaining unmatched focus in battle. They are an order militant of the Sahptev faith, and are charged with carrying out the decrees of the kingdom's leaders.\nDaily ritualistic cleansings help monks purify their spirits and overcome the corruption that gnaws at the hearts of all men. In the pursuit of martial perfection, they also hone their legendary balance and clarity, skills that allow them to master both unarmed combat and a diverse array of weapons. All Monks receive a tattoo that runs down the back of their neck so that when a Monk dies, their life's story will be seen through the eyes of the gods. Likewise, Monks receive a pair of circles on their forehead after being anointed. The two circles represent order and chaos. Monks also shave their head-hair as a sign of piety.\nMonks in training are not allowed to leave the monastery, and those who do so are not allowed to return, and risk execution if they do. However, after a lifetime of preparation, anointed Monks are permitted to leave their monasteries' halls to serve the decrees of the Patriarchs. The emblem on their foreheads marks them as survivors, achievers, and pillars of their society. Monks who remain in the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Sky%20Monastery\"&gt;Floating Sky Monastery&lt;/a&gt; spend their days in rapt contemplation of their surroundings, awaiting signs from their gods. Monks are not supposed to feel pride, shame, or fear, and no selfishness as they devote themselves to the will of the gods.\nMusic is highly regarded in the order.\nHierarchy.\nThe Monks of Ivgorod are known to have the following ranks, roughly ascending in the following order:\nMonks are not allowed to defy the will of their masters. Other ranks include high abbott and waykeeper.\nCapabilities.\nMonks embody the will of Ivgorod\u2019s one thousand and one gods in every step and every strike. As many of the Monks value strength and resolve, it is common for them to seek the patronage of deities in the faith that embody these traits (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Zaim\"&gt;Zaim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ytar\"&gt;Ytar&lt;/a&gt;). They are far more in tune with their natural surroundings that most of the people of Sanctuary, and the physical conditioning they undergo is considered legendary.\nMonks are sacred warriors who channel divine power through sheer force of will. Healing waves, mantras of protection and attacks empowered with holy might are all within their purview. The Monks exude great control over their bodies, and skilled Monks deliver rapid-fire attacks unarmed or with a variety of well-balanced weapons. In combat, they emphasize high maneuverability over staying power, darting in and out of melees and avoiding protracted slugfests. Monks\u2019 attacks are primarily melee-focused. They can eliminate single foes with extreme damage, or deliver short-range area-of-effect assaults with waves of elemental power that emanate from palm strikes or crescent kicks. To defeat the inhuman evils they pit themselves against, Monks draw upon inner reserves of &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;, a resource that reflects their personal mastery and training. They are able to enter a trance that combines the effects of meditation with a state of alertness.\nAs living weapons, weapons for Monks are, strictly speaking, unnecessary. However, the Order values training with all forms of armament to increase one's physical prowess. It is not uncommon for a Monk to train with a specific weapon, and use it as an extension of their own attacks. Monks' martial forms commonly incorporate specialized weaponry. Even Monks\u2019 naked fists are vessels of destruction, but they can be augmented with fist weapons like the &lt;a href=\"katar\"&gt;katar&lt;/a&gt;, Monks are also trained to use the &lt;a href=\"daibo\"&gt;daibo&lt;/a&gt;. Monks have access to &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt;, but these weapons are frowned upon, due to the limits of these weapons in close combat.\nIn the beginning, Monks\u2019 armor is plain, cobbled together to protect their organs without being too restrictive. As experienced monks gain access to better craftsmanship, money and equipment, the quality of armor available to them increases substantially, incorporating personal ornamentation and fine materials. Yet, even such fine armor pales in comparison to the life-saving garb of heroes, carefully chosen to enhance monks\u2019 swift fighting styles and shield them from fire, claw, and &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. To the Veradani, the distinction between armor and weaponry is open to interpretation. What can provide defense, can provide offense, if the application is right.\nAll Monks are trained in healing arts.\nTraining.\nMany Monk initiates are taken as children from the mountains bordering the &lt;a href=\"Gorgorra\"&gt;Gorgorra&lt;/a&gt; forest. Ascetic practices require Monk initiates to go without food, water and sleep for months at a time. Those who survive emerge unmoved by the petty distractions of the physical world.\nMonk training is harsh. As soon as they can walk, children of the order are brought up in the company of physical weapons. The Monks teach that every person is a living, breathing weapon, but relying on a single resource at all times is folly. A Monk's true power comes from self-discipline and the spirit. The order, therefore, requires acolytes to master arms from three realms\u2014weapons of the mind, weapons of physical combat, and most potent, weapons of spirit. Once this has been achieved, trainees may wield more mundane weapons as an extension of their balanced spirit.\nMonks are trained in six techniques. Not all master them.\nMonk initiates master the Serpent's Form. In their final test, they are taken to the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%2012%20Vipers\"&gt;Pit of 12 Vipers&lt;/a&gt;. They are not told about the 13th.\nMonks receive at least some training in battle tactics (e.g. siege warfare).\nElder Monks who train acolytes don't necessarily punish them for their mistakes, and may foster friendships with them, as they instruct them in the right way to do things. However, novitiates receive punishments that are truly confusing. They often experience nothing more than afterimages, the sensation of biting wind, and a sting.\nInitiates who show insufficient aptitude for study are instructed to leave the monastery, but with the proviso of having one last chance to become Monks; to prevail in a physical challenge, thus earning the right to return by demonstrating a previously unseen talent for training, and are sequestered away for diligent study that can last for decades. Those who cannot, or will not complete this task, are forsaken by the monastery forever. Details of how these trials are composed are one of the monastery's most closely guarded secrets. Those who fail cannot speak of it (often being dead), and those who survive and are sequestered into study cannot engage with younger initiates.\nHistory.\nThe Monks of Ivgorod existed at least as far back as the 11th century, when &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; led his &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; into the western continent of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. His forces decimated those of &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28Country%29\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. However, in Ivgorod itself, matters were different, as the forests and mountains of the north were far better suited to Ivgorod's methods of warfare than that of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. In the midst of this, the Monks of Ivgorod were called into battle, the followers of Shaptev engaging the followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, as both steel and faith clashed. Ultimately, while the kingdom of Ivgorod would never recover from Zakarum's crusade, its people and culture survived.\nLater, the Veradani clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of Light&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, with the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, paranoia gripped Ivgorod as its people turned to the Patriarchs for guidance. The Monks were called into service to beat back the forces of Chaos."}

They are found inside the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\" and are found almost everywhere except towns in subsequent games.\nOverview.\nMonsters will &lt;a href=\"attack\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; the player on sight, as soon as they notice them (each monster has a line of sight and detection radius). With some very rare exceptions, monsters offer no interaction other than combat.\nAs the combat progresses, the monster's health bar goes down. If the last slice of health disappears, the player will see one or more of the following happen:\nMost monsters are classified as one of three major types: Animal, Undead and Demon. If the monster-type is not displayed, the monster is usually an animal. Some attacks and skills are stronger if they are directed against a specific type.\nDiablo I.\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I%20Bestiary\"&gt;Diablo I Bestiary&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(&lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Bestiary\"&gt;Hellfire Bestiary&lt;/a&gt;)\"\nIn Diablo I, the monster's name appear on the lower left in the status bar, written in white. If the monster is a unique monster, its name and information are written in gold. Monster type is not displayed, however, but is usually easy to guess.\nAnimals are more vulnerable to sharp weapons in this game, and less vulnerable to blunt weapons, while undead enemies are more vulnerable to blunt and less to sharp. Demons are equally vulnerable to both.\nIf the player has already encountered and killed a certain number of monsters of the same kind, more information such as resistances and immunities will be revealed in the status window.\nDiablo II.\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II%20Bestiary\"&gt;Diablo II Bestiary&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(&lt;a href=\"LOD%20Bestiary\"&gt;Lord of Destruction Bestiary&lt;/a&gt;)\"\nMonsters return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", found in each act outside towns. In this game, monsters have 14 possible classifications of animation, from basics such as Walk, Attack 1, and Death, to the seldom-used Block, Run, and four Special modes, reserved for miscellaneous animations. &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; is the only monster who uses every animation category available.\nIn the middle top of the screen, one will see the monster's name and its &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; bar. The color of the monster name has the following meaning:\nIn addition to the three major types, one can also encounter construct monsters, who are usually immobile, immune to &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; and are more &lt;a href=\"traps\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; than monsters.\u00a0\nWhile animals and demons are now equally responsive to all weapons, unless specifically stated otherwise, undead enemies always take 50% extra damage from blunt weapons.\nDiablo Immortal.\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Bestiary\"&gt;Horadric Bestiary&lt;/a&gt;\"\nMonsters appear as antagonists in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". Several return from Diablo II. Many features of monsters from Diablo III are used.\nThe monsters health bar is displayed at the top-center of the screen. The monster's name is written above its health, with its title (if it has one) below the health bar. The monster level is displayed to the left of its health, while an icon identifying the type of monster (a paw print for beast, an amputated fist for undead, a horned skull for demon, and a face for human). Below the title any &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;traits&lt;/a&gt; the monster has is shown.\nThe colour of the monster's name stands for;\nDiablo III.\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III%20Bestiary\"&gt;Diablo III Bestiary&lt;/a&gt;\"\nMonsters appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", much the same as in Diablo II. However, they may attack towns in &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt; as per key events in the storyline.\nIn the middle top of the screen, the player will see the monster's name and its\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0bar. The color of the monster name has the following meaning:\nIn addition to the three major types, one may also encounter &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; enemies, as well as &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; and some minor types, often unique to a specific quest-related enemy. It is the first game in which players may fight &lt;a href=\"angels\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt;, some of them corrupted, and some insane.\nDiablo IV.\nMonsters appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". The game employs a concept called \"monster families,\" which groups the game's enemies into \"disparate, yet thematically linked creatures.\" Each of these families are further divided into archetypes. The appearance of monsters shifts in accordance with their environment.\nVarious zones in the world have \"monster levels\" associated with them. Monster level scales with player level, however, there are situations where the monster level is higher (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Helltide\"&gt;Helltide&lt;/a&gt; events).\nPlayers can gain extra &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; by killing monsters through the proximity of others. If one kills a monster in the presence of another player, the slayer gains a 5% experience bonus. If in the presence of a party member, a 10% bonus applies. Monster intensity remains constant up to difficulty, at which point it starts to increase. The \"intensity\" refers to traits such as monster damage, becoming more reliable with each Torment level.\nMonsters appear to have monikers associated with them, corresponding to variants (\"snowy,\" \"nightmare\", etc.)."}

Most crucially is the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; of the game you are playing in. Another factor is their HP total; the regeneration is a percent of their \"maximum\" life - in other words, the more life a monster possesses, the more it heals each second.\nDiablo/Hellfire.\nMonster Heal is something not many players may know about in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\". The only ways to really notice that such a thing exists is through one of &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin's&lt;/a&gt; randomized gossip lines, or extensive use of . And even then, it is generally not too big of a hindrance (or an aid, in Golem's case), because within the time such regeneration would be useful, the monster is simply overwhelmed by the player's damage.\nUnfortunately, for those few who do not have enough of an edge, Prevents Monster Heal is \"not\" available in the first game, even with \"\" installed. Equip your hero with that in mind.\nDiablo II/Lord of Destruction.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", Monster Heal is much more of a boon to the minions of Hell (or to you, if it's your &lt;a href=\"Hireling\"&gt;Hireling&lt;/a&gt; or Summons), because while they did \"not\" regenerate while the hero was in town in the original Diablo, they \"will\" in Diablo II as well as the expansion. Another factor to that regeneration is the actual monster type; that is to say, a &lt;a href=\"Minion%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Minion of Destruction&lt;/a&gt; in Difficulty may regenerate faster than a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Scarab\"&gt;Steel Scarab&lt;/a&gt; in Difficulty.\nThere are a couple ways to counter monster regeneration, however. Unlike the original Diablo, \"Prevents Monster Heal\" does exist, in an easily obtainable &lt;a href=\"Vileness\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt; for both &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapons\"&gt;Melee Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, the regeneration can be counteracted with the damage over time effects of &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; or the even better &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt; that does bleeding damage over 8 seconds and scales with your hero's level, usually inflicting more than enough to prevent the monsters' regeneration.\nList.\nThe following is a list of all items with \"Prevent Monster Heal\":\nDiablo III.\nAlthough Monster Heal is no longer around in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", before a patch, if the &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; fell in battle against a Rare, Champion or Unique, that monster group could heal itself to full. This frustrated too many players however, resulting in Monster Heal being removed. \nThe only other way a monster can heal is the &lt;a href=\"Vampiric\"&gt;Vampiric&lt;/a&gt; affix, and even that affix can only happen on legacy Elites. \nBosses will heal to full if they defeat players though, forcing them to begin the fight from scratch.\nInnate monster abilities may allow them to renew in battle: &lt;a href=\"Morlu\"&gt;Morlu&lt;/a&gt; (of either type) may partially heal if they are brought near death (into their ash state), but not killed quickly afterwards."}

{"id": "18848", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18848", "title": "Monster Traits (Diablo III)", "text": "Monster Traits in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" are special abilities added to &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Monsters\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Monsters\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Minion\"&gt;Minion&lt;/a&gt; monsters. These traits appear beneath the name of the monster. They are sometimes called \"monster affixes\" because of their similarity to &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt;es of &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, in using key words to denote additional powers.\nThe number of traits depends on your hero's level:\nSome traits have additional level requirements: for example, monsters cannot roll Arcane Enchanted until level 31.\nIn Champion packs, all monsters have the same skills and can use them independently. In Rare packs, some skills can be used by both the Rare and its minions, while others apply only to the leader.\nNote that a monster having a natural skill similar to an affix can still have that skill as a result of being an elite pack. For example, naturally fast creatures can roll Fast, while creatures naturally capable of becoming immune to damage can still roll Shielded.\nMonster Traits.\nArcane Enchanted.\nMonsters imbued with the \"Arcane Enchanted\" trait can summon glowing orbs of arcane energy that fully form after a few seconds. Once activated, these transform into rotating beams called Arcane Sentries, which deal significant &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; damage per tick, spinning either clockwise or counter-clockwise. If the monster who summoned the Arcane Sentry is killed before the beam forms, the orb vanishes. However, once the Sentry begins spinning, it will complete its rotation.\nOne quirk of the Arcane Sentry is that Arcane Sentries can pass underneath stairs, and will \"not\" cause damage to a hero standing on a higher stair.\nThis affix is extremely dangerous when combined with Vortex, or just in an environment with little place for maneuvering. Kite monsters with this affix often to leave the dangerous laser-swept area behind.\nAvenger.\nThe death of each Champion in the group imbues the remaining Champions with greater strength and speed. The safest way to deal with this affix is to \"not\" kill any member until they are all barely away from death. Empowered monsters are easily identified by increased size, growing after each death of their group members.\nDesecrator.\nMonsters with the Desecrator trait can conjure a deadly pool of void energy directly underneath the Player Character. Rare Minions cannot summon voids. These pools deal very little damage at first, but their damage constantly increases: the damage doubles every 0.5 seconds you remain in that pool, up to ten stacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Electrified&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis trait is identical to the Diablo II &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Lightning Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; affix. Electrified monsters, when hit by a damaging attack, release a volley of sparks that fly in all directions; the sparks count as &lt;a href=\"missiles\"&gt;missiles&lt;/a&gt;. These sparks deal slight &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20damage\"&gt;Lightning damage&lt;/a&gt;, but can easily overwhelm a hero in proximity.\nThe number of sparks released per hit grows as the monster loses &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;. As of Patch 2.1.1, there is a 0.1 second internal cooldown on spark generation, which protects players from overdose of sparks when using &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; (see the image to the right).\nAs of patch 2.4.3, crawling lightning generated by this affix now &lt;a href=\"Piercing\"&gt;pierces&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to damage multiple targets.\n&lt;a href=\"Extra%20Fast\"&gt;Fast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fast trait increases movement speed by 40%, attack speed by 20%, and casting speed by 10%. Fast creatures excel at chasing down wounded heroes and use their increased speed to quickly move around the battlefield.\nFire Chains.\nThis trait periodically connects Champion monsters with Flaming Chains (similar to the Demon Hunter's &lt;a href=\"Sentry\"&gt;Chains of Torment&lt;/a&gt;) that deal significant &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; on contact. \nThe AI of monsters that roll Fire Chains is altered to try and surround the player at all costs, even if they are ranged attackers. Killing individual monsters in the group will reduce the length and mobility of the chains. The affix is disabled when only one monster remains.\n&lt;a href=\"Cold%20Enchanted\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrozen-imbued monsters create 6 frozen bombs around the player that explode after 4 seconds. Until they explode, the crystals deal periodic &lt;a href=\"Cold%20damage\"&gt;Cold damage&lt;/a&gt; to anything within the explosion range (visible on the ground). The final explosion also deals heavy Cold damage and &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt;s heroes caught in their blast radius. With no &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, the freeze duration for heroes is 3 seconds.\nFrozen Pulse.\nMonsters with Frozen Pulse as a trait unleash a crystalline globe of ice that will home in on a player. Once it reaches the targeted player's location, it will stop and start to continuously expel ice, dealing heavy Cold damage and &lt;a href=\"Chill\"&gt;Chill&lt;/a&gt;ing on a successful hit. There is a delay between the pulse reaching its final spot and its first pulse, so it is possible for a hero to wait for it to arrive then move at the last moment. Running away from it before it arrives simply causes it to continue the chase; it only stops when it reaches its target or the original monster is killed.\nHealth Link.\nThis trait can only roll for Champions, and only has an effect when two or more pack members are present. It will split damage dealt to one Champion among all nearby Champions. Pack members isolated from other members will not share damage. At 5% Life left, monsters can still share their own damage with others, but will stop taking shared damage from others.\nThis affix can actually be beneficial to heroes with single target skills, since they can focus their attacks on one monster and damage the entire pack. Moreover, \"on (critical) hit\" effects will have a separate chance to trigger for each enemy linked by the Health Link, as technically each of them receives damage from that hit.\nHorde.\nThe Horde trait is only available to Rare monsters, increasing (usually doubling) the number of Minions they summon. The Horde affix is extremely dangerous when combined with affixes like Arcane Enchanted or Frozen, as monsters can cover the entire battlefield with deadly traps in one cast, leaving little or no space to fight. A combination of Horde, Arcane Enchanted, Plagued, and Molten would be a terrible combination: erratic enemy A.I, highly damaging ground effects, and able to dominate even a wide open area rather quickly.\nThis trait can be exploited by AoE skills that heal the hero over time. For example, a Barbarian using &lt;a href=\"Rend\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; with the Blood Lust rune and a high Life total could increase survivability substantially by hitting each target with a Rend. (This is not as effective as for Illusionists.)\nIllusionist.\nMonsters with the Illusionist trait can create clones of themselves when damaged. These duplicates deal normal damage, but have only 5% of normal health. The illusions also do not benefit from most other skills, like Fire Chains and Health Link. Destroying an illusion counts as a killing blow for the purpose of Life per Kill and other similar effects, but does \"not\" award experience or loot. Killing the 'original' monster immediately destroys all remaining illusions.\nWhile the Life of illusions is greatly reduced, the effect of hero affixes that restore a hero's Life remain undiminished.\nJailer.\nThe Jailer trait enables monsters to &lt;a href=\"Immobilize\"&gt;trap a target in place&lt;/a&gt;, dealing low damage at lower levels and scales to average damage in higher difficulties, and preventing any form of movement for 1.5\u20132.5 seconds. Some rapid relocation skills (like ) will break the trap. There is a small cooldown between monsters from the same pack using this skill. When cast, it traps \"all\" enemies within 60 yards, including NPCs, followers, and minions.\nJuggernaut.\nJuggernaut monsters are immune to &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;; as a result, they are also immune to any debuff that triggers on successful Crowd Control (such as &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20the%20Trapped\"&gt;Bane of the Trapped&lt;/a&gt;). To compensate, they have reduced movement speed, and take 30% increased damage from all attacks.\nThis affix was added in patch 2.4.3.\n&lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnockback grants the imbued monster the chance to send a target flying backwards with each attack that lands, applying an 80% &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt; effect for 3 seconds. There is no extra damage. This applies both to usual attacks and to other special affixes that deal non-periodic damage. This affix can sometimes backfire on the monster, sending the player outside the range of the monster's own attacks, or moving them away from areas contaminated with dangerous affix objects.\nMissile Dampening.\nThis trait is shown by a blue dome around the imbued monster. &lt;a href=\"Missiles\"&gt;Projectile&lt;/a&gt; attacks that enter this sphere have their speed decreased by 90%, making ranged attacks less effective. Missile Dampening does not reduce the damage done by projectiles, and has no effect at all on beams, torrents, and non-missile ranged attacks. The effect is very similar to the 's &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; spell (and to &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Missiles\"&gt;Slow Missiles&lt;/a&gt;), but affects missiles only and is permanently active.\nWhile this usually helps the monster against ranged attackers, it can backfire for certain skills. For example, a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Arrow\"&gt;Elemental Arrow&lt;/a&gt; with the Ball Lightning rune will benefit. The slow-moving Ball Lightning damages nearby monsters as it moves across the battlefield, and has no limit to how many times it can hit one monster, so its slow movement can actually do much more damage than normal\u2014albeit on a delay.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Enchanted\"&gt;Molten&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonsters imbued with the Molten trait leave harmful pools of lava behind while they move, dealing high Fire damage over 4 seconds. 3 seconds after they die, their bodies explode into extremely high-damaging gouts of fire that can kill an adequately-geared player in one hit (unlike Frozen, the flames do not do damage until the explosion). Their AI is altered to move more erratically and closer to the player. Multiple lava trails in the same area stack, increasing damage proportionally.\nThe final explosion effect was changed to do Physical rather than Fire damage when inside an &lt;a href=\"Echoing%20Nightmare\"&gt;Echoing Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; to prevent players from bypassing the danger with Fire Immunity effects such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Star%20of%20Azkaranth\"&gt;The Star of Azkaranth&lt;/a&gt;.\nMortar.\nMonsters imbued with the Mortar trait fire three Grenades at the player every 4\u20135 seconds. The mortar does Fire damage. These attacks have a minimum range, so moving closer reduces the chance of being hit; the grenades show their impact zone roughly 0.5-1 second before they hit.\nMortar grenades are \"not\" &lt;a href=\"missiles\"&gt;missiles&lt;/a&gt;, and can be launched over walls and other obstacles.\nIn the original version of the game, this was one of the most feared affixes, as the damage from even a single grenade was almost invariably fatal; while this is often still the case in high-difficulty Greater Rifts, the damage has been greatly reduced over time.\nNightmarish.\nMonsters imbued with the Nightmarish trait have a chance to send a hero running in &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; on successful attacks. The fearing lasts 3 seconds for a hero with no resistance to &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;control impairing&lt;/a&gt; effects.\nOrbiter.\nMonsters with the Orbiter trait will occasionally call up a Lightning Globe. This globe will cause smaller, slowly moving lightning globes that do low damage, but tick very fast. The main globe itself deals more damage. Each monster can only summon one Globe at a time, and that globe will remain immobile.\nPlagued.\nMonsters imbued with the Plague trait occasionally summon green toxin pools on the ground that deal &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt; to players standing in them. The pools disappear immediately when the monster that spawned the pool is killed, and can disappear on their own after a long time. Damage is very small at first, but constantly increases (effectively doubles every 0.5 seconds, to a limit of ten stacks) if you stay within them, quickly becoming lethal.\nPoison Enchanted.\nMonsters with Poison Enchanted as a trait will each periodically summon a group of acidic slimes. These slimes will spread out after 3 seconds, leaving poison in the shape of an X in their wake. Players foolish enough to stand on the poison trails receive fast ticks of damage. Each trail lasts 6 seconds. Monsters in the same pack have a shared cooldown on this ability, and each can only summon one slime cross per cast.\nReflects Damage.\nMonsters imbued with the Reflects Damage trait return damage dealt to them back to the player in form of &lt;a href=\"projectiles\"&gt;projectiles&lt;/a&gt; (only one monster in a pack can reflect at a time).\nDamage done is not prevented, but rather duplicated as a ranged attack aimed at the attacker. The exact amount equals basic damage of the attack, before &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDamage is only reflected while their aura is active (it turns on and off over time, but you'll be able to tell that it's active if you keep an eye on them). The amount reflected does not depend on the type of the attack, but damage from &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; and followers is not reflected to the player. There is a small internal cooldown on how often it can deal damage to attackers. Returned damage shares the same &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; type as the attack that caused it, but &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt; do work against it.\nBeing &lt;a href=\"Hex%20%28Mechanics%29\"&gt;Hexed&lt;/a&gt; suppresses this affix.\nAs of patch 2.4.3, this affix was redesigned: instead of reflecting damage at once, it releases &lt;a href=\"projectiles\"&gt;projectiles&lt;/a&gt; in the general direction of the attacker, which can usually be evaded. The warning duration for this affix was reduced from 2 seconds to 1, and its active duration was reduced from 6 seconds to 4. \nShielding.\nMonsters imbued with the Shielding trait can make themselves immune to all forms of damage and status effects for 5 seconds.\nAs of a recent patch, only one member of a pack that rolls Shielding can be Shielded at a time. The last member of a pack cannot become Shielded, and, as of patch 2.4.3, will immediately lose its Shield if no other pack members remain.\n&lt;a href=\"Teleportation\"&gt;Teleporter&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonsters imbued with the Teleporter trait can teleport around the field at will. Generally, they will teleport away from a player when too close, and towards a player when too far.\nThunderstorm.\nMonsters with the Thunderstorm trait will periodically call in a thunderstorm. This will strike the targeted player several times in rapid succession, making it almost impossible to avoid light to moderate Lightning damage. The lightning can follow the player, but is rather slow, so it is possible to escape the area of effect after a few hits.\nAvailable to: All but a Rare's Minions\nDamage Type: Lightning\nVortex.\nMonsters with the Vortex trait can occasionally pull the player to their position. Vortex cannot pull you through walls, obstacles, or impassable terrain (you will stop right next to the intervening object), but can pull you through allies and other enemies. It also causes a small, but unavoidable, amount of Physical damage.\nWaller.\nMonsters that have the Waller trait can erect impenetrable barriers for a short period of time. Summoned walls vanish after 6 seconds. The walls block most (but not all) ranged attacks. The walls block both players' and monsters' movement (and their missiles), so this affix can backfire on monsters.\nChampion monsters summon one section of the wall each, placing them independently, trying to trap you in a triangle-shaped prison. Rare monsters only have this power on the leader, who summons 3 walls at once, placing a U-shaped trap (with opened end on the monster's side, player being on the closed one).\nWaller is more of a threat to ranged heroes like Demon Hunters, than melee classes like Barbarians. The reason for this is that while a Barbarian can just swing through the wall and be able to hit his/her target, the Demon Hunter's projectiles cannot pierce through the wall. This is not to say that Waller is worthless against a melee hero, however; positioned right, retreat is much more difficult. The Reaper of Souls expansion offers multiple ways to overcome Waller: \nBug: at very rare occasions, it is possible for a hero to be literally stuck in the wall. This happens if the monster places the wall atop of the player due to pathing error. While stuck, said player won't be able to move until the wall fades. It usually happens when the player is facing Champion monsters, not Rare.\nAs of patch 2.3.0, individual Champion Waller barriers cannot be placed within 3 yards of each other.\nWormhole.\nMonsters with Wormhole as a trait will occasionally raise two glowing columns of Arcane energy. Should a player step into one of these columns, he/she will suffer a small amount of Arcane damage and appear on the location occupied by the other column. Typically one Wormhole is placed under the player's feet, and the other as close to the caster as possible. There is a delay before one cast on a player activates. After a single teleportation, the Wormhole dissipates.\nWormhole can backfire on a monster, as the columns do not move; it is possible for it to be initially disadvantageous for the player, but ultimately advantageous to step into one.\nSpecial Affixes.\nSome Unique Monsters, &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s may have abilities going beyond the simple affixes, such as:\nThese affixes are not displayed, but players will still find them out empirically (that is, by suffering damage from them). For &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; characters, it is especially risky, therefore one should check the monster's abilities before engaging.\nObsolete affixes.\nExtra Health.\nAs the name implies, this trait simply gave the monster additional Life, usually +40%. As of patch 2.1.2, it no longer rolls; only Unique monsters retain it as legacy.\nInvulnerable Minions.\nThis trait, which only applied to Rare monsters, granted their minions Invincibility. Note that Invincible minions were only immune to damage; &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Status Effects&lt;/a&gt; could still work on them. When the Rare monster was killed, the minions would have automatically died.\n&lt;a href=\"Life%20Steal\"&gt;Vampiric&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonsters imbued with the Vampiric trait used to recover a small portion (roughly 20%) of all unmitigated damage they dealt as Life. This trait was relatively \"no threat\" whatsoever in endgame content. The reason for this is because the life leeched was simply too low. Even an \"unprotected\" hero unfortunate enough to be hit by a monster with this would generally heal the monster for very little compared to the hits it would have received attempting to do so. In patch 2.1.2, it was removed altogether, only some Unique monsters keeping it as a legacy trait."}

This includes &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse%23Blood_moon\"&gt;Blood moons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_moon\"&gt;Blue moons&lt;/a&gt;. The nights preceding the full moon are sometimes far more dangerous than the event itself.\nThe moon's light is said to be &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al; the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt; utilizes a form of ancient magic that is enhanced by the moon and stars. Drawing power from the moon can grant one the power to obscure or transform or control, depending on its phase.\nSharval Mythology.\nThe moon, most particularly its lunar phases, played a key role in the beliefs of the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Circles\"&gt;Witch Circles&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sharval%20Wilds\"&gt;Sharval Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. They believed that the moon gave equal favor to all who sought it, renewing its strength as it turned its face (went through lunar phases). Their beliefs held that the moon was at its weakest when it \"hid its face\" (a new moon), but always renewed itself. They believed that the moon was like a child, that it hid its face at times, showed it clearly during others. They believed none of the moon's faces were weak, only waiting. They could draw on the power of the moon for their wards, but to draw upon the moon overmuch was to overwhelm it. As such, all the circles knew to exercise caution when drawing on the moon's power. They believed that the moon's interests changed, and as such, the power they drew from it shifted in kind.\nOther Mythologies.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Shen\"&gt;Covetous Shen&lt;/a&gt;, Sanctuary originally had two moons. &lt;a href=\"Liria\"&gt;Liria&lt;/a&gt; was the personification of the second moon. \nThe moon plays a role in &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"divination\"&gt;divination&lt;/a&gt; practices. Under the stars and new moon, devotees often see new patterns in the night sky, hinting at things yet to come.\nThe blood moon persists as a sign of woe for the most superstitious &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faithful. Children born under it are often considered cursed and cast out, lest it spread.\n&lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Awakening\"&gt;Lunar Awakening&lt;/a&gt; is apparently tied to the moon."}

Once used as footsoldiers in the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, they have also been sighted in recent times.\nLore.\nMorlu are ram-masked and revel in bloodshed, their bloodthirstiness rivaling that of demons. They possess the ability to communicate through verbal speech and have a sense of smell capable of detecting blood.\nThe morlu under Mephisto were difficult to slay, due to the fact that they were &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;animated&lt;/a&gt; warriors. Slain morlu continued to rise, even when pierced by arrows or other weaponry. However, once their heads were removed, the morlu's 'life-force' started to wane (decapitated morlu still remained animated for a short time in which they had to recover their heads, lest they collapse). Also, undead banishing spells have a devastating effect. When the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; unleashed his &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; against the morlu, they were drained of their 'life force,' preventing further resurrection.\nHistory.\nThe original Morlu were once &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. All great men, but all with darkness within their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; used this flaw to trick them into his service, turning them into the Morlu. The term \"morlu\" was coined by &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt;, a \"word of power\" that harkened to the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of Mephisto. They formed a special reserve of heavy infantry in the service of Lucion and the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;. When not called upon, they resided in an underground cave hidden beneath the main Temple of the Triune, constantly battling one another. Each morlu fought for itself\u2014one might fight with another for a time, but inevitably, the two would turn on each other eventually. They used &lt;a href=\"Living%20Flame\"&gt;Living Flame&lt;/a&gt; against one another to test their resolve. However, when given an assignment by Lucion, they could work together cohesively. Additionally, some morlu disguised as &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Warder\"&gt;Peace Warder&lt;/a&gt;s were used within the temple itself.\nWhenever a morlu fell in battle, it was resurrected by a demonic artifact known only as the &lt;a href=\"Kiss%20of%20Mephisto\"&gt;Kiss of Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;. Every morlu in Mephisto's service had died at least a dozen times, thus making them experienced and battle-hardened brutes.\nThe morlu came into contact with the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; followers during the Sin War. They were defeated however.\nThousands of years later, morlu in the service of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; were seen in his &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. These Morlu were seen as both warriors and &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; users. When defeated, they momentarily became frozen as a statue of ash and soot. If not destroyed while in this state, they would regenerate and fight anew.\nIn-game.\nMorlu appear in &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". They are divided into &lt;a href=\"Morlu%20Caster\"&gt;casters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morlu%20Berserker\"&gt;berserkers&lt;/a&gt;, which focus on spellcasting and damage dealing respectively. They are classified as demons rather than undead for gameplay purposes.\nTheir most unique ability is that upon reaching 5% &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, they turn into immobile statues of ash, and remove all &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Over%20Time\"&gt;Damage Over Time&lt;/a&gt; effects. Unless killed in 10 seconds after that, they will be healed to 1-100% of maximum health."}

Tired of the oppression and hypocrisy of the &lt;a href=\"Inari\"&gt;Inari&lt;/a&gt;, she stole the &lt;a href=\"Pathstone\"&gt;Pathstone&lt;/a&gt; and fled from the Cradle with her followers amongst the Lilin. The heist was carried out in a single night.\nHer group were pursued by an army of Inari, who wanted to retrieve the relic. A great naval battle was fought over the Pathstone, with Morwith's group eventually falling under a hail of arrows. The battle was ended by &lt;a href=\"Haffegul\"&gt;a deepstrider&lt;/a&gt;, who decimated the survivors of both sides. Injured, Morwith was washed ashore a desolate island. In madness born from grief or obsession, Morwith used the Pathstone to cloud the sea and resurrect her tribesmen as &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;waterlogged undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince then, she and her band of &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Reaver\"&gt;Dread Reaver&lt;/a&gt;s terrorized the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Sea\"&gt;Forgotten Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrail of Terror.\nAs &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; pursued the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered that the cult sought to purify the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; shard of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;'s taint before delivering it to &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;.

Pools of stagnant water gather after the frequent rain storms, providing excellent spots for the adults of these species to lay their eggs. Some of the mosquitoes found here are enormous, with wingspans as large as four feet. Luckily, the larger species are also much more rarely encountered than their smaller cousins.\nGiant mosquitoes, referred to locally as \"suckers,\" are known disease carriers. Their large size makes them appropriate targets for hand or missile weapons. These insects can quickly drain the blood from a victim, causing a quick loss of stamina, making escape extremely difficult. By themselves, Suckers are not usually deadly. However, if other threats lurk nearby, Suckers will drain a victim's stamina while other creatures move in for the kill.\nSuckers' hunger for mammal blood is well known throughout the villages of Kehjistan Jungle as they tend to suck the blood out of unwary or wounded creatures the point of total withering. Despite their voracious reputation these over-sized mosquito demons are only lethal when encountered in large numbers and are normally easy to hit even with ranged weapons. A vivid and well armored hero suffers usually only &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; loss and becomes slightly fatigued if the Sucker has a chance to sting."}

Once the beloved site of the s, it is now a smoldering &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nPrior to its destruction, Arreat featured open expanses of land, snow-covered tundras, and an extensive network of ice caves. Twenty years after its destruction, it now resembles a volcanic wasteland.\nHistory.\nPre-Destruction.\nMount Arreat was created by &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, shaping the mountain as a protective shell around the Worldstone. It was the first landform created on Sanctuary.\nThe Barbarians held that they were all tasked with defending Mount Arreat until &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, at which point they were free to pass on. However, some bound their spirits to the mountain, so that they could serve the mountain well after their physical forms had perished. To give one's existence to defend the mountain was considered the most honored of all sacrifices in Barbarian culture.\nThe Barbarians buried their warriors upon the slopes of Arreat, and believed that those who were denied this would be doomed to have their spirits roam the land for eternity. \nThe Barbarian tribes were aware that a day would come when they would have to protect the mountain from the armies of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. That is why they built extensive walls and fortifications throughout all larger open areas on the mountain. When Baal's armies arrived, however, these fortifications were overtaken by the demons and used to their advantage.\nThree ghostly warriors, known as the &lt;a href=\"Ancients\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, also stood at the mountain's &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Summit\"&gt;summit&lt;/a&gt; and protected the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20Keep\"&gt;Worldstone Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Their names were &lt;a href=\"Korlic\"&gt;Korlic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madawc\"&gt;Madawc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Talic\"&gt;Talic&lt;/a&gt;. The three warriors were summoned to Mount Arreat in order to protect it, honored to guard the Worldstone for all eternity.\nDestruction and Aftermath.\nWhen he came for the Worldstone, &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; was able to bypass them due to possessing the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Relic of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, while the heroes in pursuit of him were forced to fight through him. They succeeded in defeating Baal, but not before he corrupted the Worldstone, forcing the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; to destroy it. He succeeded, but the resulting explosion sent half of Arreat's bulk exploding outward, devastating the surrounding &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;lands&lt;/a&gt;. Stone and ash rained from the sky for days, turning the waters around it as red as blood, and ravines formed as Arreat collapsed. The explosion was so loud that it was even heard in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. The destruction of the mountain spurred bordering nations to close their gates, strengthen their walls, and let the world grow savage in their wake.\n&lt;a href=\"Veradani\"&gt;Veradani&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Sky%20Monastery\"&gt;Floating Sky Monastery&lt;/a&gt; collected shards of Arreat after its sundering and prayed over them. A &lt;a href=\"Bell%20of%20Sorrow\"&gt;horned helm&lt;/a&gt; was created from the shards after three months of consecration. The &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aglainn\"&gt;Aglainn&lt;/a&gt; journeyed into the Dreadlands to chronicle the aftermath of the disaster.\n20 years after the mountain's destruction, the forces of &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; poured out of the mountain's crater using it as his base operation as a staging point to &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt; to the south. However, they were driven back to the crater and defeated.\nKnown Locations.\nThe following areas were located on the mountain prior to its destruction. Post-destruction, it is doubtful whether some, if any of these locations still exist."}

They are used as a means of transportation for traversing across long distances in the open world to quicker reach one's targets. The mount's speed is variable depending on cursor distance, and three charges that make the horse sprint for a short distance. Dismounting puts it on a 10 second-cooldown.\nWhile mounted, the character's aggro range is greatly decreased, meaning that &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s will not attack on sight, only if the player approaches them. While mounted, a \"fear gauge\" is displayed on the horseriding's UI; monster attacks will fill the gauge, and if completed, the player is forced to dismount. If this happens, the mount is then put on a 30-second cooldown. \nMounts can be customized via their &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, saddle, and can have trophies dangling from them (said trophies including severed heads). Mount trophies can be attached to the saddle or the mount's flank. Different types of mounts exist, including &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic horses, flayed horses, and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; horses. Mounts can be obtained in a variety of ways, such as by completing puzzles, finding hidden locations, slaying certain monsters, or completing certain &lt;a href=\"quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;. Once a mount and customizations are unlocked, they can be used in all game modes for any and all characters that the player creates. All horse variations, as well as armor, and trophy customization, are aesthetic only, and do not change the way that players play in any way.\nAll character &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; have special dismounting attacks that allow them to perform a special offensive action the very moment they leap off their mounts. Players can collect &lt;a href=\"herbs\"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ores\"&gt;ores&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; while mounted.\nDevelopment.\nThe developers decided against jousting or fighting from horseback, as it did not feel true to the series. Furthermore, the mount's speed across terrain was supposed to be altered by collecting different types of horseshoes, and hoof plates."}

Performing attacks or casting spells prevents stamina regeneration. Walking does not drain Stamina, and allows recovering it slowly. Standing idle allows regenerating Stamina very quickly. Running makes attacks against the character ignore hit formula, and decreases &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; chance by 2/3. Thus, it's not always recommended to run, at least for melee builds or characters looking to take advantage of high armor. On the other hand, speedrunning characters would always prefer to run, even if they're melee characters; they would even avoid using shields to prevent triggering the blocking animation, and use lots of &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potions\"&gt;healing potions&lt;/a&gt; to recover from the damage taken.\nMechanics.\nDefault walking speed is 6 y/s, while running increases a player's speed by 3 y/s. Effects such as chill and Vigor affect walking speed, then the running bonus of 3 y/s is applied. The limit on reduced speed for Run/Walk is 1.5 y/s (25% of walk speed). However, there is no lower limit on Charge, meaning a character can charge in reverse if they are slowed below 0 y/s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, defaults to 22.5 y/s, but is not influenced by items that change Run/Walk speed. It is influenced by other Run/Walk speed modifiers, such as Vigor and chill. \nWhen running, the Total Blocking percentage is reduced to 1/3rd of its original value, with a cap of 25%.\nFaster Run/Walk.\nThough the speed at which the character runs does not depend on the Character Attributes, it can be modified by many factors. Certain &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;magical items&lt;/a&gt;, mostly &lt;a href=\"Boots\"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt;, have &lt;a href=\"Affix\"&gt;magical attributes&lt;/a&gt; that increase Running Speed.\nItems that provide a faster Run/Walk bonus come with diminishing returns, meaning that the higher it gets, the less of an increase a character is gaining. The formula for this is (150*FRW)/(150+FRW).\nSkills, armor type, chill, and slow modify your base speed (6 y/s) and provide their full listed effects without diminishing returns.\nSkills that affect movement speed include:\nArmor Types.\n&lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt; come in three weight Types: Light, Medium, and Heavy. See individual item pages to see the type; &lt;a href=\"Exceptional%20Items\"&gt;Exceptional&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Items\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; equivalents have same types.\nRunning Monsters.\nSome monsters like the &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt; also run. The &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Rogue\"&gt;Corrupted Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s also run to close the distance between them and the player characters.\nDiablo III.\nIn Diablo III, movement speed is measured as a percentage, with 100% (initial normal speed) being roughly 6 yards per second (much like average real-life running speed), for both heroes and most monsters. Characters no longer have Stamina, cannot walk (always run), and movement speed penalties for gear are gone. Movement speed may not be brought below 20% by negative effects (remember that monsters build up &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; resistance to it while &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt;ed down).\nOne may gain a permanent speed increase from items, skills and from &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; levels. Paragon points award 0.5% speed each (up to 25% total), and &lt;a href=\"Boots\"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt; may roll up to +12% speed. Some &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Items&lt;/a&gt; may roll movement speed as well, but normally only boots do so. Generally, players prefer to gain speed by investing Paragon points, to avoid wasting affixes (as 50 points in Paragon stats award lesser amounts of attributes than an affix on a legendary or set item, even for classic players at the level cap of 60).\nThe permanent speed bonus is limited to +25%, which allows putting 50 Paragon points into the Core section and therefore freeing item affixes for more valuable stats. One of the few ways to gain a permanent speed over 25% is the &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; passive skill &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Footed\"&gt;Fleet Footed&lt;/a&gt;.\nTemporary speed bonuses have no cap: skills, &lt;a href=\"Shrines\"&gt;Shrines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pylons\"&gt;Pylons&lt;/a&gt;, special gear affixes etc. may add speed, stacking without diminishing returns.\nThe easiest way to get a temporary speed bonus is by quickly destroying a bunch of objects like barrels/tables/etc which will impart enhanced running speed for several seconds."}

Taking umbrage, her rivals gathered to challenge her outrageous boast, arranging a contest to decide the question. To preserve her honor, Palashia was to strike the targets of all her rivals before they could land a single arrow. When dawn arose on the day of the contest, Palashia stood ready with her bow. At the signal, her rivals nocked their arrows and loosed a volley towards their targets. Palashia gathered her energies, and let fly with her own, single arrow. To the amazement of onlookers, her arrow split into many, cleaving the arrows of her rivals, and moving on to strike every target directly in their centers. This mysterious technique quickly became a martial secret that only the finest archers are able to master. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nMultiple Shot is a skill which as its name states allows the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; to fire off more than one arrow. While being a good skill for damage over a large area, it only deals 3/4ths of normal attack damage (this includes elemental damage) and only 1 arrow may hit each enemy, making it a bad choice for attacking single, tough opponents. The penalty still applies to versions below 1.10, but it does not say on the skill, and is visible on the character stats menu when Multiple Shot is selected.\nAlthough v2.6 claims that it \"Fixed the tooltip for\u00a0 Multiple Shot to reflect the synergy bonus\", as of v2.7 it's in fact still wrong. The actual formula used for calculation is dam*3/4*(100%+bonuses), including the synergy bonus like it would +X % damage from an offhand mod or Dex. This can be verified by looking directly at the dam in the char stats; with e.g. 3 lvl Guided Arrow, the damage is shown as \"111% Weapon Damage\", but can be observed as lower than base damage from a normal attack still - similarly, even with e.g. 11 lvl Guided Arrow and some Dexterity, the damage will still be lower than 2x the base. \nThe player can control the spread angle of the volley using the distance between the point clicked and the character herself \u2014 clicking far away from the character results in a narrower, more focused volley, while clicking close to the character results in a much wider spread.\nAside from actual arrow damage, &lt;a href=\"Life%20Steal\"&gt;leeching&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Strike\"&gt;Deadly Strike&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt; works with every arrow, but everything else (procs, &lt;a href=\"crushing%20blow\"&gt;crushing blow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;, et cetera) only triggers from the center two arrows.\nEach extra skill point in this skill increases the number of arrows fired by 1, but also increases the mana cost by 1 as well. When the skill level is fairly high already, one may find that increasing the volley by one arrow makes little to no difference, and after level 23 there isn't any increase (the skill is hard-capped to fire at most 24 arrows). Points placed after level 23 only increase the mana cost with no advantage whatsoever (not counting synergies to other skills)."}

As a reverence to the deceased, priests fill bodies with preservative fluids, then wrap them in specially-treated cloth, and bury them in tombs below the desert's surface. This mummification is believed to provide benefits for the deceased in the afterlife. Physically, a mummified body maintains its flesh and sinew for hundreds, even thousands of years.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s manipulation, these honored dead were summoned and bound with the spirits of malicious &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to fill the ranks of his undead army. Instilled with eternal loathing for the living, Mummies are stronger and better suited for combat than &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, who due to their advanced decay, are weak and infirm. Mummies are slow-moving, but can deliver powerful blows, often with the touch of poison from the chemicals used in their embalming. Fallen mummies often burst asunder from their wrappings, leaving behind a poisonous cloud that the living should best avoid.\nIn-game.\nWhen killed, Mummies emit a &lt;a href=\"poison%20cloud\"&gt;poison cloud&lt;/a&gt; that can affect both you and your minions. If you are particularly weak against &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, you may want to consider carrying &lt;a href=\"Antidote%20Potion\"&gt;Antidote Potion&lt;/a&gt;s with you when engaging Mummies. They bear close resemblance to Zombies though move slightly faster and can stand more punishment.\nMummies have a 10% chance to deal Poison damage on striking with their left arm in &lt;a href=\"Normal%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt;. On &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; they have a 25/25/30/30/35% chance respectively. \nOn &lt;a href=\"Hell%20difficulty\"&gt;Hell difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, all variants of mummies are immune to Poison.\nThe different types of mummies are &lt;a href=\"Dried%20Corpse\"&gt;Dried Corpse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Decayed\"&gt;Decayed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Embalmed\"&gt;Embalmed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Preserved%20Dead\"&gt;Preserved Dead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cadaver\"&gt;Cadaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nMummies can spawn from a &lt;a href=\"Mummy%20Sarcophagus\"&gt;Mummy Sarcophagus&lt;/a&gt;.

The correct order is as follows:\nAlternatively, a player can free Na-Krul simply by using a lever."}

Her island of &lt;a href=\"Skartara\"&gt;Skartara&lt;/a&gt; had rarely won, but victors commanded glory, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and station upon &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;the seas&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the repeat contestants from &lt;a href=\"Philios\"&gt;Philios&lt;/a&gt; wore resplendent &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; with symbols of their villages, heavy laden to show their strength. Nadya's armor was lean and unornamented.\nAt the start of the race, Nadya kept pace with her competitors over the leaf-littered floor of the jungle. Suddenly, it began to rain heavily. While the forest floor surged and soil cascaded beneath them, runners wearing the heaviest armor fell, and were trampled by those behind. By then, Nadya was taking the lead. \nFrom her position, Nadya was a mere league from Karcheus. She saw cruel joy in the faces of the other lead runners as they sped away from the injured. They did not even look back as she slowed. The others streamed past Nadya as she helped fallen runners from the mud. She reached Karcheus last, won no gold or titles, and was uncelebrated in her village. Nadya no longer cared, her pride was unwavering.\nLegacy.\nThe victorious racers of Philios carried their triumphs to sea as soldiers, and took up positions of influence above their peers. They spoke boldly of their competition, and argued fruitlessly about which of them had run the most perfect race. Meanwhile, Skartara never acknowledged Nadya's participation, yet this did not shake her confidence. Victory in the eyes of others is longer-lasting than victory alone, but it is hardly eternal.\nIn-game.\nNadya is mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", in the flavor text of \"&lt;a href=\"Windloft%20Perfection\"&gt;Windloft Perfection&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"item%20set\"&gt;item set&lt;/a&gt;."}

To outsiders, it is known as Torajan, the Torajan Jungles, or Toraja. \nLore.\nWild and dangerous, Nahantu lies south of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, and is the southernmost region of &lt;a href=\"Estuar\"&gt;Estuar&lt;/a&gt;. It encompasses immense, verdant, teeming jungles that span most of the southwestern expanse of the continent. Even to nearby Kehjistan, Nahantu is a strange and exotic place, filled with vibrant and dangerous flora and fauna that cannot be found anywhere else on Sanctuary. Roots stretch across entire chasms. Brilliantly-colored birds are found in the deep jungles, who flaunt their radiant plumage.\nWith an average of over 400 inches per year, Nahantu has the largest rainforests in the known world. This huge expanse of jungle feeds the &lt;a href=\"Argentek%20River\"&gt;Argentek River&lt;/a&gt;, which is the longest, widest river in Sanctuary. Hundreds of smaller rivers and tributaries twist and turn their way through the lush tropical forests until they finally unite with the mighty Argentek. Herbalists and alchemists revere the rainforest environment for its ecological diversity. Until around the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, these sages would come from far and wide to study and collect the rare plants and animals that make their homes here. The wet, humid atmosphere of these rainforests is an environment perfect for fly and mosquito larvae. Pools of stagnant water gather after the frequent rain storms, providing excellent spots for the adults of these species to lay their eggs. Because of the use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, some flora and fauna of the jungles grew to massive sizes due to the adverse effects of magical energy. Trees and vines would grow to unusual size, rivers and swamps would appear overnight, and once innocuous creatures would gain dangerous abilities with an appetite to match.\nThe jungle plays a key role in the culture of Nahantu's peoples. They are divided into numerous warring tribes.\nHistory.\nIn antiquity, Nahantu was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Ajaw%20Y%27ishich\"&gt;Ajaw Y'ishich&lt;/a&gt;. During their reign, one of the stars of the phoenix constellation fell to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and from it was forged a blade that heralded an age of despair.\nNahantu's jungles have cultivated many civilizations, many of which have been lost to the annals of time. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Teganze\"&gt;Teganze&lt;/a&gt; region remain the exception, but this is incorrect, as the &lt;a href=\"Tusked%20Lords\"&gt;Tusked Lords&lt;/a&gt; also make their home here. The &lt;a href=\"Opaya\"&gt;Opaya&lt;/a&gt; also inhabit(ed) the jungles. After the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, sightings of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;hellish creatures&lt;/a&gt; were reported from the jungles.\nPrior to the collapse of the Eastern Empire, Nahantu was considered part of Kehjistan. In the 1270s, few people made the trek into Nahantu.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, Kehjistan's borders shrunk to encompass only the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;, meaning Nahantu was no longer under its control. Temples dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; were established/appropriated during this period. The &lt;a href=\"First%20Khazra\"&gt;First Khazra&lt;/a&gt; began abducting &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s who strayed into their territory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; entered Nahantu while carrying &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. His corruption spread from the soulstone, affecting the jungle, and creating &lt;a href=\"the%20Hollows\"&gt;the Hollows&lt;/a&gt;. His corruption began to spread into the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt; itself, striking fear into the hearts of the people who dwelt in Nahantu. Mephisto's hatred spread from Nahantu across &lt;a href=\"Estuar\"&gt;Estuar&lt;/a&gt;, leaving &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s twisted by his influence in Hatred's wake.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nNahantu first appeared in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", though the name was not applied at the time, and was simply referred to as \"Kehjistan.\" From an in-universe standpoint, this is explained by Kehjistan's borders at the time encompassing Nahantu.\nDiablo IV.\nNahantu is one of the six main geographic areas that can be explored in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", with its introduction in the expansion \"&lt;a href=\"Vessel%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Vessel of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\". The area features new &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s, s, and &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s. Players will encounter warring tribes as they traverse the region. In-game, Nahantu is as large as Scosglen, and is divided into six explorable regions. Four of them are jungle-themed, while the other two are red-rock canyon themed.\nNahantu was the last region of Estuar to be added to the game.\nNotable Locations.\n\"Main article: \""}

However, his power grew, and Namari confronted him in single combat, but was defeated, though Sargoth remained trapped inside. Namari's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was bound to the temple to ensure that Sargoth never escaped.\nOver the millennia, the power of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; waned, while Sargoth's power continued to grow. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the temple's three beacons were stolen, rendering Namari powerless.

Namari told them about Sargoth and of the missing beacons. If they were returned, they could stop Sargoth before it was too late. If they aided her, she would give them the objects they sought out.\nThe heroes returned with the beacons, much to Namari's joy. She ordered Jin to stay at the altar in case Sargoth broke the seal before they were ready, while she led the other hero(es) into the temple. Her spirit ached at the sight of the temple's interior, but nevertheless, guided the champion(s) to the final chamber, where they slew Sargoth.\nIn-game.\nNamari appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

She fell in love with a blacksmith, and went to live in the swamps.\nEarly Life.\nNan grew up in the marshes of northern &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. It was a hard life. As a child, her granfer (her father\u2019s father) told her that the noble family who ruled from the &lt;a href=\"Big%20House\"&gt;Big House&lt;/a&gt; practiced bride-theft and groom-theft. She could believe it, but found it easier to believe that the family married themselves and kin and cousins in order to keep their bloodline pure. Her granfer also discouraged her from preening, for in the swamp, becauty was both a snare and a foxlight.\nNan was taught how to read and write, due to her mother\u2019s noble origins. Her granfer loved her, but despised her mother. Nan did most of the work in the house, maintaining it, and oiling her father\u2019s tools, while her parents mooned over each other.\nWhen Nan was around 15/16 years old, her mother died, and her father died the year after that, as according to Nan, he loved his wife far more than his daughter, and with his wife dead, there was nothing left to live for.\nIn Service to the Countess.\nFirst Meetings.\nAt the age of eighteen, Nan\u2019s fortunes changed. The Countess, two years her junior, had seen her outside the Big House, and had taken a fancy to Nan\u2019s looks. Her granfer informed her that she was wanted as a servant in the Big House, to which Nan refused. He pleaded, as did her neighbors, for no-one wanted the wrath of the noble family brought down on them. A man came down from the Big House every day for a sennight, cozening or begging or threatening, before at last, the Countess herself came down, mounted on a horse. She rode up to Nan\u2019s house.\nNan was entranced with the Countess\u2019s beauty and mannerisms, but still refused, at least at first. The Countess mixed compliments and insults alike, until finally, Nan relented, saying that she\u2019d come, but leave at the end of spring if things didn\u2019t suit her. \nThe First Two Years.\nAfter escaping the Old House, Nan\u2019s role in the Countess\u2019s actions was hazy. Because the clergy were unable to talk any sense, they couldn\u2019t implicate her. A number of crofters wanted to burn Nan at the stake, but her granfer spoke in her defense. Nan lied, and said she knew nothing of the murdered girls. Whether they believed it or not was irrelevant, as the villagers prepared to storm the keep at sunrise.\nNan wrote her testimony. She understood that it was likely she would be hanged, and considered herself guilty. However, even then, she could not abandon her love for the Countess. \nPersonality and Traits.\nNan rarely used her birthname (\u201cNan\u201d was a nickname used by the Countess).\nNan considered herself \u201cvery pretty for what [she] was,\u201d with roses in her cheeks, and was not pallid like the other girls of the swamps. However, she was taught not to flaunt her appearance. She was \u201cstrong as a little horse.\u201d She had black hair and blue eyes.\nShe disliked priests and clergy. By the end of her service to the Countess, she was consumed with self-loathing."}

Heat and cold alike are something they endure often. Since food is scarce while foraging, they have learned to consume species of plants that would slay normal men. Through additional training, a warrior can fortify himself further against these dangers, allowing him to better survive while traveling to unfamiliar lands and battling unknown foes.\"\nGeneral Information.\nNatural Resistance is the final passive skill, making him more resistant against &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage (but not &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; and not &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Damage\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;). It is a very useful skill at higher difficulties, where better resistances are paramount.\nThe benefits from this skill suffers from diminishing returns per point, so putting just one point into it and taking advantage of skill-boosting equipment for a little more resistance may prove more efficient. The boost at low levels is much smaller than that provided by the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Salvation\"&gt;Salvation&lt;/a&gt; skill (which starts at 60% at level 1), but unlike Salvation, Natural Resistance provides a permanent bonus, and offers protection against Poison damage, which Salvation doesn't.\nWhile Natural Resistance helps bolster resistances, it cannot be a complete substitute for equipment that boosts resistances due to its limitations. This is even more evident in the expansion, due to the increased penalties for &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; difficulty; if a Barbarian were to max out this skill in classic Diablo II, he would have +17% all resistances in Hell difficulty."}

As such, this build downplays melee combat in exchange for the ranged attack damage provided by spells such as &lt;a href=\"Fissure\"&gt;Fissure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Boulder\"&gt;Molten Boulder&lt;/a&gt;, while at the same time keeping enemies at bay with &lt;a href=\"Raven\"&gt;Raven&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dire%20Wolf\"&gt;Dire Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Grizzly\"&gt;Grizzly&lt;/a&gt;. Summoners can also use ranged weapons such as bows, crossbows and throwing weapons to damage enemies from afar rather than spells (sometimes referred to as a Hunter Druid).\nPros:\nCons:\nYou have to play specially around the Summoning Skills tree. Spend up to five in Spirit Wolf because it works as a synergy for the Dire Wolves and the Grizzly and they are useful early in the game. Spend just one point in &lt;a href=\"Oak%20Sage\"&gt;Oak Sage&lt;/a&gt; and level the Spirit Wolves only to five before continue keeping all your points for Dires, Grizzly.\nStat points:\nStrength - Enough to wear in-game armors\nDexterity - Enough to wear in-game Armors and Shields\nVitality - The remaining points\nEnergy - It is suggested to put little to no points into energy. Although early on in the game you will not have enough mana to summon all minions at once, this will balance out later in the game. And if you choose your skill points wisely, you will rarely have to re-summon any pets.\nSkill Suggestions\nSummons Tree\nMax Bear\nMax Spirit Wolf\nMax Dire Wolf\nAbove is the Focus of the Build\nYou will want to have an active spirit. Debate on whether Oak Sage adding life to all your summons and yourself is more important than Heart of the Wolverine has been long debated. Certainly the shock of Oak Sage dying and reducing everyone's life is jarring. The AI for the spirits will not keep them out of trouble and they will die often at inopportune times. Which would bring my slight preference to play with Heart of the Wolverine. Either is valid. I've also seen people proclaim that you must max one of the spirits. I'm not that sure its true. You already will probably have a lot of +Skill items and charms and Spirits get buffed by your +Summons Tree items as well. If you don't expect them to be active all the time and are okay recasting them a few points is enough for most situations.\nThis can leave roughly 40 more points to assign.\nOptions of where to put them..."}

In an &lt;a href=\"Igani%20Bawe\"&gt;Igani Bawe&lt;/a&gt;, he found that his master had been captured by members of the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20of%20the%20Seven%20Stones\"&gt;Clan of the Seven Stones&lt;/a&gt;. He begged them to release his master, claiming that the Igani Bawe was unnecessary, that it was not the will of the spirits. The Seven Stones Witch Doctors refused to listen, and Nazeebo was forced to kill all of them bar &lt;a href=\"Benu\"&gt;Benu&lt;/a&gt;. Nazeebo warned him to flee as Five Hills Witch Doctors approached. Despite his protests, Benu obliged.\nIn the aftermath, Nazeebo became the topic of much discussion. Rumors persisted among the Clan of the Seven Stones that he had slaughtered his own kin when he was found in the jungle. Some described Nazeebo as a madman who had massacred Seven Stones warriors out of sheer bloodlust. Others told of the heretic eating the flesh of slain Witch Doctors and becoming a cannibal. Both Nazeebo and Zuwadza disappeared into the jungle, and were not heard from. The priests of the Clan of the Seven Stones claimed that the spirits of the Unformed Land called for &lt;a href=\"Igani%20Bawe\"&gt;Igani Bawe&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Tribe%20of%20the%20Five%20Hills\"&gt;Tribe of the Five Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn reality, Nazeebo had discovered the truth of the Unformed Land, that the spirits did not seek to be appeased through the Igani Bawe, and that the Umbaru's form of ritualistic warfare was nothing but the needless taking of lives. For his heresy, Nazeebo was banished from his people, who accused him of defying the spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Unformed Land&lt;/a&gt;. However, in reality, he followed their words. The spirits told him of a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;fallen star&lt;/a&gt;, and warned him of the end its coming prophecized. Nazeebo traveled into the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt;.\nNazeebo successfully defeated &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. The Hellflame Mask was crafted in honor of his victory. Nazeebo kept the mask close at all times. Or, perhaps too close...\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nNazeebo can be considered the canonical version of the Witch Doctor in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", but the name and gender are still up to the player.\nHeroes of the Storm.\n\"Nazeebo\" is a term given to the male Witch Doctor class in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". It is a name that is otherwise unused in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;\"Diablo\"&lt;/a&gt; series, though \"&lt;a href=\"Doubtwalker\"&gt;Doubtwalker&lt;/a&gt;\" depicts him as being male.\nHe was named \"Naziba\" in earlier versions of \"Heroes of the Storm\".\nHe retains &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Spiders\"&gt;Corpse Spiders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Wall\"&gt;Zombie Wall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Toads\"&gt;Plague of Toads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gargantuan\"&gt;Gargantuan&lt;/a&gt; skills. He also has a skill called Ravenous Spirit (which combines elements of &lt;a href=\"Haunt\"&gt;Haunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Locust%20Swarm\"&gt;Locust Swarm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Barrage\"&gt;Spirit Barrage&lt;/a&gt;) and a passive trait called Voodoo Ritual (which resembles &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Injustice\"&gt;Grave Injustice&lt;/a&gt;).\nNazeebo wears the &lt;a href=\"Quetzalcoatl\"&gt;Quetzalcoatl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20Mask\"&gt;Voodoo Mask&lt;/a&gt;. He is also unique in that even on his canonical skin, he carries a severed \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; \"troll head (as a &lt;a href=\"Mojos\"&gt;Mojo&lt;/a&gt;) and a &lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt; zergling skull on his hip, being the only hero to combine elements of all three franchises."}
