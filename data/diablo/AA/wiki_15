It is a place of meditation that acts as a retreat for those who feel lost. \nLore.\nThe gardens appear to stretch endlessly. The ground is dusted with flowers made of multicolored light petals. The flowers bloom eternally, scenting the air with soft perfume. \nThe gardens are in a constant state of flux, with some flowers fading, and others bursting into color. Reflective pools surround the gardens' fountains of light and sound. Music of a kind is constantly playing. &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s who enter the gardens can have their fears lifted, but they run the risk of being lost in its atmosphere. Mortals who have experienced the gardens have described an almost intoxicating tranquility, one in which the mind can become lost, forgetful, and complacent.\nHistory.\nDuring the assault on the High Heavens by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, it was one of the primary battlegrounds of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s assault. Numerous &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Rift\"&gt;Hell Rift&lt;/a&gt;s were opened in the area to allow &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to pour through. Diablo chose the Gardens specifically as one of his focal points, for he knew that if Auriel were to fall, the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; would lose hope. However, the Hell Rifts were closed by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit of the demon lord.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and the reformed &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; travelled through the gardens as part of their heist of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Staalek\"&gt;Jacob Staalek&lt;/a&gt; was nearly caught up in the gardens' atmosphere, but Tyrael prevented him from being too engrossed in it. He realized that the Black Soulstone was corrupting the gardens, noticing hairline cracks through the branches of a tree; corruption, spreading like a disease.\nIn-game.\nThe Gardens appear with two \"tiers\" in &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" when playing through the &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;Waypoint&lt;/a&gt; in both tiers. This is the first large zone in the High Heavens encountered by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, entering from &lt;a href=\"The%20Vestibule%20of%20Light\"&gt;The Vestibule of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Dense clumps of Demonic Corrupt Growths block access to most of the zone, but &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, Archangel of Hope empowers the Nephalem to destroy them after &lt;a href=\"The%20Light%20of%20Hope\"&gt;she is rescued&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Rakanoth\"&gt;Rakanoth&lt;/a&gt; in the connected &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Library of Fate&lt;/a&gt; subzone. The Nephalem then enters and destroys two &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Rift\"&gt;Hell Rift&lt;/a&gt;s, one in each Tier, before proceeding to &lt;a href=\"The%20Crystal%20Colonnade\"&gt;The Crystal Colonnade&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; adds a 3rd Tier to the Gardens of Hope, and the single two-level Hell Rift of that mode is only accessible by waypoint, not by a portal in the Gardens - although the dungeon return stone at its end does bring the Nephalem to the Gardens' 1st Tier.\n&lt;a href=\"Nekarat%20the%20Keywarden\"&gt;Nekarat the Keywarden&lt;/a&gt; is present in the 2nd Tier in &lt;a href=\"Torment%20difficulty\"&gt;Torment difficulty&lt;/a&gt; and above in both modes."}

They are capable of flight. With no need for food or water, Gargoyles can stand motionless for years. However, should a mortal draw near, they are quick to break their immobility and attack.\nThe act of transforming from flesh to stone allows a Gargoyle to heal any wounds that it has suffered. Adventurers should either avoid these demons or hunt them down until they are dead. Allowing them to flee will enable Gargoyles to return in full force.\nGargoyles are fairly intelligent and evil, and so sometimes serve a more powerful master.\nHistory.\nIn ages past, it was customary to decorate buildings with stone statues of demons that were enchanted to serve as guardians and protectors of those within. The misshapen figures of the statues were designed to taunt and anger any demons that attempted to gain entrance. &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; worked to unlock the wards that protected these granite images, and eventually was able to gild them with a Hadean life. The Gargoyles arose from their captive sleep and swooped down to prey upon those whom they were created to protect. Naturally, the remaining statues were immediately destroyed, but there are Signum that escaped and continue to terrorise the innocent to this day. They have spread to many dark and deep parts of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nGargoyles are encountered in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\".

The six piece bonus used to give higher damage bonus, but was nerfed in v2.7.1.\nPieces.\nThe set consists of six pieces, all six of which are required to complete it, and all six are Necromancer-restricted.\nSet Bonus:\nFor the first bonus, the Simulacrums will still be targetable and can take hits (and block pathing), but will not take any unsaved damage. Note that this set will be completely ineffective without the &lt;a href=\"Haunted%20Visions\"&gt;Haunted Visions&lt;/a&gt; that also makes Simulacrums \"permanent\", i.e. last forever. It will also make Simulacrums teleport to the Necromancer if they venture too far away.\nDue to gaining all runes, the Simulacrums will gain the following:\nCooldown refreshment is not a combat trait: it simply serves as a quality of life addition, so if the Necromancer (not the Simulacrum) actually dies, they can resummon their Simulacrum immediately upon revival.\nFor the second bonus, unsaved damage is only split if taken by the Necromancer, any damage going into Simulacrums is ignored. Note that with the &lt;a href=\"Unity\"&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt; and an undying &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;, the two effects will stack, further reducing damage taken: with 2 Simulacrums and a follower, the total damage reduction will be 50%, another 50%, and 33.3%, to a total of just 8.3% damage taken, which can be further augmented with other items.\nThe third effect is multiplicative to other similar effects, including &lt;a href=\"Gelmindor%27s%20Marrow%20Guards\"&gt;Gelmindor's Marrow Guards&lt;/a&gt;."}

The boy/girl was only twelve. The apprentice swore the oath genuinely, but cried the first night, and every other night over the first week. The master began to consider taking their new apprentice back to the village. However, they decided against it, for the Master Crusader saw even then that their apprentice would be the greatest member of their order. The Master Crusader died before their apprentice's eyes. Per Crusader tradition, the apprentice took up their master's armor, shield, and name.\nAfter death, this Crusader found themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, where their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; remained tied to the location by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ordan\"&gt;Ordan&lt;/a&gt;, whose soul was also imprisoned, instructed the Crusader on how to communicate with the living. The Crusader did so, as their apprentice entered the fortress, seeking for the means to defeat Malthael. The master told their apprentice to release the spirits in the fortress, so that they may gain the power of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. They did so, and the master returned to their apprentice, alongside the spirits of every Crusader who had borne the name now carried by the apprentice. They asked where their former ward's apprentice was. Their former apprentice, after some excuses, promised to get one. With final farewells said, the former apprentice went to confront Malthael.\nIn-game.\nThe Master Crusader will appear in the Pandemonium Fortress if the player is using a Crusader. Their gender matches that of the player's character. Taking part in all the Master Crusader's conversations will earn the \"&lt;a href=\"Carrying%20the%20Name\"&gt;Carrying the Name&lt;/a&gt;\" achievement.

He and his fellow masters studied the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Cycle%20of%20Being\"&gt;Great Cycle of Being&lt;/a&gt; for many years. The &lt;a href=\"Bloodtide%20Blade\"&gt;Bloodtide Blade&lt;/a&gt; was his favored &lt;a href=\"scythes\"&gt;scythe&lt;/a&gt;, and he was so devoted to the weapon that he would rather part with his life than have it leave his side.\nDark portents came to the priests after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, and Ordan and his fellow masters began trying to decipher them. It was clear that something terrible was coming, but none could pinpoint the exact nature this disaster would take.\nThe Chosen.\nOne day, far removed from the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, Ordan came across a village. A group of children had discovered a bird's nest with newly hatched eggs, but one of the eggs had fallen to the ground, leaving the dead bird inside. Ordan saw &lt;a href=\"The%20Chosen%20%28Necromancer%29\"&gt;one of the children&lt;/a&gt; cradling the creature in her hands. He closed his hands around the egg, and using his powers of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, resurrected the bird in skeletal form. He simply asked the girl, \"do you wish to learn?\", and she accepted.\nWeeks later, they arrived at the Necropolis. Ordan declared to his fellow priests that he had found his apprentice, and over the years, he instructed her in necromancy, physical combat, and academia. He also taught her how to control her emotions.\nWith the girl now an adult, he approached her and told his student that she had nothing left to learn within the halls of the Necropolis, but that wasn't to say that her teaching was over. The following day, they departed the Necropolis, and after travelling by land and sea, arrived at his student's old village. The village had been destroyed by cultists, and its inhabitants, including her former friends, slaughtered. As the cultists attacked them, he ordered her to raise &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s from the corpses of the villagers, and she did so, using the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s to kill the cultists. Ordan congratulated her, but told her that she would have to be faster next time.\nReaper of Souls.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt; neared, Ordan's &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; left the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; before they were finished with their training. Ordan let them go, as he knew that in the future, the student would perish in a coming attack.\nSure enough, the Priests did indeed do battle with the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; assaulted &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and Ordan was among those killed. His &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; wound up in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, as with the souls of many others from across the world. He instructed some of these spirits to provide aid to their own allies. Ordan himself provided instruction to his former student, who had come to the fortress seeking Malthael. Ordan instructed them to become one with &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, so that they might defeat the fallen &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;. Before the Necromancer departed to face the angel, Ordan requested that they take leadership of the Priests of Rathma, as Deathspeaker &lt;a href=\"Jurdann\"&gt;Jurdann&lt;/a&gt; was among the fallen.\nIn-game.\nMaster Ordan appears in the Pandemonium Fortress when playing as the Necromancer."}

She masterminded the revival of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; by manifesting herself in the mortal realm and performing a ritual of Dark Summoning. This ritual, long thought to be impossible by the most powerful mortal wizards, allowed Lilith to link with Diablo across realms, strengthening him until he was finally able to once again reincarnate himself in the mortal plane. Rage and a deep yearning for revenge boiled within the eyes of the Lord of Terror, and together he and Lilith resurrected the two remaining &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s as well as &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt;, two of their strongest agents.\nDiablo announced his grand plan - the Three were finally strong enough to spread Pandemonium throughout &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Lilith could have easily conducted an assault on her own, but because she had been left severely weakened by the Dark Summoning ritual, she agreed to aid the Prime Evils and command some of their remaining forces.

In 1993, he sent demos of his work \"to every developer who was working on 16-bit games in the San Francisco Bay Area.\" He created the music using the technical specs of the Sega Genesis.\nHis works include the &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; theme from the original \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", and worked on the music for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and its . He also worked on the original \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and worked on the music of &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Diablo%202.5\"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" as well. &lt;a href=\"Russel%20Brower\"&gt;Russel Brower&lt;/a&gt; has commented that Uelmen's style in this time was more \"Wagnerian\" (a comparison to Richard Wagner); the music being \"big and powerful,\" whereas previously, Uelmen's scores had been more eclectic, using a lot of found sound. Reportedly, Uelmen's music style influenced the direction of the game's early development.\nIn the early 2000s, Uelmen was aware of the tensions gripping Blizzard North as the team collapsed into dysfunction. For his part, Uelmen wanted to keep the team together, and was caught offguard when &lt;a href=\"David%20Brevik\"&gt;David Brevik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Max%20Schaefer\"&gt;Max Schaefer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaefer\"&gt;Erich Schaefer&lt;/a&gt; resigned. While some Blizzard North members left with their founders, Uelmen wasn't among them; he was raising a family, paying for his wife's law school course, and didn't feel financially secure enough to risk jumping ship. Thus, at least initially, he remained at Blizzard North. However, the company was shut down in 2005, and it took awhile for Uelmen to learn what had happened; his wife had gone into labor, and he was in the hospital when he learnt of Blizzard North's closure. When he finally got to see &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt;, he took Morhaime's offer to work at Blizard Irvine. When he arrived, his first assignment was to write music for \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUelmen performed a track for \"World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade\". He left Blizzard in 2007, and joined &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_Games\"&gt;Runic Games&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, where he provided the composition for \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchlight\"&gt;Torchlight&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Using this ability, the fury of his assault increases with every opponent he kills. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nThis is a \"Power-Up\" skill, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charge-up%20Skill\"&gt;Charge-up Skill&lt;/a&gt; in that you gain charges with each attack, but different in that you do not need to use another attack to release the charges, Power-up Skills just get stronger and stay that way for a duration and do not consume accumulated charges on hit.\nThe first hit you deal grants you a small orbiting green orb, each hit after that makes the orb bigger and bigger graphically showing you how many charges you have. Each hit will also refresh the timer on the duration, if you don't deal a hit after 20 seconds of the last hit, all the charges disappear.\nThe more hits you get in, the higher the damage and attack speed bonus will grow. For example, at skill level 1, the first hit is +20% damage (+30% in patch 2.4 of Resurrected) and +3% attack speed, but by three hits, it will now be +60% and +9% respectively. The \"green ball\" will spin around your character indicating the power level of Maul. The bigger the ball, the more damage you'll be doing and the attacks will be faster.\n+20% Damage Per Charge Level - changed in patch 2.4 of Resurrected to 30%\n+3% Attack Speed Per Charge Level\nYou will only gain a certain amount of charges, based on the level of the skill. If you look at the Bonus Damage row for Level 1 it says 20-60, since you get 20% with each hit, you only can hold 3 charges (20 &gt; 40 &gt; 60), at level 20 you can hold 13 charges. This charge limit will also affect how much Attack Speed you get, for example, since you can only hold 3 charges at level 1, you can only get up to a maximum of 9% Attack Speed (3 * 3%).\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 3\nDuration: 20 seconds"}

After the second visit, Nerissa requested Maurice fetch her an oil lamp, as she began writing to the creditors, begging for more time. As he returned, finding &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth\"&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; with her sister, Elizabeth suddenly span round, knocking the lamp out of Maurice's hands. Elizabeth's hair caught fire, and she was severely disfigured by the blaze. Maurice was sent out to find the healers, and while they saved her life, they could not save Elizabeth's visage. Maurice blamed himself for the accident, despite Nerissa insisting that he wasn't to blame. He stood on watch like a soldier for Carlotta, who sure enough, arrived a third time. Carlotta strode past him, and he announced Carlotta's presence to his mistress after she had done so herself. Nerissa let him leave as they began their third and final card game."}

She believed that knowledge could be found in understanding the essence of your &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; as it has always been, and wisdom in accepting what it will become. She also taught her people about purification of the soul; that it should occur first alone, over days. Then, purification should occur \"in the sight of others,\" over the course of a life's ordeals.\nAs the power of the empresses winnowed, they argued over the direction to take their people. Ksathra suggested uplifting a few so that they could shepherd their fellows, which Mehrwen said that it would be better to provide a small amount of power to all, that none may claim dominion. It is widely believed that Ksathra struck the first blow in anger. The result was a civil war that destroyed the empire, and left the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Isles\"&gt;Cold Isles&lt;/a&gt; beset by storm and sea.\nIt is believed that while mortally injured, Mehrwen swam away from Ksathra to &lt;a href=\"the%20Spiral\"&gt;the Spiral&lt;/a&gt;, where people could find and praise her in &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Her dying breath supposedly formed the mists that shroud the region. The purest and bravest &lt;a href=\"Tempest\"&gt;Tempest&lt;/a&gt;s are sent on dangerous voices to breathe in the mists, hear the whispering voices of an earlier age, and grow in knowledge and power to command sea and sky as empresses such as Mehrwen did. \nPresently, Mehrwen is worshipped by the people of the Cold Isles, in tall spires with roofs open to the air, as if inviting all to join in her rule. However, the legend of &lt;a href=\"Xekorendaag\"&gt;Xekorendaag&lt;/a&gt; states that the empresses' fury cursed the Isles so long as their descendants remained on Pelghain. When the people began to brave the deluges and hurricanes, arrogantly building tall cities and monuments, a great serpent drove into their settlements, consuming families and carving the isles apart as it did. Reproached, the people moved their settlements away from the capital, and the serpent faded to memory."}

Powerful &lt;a href=\"Deathly%20Haunt\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; haunted the ruins in the area, but he was not powerful enough to defeat them (though he was able to track them). He feared that the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; would try to use the spirits to further their goals.\nMehtan explained the situation to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, instructing them to find and confront the spirits. The nephalem succeeded, and aided Mehtan when the Coven attacked. Mehtan could thus begin the work of freeing the spirits, though he feared the Coven would find other sources of power to exploit. Regardless, he bid his ally farewell.\nThe Necromancer's Choice.\nThe Nephalem later encountered Mehtan in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "13452", "revid": "188907", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13452", "title": "Melee Sorceress", "text": "The Melee Sorceress or Meleeress is a build intending on making the magically-inclined &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; into a melee fighter. She is not made for this use, meaning this build is seemingly not for practical use, in reality however, it can indeed be an extremely powerful build. It is essentially a ladder-only build, due to the majority of damage coming from the &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Dream Rune Word&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nBy definition, this build the Sorceress only invests points in skills that are not used to directly attack the enemy with magic. All other skills can only serve as prerequisites or synergies.\nUsing these guidelines, only the following skills are permitted:\nAs this short list makes quite plain, the possibilities are rather limited. Nevertheless, most of the skills left will also be ignored, with focus narrowed down to a tiny handful of extremely important, and potentially powerful, skills.\nGeneral build.\nSkills.\nThe Melee Sorceress build will mainly need to focus on Warmth, Enchant, Energy Shield, and Telekinesis, with anything left over possibly going to the cold armor of your choice.\nTelekinesis may seem an odd choice, but is actually extremely important to a Melee Sorceress, as it comes with a hidden synergy that reduces the amount of mana consumed per life point saved by .0625 when using the Energy Shield. This reduction is barely significant for any other build, but without any synergy bonus, the mana to life ratio is 2:1, while after 16 points are invested in Telekinesis, the mana consumed by Energy Shield is halved to a 1:1 ratio. Every point beyond 16 means you are losing less mana than you are preserving from your life. Only actual, invested points in the skill are counted toward this bonus, so +skills do not affect this at all.\nTelekinesis and Energy shield are crucial for you to survive. Telekinesis increases the amount of damage absorbed by each point of mana, so it is imperative that you max it. Remember, as a melee fighter, you're going to be in the thick of it. As the Sorceress is extremely fragile, you will rely primarily on your Energy Shield and mana to keep you alive.\nIt is important to note that when struck by an elemental attack with Energy Shield up, the game calculates the damage against you \"before\" it factors in resists. This means that elemental attacks, such as those from the powerful Gloams or Mephisto, will damage your Energy Shield as if you had 0 to all resists. This is your one weakness, and although Warmth's regeneration helps counteract it, fighting these enemies efficiently still requires a bit of finesse. Keep a belt of Rejuvenation potions handy!\nWarmth enhances Energy Shield further by providing a constantly replenishing mana pool. Remember, this is analogous to having a constantly replenishing life pool so long as you are quick with replacing Energy Shield when it drops.\nEnchant is a required skill, not due to its damage, which is negligible, but for its attack rating bonus. The sorceress has a very low attack rating even with high Dexterity, which will cause you to miss many hits in melee. Enchant goes a long way to vastly improving your accuracy and thus mana leeching ability; by skill level 20, Enchant will be granting you a 15% bonus to accuracy, which is huge!\nEquipment.\nWhat the Melee Sorceress wears may prove far more important than her small array of skills. Note that the elemental masteries can be beneficial in this aspect, assuming your equipment provides elemental skills.\nThe sorceress can wear to use the paladin skill &lt;a href=\"Zeal\"&gt;Zeal&lt;/a&gt; (see Zealess sub-build below). Instead of , you could use a &lt;a href=\"Phase%20Blade\"&gt;Phase Blade&lt;/a&gt; for the decent damage and 20% &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor your shield, use a &lt;a href=\"Monarch\"&gt;Monarch&lt;/a&gt; with 4 &lt;a href=\"Ith%20Rune\"&gt;Ith Rune&lt;/a&gt;s and have 20 Energy Shield so you have 60% damage goes to mana and at least 75% of the damage doesn't go to health. Combined with a Circlet with 3 Iths or 3 &lt;a href=\"Dun\"&gt;Dun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jewels\"&gt;Jewels&lt;/a&gt;, that makes 100% damage taken go to mana. therefore making you have 75% or more damage reduced. Then add &lt;a href=\"Verdungo%27s%20Hearty%20Cord\"&gt;Verdungo's&lt;/a&gt; 10% more and you end up taking 12% damage from all enemies and less from spells with max resists. It'll be like an underpowered &lt;a href=\"Smiter\"&gt;Smiter&lt;/a&gt; that has about 8 times as much health.\nZealess.\nThe Zealess is a powerful sub-build of the melee sorceress, using the &lt;a href=\"Passion%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Passion Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to &lt;a href=\"Zeal\"&gt;Zeal&lt;/a&gt;. It takes advantage of the sorceress' elemental power in the form of Lightning Mastery and survivability granted by Energy Shield and Warmth.\nThis is a surprisingly powerful build, a Zealess can solo or rush her way through any content in the game. They can do most tasks with ease, though they must show some finesse around mana-draining or heavily elemental enemies. Teleport will be your only active skill, and should be used \"very\" liberally, zooming your way across the battlefield.\nAttributes.\nStrength: Enough to wear your items. You should have at least 106 to wear a Troll Nest, though if you plan to do Ubers it would be prudent to get 115 so you can wear a Winged Helm (&lt;a href=\"Guillaume%27s%20Face\"&gt;Guillaume's Face&lt;/a&gt;, specifically).\nDexterity: Enough to max out your block rate. This should be around 360 by level 90.\nVitality: As you are using your mana as your health, this stat can be completely ignored. If you're having trouble with mana burners like Uber Baal, then it may be prudent to invest some points into this, but you can use your skills to bypass burners.\nEnergy: Keep your Strength up to pace with your equipment requirements, and keep your Dexterity up to pace with maintaining your block rate as you level up. If you're satisfied with those two stats for the time being, drop all additional points into Energy to increase your Energy Shield's lifespan.\nSkills.\nThe skills will be mostly the same as the basic Melee Sorceress outlined above, with the exception that Lightning Mastery will be more important than Enchant. Max Lightning Mastery first, then dump all your extra skill points into Enchant.\nTeleport is really your only active skill, and you should be making good use of it to get into combat quickly. Remember, a Zealess is strongest when she is surrounded by enemies on all sides to leech off of. A Zealess can use teleport to always be at the thickest point of fighting, and if your Energy Shield drops during that fight, you can instantly get to safety and replace it.\nEquipment.\nThe meat of the build's damage output lies in Passion, which grants Zeal and allows you to bypass your poor attack speed, and the dual Dreams, which stack and receive a massive damage bonus from your Lightning Mastery. A perfectly geared Zealess with an inventory of +Lightning skills Grand Charms will be able to reach upwards of 50,000 damage per hit. While the Paladin Zealer hits like a swarm of bees, light damage but incredibly fast, the Zealess is the opposite: she attacks slower, but each strike is like being hit by a freight train. Passion and the two Dreams are really the only two 'required' items of this build; Zeal for attack speed and multiple target hit, and Dream so your Zeal does damage. Be sure to make your Passion in a Phase Blade - these are the only swords with no durability, and thus are indestructible by default.\nFortitude is a generally excellent runeword, with many useful traits for a melee fighter and is uniquely suited to a Zealess. A sorceress can take advantage of Fortitude's massive defense on a low strength requirement base armor like a Dusk Shroud or Archon Plate. The enhanced damage is not very useful since your damage is almost entirely elemental, but the + to resists, faster cast rate to enhance your advance or retreat via teleport, damage to mana to round out your energy shield for 100% damage to mana, and huge bonus to health are all very helpful. In particular, Fortitude's very high chance of casting Chilling Armor when struck allows you to skip the Cold Tree entirely, foregoing Frozen Armor in favor of Fortitude's chance for Chilling Armor. Fortitude's enormous defense + Chilling Armor grants you an incredible defense bonus that greatly enhances your survivability in melee.\nGore Rider is an essential item. Its many melee bonuses will prove quite helpful, in particular Crushing Blow and Open Wounds. Combined with Dracul's Grasp, your Open Wounds chance should ensure no bosses, even Ubers, will heal. Dracul's is also helpful for the Strength bonus, which frees up 15 points to be spent elsewhere, and its life leech and life tap are useful in surviving against mana burning enemies like Uber Baal. Verdungo's Hearty Cord also helps in this situation, the massive vitality boost and physical resistance allows you to stretch what is probably a very low life pool to beyond what you thought was possible.\nAs for jewelry - Crescent Moon, with its very large 15% mana leech, is probably the best amulet choice. It's large leech percent, when combined with Warmth, gives you a basically unlimited mana pool as long as no mana-burners are around, and significantly speeds up your recovery from mana-burners when they do appear. Crescent Moon's large leech also frees up your ring slots do you really don't need leech rings, and can use a Stone of Jordan for the +to skills and (especially) the increase in mana pool, and a Raven Frost so you Cannot Be Frozen. Freeze is always a danger and annoyance to a melee fighter.\nNote that this equipment loadout will not max out your resists.

{"id": "8034", "revid": "24916843", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8034", "title": "Melee Weapons", "text": "Melee weapons are any weapons that require close-quarter physical contact in order to cause damage. They are the staple of any character that uses &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28attribute%29\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; as their primary attribute. Majority of weapons in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo series&lt;/a&gt; are melee. Monsters also mainly use melee weapons, although many of them fight with their claws and teeth instead of hand-made tools of war.\n&lt;a href=\"Mages\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt; and other users of &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; put little faith in melee weapons: they may serve to augment spells, but are rarely, if ever, used directly.\nAppearance.\nUnlike the mostly wooden, and light &lt;a href=\"Ranged%20Weapon\"&gt;Ranged Weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, melee weapons are usually made of very hard and heavy materials, though there are some that exist that do not adhere to these requirements.\nThey are all characterized by some sort of cutting-edge, piercing tip, or blunt head, set atop a handle. The size and shape of the cutting-edge and the handle can be varied to produce a multitude of different varieties. Have a long, flat and sharp edge upon a short handle that allows for a tight grip and you have a &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Using a much broader and heavier edge with a strong and medium-sized handle creates the &lt;a href=\"axes\"&gt;Axe&lt;/a&gt;. Most melee weapons can be either &lt;a href=\"one-handed\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nThe melee weapons found favor with the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; class in the original \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; preferred Ranged Weapons and Spells respectively. They were not used widely by the other two classes due to the high strength requirements of the more powerful weapons that are needed to do enough damage in the late-game.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;, the unfinished class, the found favor with melee weapons as his primary means of attack. Largely because of his high strength and no magic.\nOnce \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" was released, the and some builds of the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; were favorites for melee weapons, even though there were no limits to the attribute distribution in the game. This was not only partly due to the fact that their skills swerved more towards melee use, but standard stereotyping also played a role. One could not imagine a Barbarian wielding a &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt;, although some enterprising players successfully created the Barb Bowman build. All five classes had\u00a0some melee weapon particularly designed for their use: the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;s had &lt;a href=\"Spears\"&gt;Spears&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=\"Daggers\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt;, further aided by their &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Dagger\"&gt;Poison Dagger&lt;/a&gt; skill, the Paladin gained bonuses with &lt;a href=\"Swords\"&gt;Swords&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Scepters\"&gt;Scepters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es favor &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20Orbs\"&gt;Sorceress Orbs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Assassins\"&gt;Assassins&lt;/a&gt; use dual &lt;a href=\"Katars\"&gt;Katars&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0while the Barbarian could become proficient in any type of weapon due to their &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Masteries\"&gt;Combat Masteries&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nAnother major factor in the switch of many players towards melee weapons was that &lt;a href=\"Ranged%20Weapon\"&gt;Ranged Weapon&lt;/a&gt;s now required ammunition. &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;Bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crossbows\"&gt;Crossbows&lt;/a&gt; required &lt;a href=\"Arrows\"&gt;Arrows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bolts\"&gt;Bolts&lt;/a&gt; respectively, while the various &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Weapons\"&gt;Throwing Weapons&lt;/a&gt; got depleted as they were used. The Throwing Weapons could carry some modifiers that replenished them in time and Arrows and Bolts were easily found as drops by killing &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt;, but many casual players still found the constant search for more ammunition very tiring, not to mention boring. Consequently,\u00a0\nAfter the release of , both new classes were used in melee. The &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; had class-specific melee weapons, the &lt;a href=\"Katars\"&gt;Katars&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;-bashing s to great effect. The Druid seldom used them in combat, for he usually leaves the weaker enemies to his minions. Druids are the only class which does not have special weapons, since even if they fight in melee, they do so in beast form, where fangs prove to be more of aid than blades.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", the s are most proficient in Melee Weapons. They can even wield massive &lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Weapons\"&gt;Mighty Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, which are way too heavy for any other human to even lift. In return, Barbarians despise ranged weapons and will never utilize those (yet may hurl throwing weapons if they want to soften enemy up before charging into close combat).\nAll other classes mostly use melee weapons as secondary tools:\n&lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt; favors melee weapons, as opposed to &lt;a href=\"Lyndon\"&gt;Lyndon&lt;/a&gt; (who isn't fascinated with putting his life on the line) and &lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt; (who only uses weapons to augment her sorcery)."}

It was a bunch of settled bandits, we heard; violent against their neighbors, accompanied their robberies with mass conflagrations. So we weren't surprised when we marched in, made our demands, and instead of saying \"no,\" somebody tossed a fire pot at the guy right in front of me. Burst into flame instantly, before he could scream. More of them threw.

I just shouted at her \"stop!\" \"please\" and maybe it's because I didn't have my sword out, or maybe she could see how scared I was, but she stopped. I thought we'd averted disaster; that's how na\u00efve I was.\"\n\"Shunshek put his hands over the potion and Tsanag and Gaztya had the girl by the hair, and both of them took their knives out. I don't remember what I said to them. It wasn't impressive. Probably just how she was just a kid. They told me to leave if I didn't wanna watch.\"\n\"Everything felt slow then. I tried to get them to stop but they were already holding her to the ground. I rounded on them, someone cut me bad, right over my eyes, and everything was red.

Where it dripped below, I saw white teeth gleam in a glistening red snout. The blood vanished with a puff of sand and an awful guzzling noise.\"\n\"For minutes, I barely moved. What I had seen, I was sure, was blood sacrifice--a red beast, crouching in illusion below the earth, drinking the life of Morrick's thralls. I retreated, and did not return until I had the Ammuit council at my back. But Morrick, raking both hands through his elaborate braids, parried my every accusation. His fighters were volunteers, he swore. No red demon feasted upon them. What sacrifice could there be?\"\n\"I searched the pit and pulled up piles of earth; I cut my palm open and let the blood drip uselessly upon the sand. The red beast remained hidden, and Morrick was outraged. The council deemed me a menace, and I was stripped of my titles among the Ammuit, and the many artifacts I had won in my journeys. I could have lashed out at Morrick, but I had no hope to defeat him directly, and I could not even unearth his illusion. He was the greater.\"\n\"At that time, old conflicts among the mage clans were as badges of honor. I pledged myself to clan &lt;a href=\"Ennead\"&gt;Ennead&lt;/a&gt; in their black-leaved grotto; so great was their desire to insult my order that they accepted. And I found their perspective inspiring. Unlike we Ammuit, who strove to create fully-formed and perfect illusions all at once, the Ennead artificers imbued their creations one piece at a time. Thus I underwent their ritual transfusions, despite my unease at letting old rivals open my veins.\""}

I could hear the walls splintering.\"\n\"Aphod's armies brought a great rock-hurler; where it struck, timber and stone walls were tossed about like twigs. I knew injury would be plentiful, homes destroyed. Spake Isshai again, \"Mighty Nilfur, you must yoke the storm and take the invaders' lives!\" Kalbaz said nothing--he feared my magic would bring other mages--but Isshai was insistent, and thus I replied: \"No, for the enemy's weakness has not been revealed.\"\"\n\"Before sunset, the armies of Aphod were inside the city. They fought with inhuman zeal, clambering up ladders in full suits of jagged armor. I studied them with eagles' eyes, my vision piercing through their helmets so that I could see the answer I sought upon the face of the enemy. But all I saw were people.\"\n\"Aphod's soldiers stood upon the heaps of dead to surmount the walls separating Ullrat into quarters. Fighting beneath these walls led to collapses; hundreds were trapped and mortally wounded. The enemy vanguard pushed our despondent army to the exterior of the palace, and took up ramsheads to breach it. \"Nilfur,\" Isshai cried, \"will you not act?\""}

His realm in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Realm of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;, and he watched with joy as its denizens schemed and warred against each other. He, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; were the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, and from the outset, warred amongst each other to maintain dominion and rule over the legions of the Burning Hells. He acted as the mentor of &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs with all of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;kind, Mephisto warred against the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. However, he preferred to operate from the shadows rather than lead an army in the open.\nOne battle bore &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s right into the heart of his lair, making an attack against Mephisto himself. One of the angels managed to draw blood, causing it to spill onto the ground. This led to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Demon\"&gt;Magma Demon&lt;/a&gt;s, who rose up to defend their master and drove the angels back.\nMephisto and his brothers almost achieved victory against the High Heavens at the &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Battle%20of%20the%20Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Fifth Battle of the Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt;. However, confident of victory, the Primes began arguing over who would get the spoils of war, and thus, their attack failed.\nThe Sin War.\nWhile leading his forces on the battlefields of &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;, Mephisto noticed that the angels were withdrawing. He ordered his forces to withdraw so he could analyze the situation. &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, losing patience, stormed the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; was missing. Thus, the Eternal Conflict ground to a halt. Eventually, tales of demons summoned into a &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;new realm&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;new people&lt;/a&gt; reached the ears of the Prime Evils. They sensed within humanity the dormant powers of their &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; forefathers, and thus resolved to corrupt humanity into a weapon to use against the High Heavens. So it was that Mephisto and his brothers cast their influence into mortal minds, spreading their ideas across Sanctuary. Their whispers led to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;, where each Prime Evil took on the role of a seemingly compassionate deity. Mephisto took on the persona of Mefis, Spirit of Love. Their actions were countered by the rogue angel &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, who formed the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; to counter their influence. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, as the Prime Evils and Inarius secretly vyed for influence over humanity.\nThe Sin War ended with a final battle between the forces of Heaven, Hell, and the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt;, after which Mephisto met with the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;. Mephisto offered to let Sanctuary be untouched by either angel or demon to see what the children may yet become on their own for good or ill. It was agreed that Mephisto cast his mark on the ruins of the Cathedral of Light to seal the flux between worlds and in return, Mephisto was given Inarius. It was agreed that humanity be allowed to find its own path, free of the interference from angels and demons.\nThe Dark Exile.\nIn the millennia following the Sin War, the Lesser Evils grew discontent, believing that the Prime Evils had forsaken the Eternal Conflict to focus on humanity. The four &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; rose up against the Primes, and despite the efforts of Mephisto and his brothers, they were cast out of Hell into the mortal realm, in what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe banishment of the Prime Evils from Hell to the mortal plane also left them incorporeal. In order to acquire a physical form, they required a body for their spirit to possess. Over time their demonic presence twisted the victims human flesh into grotesque simulacrums of their physical form. \nIn response to the most evil of beings walking Sanctuary, the &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; rallied several of the disparate &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt; into an alliance known as the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, and gave them the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s to bind the Three forever. In truth, this series of events had been masterminded by the Prime Evils. Through the soulstones they would corrupt the Worldstone itself and with it, all of humanity. A new army to be used against the forces of Heaven.\nAt some point during the Exile, Mephisto was present in &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. He bound the spirits of demons into the &lt;a href=\"mummies\"&gt;mummies&lt;/a&gt; that slept beneath the sands of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, hordes of undead emerging to bring woe to the living.\nMephisto was the first of the Three to be captured. During their hunt for him, the Horadrim led an army against his &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20of%20Bone\"&gt;Fortress of Bone&lt;/a&gt;, but the common soldiers found themselves hard pressed to advance against the seemingly endless tides of undead that he summoned, and were nearly overwhelmed. Eventually, Mephisto was found in or around one of the urban centers of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. The fight cost many innocent lives, but eventually, the Horadrim succeeded in defeating the Lord of\u00a0Hatred and imprisoning his essence inside the soulstone. It was then entrusted to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; priests and kept sealed in the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Tower\"&gt;Guardian Tower&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Corruption of Zakarum.\nOver the generations, Mephisto was able to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, and the body became a mockery of its former glory. The first signs of this were as early as the 11th century. Two centuries after this, Mephisto cemented his control over the Church. He had been able to overcome the soulstone enough to have the Zakarum priests to work spells to shatter the soulstone into seven shards, breaking the mystic seal and freeing him. The &lt;a href=\"Que-Hegan\"&gt;Que-Hegan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim&lt;/a&gt; proved immune to his corruption, so Mephisto had the priesthood slay and dismember him. The priest &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;Sankekur&lt;/a&gt; became the new Que-Hegan and consequently, Mephisto's embodiment on the mortal plane. The corrupted High Council fashioned the &lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Orb\"&gt;Compelling Orb&lt;/a&gt; to control the rest of the Zakarum faithful and used their powers to conceal the lair of their master. Years passed, and eventually, &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; was sent west to reawaken &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThus, Diablo arrived in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, with Baal at his side. The two entered the temple's innermost chamber where Mephisto's soulstone was kept, and released him. Mephisto possessed Sankekur (already under Mephisto's control), whose body was twisted to represent Mephisto's hideous visage. After nearly three centuries, the Prime Evils were united. Within the chamber, the Three devised a final stratagem to reclaim the Burning Hells and claim vengeance upon those who overthrew them, along with enslaving humanity to their will. Diablo, assuming his true form, crossed through the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt; into Hell to rally those still loyal to the Three. Baal began his journey north to corrupt the Worldstone while Mephisto remained behind, bent on destroying anything that could oppose their plan.\nIt wasn't long before a group of mortal heroes arrived intent on doing such a thing. In the fevered combat that followed, Mephisto worked diligently to turn his foes' own anger and distrust against them. But despite the long hunt and many hours of battle, the heroes defeated Mephisto and imprisoned his essence within his &lt;a href=\"Mephisto%27s%20Soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. The artifact was later destroyed at the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;, which would, in theory, cast his spirit into some &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;unseen netherworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven after death, Sankekur's corpse still seeped corruption from Mephisto's deep rooted demonic influence, and it was sealed in a &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Rakhat%20Keep\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Carthas\"&gt;one of the heroes&lt;/a&gt; who defeated him.\nThe Black Soulstone.\nMephisto's essence ended up in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, as per the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;. He was the fourth and final Great Evil to be marked by her in her preparation for Diablo's return. When she found his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, Mephisto fought back with a rage that she had not anticipated. More than once, he was able to take control of the &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;'s mind, and if not for the safeguards Adria had employed in the ritual, she would have been lost. Nevertheless, she succeeded in marking his essence.\nMephisto was briefly merged into Diablo as a single Prime Evil, but Diablo was defeated by a new hero and the Great Evils were drawn back into the Black Soulstone, their souls screaming for release. Because of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, the stone was destroyed, and Diablo was freed, still containing Mephisto's essence and those of the other Evils. Eventually however, Mephisto's spirit was able to break free from Diablo, just as all the other Evils.\nWhile Mephisto returned to the Burning Hells, a sliver of his essence remained in Sanctuary. This sliver took the form of a &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Wolf\"&gt;Bloodied Wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great Enmity.\nMephisto's demonic influence bubbled up from Hell, causing the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Fields of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;, corrupted land that seeped deep hatred into the hearts of men, causing them to turn against each other. Such intense evil permeates those lands that it even causes the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Hatred%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;crystalized demonic energy&lt;/a&gt; made of hatred itself.\nAt some point, Lilith was summoned into Sanctuary by a former &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;Elias&lt;/a&gt;. This brought a resurgence to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Triune\"&gt;Cult of Triune&lt;/a&gt;, who now worshipped her. Meanwhile, Mephisto's essence remained scattered in Hell. As the Bloodied Wolf, he began following the progress of a &lt;a href=\"the%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, occasionally protecting them from unseen dangers, unknown to them, as Mephisto saw they had the strength to oppose Lilith.\nFinally, his essence began to reform within his &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Realm of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately for him, Lilith sensed this, and made efforts to reach him before he fully reforms and then devour him to take his essence. According to Mephisto himself, Elias' meddling with the power at the Temple of the Primes caused imbalance to the realms of Hell; the Vision of Sescheron and its deceased inhabitans ended up in his realm, while in truth they belonged in Baal's domain, not his.\nWhen the Wanderer came to a Triune shrine dedicated to him to request his blessings to use against Lilith, the Bloodied Wolf revealed himself to them, and told them his true identity. He agreed to grant them the blessing if they put the renegade souls to rest.\nFrom there he continued to help them (dialogues adapting accordingly to what order the player choses to go with the campaign), now without the need to hide himself. He came to an agreement with them; he would lead them to his cathedral where his essence gathered ahead of Lilith. He would help them subdue Lilith after they freed him, after which she would be sealed in a shard of the Worldstone, which had been fashioned into a &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. He would keep the soulstone to make sure she didn't return. After that, he would return them to Sanctuary and seal the gates of Hell.\nResealed.\nUnfortunately, when the time arrived, the Wanderer was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt;, who had the new soulstone in her possession. She recognized the runes on the wolf's head as that of Mephisto, and was aghast when she was told its true identity. She argued that between Lilith and Mephisto, he was the greater threat. The Wanderer decided to leave the final decision to her. Within his temple, Mephisto's essence could be seen as a giant floating sphere of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;; within which a shade of his visage could be glimpsed. Mephisto tried to persuade her again to stick to the agreed plan, but she refused, and stabbed his essence into the new soulstone, thereby sealing him. In the process, Neyrelle was also tainted by his essence.\nAfter Lilith was defeated, Neyrelle travelled away, promising to find a way to put an end to the Primes before she is lost. Possibly unknown to her, and unseen to all, Mephisto stalked her in the form of the Bloodied Wolf, watching as she lost a bit of herself with each passing day.\nVessel of Hatred.\nStill contained within the soulstone, Neyrelle took Mephisto to &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;. With every step she took, Mephisto grew stronger, constantly pushed against Neyrelle, attempting to break her spirit, whispering to her even as she slept. By the time Neyrelle neared &lt;a href=\"the%20River%20Gate\"&gt;the River Gate&lt;/a&gt;, Mephisto's influence over her had become dire, both physically and psychologically. Seeking to manipulate her, Mephisto appeared before Neyrelle as &lt;a href=\"Vhenard\"&gt;her mother&lt;/a&gt;, telling her that \"she\" was proud of her daughter, but that she needed to give up. Neyrelle saw through Mephisto's deception, and the Lord of Hatred psychologically tormented her. Neyrelle managed to escape Mephisto's hallucination, but the corruption that was spreading from his soulstone had slain her boatman. With a heavy heart, Neyrelle took his oar and continued on to Nehantu. Mephisto continued to whisper to her.\nAs Neyrelle carried Mephisto's soulstone into Nahantu, his corruption began to seep into the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt; and out of Nahantu across &lt;a href=\"Estuar\"&gt;Estuar&lt;/a&gt;, leaving &lt;a href=\"the%20Hollows\"&gt;monsters twisted by Hatred's influence&lt;/a&gt;. His corruption decimated the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Remnants\"&gt;Zakarum Remnants&lt;/a&gt;.\nAge of Hatred.\nMephisto was able to whisper into the ears of &lt;a href=\"Eru\"&gt;Eru&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Spiritborn\"&gt;Spiritborn&lt;/a&gt; who saved and was helping them to find Neyrelle. By blaming all the tragedies he had suffered on the arrival of Neyrelle with the soulstone, Mephisto managed to turn Eru to his side; they made a pact in which Mephisto would spare Nahantu should Eru help him. In a timely betrayal, Eru stole Akarat's corpse from the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Light\"&gt;Vault of Light&lt;/a&gt;, as well Mephisto's soulstone. In the hall of the &lt;a href=\"Dedicants%20of%20Akarat\"&gt;dedicants&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, Akarat's corpse was laid on the ground, and the soulstone on its chest. Tar leaked from the stone, forming a pool which submerged the corpse. Shortly after, Akarat's corpse rose again, with Mephisto now inhabiting it, as the nearby statues began to melt due to his corruption.\nHatred Rising.\nMephisto's influence continued to corrupt areas of &lt;a href=\"Estuar\"&gt;Estuar&lt;/a&gt;. In accordance to his pact with Eru, he spared Nahantu and the Spirit Realm. &lt;a href=\"Realmwalker\"&gt;Realmwalker&lt;/a&gt;s in service to Mephisto emerged in the mortal realm, spawning &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nMephisto can be found on the third level of the &lt;a href=\"Durance%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Durance of Hate&lt;/a&gt;. However, before geting to him, the have to battle a score of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Lord%20%28Vampire%29\"&gt;Bloodlords&lt;/a&gt; and additional &lt;a href=\"Council%20Member\"&gt;Council Member&lt;/a&gt; bosses. Mephisto can be reached either by taking the left or the right way around the pool of blood; both rooms contain a Unique Council Member boss.\nMephisto has a range of abilities he will use against the player: several based skills such as and , a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Nova\"&gt;Poison Nova&lt;/a&gt; spell and several &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; based skills like Frost Nova. Apart from these abilities, Mephisto has an extremely powerful missile attack that looks like a blazing white orb (officially called Skull Missile), that can kill most &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; units or minions and take away an enormous chunk out of the player's health. Therefore, it is best to stay close to Mephisto, as he mostly uses this attack when the player is far away. While his melee damage isn't very high, the player's health can drop steadily if Mephisto combines his Poison Nova and skills; having enough &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Resistance\"&gt;Cold Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Resistance\"&gt;Lightning Resistance&lt;/a&gt; helps mitigate this damage. In Nightmare and Hell difficulties, Mephisto is immune to life and mana leech (unless Life Tap is cast) so it is best to stock on health, mana and rejuvenation potions before battling him.\nA viable strategy is to battle Mephisto in one of the rooms on the left or right in order to avoid a trap: in the backroom where Mephisto stands there are restless spirits that sometimes rise up and lash out at players who are in range. These spirits can be killed, but it's very hard to hit them and the experience reward is small and the loot nonexistent, therefore, it's best to avoid them.\nThe easiest method to defeat Mephisto is to exploit his AI: the player first draws his attention by approaching slowly, then retreats to the central room that is separated from Mephisto by the pool of blood. Even though he should be perfectly capable of gliding past the pool the same way the player did, his AI, which forces him to only move in the direct direction of the player's position, does not allow him to do this. In this situation, Mephisto will not attack or casts spells (not even his Skull Missile), meaning the player can safely attack with ranged weapons or spells; Mephisto will, however, attack mercenaries and summoned minions that are near him.\nWhen Mephisto dies, a volcano erupts from his body; it doesn't do any damage, however. Now that Mephisto is dead, the player can search his room for stashes of gold. Note that he also drops his &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;: this item is needed in a quest in &lt;a href=\"The%20Harrowing\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt;. If the player doesn't pick it up, Deckard Cain will give it later. Once the player approaches the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;, a bridge made of bones and skulls should rise from the pool of blood, allowing the player to cross it, and enter the Infernal Gate to complete &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Shard of Hate&lt;/a&gt; is a Mephisto-themed &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; that was released with\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nManuscripts by Mephisto and the other Prime Evils can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Battlefields%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Battlefields of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Mephisto &lt;a href=\"Mephisto%20%28Pet%29\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; is available in the game for those who purchase the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil%20Collection\"&gt;Prime Evil Collection&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Hatred%27s%20Grasp\"&gt;Hatred's Grasp&lt;/a&gt; (Mephisto-themed wings).\nThe , based on Mephisto's soulstone, can be obtained.\nDiablo IV.\nDevelopment artwork for 1 in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" shows a figure reminiscent of Mephisto in the background.\nThe Herald of Mephisto appears in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Wolf\"&gt;Bloodied Wolf&lt;/a&gt;; a mysterious entity that shows himself to at different points of their journey. He later reveals his true identity to them, the wolf being a manifestation of Mephisto's power still residing in Sanctuary, while his true form reforms in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. In the main game, he does not play an antagonistic role, and aids the player character with the goal of defeating Lilith, claiming that while they will be enemies in the future, Lilith must be stopped at all costs.\nMephisto's essence resided in the Cathedral of Hatred, the seat of power inside his &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;. He is trapped inside a &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt;, in order to prevent Lilith from absorbing him. Despite Mephisto's essence being now contained in the soulstone, his Herald doesn't disappear. The soulstone is last seen in possession of Neyrelle, who sails towards &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;, becoming its guardian, while the Bloodied Wolf follows her.\nJust before her death, Lilith saw a glimpse of Mephisto in the cathedral, believing that in killing her, humanity was robbed of any chance of victory against her father.\nIn \"\", Mephisto continuously attempts to break Neyrelle's spirit from within the soulstone, for her to give up on her quest and release him. An empowered Herald of Mephisto is fought by The Wanderer at the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Light\"&gt;Vault of Light&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the expansion, Mephisto achieves part of his masterplan by taking control of the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt;, with the soulstone infused within his body.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nMephisto is a playable ranged assassin\u00a0hero in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\", and the second Prime Evil added in the game since &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself. His gameplay revolves around his Trait, Lord of Hatred, which decreases the cooldown of his Basic Abilities each time they deal damage. All his skills are lightning-based, most notably his signature Skull Missile. He's also able to use Lightning Nova to create a ring of electricity around him, as well Shade of Mephisto, which allows him to temporarily teleport to the clicked location and return to the original position shortly after. One of his Heroic Abilities, Consume Souls, is a global attack that hits all opponents in the battlefield, no matter where they are.\nPersonality and Traits.\nMephisto stands 20 feet (6.1 meters) tall. He possesses \"foul blood\" and his voice itself is painful for mortals to hear.\u00a0The &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; are the minions of Mephisto. \nMany claim that Mephisto is the most intelligent and cunning of the Prime Evils. There are some who believe that if there is truly a leader among the Burning Hells, it is Mephisto. There is certainly evidence that Mephisto himself believes this to be the case, declaring that \"where I am \"is\" Hell.\" \nOf the three Prime Evils, Mephisto is the most adept at sowing discord. Forever looking to instigate a skirmish, it is said that Mephisto was most adept at pitting his brothers against each other. While many demon lords rely on force to enact their will, Mephisto relies on manipulation, able to turn neighbor against neighbor for reasons that seem right and good to those who fell victim to his machinations. Diablo and Baal chafed at his manipulations, but more often than not they complied. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; speculated that this was because Mephisto provided them with ample opportunities to pursue their own ambitions. Perhaps because of this, Mephisto is seen by some to be a unifier and great tactician. It was Mephisto's greatest ambition to pit entire societies against each other, to turn brother against brother, to seed discord and distrust wherever he could. Mephisto shuns companionship, considering it \"a comfort of the wretched.\"\nMephisto views hatred as a tool, though one to be wielded with precision. That said, his hatred has a miasmic effect on wherever he goes. By the Great Enmity, his hatred was able to 'bubble up' from Hell, corrupting areas of Sanctuary. He loathes all, including the nephalem and humanity (whose suffering is his delight, and whom he considers to be lacking in both physical and mental strength). His hatred even extends so far as to despise Creation itself. However, his greatest hate is reserved for angels. Ergo, the inhabitants of Sanctuary are seen by him as weapons to be forged in his likeness and directed towards the High Heavens. However, Mephisto does appear to have some level of respect for &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, considering her aspect (hope) \"the only virtue with purpose,\" and winking at her during the pact struck at the end of the Sin War.\nMephisto's influence is so powerful that remnants of his demonic energy can corrupt everything it touches. His former host, &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;Sankekur&lt;/a&gt;, had hatred rooted deeply within him even after death, and the mere presence of his foul corpse was enough to corrupt those around him, poisoning with the deepest, blind hatred, turning brother against brother. Such is Mephisto's power that its hatred can even manifest as &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Hatred%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;physical objects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;corrupt the soil itself&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuch was Mephisto's hatred that &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;areas of Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; were tainted by it, compelling mortals to turn upon one another when entering these regions.\nLike his brothers, Mephisto, by his nature, is confrontational. He is able to use astral projection into Sanctuary, his projected form being the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Wolf\"&gt;Bloodied Wolf&lt;/a&gt;."}

In the mortal realm, the three caused widespread ruin and suffering. After centuries, the presence of the Prime Evils was discovered by the &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, who intervened. To aid the mortals, he formed the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, a brotherhood composed by the most powerful &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; in Sanctuary. Tyrael handed the Horadrim three powerful gemstones, known as &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s, which were capable of holding the vile demons' spirits. Now that humanity was equipped to combat Evil, the hunt for the Three began.\nThe Lord of Hatred, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, was the first of the three brothers to be caught and imprisoned within a soulstone. He was then entombed beneath the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt; within the temple city of &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, where the esteemed &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; watched over him. However, overtime, Mephisto's insidious power started corrupting both his soulstone and his human jailors. Ultimately, he influenced the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; priesthood to shatter his soulstone, freeing his spirit. Each of the fallen priests drove a shard of the soulstone through their left palms, with the largest shard piercing the hand of the High Priest &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;Sankekur&lt;/a&gt;. In time, Sankekur would become the mortal host for Mephisto's spirit.\nDecades later, Mephisto was defeated by a group of adventurers within his lair, the &lt;a href=\"Durance%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Durance of Hate&lt;/a&gt;, underneath &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, and his soulstone taken by the heroes. Later on it was revealed by &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; that the Prime Evils had masterminded their own exile and had allowed themselves to be bound within the soulstones. By corrupting the stones the Prime Evils could now tap into their tremendous powers (as the the stones were originally shards of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; itself). After learning about the soulstone's corruption, Tyrael ordered the stones to be destroyed. Mephisto's soulstone was then taken to the one place where it could be destroyed, the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;, where it was subsequently shattered. This act banished Mephisto's spirit back to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, presumably preventing him from ever manifesting in the mortal realm again.\nIn game.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", players can obtain Mephisto's Soulstone after defeating the Lord of Hatred within the &lt;a href=\"Durance%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Durance of Hate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; then tasks the player with destroying the soulstone in a &lt;a href=\"Hell%27s%20Forge%20%28quest%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Harrowing\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt;.

Hirelings) are a gameplay feature of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo II.\nHirelings made their debut in \"Diablo II\" as hirable mercenaries. Hirelings assist the player by attacking &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s. They follow the character and stay in a fixed radius around the character. They can be killed by monsters and can use spells and &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s as well. Like player characters, hirelings can also level-up and become slightly stronger over time. Players can only employ the services of one hireling at a time.\nEach &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt; has its own hireling, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"The%20Harrowing\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt;:\nEach hireling has a different AI script, making some run away while others engage in combat without fear. In the original, non-expansion Diablo II, Hirelings had only a limited use as they were killed easily. Once killed, that hireling would be lost forever and the player would have to hire a new one. Also, hirelings couldn't enter different acts. For instance if the player had a Rogue Archer and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, the Rogue would disappear upon entering Act II.\nIn the expansion pack, hirelings were radically improved. They came to be regarded as co-adventurers as they would now cross into other acts. They received a new stats screen, allowing the player to equip them with &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s (even &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;unique items&lt;/a&gt;) to further enhance their stats and combat potential. A slain hireling could now also be resurrected, preserving their equipment and level. Hirelings could also be healed by dragging a &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potions\"&gt;health potion&lt;/a&gt; onto the hireling's profile, or by pressing Shift and (right-clicking the potion or using belt slot hotkey).\nHireling weapons are limited to their class. Armor is mostly unlimited, with the exception that most hirelings cannot wear any &lt;a href=\"Class-specific%20Items\"&gt;Class-specific Items&lt;/a&gt;, other than the Barbarian, who can wear &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Helms\"&gt;Barbarian Helms&lt;/a&gt;, and the Rogue, which can equip &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Weapons\"&gt;Amazon Bows&lt;/a&gt;. Players can still hire a new hireling when their old one's dead. Any gear left on the old hireling will be lost, so be sure to remove their items first.\nHirelings do not possess Vitality, Mana, Energy, or Stamina, and as such, do not gain any benefits from items increasing those stats. They do benefit from extra skills, to that which their skills are native e.g. Amazon skills will increase all of a Rogue's abilities, while on a Desert Mercenary it will only increase the Jab attack.\nAct I Rogue.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt; belong to the order of the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20Of%20The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters Of The Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and can be hired from &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt; after completing the quest (players receive a free Rogue upon completing that quest) or upon reaching level 9.\nPer Level up:\nAct II Desert Mercenary.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Mercenary\"&gt;Desert Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; hail from the city of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; and serve as the town's guards. They can be hired from their captain, &lt;a href=\"Greiz\"&gt;Greiz&lt;/a&gt;.\n/ Auras:\n Auras\nPer Level up:\nAct III Iron Wolf.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; are Sorcerer-knights, and guards of the &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Docks\"&gt;Kurast Docks&lt;/a&gt;. They can be hired from &lt;a href=\"Asheara\"&gt;Asheara&lt;/a&gt;. In the original Diablo II game, the player would receive a free mercenary upon completing &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Old%20Religion%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Blade of the Old Religion (quest)&lt;/a&gt;. This was changed with the expansion, as hirelings gained the ability to travel between different Acts and can now be revived if killed (it's still possible to get a free mercenary if the player has not hired a mercenary before, or has not completed the quest back in Act I, but this is unlikely to happen).\nLightning mercenary spells: (Main Attack), and &lt;a href=\"Static%20Field\"&gt;Static Field&lt;/a&gt;\nFire mercenary spells: &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Bolt%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Fire Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ball\"&gt;Fire Ball&lt;/a&gt; (Main Attack), &lt;a href=\"Enchant\"&gt;Enchant&lt;/a&gt; (both on self and other party members)\nCold mercenary spells: &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Blast\"&gt;Ice Blast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chilling%20Armor\"&gt;Chilling Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Spike\"&gt;Glacial Spike&lt;/a&gt; (Main Attack).\nPer Level up:\nAct IV.\nThere are no new hirelings, but &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; provides resurrection services.\nAct V Barbarian.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; can be hired from &lt;a href=\"Qual-Kehk\"&gt;Qual-Kehk&lt;/a&gt; after completing the quest.\nPer Level up:\nDevelopment.\nHirelings were a late addition in the development of \"Diablo II\". Prior to version 1.13, if a hireling had an item (e.g. the weapon) that gives wielder an Aura when equipped, the Aura wouldn't be active when the hireling was resurrected. To enable it, the player would have to open the hireling screen and reequip the item.\nWhen first receiving a hireling, if the player is level 1, the hireling will be level 2. This is the only time a hireling can be a higher level than the player.\nHiring a new Hireling while you still have your old one with you will cause them to despawn along with any of the items they are wearing.\nDiablo IV.\nMercenaries were added to \"Diablo IV\" in the \"&lt;a href=\"Vessel%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Vessel of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion. Each of the mercenaries is part of a group called the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Hand\"&gt;Pale Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nWhen designing mercenaries for \"Diablo IV\", the developers wanted them to complement the game in the areas it differed from previous titles. The first consideration was to have the mercenaries operate in a manner that complement player builds. The second was that they were always useful."}

He promised to rid her of her nightmares if she disabled the wards around the temple's library. Seeking to protect her master, she knocked him out before heading to the library.

He made port runs around the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; and occasionally out to &lt;a href=\"Kingsport\"&gt;Kingsport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. He also sailed across &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s southern seas and visited many strange lands. Whenever he stopped in &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elzix\"&gt;Elzix&lt;/a&gt; offered him a free room in his inn. However, Meshif preferred the comforts of his own cabin. Similarly, he rarely frequented &lt;a href=\"Atma\"&gt;Atma&lt;/a&gt;'s establishment. &lt;a href=\"Lysander\"&gt;Lysander&lt;/a&gt; sold him many sea-sickness potions over the years, as many of his passengers didn't take well to the rocking of his ship.\nAt some point he had an encounter with an &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Caste\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLut Gholein.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, Sultan &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt; ordered Meshif to stay docked in &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; in case of emergency, as the city dealt with the appearance of &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;strange creatures&lt;/a&gt; in the desert outside the city. He obliged, though he knew that there was something that Jerhyn wasn't telling him; things in Lut Gholein didn't appear that bad to his eye. He came into contact with a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; who were persuing the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually it came to light that &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s had gained access to Lut Gholein through a portal in Jerhyn's palace, hence why he had asked Meshif to stay. The heroes were able to deal with the issue, and Jerhyn asked Meshif to wait some more, in case they needed to get out of the city. Eventually, at Jerhyn's request, he took them east to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;.\nKurast.\nMeshif sailed into Kurast, finding to his dismay that the city was being overtaken by jungle; that he had boasted of the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; on the journey to his home was a tragedy not lost on him. The heroes were able to defeat &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; however, and the jungle began to retreat. He thanked them, stating that Kurast could now begin to reclaim its former glory.\nScouring Sands.\nDecades after the events of the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; as well the aftermath against &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, an old Meshif since retired from being a ship captain and his days of adventures, and moved back to &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. he spends most of his days at the Argentek Riverbank near to Tarsarak.\nHe would be eventually visited by &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; and the wanderer hero, who would request aid to cross a harsh sandstorm on the way to &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;Elias&lt;/a&gt;' haven for &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;'s cult. He often confuses Elias for Deckard Cain, reminiscing on their adventures decades ago and never knowing what happened to the Last Horadrim.\nAfter crossing the desert and arriving at The Outer Gardens, Meshif would remain outside, hiding. However, he is killed by cultists after Lorath steals the &lt;a href=\"Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; from Elias.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nMeshif appears in acts &lt;a href=\"Act%20II%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;III&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". He takes the player from &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, bridging the two acts.\nMeshif is the sailor who takes the player from &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the latter, he trades the hero &lt;a href=\"The%20Golden%20Bird%20%28Item%29\"&gt;The Golden Bird&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Figurine\"&gt;Jade Figurine&lt;/a&gt; found in quest. In the above mentioned quest, it is shown that he owns a figurine collection which was missing the Jade Figurine, which the player gives to him.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Warriv\"&gt;Warriv&lt;/a&gt;, he does not change clothes between acts.\nDialogue.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Meshif/Dialogue\"&gt;Meshif/Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;\"\nDiablo IV.\nMeshif appears during Act III of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". He aids &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath&lt;/a&gt; and hero as a guide to cross through a sandstorm to the Outer Gardens, to find &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;Elias&lt;/a&gt;. After Meshif dies, the wanderer hero inherits his sword as a memento.\nPersonality and Traits.\nMeshif appears to be a follower of the &lt;a href=\"Skatsim\"&gt;Skatsim&lt;/a&gt; faith. He had no desire to be immortal, stating \"can you imagine having to wake up every night just to piss for the next thousand years?\" &lt;a href=\"Fara\"&gt;Fara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jerhyn\"&gt;Jerhyn&lt;/a&gt; held him in high regard.\nIn \"Diablo IV\", now an old man, he has since became a drunkard, and has gone slightly senile; when first meeting Lorath, he confuses him for &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, and continuously call him \"Deckard\" even after Lorath corrects him and states that Deckard has died. Meshif longs for his old days of adventures, and promptly agrees to help Lorath and the hero. The denizens of Tarsarak call him strange. Meshif has a camel called Isabella; after his death, Lorath takes her."}

This is one of the strongest of her spells, capable of reducing large areas to cinders. During the Vactayan uprising, a Sorceress by the name of Hepsheeba took pity on the plight of the revolutionaries, and joined their cause. During the final battle of the conflict she cast this spell to great effect, single-handedly destroying the entirety of Lord Bareen's troops and delivering the Vactayans from his tyranny. \"\nGeneral Information.\nMeteor is among the most powerful of a &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Spells\"&gt;Fire Spells&lt;/a&gt;. Combined with synergies, it is potentially one of her most powerful spells.\nOne part and one part &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ball\"&gt;Fire Ball&lt;/a&gt;, Meteor has two damage-dealing parts. When cast, a flaming target appears on the ground. After several seconds, a meteor then strikes the ground, and the impact causes a large amount of damage. From the impact site rises a patch of fire 4 yards long, and enemies that survived the strike are caught in its wake.\nDue to the amount of time it takes for Meteor to strike the ground, Meteor is a little bit difficult to master, especially when retreating from enemies. It is easiest to aim with the help of party members or &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt;, when enemies are standing still and easily at the mercy of Meteor.\nWhen combined with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Mastery\"&gt;Fire Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, good equipment, and synergies, Meteor can easily hit for over 10,000 damage. Even with minimal synergies, Meteor is extremely powerful.

{"id": "8068", "revid": "3423357", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8068", "title": "Meteorb Sorceress", "text": "The Meteorb Sorceress is a &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; build that focuses on the Meteor and Frozen Orb spells. Its name is a portmanteau on \"Meteor\" and \"Orb.\"\nThe Meteorb Sorceress has the advantage of relying on two skill trees: &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Spells\"&gt;Fire Spells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Spells\"&gt;Cold Spells&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike some other Sorceress builds that focus on only one element, making them vulnerable in mode due to increased monster immunities, the Meteorb Sorceress can often survive without help of teammates.\nHowever, the Meteorb Sorceress often takes technique to utilize correctly. Meteor has a delay before hitting, and Frozen Orb can miss enemies completely if not aimed properly. Neither are very effective \"panic buttons,\" and may not be useful in the hands of an inexperienced player. Still, with enough practice, the Meteorb sorceress can be one of the most powerful caster builds. To shore up their weakness of relying on time-delayed skills, Meteorb sorceresses can rely on Fireball as a backup. Since Fireball and Meteor have near-identical synergies, they can become very powerful on Meteorb sorceresses.\u00a0\nMeteorb builds have precious few superfluous skill points to spend: maximizing Meteor's power requires investing in Fire Bolt, Fireball, Meteor, and Fire Mastery--a total of eighty points, not counting other prerequisites. Frozen Orb and its prerequisites require an additional twenty five points. While some sorceress builds have the luxury of investing many points into utility skills such as &lt;a href=\"Warmth\"&gt;Warmth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Shield\"&gt;Energy Shield&lt;/a&gt;, every point spent this way on a Meteorb sorceress reduces her damage potential.\u00a0\nMeteorb Sorceresses are slightly harder to equip than others. Since they specialize in two separate skill trees, finding equipment that gives + to all skills is probably most prudent; however, depending on personal tastes, one could favor either Frozen Orb or Meteor over the other.\nSkill Point Allocation.\nMain skills:\nUtility Skills:\nPrerequisites:\nSkills.\nFrozen Orb and Meteor are the staple damage dealers for this build. Meteor requires putting points into three other fire skills to maximize its damage potential, making it very skill point-hungry. This leaves precious little for Frozen Orb, which is why only one point is put into its only synergy, Ice Bolt. Ice Bolt only minimally increases the damage of Frozen Orb regardless.\nFire Ball is a very powerful skill in its own right, and can out-damage Meteor at higher levels. It benefits more from Firebolt than Fire Mastery, so if using Fire Ball instead of Meteor, allocating points in Firebolt is a better option than Fire Mastery. However at least one point in all the mentioned skills is useful to take advantage of items that give +skills.\nCold Mastery reaches -100% enemy cold resistance at level 17, which is plenty for most non-immunes even in Hell. With enough +skill items, a minimal amount of points can be put into this skill to make it effective. A mercenary or party member providing the &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; aura can further reduce the need to put points in this skill.\nMana depletion is a constant problem in the early game, but in the late game it quickly stops being an issue because Frozen Orb and Meteor both consume mana slowly. In the early game, a point into &lt;a href=\"Warmth\"&gt;Warmth&lt;/a&gt; may be useful, but it isn't essential in the late game.\nEquipment.\nAny equipment that grants +skills, FCR, resistance, stats, life/mana, damage reduction %, cold skill damage and reduction to enemy fire resistance are useful.\nThe best equipment for a Meteorb Sorceress is &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha%27s%20Wrappings\"&gt;Tal Rasha's Wrappings&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the rare and powerful increase to cold damage mod and the reduction to enemy fire resistance.\nAs with many other sorceress builds, Cannot be Frozen and FR/W is not particularly useful as late-game sorceresses mainly rely on Teleport to move and being frozen does not slow casting speed.\u00a0\nWealthy sorceresses benefit greatly from having a &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20Arms\"&gt;Call to Arms&lt;/a&gt; on switch, to bolster their meager maximum health.\nHireling.\nA tanky mercenary is excellent for distracting monsters long enough for meteors to fall on them. Act II mercenaries can be equipped with a variety of weapons that grant them potent auras, such as &lt;a href=\"Infinity%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Infinity's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; aura.\nViable Areas.\nThere are very few areas in \"Diablo II\" heavily populated by monsters that are both fire and cold immune. Meteorb sorceresses can therefore run practically any area on Hell difficulty, though her frailty may make areas such as the Worldstone Keep dangerous."}

This set can only drop at\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0difficulty.\nWhile anyone is not prohibited from making use of the items that make up the set, if anyone is to even receive its bonuses, the bearer must be a Barbarian.\nPieces.\nThe set consists of six pieces, all of which are required to complete the set. None of them are Barbarian-restricted.\nSet Bonus:\nFor the first bonus, spending Fury by any means reduces the remaining cooldown; this Fury does not have to be spent in a single use, and may even be spent within unlimited time to count towards the reduction. However, it must be actually consumed by skills, not drained away when out of combat. For Avalanche, the cooldown is reduced twice: for its own in-built Fury reduction, and that of the set.\nThe second bonus\u00a0only\u00a0creates an Earthquake at the landing zone (even with the use of the Launch rune for Leap). This Earthquake fully benefits from all runes and enhancements the Barbarian might have. Also note that multiple Earthquakes in the same area \"do\u00a0\"stack, unlike most area damage skills.\nIf this set coupled with a pair of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Socks\"&gt;Lut Socks&lt;/a&gt;, four Earthquakes may be summoned at once. Leap will also provide the Barbarian with a total of 10 seconds of enhanced protection after this sequence ends. For extra casts of Avalanche and Earthquake, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Tribes\"&gt;Blade of the Tribes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Iron\"&gt;Dread Iron&lt;/a&gt; can be used.\nThe last bonus is multiplicative to other damage enhancements. For Ancient Spear, Boulder Toss rune is an intended choice for MoE-centered build, due to its ability to consume Fury.\nOne may sacrifice a portion of damage and focus on &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; damage instead of &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, using Earthquake with the Chilling Earth rune. It allows keeping enemies &lt;a href=\"Frozen\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt; consecutively. Also, using the &lt;a href=\"Rimeheart\"&gt;Rimeheart&lt;/a&gt; with this build leads to a lethal combination.\n&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Spear\"&gt;Boulder Toss&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Seismic%20Slam\"&gt;Rumble&lt;/a&gt; may be good optional additions to this set, as they instantly consume all Fury accumulated by the character, effectively triggering the first bonus.\nDevelopment.\nOriginal (pre-2.4) bonus of this set was different:\nThe latter bonus\u00a0only\u00a0created an Earthquake at the landing zone (even with the use of the Launch rune for Leap). This Earthquake fully benefited from all runes and enhancements the Barbarian might have had."}

He could almost always be seen with at least two of them on either side waiting for his command. When they attacked, it was with such force that a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; might feel like they was hit by twenty fists and not just four. These beasts like to snap the neck of their prey with a single strike, dragging them off to eat for a future meal.\nIn-game.\nMinions of Destruction are only found in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Throne of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Lister%20the%20Tormentor\"&gt;Lister the Tormentor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey can, unlike the similarly &lt;a href=\"Council%20Member\"&gt;boss-only monsters&lt;/a&gt;, regenerate their health and therefore, are one of the deadliest enemies to fight against (and possibly the MOST dangerous save for bosses) in the entire game.\nTips and Other Additional Information.\nMinions of Destruction are considered among the strongest enemies in game and they can be a serious threat on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell (difficulty)&lt;/a&gt; with their ability to &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;. Since they are the last wave of minions to fight before confronting &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, and usually don't leave any items except &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, many players would avoid fighting Minions. A good and efficient trick is to lure them to the lower part of the level, anywhere where &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; can't see them. A great place to lure them would be the doors where the hero entered the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Throne of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;. Once this is done, simply outrun them and return to the Throne where Baal is. Baal will start laughing and he will enter the portal and the game will act like the player has killed all Minions of Destruction.\u00a0If you would rather kill them, guerrilla tactics are your best bet - attempting to kill them in front of Baal is suicidal, as he will cast &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt; on you, slowing you down and weakening your resistance to Physical damage enough that even a fully equipped tank would be hard-pressed to survive, let alone kill the monsters. Lure the Minions away from the Throne where Baal can't aid them- only then will your battle show signs of progress in an efficient timeframe. If you cannot do so, you can always use potions during the brawl: it's always wise to buy at least ten bottles of super healing and mana potions, or merge both into super rejuvenation potions."}

Haedrig would later wonder if Mira had known what her future held, and had willingly led herself to her doom, in order to get Haedrig to a place where he could aid &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nRisen.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; besieged &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, she tended the wounded. However, she was bitten, and became noticably ill. It was realized that she had become infected. She was thus thrown into a cellar with people likewise afflicted.

He has a thin mousy face, and his skin is extremely pale. Blind, his eyes are stark white, and (something that he can't control). Red veins are visible all around them, as if his face has been slashed numerous times. His stamina is poor.\nBiography.\nMiskha was born c. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231275\"&gt;1275&lt;/a&gt;; the son of a &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarch&lt;/a&gt; and a concubine. He was born with deformities, but his mother convinced his father to sequester him in the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Sky%20Monastery\"&gt;Floating Sky Monastery&lt;/a&gt; rather than killing him. His mother would often play \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Trickster%20of%20the%20Moss%20Barrows\"&gt;The Trickster of the Moss Barrows&lt;/a&gt;\" for him. She also told him that those who claimed he was cursed for weeping blood were fools.\nMishka lived in isolation until the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;, causing paronoia to sweep &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, Mishka's father ordered that his son be put to death, lest his purity be called into question. Thus, through the work of his mother and a few loyal servants, Mishka was carried into the &lt;a href=\"Gorgorra\"&gt;Gorgorra&lt;/a&gt;. However, the caravan was attacked. Mishka's mother told him to flee, telling him that she would play a song on her flute when it was safe. Days passed, and he heard no sound. In truth, his mother and the servants were dead. \nZhota came across the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;y scene, and picked up Mishka's flute. Playing a few notes, Mishka reacted in the nearby bushes, catching Zhota's attention. Zhota easily caught him. Zhota purified the bodies of the fallen, and Mishka remained silent for the next few days, though one night, whispered \"mother\" in his sleep. He tried to escape on several occassions, but Zhota bound his hands. Mishka's slow pace slowed Zhota's progress to a crawl, and he began taunting the boy, calling him \"&lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; child.\" Eventually, Mishka exclaimed that he wasn't a demon. He further claimed that he couldn't trust Zhota, as he'd \"played the wrong song.\" Zhota told Mishka that he wasn't responsible for his mother's death. Mishka wasn't put at ease however, as he believed that the demon that had killed his mother was still out there.\nAfter five days of travelling, and passing through numerous empty villages, the pair finally exchanged their names. Mishka also began to play \"Trickster\", much to Zhota's annoyance. Nevertheless, Zhota's demenour had softened towards the boy, and had begun to carry him for periods of time. That night, they were confronted by a group of brigands. They claimed that the Patriarchs had hired their services in lending aid to the people of the Gorgorra. Specifically, one of Zhota's fellow Monks had told them of a demon that wore the face of a blind child, and had \"hair as white as snow.\" Mishka cried, claiming that he wasn't a demon, but his tears of blood were all the proof that the brigands needed that he was cursed, if not outright demonic. Zhota told the men that he would see the Monk that had entrusted them to this task, and refused to pay them anything. This led to blows, but Zhota easily defeated the brigands. He demanded to know why a demon was after Mishka. The boy explained that his father had sent it, and told Zhota the story of his origins.\nThe next day, Zhota found the Monk the brigands were referring to\u2014&lt;a href=\"Akyev\"&gt;Akyev&lt;/a&gt;, who likewise maintained that Mishka was a demon in the form of a child. Mishka reacted hysterically, calling Akyev the demon. Zhota recounted Mishka's tale to Akyev, telling him that he believed the child. Akyev was less inclined to believe Mishka's story than that of the Patriarchs (who had ordered him to hunt the \"demon\" down), and attacked Zhota, telling him that if he killed Mishka himself, his transgressions would be forgiven. In the fight, the head of Mishka's mother spilled out of Akyev's bag, confirming that Akyev was the \"demon\" that had killed Mishka's fellows. After a grueling fight, Zhota felled Akyev.\nAfter awhile, Mishka played a tune again. Zhota told him that the \"demon\" who had killed his mother was no such thing, but he was dead nonetheless. He unbound Mishka and took him to his mother's head, giving him a chance to say goodbye. Mishka refused, simply stating \"I don't need to. I have the song.\" With that, Zhota led Mishka to Ivgorod, determined to reveal the truth of what had happened."}

Note that\u00a0missiles are\u00a0\"not\" a synonym to ranged attacks.\nDiablo I.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;, most ranged attacks and spells are projectiles, including arrows. They need to directly hit their target in order to have any effect, therefore casting a spell or making a shot also requires some degree of accuracy, especially against moving targets. Most obstacles, including allies, between the player and the target, will block any and all missiles (bar grates being a notable exception). Monsters, however, can shoot through allies without harming them.\nDiablo II.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, Missiles are any non-magical (that is, &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt;) projectiles, including &lt;a href=\"arrows\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bolts\"&gt;bolts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Weapons\"&gt;thrown weapons&lt;/a&gt;. This term is used in reference to &lt;a href=\"Missile%20Weapon\"&gt;Missile Weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, and when an item has a &lt;a href=\"Defense%20vs.%20Missile\"&gt;Defense vs. Missile&lt;/a&gt; bonus. Magical missiles bypass this extra protection.\nDiablo III.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, any solid projectile (regardless of damage type) that has a distinct speed and linear trajectory counts as a missile. Their main distinction from other ranged attacks is the fact that once released, the missile flies forward (some can home on the target if needed, or otherwise change trajectory), hitting the first enemy target that happens to be in its way. Hitting a solid wall usually causes missiles to stop immediately, and allies are ignored for this purpose (missiles pass through them harmlessly).\nSome missiles are &lt;a href=\"piercing\"&gt;piercing&lt;/a&gt;, and once they hit the first target, they continue to move in the same direction, potentially hitting more than one enemy standing in a line. Some of them can even bypass obstacles. Other missiles explode on impact, disappearing and hitting all enemies within a certain radius.\nSome skills, like &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Torrent\"&gt;Arcane Torrent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firebats\"&gt;Firebats&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cluster%20Arrow\"&gt;Cluster Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, are not missiles, even though graphically they may be depicted as such. Such skills are dubbed\u00a0torrents, as they create a stream that reaches the destination point, bypassing most or all types of obstacles in its path. They are not affected by special effects that alter the missiles' behavior. Even if they create just one single blast, they are still not missiles. Same goes for Mortar monster affix and monster attacks like &lt;a href=\"Lacuni%20Huntress\"&gt;Lacuni Huntress&lt;/a&gt; grenades or &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt; firebombs.\nSkills like &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heaven%27s%20Fury\"&gt;Fires of Heaven&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ray%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Ray of Frost&lt;/a&gt; also do not count as missiles, and are instead dubbed\u00a0beams. They reach their target instantly, but stop if they hit a solid wall, and normally hit the first enemy in their path. Piercing beams hit all enemies in line, instantly reaching their maximum length.\nThe easiest way to determine whether or not an attack is a missile is to check if it is slowed by &lt;a href=\"Missile%20Dampening\"&gt;Missile Dampening&lt;/a&gt; monster affix and &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; skill."}

{"id": "39300", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=39300", "title": "Abbot", "text": "An Abbot is an unusual PvM build, focusing on high &lt;a href=\"Damage%20reduction%23Damage_Reduced_By_.28integer.29\"&gt;Damage Reduced By X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;, and healing from &lt;a href=\"Prayer\"&gt;Prayer&lt;/a&gt;. The equipment needed for this build is very cheap, can generally be gambled easily or even shopped by a high-level character, but might be difficult to pull off untwinked. It is good for party play, where the Abbot serves as the party's tank while the rest of the party kills monsters; in solo play, Abbots kill slowly, but you can leave the Abbot in the middle of a mob, go prepare a sandwich, and come back and continue slowly killing monsters (but note that the mob may damage your worn equipment, so you can't leave for more than 10 minutes or so).\nEquipment.\nThe defining property used by Abbot is Damage Reduced By X. This property is primarily acquired on three possible slots:\nWith the above slots and some luck on the suffixes, &lt;a href=\"Jeweler%27s\"&gt;Jeweler's&lt;/a&gt; prefixes on the Helm and Armor filled with Sol Runes, you can easily exceed a total of damage reduced by 100 or more. For reference even Hell minotaurs will deal up to around 120 damage; this is roughly equivalent to getting 83% damage reduction, which is the entire reason why pumping Damage Reduced By X is a fairly good strategy. Yes, monsters deal only relatively small amounts of physical damage.\nThere are really only 3 things an Abbot needs on non-weapon equipment:\nYour endgame target for Damage Reduced By X is to get at least Damage Reduced By 90. More is always better, but if you can achieve &gt; 90 in your Helm, Armor, and Amulet, you might want to get resistances and +skills from a rare shield instead of trying to push more Sol Runes in a magical Jeweler's shield Of Amicae. You could socket &lt;a href=\"Um%20Rune\"&gt;Um Rune&lt;/a&gt;s or Perfect Diamonds in a +skills shield as well, instead of putting Sol Runes on the shield. Or you could eschew a shield and use a 2-handed weapon, because your damage is not that high due to your primary focus on defense.\nTry to get resistances and +Skills on the prefix of the amulet slot. You might be able to get by with one less Sol Rune in your Circlet by finding a nice magical Circlet Of &lt;a href=\"Life%20Everlasting\"&gt;Life Everlasting&lt;/a&gt; with a good resistance or +skills prefix, then punching two holes in it at &lt;a href=\"Larzuk\"&gt;Larzuk&lt;/a&gt;. Half of the Paladin-only shields will have +all resistances, and you might get a nice magic &lt;a href=\"Jeweler%27s\"&gt;Jeweler's&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Amicae\"&gt;Amicae&lt;/a&gt;, or one with further resistance or +skills prefix, or a good rare shield.\nDamage Reduced By X is the hardest property among the above 3 properties to get: you can get + Defense Auras in Grand Charms, +skills on unique rings, and resistances in random rare equipment and charms and rings, but the high amounts of Damage Reduced By X are most easily gotten on the amulet, armor, helm, and shield slots. So generally you will plan your build around what you can acquire for those slots.\nA nice Jeweler's armor Of Amicae can be bought from a shop by a level 51 or higher character. You can gamble the circlet and amulet, and if you have a good supply of perfect gems you can try cubing magical circlets and amulets until you get properties you want.\nThe hardest piece of equipment would be the weapon. Because you will be mostly focused on defense, and nearly all the Paladin combat skills hurt exactly one target (except &lt;a href=\"Zeal\"&gt;Zeal&lt;/a&gt;, but the requirements for a good Zeal weapon are pretty stringent and you will not have &lt;a href=\"Fanaticism\"&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt; to help your damage and speed). Try to find the best DPS one-handed weapon.\nProperties You Don't Need.\nThe Abbot is about reducing incoming damage and then healing any damage it received, but the properties below, while they help with these, simply do \"not\" help enough and you are better off getting +skills, resist, or Damage Reduced By X instead:\nSkills.\nAbbots primarily focus on the &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Auras\"&gt;Defensive Auras&lt;/a&gt; tree, and select one &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Skills%20%28Paladin%29\"&gt;Combat Skill&lt;/a&gt; for offense, usually &lt;a href=\"Vengeance\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat Skills.\nYou will probably use &lt;a href=\"Vengeance\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, because you will be boosting Resist Fire and Resist Lightning, and will probably put any spare points in Resist Cold and Salvation, all of which are synergies of Vengeance.\nYou could use &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Hammer\"&gt;Blessed Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, which at least deals damage to many opponents, but you will not be using Concentration, and you are unlikely to want to put points in Vigor (you need to max Resist Fire and Lightning as well, so spare points in Vigor will be hard to come by).\nMercenary.\nNormal Act II Combat mercenary, which will provide its own Prayer for a mild boost of healing on top of your Meditation. You could try a Nightmare Act II Offensive for some damage bonus, or a Nightmare Act II Defense to further reduce incoming damage rather than improve your healing.\nTry giving the mercenary some Damage Reduced By X circlets and armor as well; you could give it equipment you have replaced. Getting 70 to 80 Damage Reduced By X will be possible if the mercenary helm and armor is similar to yours."}

Hailing from &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, he traveled all over &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, writing many tomes on the lands and peoples he encountered in his journey. It was a journey that resulted in his capture and subsequent release.\nBiography.\nYouth.\nAt some point in his youth, al-Hazir had an unfortunate encounter with &lt;a href=\"scavenger\"&gt;scavenger&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTravincal.\nAt some point, al-Hazir visited &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt;. On his first day in the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zhou\"&gt;Zhou&lt;/a&gt;, he was robbed and left for dead, but managed to survive the experience. During his travels through the nation he crossed paths with &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Burroughs\"&gt;Franklin Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;, who would stay his friend. He would later recount his experiences in the \"&lt;a href=\"Xiansai%20Chronicles\"&gt;Xiansai Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOn a separate occassion, al-Hazir visited the ruins of the temple city of &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;. While exploring one of the long-abandoned temples, he was drawn by the flickering of faint torchlight through a distant doorway. As he crept nearer, he heard the sound of a voice, which he discovered belonged to an &lt;a href=\"Archivist\"&gt;Archivist&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeparture from Caldeum.\nA resident of Caldeum, al-Hazir was forced to look on as the city began its decline. In his mind, it began when nobles fleeing &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; (the result of the carnage &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; unleashed) entered the city and demanded a place on its &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Consortium%20Council\"&gt;Trade Consortium Council&lt;/a&gt;. Caldeum's &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20I\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt; was able to rectify the situation, but when the emperor became ill and his &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; took control of the throne, the decline continued.\nAbd al-Hazir decided to leave the city and set out on a journey, to gather the world's knowledge together in &lt;a href=\"Writings%20of%20Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;one tome&lt;/a&gt;. While he was preparing, he received news that a &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Thresher\"&gt;Dune Thresher&lt;/a&gt; had killed a citizen just outside the city. Thus, he contacted his old friend Franklin Burroughs so that he could take part in his quest to rid Caldeum of the burrowing nightmare. Burroughs was reluctant at first, but al-Hazir could tell it was an act and soon, they headed out to find their foe.\nEncounter with Burrowing Death.\nal-Hazir met Burroughs at dusk, at the sandy rocks that ringed that &lt;a href=\"Tardin%20Wastes\"&gt;Tardin Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. There, Burroughs showed him the corpse of an unfortunate soul who had been attacked by a thresher, clinging to the rocks. It was a grisly sight and he was treated to more unpleasantness, as Burroughs used &lt;a href=\"scavenger\"&gt;scavenger&lt;/a&gt;s to lure the thresher out. The thresher's maw closed around them, but they ended up eating it apart from the inside, killing the thresher, but they themselves dying due to its digestive juices. A delighted Burroughs engaged in a lecture about the properties of dune threshers while al-Hazir nodded weakly and wondered when he could head home and crawl into bed.\nTeganze.\nal-Hazir headed east, entering the &lt;a href=\"Torajan%20Jungles\"&gt;Torajan Jungles&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Teganze\"&gt;Teganze&lt;/a&gt;. Translating ancient carvings, he learnt of the origins of the &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; and came into contact with the &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; themselves. He interacted with the people of the &lt;a href=\"Tribe%20of%20the%20Five%20Hills\"&gt;Tribe of the Five Hills&lt;/a&gt;, who were currently engaged in a ritual war with the tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20of%20the%20Seven%20Stones\"&gt;Seven Stones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tribe%20of%20the%20Shrouded%20Valley\"&gt;Shrouded Valley&lt;/a&gt;. He learnt what he could of his beliefs and their culture, but due to the social upheaval they were experiencing, he had to leave.\nNew Tristram.\nHeading west, al-Hazir entered &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, arriving at the town of &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. He had heard the tales of the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt; at the hand of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, but found the settlement that had grown near the old town's ruins to be quite dreary. He explored the ruins of old Tristram, but could not bring himself to enter the town's &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. He learnt what he could of the cathedral from an adventurer who had entered it two decades ago Before leaving the town, he was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, who told him of the tomes that lay within the cathedral. al-Hazir decided to take his word for it, for he had no intention of entering the structure.\nThe Festering Woods.\nal-Hazir traveled to &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to find a guide to take him into the &lt;a href=\"Festering%20Woods\"&gt;Festering Woods&lt;/a&gt; so he could observe the &lt;a href=\"Gnarled%20Walker\"&gt;Gnarled Walker&lt;/a&gt;s that inhabited it. However, the few people he encountered in the town were unwilling to answer his inquiries. As he wandered throughout the town, he noticed that the bridge that led into the woods had been destroyed. It was another point the townsfolk refused to elaborate on. He found it odd that only elderly people seemed to inhabit the village, with the exception of a beautiful young girl, whose father insisted that al-Hazir stay away from. He introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20DeSoto\"&gt;Pablo DeSoto&lt;/a&gt;, and told al-Hazir of the Festering Woods and the rationale behind its namesake. He blamed the woods' dark nature on the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, and expressed the belief that they had played a role in the Darkening of Tristram as well. Unsure about the truth of the matter, al-Hazir found himself greatful that he hadn't found a guide to take him into the woods\u2014they seemed better suited to those of a more adventurous temprement.\nBastion's Keep and Ivgorod.\nal-Hazir traveled to &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Standing on the ramparts, he had come to see the legendary s of the north, but only beheld the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Crater\"&gt;Arreat Crater&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote on what he knew of the Barbarians, of their vigil, and of the destruction of their &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;. He reflected that if any Barbarians still lived, they would be without hope.\nBy the time al-Hazir reached &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, winter was starting to come. Taking refuge in a tavern, he encountered a &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;. al-Hazir gingerly approached the man and was welcomed. Food was provided, but al-Hazir touched little of it, as he was more intent on learning what he could of the Monk's life. The man told him of the &lt;a href=\"Sahptev\"&gt;Sahptev&lt;/a&gt; faith and of his fighting style, claiming that his mind and body were the weapons he used. These were 'weapons' that the Monk put to good use against some thugs who entered the tavern. The Monk easily defeated them, and revealed one of their number as a demon before killing it.\nThe Demon Hunters.\nal-Hazir traveled to the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;. He later headed for the village of &lt;a href=\"Bronn\"&gt;Bronn&lt;/a&gt;, but found that most of the buildings had been burnt to the ground, with bodies strewn everywhere. From the town's inn, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Berserker\"&gt;gray-skinned creatures&lt;/a&gt; charged forth, intent on adding al-Hazir to their bodycount. Frozen in terror, al-Hazir let one of them grab him before he was saved by the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Valla\"&gt;Valla&lt;/a&gt;. With her &lt;a href=\"crossbows\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt; she laid waste to the demons. That night, she told al-Hazir about her life, how demons had laid waste to her village, and how she had survived and joined the Demon Hunters to take vengeance. Each and every Demon Hunter, she said, had a story like this.\nThe Unburied.\nal-Hazir returned to New Tristram. A few days out of town, he saw a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;falling star&lt;/a&gt; soaring across the sky. He could sense that something was wrong, and coming across a badly mangled traveler, his fears were confirmed. Before the man passed away, he referred to his killer as an \"&lt;a href=\"Unburied\"&gt;Unburied&lt;/a&gt;,\" and how he and his fellow guardsmen had succeeded in felling the beast.\nWestmarch.\n\"Note: The following events aren't necessarily in chronological order.\"\nAround this time, al-Hazir apparently entered Westmarch, with a temporary assistant. They encoutered various creatures on their travels. While searching for a &lt;a href=\"Maggot%20Brood\"&gt;Maggot Brood&lt;/a&gt;, they observed the corpse of one near the road to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. His new assistant vomited twice due to the smell, said vomit ending up on al-Hazir's traveling cloak. The stains came out eventually, but he was sorely vexed.\nHe had a low opinion of his assistant due to his incessant noise, and that was added to when they came across a &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Bat\"&gt;Terror Bat&lt;/a&gt;. His assistant screamed loudly\u2014enough to give al-Hazir a headache.\nal-Hazir and his assistant took shelter in the caves outside Westmarch, with the intent of organizing al-Hazir's records. However, &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Bat\"&gt;Vile Bat&lt;/a&gt;s appeared and tore several of the scrolls to pieces, much to al-Hazir's lament.\nal-Hazir planned to explore the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Corvus\"&gt;Ruins of Corvus&lt;/a&gt;, but then discovered they were filled with s. Of course, he claimed, such creatures didn't frighten him, but they made his research too time consuming.\nThe Coven.\nBack in Khanduras, al-Hazir traveled through a forest near Tristram. Finding the darkness of the night oppressive, he saw a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; crackling in the gloom. Heading towards the source of the light, he felt a sense of overwhelming dread, and heard the sound of chanting. Checking himself, he didn't head straight towards the fire, but instead sought a vantage point to observe the proceedings. Before him was a collection of &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;cultists&lt;/a&gt;, arrayed in a circle. While he had heard of these cultists before, this was the first time he had seen them himself. As he watched them chant on, he thought to leave, but then saw a pale supplicant being drawn forward, and was compelled to stay and watch. The supplicant knelt in the center, and the cultists' leader stepped forward, before drawing out a spike that he rammed into the supplicant's back. al-Hazir almost screamed, but the supplicant made no sound. As the leader readied another spike, al-Hazir couldn't stand it any longer. He broke into a run, running as hard as he could, as long as he could, until he could do no so longer. As soon as he was able, he staggered to his feet, and ran some more.\nReturning home, al-Hazir began to research the cultists in an effort to ease his mind, to assure him that what he had seen hadn't actually happened. And yet, every whispered, frightened tale served to confirm his fears. Then, one morning, he saw a bloody, curved knife stabbed into his door. He had been marked.\nThe Ruins of Sescheron.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, late in the year, al-Hazir was abducted by the Coven: they discovered him observing their rituals. He even befriended one of the cultists, &lt;a href=\"Kalvesan\"&gt;Kalvesan&lt;/a&gt;, by constantly pleading for his life, and eventually escaped, his friend sacrificing himself to buy al-Hazir time to flee to safety. The freedom was very brief, though, as soon afterwards, al-Hazir has been recaptured by &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Clan\"&gt;Ice Clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt;. He was thus imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was rescued by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and taken to &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, promising to write books about the heroes to return the favor.\nIn-game.\nNumerous logs from al-Hazir can be found throughout \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". Most beastiary, history and location entries are narrated by him.\nAs of patch 2.3.0, al-Hazir appears in the game's &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, and can be found in &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Sescheron\"&gt;Ruins of Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; in . His rescue is the goal of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Return%20of%20Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;The Return of Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt; .\nOnce rescued, he will accompany the Nephalem for the rest of their exploration of Sescheron, commenting on history, &lt;a href=\"Kanai\"&gt;Kanai&lt;/a&gt;'s fate and some other issues. He cannot be killed, and does not attack. Upon returning to the Keep, he leaves and is on his way.\n is mentioned in the flavor-text of some &lt;a href=\"legendary\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; equipment in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nJudging by his journal entries, al-Hazir was often quite dismissive of the more supernatural and spectacular aspects of Sanctuary and the Burning Hells, often dismissing tales of demons and monsters as fabrications and/or exaggerations. However, some threats he treated with due credit, such as the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and that of uncontrolled use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbd al-Hazir has been repeatedly compared to famous historians and philosophers such as &lt;a href=\"Brast\"&gt;Brast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lysra\"&gt;Lysra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jeram\"&gt;Jeram&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Valthek\"&gt;Valthek&lt;/a&gt; by his readers, yet he himself (as he said, out of modesty, humility and honesty) rejected such comparison.\nal-Hazir was accompanied by a number of assistants over his travels. In his mind, he paid them quite generously."}

{"id": "7481", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7481", "title": "Absorption", "text": "Absorption and Absorption Shields are effects where a portion of &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; that would've been taken by a character is not deducted from the character's &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; total, but is instead turned into healing or deducted from a shield. Absorption can be considered a special form of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt;, where the negated damage has an additional effect or consequence.\nAbsorption types.\nThere are two main varieties of absorption, which are quite different:\nAside from these \"true\" absorption effects, there is an &lt;a href=\"Suffix%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;item suffix&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Rune\"&gt;Skill Rune&lt;/a&gt; (for &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Armor\"&gt;Energy Armor&lt;/a&gt;) called \"Absorption\", although neither causes \"true\" absorption - the former causes straight &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt;, and the latter functions like the \"&lt;a href=\"Vulpine\"&gt;Damage taken Goes to Mana&lt;/a&gt;\" item . Some &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; skills use \"absorb\" informally to describe their effects, but they do not do anything with the \"absorbed\" damage.\nHealing absorption.\nCertain items absorb damage and turn some or all of that damage into healing. These effects usually apply only to one type or &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt; of damage. In \"Diablo II\", only part of the damage is absorbed, creating a net effect of simply reducing the damage even further than other defenses do. In \"Diablo III\", all damage is prevented, but only a portion of it is turned to healing, and the power is only found on one series of &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"amulets\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", damage absorption heals the user by a certain amount of damage before they take damage from the rest of the hit. This effectively makes absorption equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; by an amount \"twice\" the absorption amount - once for the damage reduced by absorption, and again for the subsequent damage that is \"cancelled out\" by the healing of the absorption effect.\nAbsorption appears as a &lt;a href=\"special%20modifier\"&gt;special modifier&lt;/a&gt; on some &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique Items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt;. There are two types of absorption modifiers: one that reduces damage by a specific \"number\" of hit points (e.g., \"+15 Fire Absorb\" on ), and one that reduces damage by a specific \"percentage\" (e.g., \"Cold Absorb 20%\", as found on ).\nThe value of absorption modifiers varies greatly due to how damage is inflicted:\nAbsorbing &lt;a href=\"lightning%20%28damage%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage is the most useful since lightning tends to hit in multiple small bolts. Ten points of lightning absorb can completely neutralize a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Enchanted\"&gt;Lightning Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; boss, if it's emitting dozens of 6-8 damage charges. In contrast, ten points of &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; absorb, even after healing, would make hardly any difference against a 500 damage &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbsorb Magic Damage modifiers work against all types of non-physical damage.\nAbsorb Damage modifiers are very useful against elemental attacks, especially multiple small damage hits, such as those from &lt;a href=\"Council%20Member\"&gt;Council Member&lt;/a&gt;s' s or &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Demon\"&gt;Scarab Demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAbsorb X% Damage modifiers are most useful against fierce elemental damage monsters.\nCalculating Absorption.\nAbsorption is calculated as follows:\nExample: A player with and 75% Cold Resistance takes 400 hit points of cold damage. The 75% resistance takes the damage down to 100 HP. The Cold Absorb takes 20% of that figure off, leaving 80 HP, and then those 20 HP are converted to healing, leaving a final damage of just 60 HP.\nAs a result of the formula, the effective damage reduction from Absorb is \"twice\" the listed amount: Raven Frost, for example, reduces cold damage by 40 percent.\nThe maximum effective percentage absorb that has any effect is 40%.\nDiablo III.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" combines &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;Immunity&lt;/a&gt; with Absorption in the form of five &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"amulets\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt; which each absorb \"all\" damage of an &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; type, and convert a low-medium percentage of that to healing. The amulets are: (Poison), (Fire), (Lightning), (Arcane/Holy) and (Cold).\nAbsorption shields.\nThe shielding form of absorption was introduced with the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Shield\"&gt;Mana Shield&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in the original \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\", which consumes &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; to absorb \"all\" damage that would be taken until the Mana runs out, at a 3 damage : 2 mana ratio. The \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" has the successor skill, &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Shield\"&gt;Energy Shield&lt;/a&gt;, which absorbs a medium percentage of incoming damage (increasing by skill level) by consuming mana, at a 1 damage : 2 mana ratio which can be improved by &lt;a href=\"synergy\"&gt;synergy&lt;/a&gt; with . Energy Shield does not apply &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; to the damage absorbed by mana, only to the remaining damage.\n\"Diablo II\" also introduced for the , which does not drain &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;s per damage taken but instead absorbs &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; damage up to a set limit, scaling with skill level, and refreshable by re-casting the spell. After the shield is exhausted, further damage applies to &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; normally. This model of shields with a set capacity was expanded heavily by \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" with several new &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;. In that game, other defenses are applied to the damage before it hits the shield, allowing shield effects to scale well. Ironically, the new skill does not provide absorption shields anymore.\nNote that absorption, unlike complete &lt;a href=\"immunity\"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt;, does \"not\" protect from secondary effects of an attack; that is, all effects other than damage will apply as normal. Moreover, for all effects that trigger on a damaging hit, even a fully absorbed attack still counts as taking or inflicting damage.\nDiablo III.\nThe third game offers absorb shields from many sources. However, their capacity is limited, so much like &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; itself, they are best combined with increased &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Resistances&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; effects. Some skills calculate the amount of damage absorbed based on the character's maximum &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, while others use a fixed amount, often increased by the character's secondary &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; stats. They usually apply to all damage, not just one type.\nSources of absorption shields (including &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Rune\"&gt;Skill Rune&lt;/a&gt;s):"}

They are mystic seals, placed all over &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, supposedly to protect it from the prying eyes of both &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Over time,a curse fell upon most of the towers and they were lost.\nThere are over a hundred scattered all over Sanctuary, with most located in the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Swamplands\"&gt;Swamplands&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecent History.\nc. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, they were unearthed, each exuding an aura of power. The first tower was unearthed on an &lt;a href=\"Bygone%20Islet\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; beyond the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Gulf of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. As artifacts were uncovered and returned to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, whispers of nightmares started to spread, and a request was made for more workers. The dig advanced ahead of schedule, but rumors of nightmares and hallucinations grew among the workers. The dig quickly became a test of wills, one that the workers 'won,' in a sense, as the tower stood revealed. However, claims spread of workers returning with their minds torn.\nThe tower in the Gulf was not the only tower that stood revealed. Sanctuary's denizens desired to claim the powers for themselves, but did not know how to do so. The &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt; were among the factions that fought for control of the towers, and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; also sought to control them.\nGameplay.\nAccursed Towers is features both PvE and PvP gameplay. Clans will compete to claim ownership of towers, thereby providing powerful bonuses to all clan members and the opportunity to acquire new &lt;a href=\"cursed%20item\"&gt;cursed item&lt;/a&gt;s. Players must be in a clan to participate in the mode.\nThe Towers operate under an eight-week &lt;a href=\"season%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;. A clan may claim one tower during the first week, and no more than two at any given time. At the end of each season, the ownership of all towers is reset.\nAt the start of a season, players will see many towers on the map to select from, all of which will be Unclaimed Towers. During the first week of a season, from Monday, 3 a.m.\u2013Saturday 7 p.m. server time, the clan's leader and officers can select a tower through the Accursed Towers menu and attempt to claim it for the clan, plunging the Clan into a PvE match against &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;minions&lt;/a&gt; for control of the tower by purifying it.\nPvE.\nWhile fighting demonic hordes for control of the tower, a clan\u2019s objective is to collect Cursed Shards from slain demons. However, players can\u2019t simply attack enemies as they normally would. To deal damage to their foes, players need to locate and activate the tower\u2019s Curse Sources. Doing so will make enemies vulnerable, allowing players to dispatch them and collect their Cursed Shards. Once the timer runs out, the top 10 clan members with the highest Cursed Shard amounts will have them added to their team\u2019s total. A clan can choose to do as many runs to collect Cursed Shards at the same tower as they desire, but only the highest team total will be retained. If a clan has collected the most Cursed Shards among all clans vying for that specific tower by Saturday at 7 p.m. server time, then their clan will claim the tower.\nEven after taking the tower, Hell will attempt to retake it. Once the Corruption meter reaches a certain amount, demonic incursions will follow. Members of the clan must come to defend their tower promptly or else it will be lost and can be reclaimed by another clan.\nThe demons can be warded off by powering up the tower. Within the Accursed Tower's menu, the clan leader and officers can choose to power up their tower. Doing so will not only end the attacks on it from demons but increase the bonuses provided by the tower and periodic rewards provided by the rewards chest inside of it. However, if the tower is powered up, other clans will be able to challenge the owning clan for control of the tower through PvP. Note that Legendary towers (the PvP, Helliquary Reward and Challenge Rift Speed ones) are always open for challenge.\nStarting with the second week of a season, a clan can apply to purify any remaining tower that is not claimed by any clan, including those the owner failed to defend from the curse. Further towers are opened up for purification on weeks 3 and 4 of the season. However each clan can only have two towers under their control. If they wish to challenge another tower, they must choose a tower to relinquish control of should the challenge be successful.\nPvP.\nIn addition to purifying them, clans can gain ownership of towers through challenge. Towers can only be challenged if they are either a Legendary tower or the owning clan has opened them up for challenge. From Saturday, 9 p.m.\u2013Sunday 12 a.m. server time, clans will be able to attempt to challenge for tower ownership from another clan through an all-out PvP match using a 10v10 &lt;a href=\"Conqueror\"&gt;Conqueror&lt;/a&gt; battle format. The clan who wins, in addition to gaining control of the tower, also receives a number of rewards from the match, which can include cursed items. Similarly to claiming a tower by purification, if a clan already has 2 towers under their control, they must choose a tower to replace if they win the match.\nAlliances.\nClans can form tower alliances. This also gives the allied clans access to a \"Tower Alliance\" chat channel.\nTowers are connected with dotted lines on the map. A clan in an alliance can send players to help with defending allied towers connected to the clan's towers.\nThere is no limit on the number of clans in the alliance, however any clans above 3 receive a penalty:\nThe Alliance Leader can transfer towers captured in excess of the limit to other clans.\nList of Towers.\nThere are 9 types of towers.\nNote that Legendary towers (the PvP, Helliquary Reward and Challenge Rift Speed ones) are always open for challenge and therefore don't have \"unboosted\" values of their stats. For the other types of tower, the unboosted stats are included in the table.\nServer Merge.\nDuring a &lt;a href=\"server%20merge\"&gt;server merge&lt;/a&gt;, all Accursed Towers are reset to no owner. The season number is reset to 1. The season start date is updated to the date of the server merge, but the end date is not changed.\nHistory.\nThe alliance feature was added in the update."}

He is the best hunter in &lt;a href=\"Seram\"&gt;Seram&lt;/a&gt; and a good friend of &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally gifted with a bow and arrow, Achilios journeys with Uldyssian, &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serenthia\"&gt;Serenthia&lt;/a&gt; in their quest to stop the manipulating influence of both the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAchilios was a blond and wiry figure, nearly as tall as Uldyssian. He was usually dressed in his hunter's clothing - a brown and green outfit consisting of a jerkin and pants that allowed him to blend into the surroundings of Seram. He had soft leather boots designed for padding silently through the woods. His swift frame hinted of his swiftness but belied his strength: the great bow that was Achilios' pride and joy required great strength to string. His skill in both archery and hunting was unmatched in the region. He was a handsome man, and he was deeply in love with Serenthia. Sadly for him she had feelings for Uldyssian, but this did not deter him.\nAchilios came across a strange object in the middle of the woods, roughly at the same time of the mysterious events in Seram. Together with Mendeln they went to investigate. Upon touching the stone surface, Achilios felt an emptiness, reminding him of death.\nAchilios later joined Uldyssian in his quest to bring down the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. His tracking skills proved a great asset in their travels, and his skill with the bow proved equally useful.\nDuring their stay in &lt;a href=\"Partha\"&gt;Partha&lt;/a&gt;, Achilios befriended the boy &lt;a href=\"Cedric\"&gt;Cedric&lt;/a&gt;. When the evil priest &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt;, disguised as Master &lt;a href=\"Ethon\"&gt;Ethon&lt;/a&gt;, enchanted his bow to miss, Achilios' extraordinary skill still allowed him to hit his targets. It was also after the party left Partha that Serenthia finally answered his love.\nHowever, during the showdown with &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt;, Achilios was mortally wounded with one of his own arrows. Unable to help him, the hunter almost instantly dies. His body was buried in the wilderness.\nUndeath.\nDuring the course of the second novel, &lt;a href=\"Scales%20of%20the%20Serpent\"&gt;Scales of the Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that Achilios has been resurrected as an &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undead creature&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, in order to assist his friends against the machinations of the Triune and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his current plight he vowed to protect Serenthia from any harm. Though Achilios was bound and animated by spells, he still had a high degree of free will. Achilios insisted in eliminating assassins sent by the Triune, and helped expel &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit from Serenthia's body.\nAchilios also has an encounter with &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, who imbues him with holy power and 'overwrites' his orders: Achilios is forced to attack his own friends. His strong, independent character allows him to rebel against Tyrael's orders, however. Achilios continues helping his friends, standing side-by-side with his love Serenthia at the Battle of the Golden Path.\nAfter Uldyssian sacrificed himself in order to save Sanctuary, Achilios was returned to life."}

All three of these areas are playable and play an important part in telling the story as we progress through this Act.\n&lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; - Caldeum was the jewel of the East. It became the trading center for all of Sanctuary. However, there was turmoil due to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, rich merchants, and Wizards all vying for power over the city. &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20I\"&gt;Hakan&lt;/a&gt; eventually took rule and united the three groups to create the most prosperous city. However, his death left a son too young to rule the city. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, lead by &lt;a href=\"Asheara\"&gt;Asheara&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", were hired to protect him until he was old enough to rule the city. However, &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt; removed them and replaced them with his own Caldeum guards. Asheara is unsure of why he made this decision and now helps the people on the lower parts of Caledum.\n&lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur Oasis&lt;/a&gt; - This small paradise was the birth of Caldeum. A mysterious man rose from the waste and showed the original settlers this source of water which was used to help begin Caldeum. However, the story is said that this mysterious man disappeared back into the waste after showing them.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Archives%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;The Archives of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; was one of the original members of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; who helped capture the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; the first time. However, he eventually became corrupt and evil. He was so strong that the Horadrim could not kill him, so they removed his head and buried it underground surrounded by magical runes. His body has been sent into another dimension.\nBlizzCon 2009 Demo.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; 2009 Demo, players start in an area called &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Pass\"&gt;Sundered Pass&lt;/a&gt;, and is tasked by the woman called Asheara to reach the town called Alcarnus, which has apparently been desecrated by the &lt;a href=\"Cultists\"&gt;Cultists&lt;/a&gt;. The player then sets off through several areas, of which some are the &lt;a href=\"Stinging%20Winds\"&gt;Stinging Winds&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20Rim%20Mines\"&gt;Canyon Rim Mines&lt;/a&gt;. Some new monsters were revealed, like the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Dervish\"&gt;Desert Dervish&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Wasp\"&gt;Desert Wasp&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; Reveal Trailer, the hero fought against a &lt;a href=\"Morlu%20Caster\"&gt;Morlu Caster&lt;/a&gt;, but this enemy did not appear in the demo."}

Act I's &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; are the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Araneae\"&gt;Queen Araneae&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt;, and its central &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe story begins centered around &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; and adopted niece of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, and the defense of the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. The earliest tasks include putting to rest the undead led by the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Khazra\"&gt;Khazra&lt;/a&gt;, and rescuing &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and a mysterious man who fell from the sky. The man's sword is broken and scattered; during their retrieval &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt; introduces herself along with her &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt;. She eventually kills Cain and kidnaps the fallen stranger, turning the story into a mission of pursuit and revenge. Along the way, hints of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;'s true power begin to emerge, their first &lt;a href=\"Artisan\"&gt;Artisan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt; are recruited, and the &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; ability is unlocked. The Act ends with the fallen man revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, fallen from &lt;a href=\"heaven\"&gt;heaven&lt;/a&gt;. The heroes vow to pursue Maghda into the east, to avenge Cain's death as well as that of countless townsfolk by stopping her plan to assist the Lesser Evils &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndividual quests, key locations and major events:\nZones and Waypoints.\nAct I takes place in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; in the areas surrounding &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; (the Act's major &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;), the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tristram\"&gt;Old Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, and the outlying town of &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;. This includes two major dungeons, those under the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Tristram.\nThe main quest hub of the zone. The &lt;a href=\"Overlook%20Road\"&gt;Overlook Road&lt;/a&gt; leads to to &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rumford\"&gt;Captain Rumford&lt;/a&gt; introduces the story.\nOld Tristram.\n&lt;a href=\"Old%20Tristram%20Road\"&gt;Old Tristram Road&lt;/a&gt; leads to &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tristram\"&gt;Old Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of Tristram, and eventually to &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; can be recued. Inside the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;'s fall from the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; has left a gaping hole through all the levels, shining with an unnatural blue glow. On the last level the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Skeleton King (Diablo III)&lt;/a&gt; can be found in his throne room, as well as \"The Stranger\".\nThe Fields of Misery.\nThe second broad area of Act I, north of town, where the player finds the broken crown and two of the three pieces of \"The Stranger's\" sword, as well as &lt;a href=\"Firstborn\"&gt;Ancient Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; ruins.\nThe Highlands.\nA boat can be taken to the small town of &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;, north of which the Highlands lead to the area around &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt;. The area is dominated by &lt;a href=\"Khazra\"&gt;Khazra&lt;/a&gt; as well as other wild monsters. The zones in order are:\nThe Halls of Agony.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Agony\"&gt;Halls of Agony&lt;/a&gt; can be found under &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Manor\"&gt;Leoric's Manor&lt;/a&gt;. This is where the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; has imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. The final boss of Act I is the horrific, murdering demon &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt; which must be defeated to free him.\nPre-release.\nDuring promotion before the release of \"Diablo III\", the official website stated that the \"Fallen Star\" was a 'harbinger of doom' that would awaken ancient evils, calling for heroes of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; to defend their world. Only some parts of Act I were revealed. The demo allowed play of the quests up to the first &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is available to all players, regardless of whether they have Reaper of Souls or not.\nIn-game.\nAction Combat gives players various bonuses for meeting special criteria in battle. All of them are displayed graphically mid-screen.\nKill Streak (Massacre).\nScoring a Massacre will provide an &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; bonus, as stated above. The more you kill, the higher your bonus will be. Each tier of Massacre has a title, which will show in its cue card when you hit the limit, and after the Massacre ends. Here are some of the names and limits needed to get a multiplier:\nDestruction (\"Crushed\").\nDestruction bonus starts at 7 objects destroyed. As soon as the 7th object breaks, you're awarded the \"Dimensional Speed\" Buff, which will start ticking down, unless you've \"crushed\" more objects. \"Crushing\" more objects will add onto the timer, but only to a limit. For a 7 streak, another one with 10 seconds remaining will only add the missing time. Sometimes it's hard to know how many you've \"crushed\" due to Massacre's callout taking priority. Timer caps out at 1 minute, but you can keep it there longer with more \"crushes\" in a row.\nEnvironment Kills (Traps).\nTrapping a foe means to use the environment as a weapon. Usually a wall propped up by some wood or a wire rack full of hot coals, but explosive &lt;a href=\"barrel\"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt;s and any other traps will work too. As stated above, you gain double resource charge called \"Trap Mastery\". The time rates seems to depend on the type of monster killed, varying from 30s to almost 1 minute."}

Her real form was a torso carried upon limbs of tentacles, each of them covered in hundreds of mouths. Three horns portruded through the top of her head, and in lieu of a jaw, a gaping orifice pulsed at the bottom of her head.\nBiography.\nDisguising herself as an &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; female who was supposedly the wife of &lt;a href=\"Guwate%27ka\"&gt;Guwate'ka&lt;/a&gt;, Adiya revealed herself to &lt;a href=\"Benu\"&gt;Benu&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;. She had sensed his doubt and had been drawn into the jungle. On the day before an &lt;a href=\"Igani%20Bawe\"&gt;Igani Bawe&lt;/a&gt;, she told him that the spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Unformed Land&lt;/a&gt; were uneasy. That they said that there was nothing in the Umbaru that was unique or worth celebrating. That the Umbaru were blind. She further claimed that the high priests were using the Igani Bawe as a means of controlling Umbaru society. Benu was uneasy, but did admit that he had seen things in the Unformed Land that had made him question his dedication to the Igani. Adiya told him that she had come to Benu in the hope that he might change the Umbaru's ways.\nThe following day, Adiya came to Benu during the Harvest of Souls, despite being forbidden from being there as she was not a Witch Doctor. Having seen the results of the Harvest, he came to accept her claims as being true. However, they were captured by &lt;a href=\"Tribe%20of%20the%20Clouded%20Valley\"&gt;Tribe of the Clouded Valley&lt;/a&gt; Witch Doctors. Both of them were led to the tribe's home village where they were to be sacrificed. Adiya mentioned that the Umbaru were forbidden from carrying out cannibalism\u2014a great sin in Umbaru society, for one who did so would become \"kareeb\"; damned by the spirits. She claimed that these were stories crafted by the high priests, and that her husband had heard stories of eating Witch Doctor flesh being a path to godhood. With this power, they could reform Umbaru culture. In truth, she sought to torment Benu, as he would be so distraught by his actions, she would be able to feast on his spirit years later.\nWhatever the case, when the tribesmen came to take them to be sacrificed, Adiya killed them and led Benu out of the hut. The Clouded Valley tribesmen were stunned, as this was far from normal behaviour in an Igani Bawe, where captives were honoured to be sacrificed. She bit into a captive's heart and bristled with power. She bid that Benu do the same. However, he refused, causing Adiya to lash out at him, calling him a coward. She shot bolts of energy into Benu, temporarily incapacitating him. She then turned her attention to the Clouded Valley tribesmen, killing scores of them and devastating their village. Benu got to his feet and battled her, and while he was able to kill Adiya, the wounds she inflicted on him ensured that he died himself moments later."}

From a young age, she resented her father, seeing him as more interested in his wealth and possessions than his own flesh and blood.\nAdria saw a &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; for the first time when her father took her to the town square to see the public execution of one. He told her to look at the woman, at what he called \"the face of evil.\" But when Adria looked, the witch looked like any normal person. And when the fire was lit, she burnt like any normal person. As the flames consumed her, the witch met Adria's eyes...and laughed.\nBefore Adria's tenth year, Sevrin lost a small fortune when his ships were destroyed in a storm, and in a fit of drunken rage, killed Adria's mother. Sevrin was arrested by the city guards, but due to his wealth and influence, was able to secure a pardon. During this time, Adria lingered outside the jailhouse. When Sevrin was released, the two went back to living at their dockside abode.\nNot long after these events, Sevrin's home caught fire in the dead of night. Standing outside, Adria heard his screams and could smell his burning flesh, later describing it as \"sickly sweet.\" Adria later reflected that it was only in his last moments that her father truly saw her, and only in those last moments did he understand what she was. Afterward, Adria vanished into the night.\n&lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; would later speculate that Adria had played a role in the blaze.\nAfter Kingsport.\nAfter these events, it appears that Adria fled to the wilderness around Kingsport, and perhaps as far north as &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Adria was labeled as a witch by those she encountered, but found that morality was flexible. When a daughter had a child that needed to disappear, when a sickness needed to be cured, it was her that they turned to. At some point, she spotted a &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt;. She spent weeks tracking down the creature until she realized the truth of their activities, and the &lt;a href=\"Greed\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; that they served. Thus, she gave up on that endeavor.\nThe Coven.\nEventually, Adria became involved with a small and secretive group of witches that existed in the Westmarch's remote wilds. Over the years, she became a powerful figure within the circle. It was here that she met another witch, &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;. The two became close, sharing certain traits in an uncanny manner. One of her first tasks was to search for the resting place of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. She learnt that the Lord of Destruction's spirit was contained in the body of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, and that he in turn was entombed deep beneath the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. She was able to find his &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt;, but could not learn how to enter the final chamber. However, whispers in her dreams explained that she had done well in failure, that if she had found Baal, he would have likely killed her where she stood.\nAt some point, Maghda convinced Adria to poison the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; so they could take control. The cult had been floundering prior to their arrival, but when they took control and poisoned its leaders, they reforged it into a dangerous new order that practiced torture and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic summoning.\nIt is said that these witches were fueled by the belief that they were destined to become mortal heralds of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. While in the Coven, Adria compiled a &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; collecting all she had learned over her travels, so that the Coven might turn this knowledge to its advantage. She declared that the final war between Heaven and Hell was coming and that demon lords had whispered to her, telling her of two possible outcomes. In one, Hell recognised the worth of the Coven and they ruled alongside them. In the other, they saw the Coven as being less than useless, their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s tormented for eternity. She urged the Coven to look at sources of power beyond demonology, from the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;, to even &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; itself. While these groups were not servants of Hell, she insisted that the only pertinent question was whether they were powerful.\nYears after taking control of the Coven, Adria and Maghda had a falling out and Adria left the group, around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Cain would later speculate that while Maghda had been devoted to the cult, Adria had only been 'passing through,' that she was driven by the allure of power rather than any greater affiliation. Adria would later write that Maghda had become too complacent, having a far greater estimation of the position of the Coven than Adria did. When she heard the call of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and left the Coven, she did not feel any sorrow in leaving, but rather, that a burden had been lifted from her shoulders.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nNot long afterward, with the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Hellmouth\"&gt;Hellmouth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Adria saw an opportunity to both strike a blow against the legions of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, and to make some profit in &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and magical artifacts in the process. Thus, Adria arrived in the village while most of its people were fleeing, and constructed a &lt;a href=\"Adria%27s%20Hut\"&gt;small hut&lt;/a&gt; on the edge of the village, seemingly overnight. Many of the remaining villagers were wary of her, both in regards to her skill in magic, and her procurement of magical items. One of Asylla's handmaidens called her a witch, and told Adria that she had no virtue in her soul.\nAdria made no secret of being a witch, and &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few individuals to interact with her. The pair spent many nights in the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;Tavern of the Rising Sun&lt;/a&gt;, discussing &lt;a href=\"Horadric\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; texts and the various arcana Adria had collected during her travels. Cain found her knowledge about mysticism and demonology most valuable, though he did find her behavior peculiar at times. It was during these conversations that Cain mentioned the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, something that Adria thought little of at the time, but would later come to realize its true significance. When Cain asked about Adria's past, she only said that her father had been a merchant, and otherwise ignored or deflected subsequent questions. As adventurers came to Tristram, they found Adria's magical trade indispensable. Not that this prevented them from meeting their demise in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually though, three adventurers succeeded where others have failed. &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summoner\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, journeyed into the depths of the Cathedral and found the source of its corruption\u2014Diablo, Lord of Terror. Aidan slew the demon, but was left psychologically and physically scarred by the experience. Tormented by his experiences, Aidan sought solace with Adria.\nAidan had plunged Diablo's &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; into his forehead in an attempt to contain Diablo's essence, and Adria beheld that essence within him. When Aidan spoke, she heard thousands of voices, and saw the flames of her past. Adria knew fear. She suspected that he had summoned her as a proof against possible failure; at the very least, he had not corrupted her like he had Aidan. He whispered to her of the End of Days, and pronounced her worthy to serve him in his ultimate victory. He gave her dreams of decay and corruption, knowing that she would see them as the natural end of humanity. She pledged herself to Diablo's service. She would give Diablo her &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, and he would give her the destiny she knew to be hers by right. She marked his soul as he caressed her, in preparation for a plan that would take over 20 years to come to fruition. Adria and Aidan spent many nights behind closed doors, and through this liaison, Adria became pregnant with Aidan/Diablo's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;. It would take time, but it was intended that when the time was right, Leah would serve as Diablo's vessel as part of his plan to become the sole &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;. Because the ritual had been conducted with Adria's own blood, Diablo had an affinity for it, and therefore, the child they had conceived. However, Adria had to find a means to contain the essences of the other Great Evils.\nDeparture.\nEventually, Aidan left Tristram, now wearing the guise of the Dark Wanderer. Adria told Cain that he had headed east to find mystics that could help exorcise his nightmares. Shortly afterwards, Adria departed also, along with &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt;. The pair traveled to &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; where Adria gave birth to Leah. Adria bore no love for the girl, seeing her as Diablo's daughter rather than hers, and a tool at that. After all, she reflected, daughters were a cheap thing. The infant was left in Gillian's care, and after casting a protective spell around Gillian's new home, Adria departed on a mysterious errand.\nAt some point during his &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;travels&lt;/a&gt;, with a new group of heroes in pursuit of the Dark Wanderer, Cain encountered Adria and learned of Leah's existence. He promised her that he'd keep her safe. She gave the scholar a scroll of misdirection and protection in the event that he and Leah would have to evade prying eyes. Adria was present at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; led his armies against the s. She witnessed as his &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;s tore through the Barbarian ranks. When Baal corrupted the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, Adria sensed the darkness he had infected it with. In this moment, she realized what the Worldstone was, and what it could truly do, that the stories of how it had forged Sanctuary were true. She was able to survive the Worldstone's destruction and the ensuring fallout.\nPost-Arreat.\nOver the intervening years, Adria and Cain's paths occassionally crossed, but they never met face to face. Adria caught a few glimpses of her daughter, but otherwise remained inconspicuous. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;Seven years&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, Cain heard a report that Adria had perished in the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever truth may have existed in the report, it was inaccurate in that Adria was indeed still alive. The destruction of Mount Arreat was the culmination of a series of events that had left five of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; dead, making &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; the last two lords of Hell.\nAfter visiting an &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt; sanitarium (where he learnt of Adria's past affiliation with the Coven), Cain began to sense Adria's presence nearby. Still, the witch managed to evade his attempts to track her down. At some point around this time, Adria passed through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Library\"&gt;Great Library&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, where she had come searching for information concerning the battles of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, she was interested in the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Sands\"&gt;Desolate Sands&lt;/a&gt; and the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. These were places that &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; had once visited. Cain realized that she was searching for information on the Black Soulstone.\nThe Black Soulstone.\nThe essences of the Great Evils bar Belial and Azmodan lingered on Sanctuary. At some point, Adria learnt of Zoltun Kulle and his creation of the Black Soulstone. She realized that this was the means through which Diablo's vision of becoming a singular Prime Evil could be realized, by 'marking' the souls of the Great Evils for absorption into the stone. To test Kulle's spellwork, Adria marked the soul of a &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Dervish\"&gt;Dune Dervish&lt;/a&gt; and bound it into a ruby. The crystal shattered moments later, but that was expected. What mattered was that she had proof that Kulle's magic worked. Thus, she had to experiment on more demons to ascertain the scope of its power. At some point prior to this, she had thought that a &lt;a href=\"Scouring%20Charger\"&gt;Scouring Charger&lt;/a&gt; could contain the essences of the Great Evils, but this turned out to not be the case. After marking the essence of a &lt;a href=\"Subjugator\"&gt;Subjugator&lt;/a&gt;, she decided it was now time to move onto the Great Evils.\nOver the years, Adria was able to locate the essences of the Great Evils, preparing them for absorption into the Black Soulstone, as per Diablo's plan of taking their essences into himself. &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; was the first essence which she marked; the ritual was quick, just as Diablo had promised. As she drew Andariel's soul into the Black Soulstone, Andariel looked into Adria's soul as she tried to subdue hers. The Maiden of Anguish discovered what Adria was trying to do, and fought as hard as she could. Adria later reflected that if Andariel had been fully formed, she would have been defeated. Nevertheless, Anguish's essence was marked.\n&lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; was the second of the Great Evils that Adria marked. She approached him with fear, knowing that if she failed and he imprisoned her in his &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Pain\"&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt;, she could look forward to years, possibly decades of torture before being granted the peace of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. However, when she found Duriel's soul, there was no confrontation. Duriel witnessed Diablo's vision of the End of Days and rejoiced. Even if he would be a 'passenger' to the Lord of Terror, the destruction Diablo would wreck would bring him indescribable pleasures. Thus, Adria marked his soul, using a circle formed from her own blood. The wounds would heal quickly, she reflected.\nBaal was the third soul that Adria marked. Similar to Duriel, she encountered little resistance, as upon marking his soul, Adria learnt that he desired to see the End of Days as much as Diablo did. Thus, she sent his soul into the Black Soulstone. She expected him to lash out, but she sensed that Baal was content, understanding that he would wait there until Diablo had use for his spirit. If anything, he was amused.\nMephisto was the fourth soul that Adria marked. Overconfident with her past victories, Mephisto's hatred caught her off-guard. More than once, he took control of her mind, and if she had not already placed safeguards before the ritual, she knew that she would have been lost. Nevertheless, she completed her task\u2014the live human sacrifices she had carried out previously had served their purpose.\nWith her work complete, Adria was left only with &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;. This presented a problem, as Azmodan ruled from Hell, and Belial had ensnared the nobility of Caldeum, far too well protected to mark alone.\nThe End of Days.\nCaldeum.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Twenty years&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of Arreat, the time had come for Diablo's plan to enter its final stage. At this point in time, Adria was in Caldeum, seeking to gather some things before setting out to find the head of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Soulstone's creator. However, she was cornered by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; in the sewers\u2014Belial had enthralled the city, and was aware of the Black Soulstone's existence, if not its function. His demons tortured her until she was saved by a group of heroes, among which were the now-mortal &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, and Leah herself. She told Leah that she'd watched over her all her life, and had not gotten close due to the shadows that followed her. They returned to the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Camp\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; that the heroes had set up outside Caldeum.\nAdria told them of her plan to use the Black Soulstone to bind and destroy Belial and Azmodan, and directed the Nephalem to find the head of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; with the aim of resurrecting him to lead them to the soulstone. Tyrael was uneasy as to the thought of resurrecting him, but when pressed by Adria, admitted that he didn't have a better idea, similarly pointing out to The Nephalem that if Belial or Azmodan invaded, Kulle would be the least of their problems. \nWhile The Nephalem headed to the &lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur Oasis&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the head, Adria began training Leah in the use of her abilities. When they returned with the head, Adria had Leah cast a spell she had taught her, resurrecting Kulle's spirit.\nWhen Kulle was resurrected and the Black Soulstone was completed, the souls of the five dead Lords of Hell, &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, were drawn into the stone to Kulle's shock. Turning against The Nephalem, Kulle was slain for a second time. Adria told the heroes that her intent for using the stone was destroying the demon lords forever in vengeance for what Diablo did to Tristram two decades ago. Once all seven Evils were trapped within the stone, she said, she would shatter it and the Lords of Hell would be no more. However, it would be Leah who would have to wield the stone itself.\nArmed with the Black Soulstone, the heroes returned to Caldeum to find it under attack by Belial. Adria tried to dissuade Leah and The Nephalem from saving Caldeum's civilians in favor of striking at Belial directly, calling it \"foolish heroism\", but neither Leah nor The Nephalem could ignore the call to save lives, and successfully evacuated Caldeum's citizens and refugees through the sewers. With the people saved, Adria assisted the Nephalem in battling through to the gates of the Imperial Palace, ordering Leah to bring down the gates. When The Nephalem killed Belial, Leah successfully bound his soul into the Black Soulstone, leaving the party only with the issue of Azmodan. She told Leah to go to Caldeum's &lt;a href=\"Great%20Library\"&gt;Great Library&lt;/a&gt;, in order to best ascertain where Azmodan would strike.\nAdria later reflected that Belial's overconfidence had been his downfall, and that he likely was aware of her intentions. If he'd revealed them to her companions, Diablo's plan would have been ruined. Perhaps he had sought to use her and the Black Soulstone to his own ends, she supposed.\nJourney to Bastion's Keep.\nOn the way to &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Leah went through Cain's writings, where she learnt of Adria's past connections to the Coven, and Cain's suspicions. Adria admitted her connection to the Coven, but claimed it was part of her quest to wage war against Hell, and 'confessed' she had gone too far.\nIn her writings, Adria mused that Azmodan had likely become aware of Diablo's plan (this was, in fact, the truth). She doubted that he would step foot on Sanctuary as long as the Black Soulstone existed, so therefore she would need help to subdue him in his &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Sin\"&gt;own domain&lt;/a&gt;. Once that happened, she would have precious minutes to draw his soul into the Black Soulstone. If she failed, his soul would enter the process of rebirth, and be forever lost to her.\nTrue Colors.\nAt Bastion's Keep, while Azmodan's minions lay &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;, Adria remained at her daughter's side, as she struggled to contain the essences of the six demon lords imprisoned inside the Black Soulstone.&lt;Ref name = \"TheSiegeofBastion'sKeep\"&gt;\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt;\", \""}

From time to time, our paths would cross, and I would catch glimpses of Leah as she grew.

A legend. There is no doubt in my mind he is as powerful as the stories say. But for every bit of his genius, he was surely mad. He was obsessed with immortality and power.\nTyrael:\nA madman.

We will soon defeat him. What will you do then?\nAdria:\nThe war will never end for me. Even if we defeat all evil forever, I will carry the scars of this nightmare till the end of my days.\nPlayer:\nSome scars so not heal, but what of Leah? She may not be bound to our fate.\nAdria:\nI wish Leah could have the life I never had. But in truth, I fear she'll be damned as well.\nPlayer:\nLeah is stronger than you know, She may yet come to know a life without the memory of these nightmares."}

These renegades, the angel &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and the demon &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, created the world of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; as an escape from unending war and bore children, &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;hybrids&lt;/a&gt; of heavenly and hellish ancestry, as their legacy. As millennia passed, Inarius and Lilith vanished, and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's origins faded into legend.\nToday, Sanctuary is a dangerous world. Infiltrated by avaricious demons and largely ignored by the angels of the High Heavens\u2014until recently, when a group of heroes fought to contain the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; the demon lord of Hatred, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, the demon lord of Terror, and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, the demon lord of Destruction. Atop sacred &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes struck down Baal, who had located and corrupted the Worldstone itself. Fearful that Baal's efforts might poison all of humanity, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; of Justice, chose to hurl his sword &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt; into the great Worldstone: he, the stone, and the mountain were all obliterated.\nIn Tyrael's absence, fragments of the Worldstone large and small fester throughout Sanctuary, radiating the energies of destruction and creation both, twisting flora and fauna and offering poisoned power to those who dare to wield it. Sanctuary is again on the brink of destruction\u2014and would-be saviors are vanishingly rare.\nWortham.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrives in the embattled village of &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;. After helping to defend the town against the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cult of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;, servants of the heretofore unknown demon lord &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt;, they are drawn into a quest by the scholar Deckard Cain: to find the shard of the destroyed Worldstone before they bring abject ruin to Sanctuary.\nAshwold Cemetery.\nThe Adventurer pursues the rogue &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lethes\"&gt;Lethes&lt;/a&gt;, thief of a Worldstone shard, through &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, which she has overrun with hordes of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Xul\"&gt;Xul&lt;/a&gt;, Lethes's old mentor, they stop her from seizing the powerful &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; of Mad King &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, and recover her stolen Worldstone shard, though Lethes uses a simulacrum to escape.\nWestmarch.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;City of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, Deckard Cain's Horadric ritual reveals another Worldstone shard being used in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;. After planning their approach with a former resident of the wood, the blacksmith &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt;, the Adventurer heads to the imperiled wood to seek out &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt;, priestess of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and a third ruinous shard.\nDark Wood.\nThe Adventurer finds the Dark Wood and its &lt;a href=\"Derelict%20Timberyard\"&gt;outlying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackstone%20Village\"&gt;villages&lt;/a&gt; teeming with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Creeper\"&gt;blood-sucking vines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;corrupted rogues&lt;/a&gt; who kidnap and murder innocents to empower their mistress, the reanimated Countess. The Adventurer helps purify the wood's corruption with the aid of a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hemlir\"&gt;Hemlir&lt;/a&gt;, who gives up his life to perform a cleansing ritual. Then, alongside the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye, including their commander &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt;, the Adventurer infiltrates &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt;, destroys her, and claims a third Worldstone shard.\nShassar Sea.\nIn the blistering deserts of &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar&lt;/a&gt;, the Adventurer strikes a deal with members of an outlaw group, the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Blades\"&gt;Amber Blades&lt;/a&gt;, to find Kulle's hidden library. They assist the Blades leader, &lt;a href=\"Tabri\"&gt;Tabri&lt;/a&gt;, by delving Shassar's tombs so recover pieces of the &lt;a href=\"scepter%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;scepter of Fahir&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact of rule in the process, they confront the vile undead monarch &lt;a href=\"Fahir\"&gt;Fahir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;his tomb&lt;/a&gt;-though Fahir escapes, the Adventurer reclaims and reforges the scepter, elevating Tabri above her cruel rival &lt;a href=\"Vataos\"&gt;Vataos&lt;/a&gt; and earning access to the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;.\nLibrary of Zoltun Kulle.\nTo win entry into the library's deepest archives, the Adventurer works with &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a simulacrum made in the image of &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to restore and unseal parts of the ruin. They fight &lt;a href=\"Aberration\"&gt;twisted experiments&lt;/a&gt; and relive &lt;a href=\"Destruction%27s%20End\"&gt;Kulle's sealing&lt;/a&gt; of the Demon Lord Baal, Lord of Destruction, where they learn of the means to utterly destroy a Worldstone shard: an archangel's blade. The Curator knows the location of one such weapon\u2014a temple among the forsaken swamps of &lt;a href=\"Bilefen\"&gt;Bilefen&lt;/a&gt;.\nBilefen.\nThe adventurer encounters a wizard named &lt;a href=\"Jin\"&gt;Jin&lt;/a&gt; seeking the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Namari\"&gt;Temple of Namari&lt;/a&gt;, and the two work together to recover the temple's stolen beacons and appease the spirit of its high priestess. They recover the beacons from &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Owen\"&gt;accursed villagers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhodri\"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ongori\"&gt;fetish demons&lt;/a&gt;, and the Adventurer enters the temple to confront its prisoner, the ancient nephalem magus &lt;a href=\"Sargoth\"&gt;Sargoth&lt;/a&gt; who has begun to break the walls of his prison. After they defeat Sargoth and his legion of summoned demons, &lt;a href=\"Namari\"&gt;Namari&lt;/a&gt; grants the Adventurer what they seek: the angelic dagger &lt;a href=\"Yl%27nira\"&gt;Yl'nira&lt;/a&gt;, Edge of Temperance.\nThe Cycle Begins.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Yl%27nira\"&gt;Yl'nira&lt;/a&gt; recovered from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Namari\"&gt;Temple of Namari&lt;/a&gt;, the Adventurer returned to Westmarch. Cain asks the Adventurer to use the angelic dagger to destroy the three shards of the Worldstone and this time, they are successful. The Adventurer consults two ancient orders of demon slayers interested in recruiting them: the &lt;a href=\"Immortals\"&gt;Immortals&lt;/a&gt;, guardians empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Crown\"&gt;Eternal Crown&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt;-a secret organization keeping watch over the Immortals. Then, they follow Cais guidance to the location of a fourth shard, on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;.\nMount Zavain.\nIn rocky Mount Zavain, the Adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Oza\"&gt;Oza&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Veradani\"&gt;Veradani&lt;/a&gt; monk from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Sanctified%20Earth%20Monastery\"&gt;Sanctified Earth Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, confront members of the Cult of Damnation, including one of the cult's leaders, &lt;a href=\"Dravec\"&gt;Dravec&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a disgraced Sanctified Earth monk who worships Skarn and refers to the Adventurer as the \"Shard-seeker\". Dravec besieges Sanctified Earth with an army of demons to claim the Worldstone shard in their care; Oza and &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; protect the monastery from ruin, but Dravec slays Oza in a duel and escapes to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt; to bring the Worldstone shard to his master.\nFrozen Tundra.\nThe Shard-seeker pursues Dravec across the icy barrens of the Frozen Tundra, but he uses the Worldstone shard to slip into the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;realm of the dead&lt;/a&gt; and evade justice. To follow the traitor, the Shard-seeker allies with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wolves\"&gt;Shadow Wolf&lt;/a&gt; barbarians of &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Hearth\"&gt;Bitter Hearth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tassi\"&gt;Tassi&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; warrior searching for a relic, the &lt;a href=\"Iceburn%20Tear\"&gt;Iceburn Tear&lt;/a&gt;, that can shield anyone from the chill of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The Shard-seeker recovers the Tear and races after Dravec catching him just as he hands the shard to Skarn. Skarn repays Dravec's service by transforming him into a &lt;a href=\"Dra%27yev\"&gt;demonic monstrosity&lt;/a&gt;, but the Shard-seeker dispatches Dravec and follows Skarn into the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;\nRealm of Damnation.\nThe Shard-seeker tracks Skarn through the Burning Hells, and in the process frees the captured angels &lt;a href=\"Verathiel\"&gt;Verathiel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mikayel\"&gt;Mikayel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Andalon\"&gt;Andalon&lt;/a&gt;. On the angels' advice, the Shard-seeker seals the &lt;a href=\"Pits%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Pits of Anguish&lt;/a&gt;, gateways to the depths of the Hells from which Skarn plots to raise an army. The Shard-seeker defeats Skarn in &lt;a href=\"Skarn%27s%20Throne\"&gt;his lair&lt;/a&gt;, where he has been siphoning power from the skull of Diablo, and reclaims the Worldstone shard but the defeat of Terror's jailer frees Diablo's soul. As Diablo's claws close around the angel Verathiel, she hurls the Shard-seeker free with the remaining Worldstone shard.\nSilent Monastery.\n&lt;a href=\"Shura\"&gt;Shura&lt;/a&gt;, a Veradani monk, requests the Shard-seeker's aid to investigate an ominous &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mists\"&gt;black fog&lt;/a&gt; spreading across Mount Zavain and bringing violent &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28monster%29\"&gt;nightmare creatures&lt;/a&gt; with it. Together, they travel to the &lt;a href=\"Silent%20Monastery\"&gt;Silent Monastery&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the site of Ivgorodi Patriarch Sladyan's desperate attempt to stop Zakarum invaders from conquering his homeland. Within the monastery, the Shard seeker confronts a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nightmare\"&gt;demon-corrupted Sladyan&lt;/a&gt; and lays his soul to rest. The Shard-seeker and Shura drive back the remainder of the fog, and Shura vows to work more closely with the soldiers of Westmarch\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Rakkis\"&gt;Sons of Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to heal the rift between then people.\nStormpoint.\nCain and an old comrade, the mage &lt;a href=\"Karshun\"&gt;Karshun&lt;/a&gt;, discover that Diablo's &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt; is seeking a Worldstone shard at the prison isle of &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint\"&gt;Stormpoint&lt;/a&gt;. The Shard-seeker races the cult's leaders to locate the shard, protects two orphans, &lt;a href=\"Esmund\"&gt;Esmund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fern\"&gt;Fern&lt;/a&gt;, and helps the prison's guards defend &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint%20Keep\"&gt;Stormpoint Keep&lt;/a&gt; from an army of demons with the aid of the mysterious swordsman &lt;a href=\"Zatham\"&gt;Zatham&lt;/a&gt;. When Fern is dragged into &lt;a href=\"Deepstrider%20Lair\"&gt;a beast's lair&lt;/a&gt; and Esmund and the Shard-seeker rush to save her, &lt;a href=\"Akinees\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the cult's leaders is able to flee with the Worldstone shard. Fern survives, but Esmund does not, and the Shard-seeker and Zatham resolve to pursue the cult.\nTrail of Terror.\nZatham and the Shard-seeker locate &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Lair\"&gt;a lair&lt;/a&gt; used by the Cult of Terror, but its leader, the &lt;a href=\"Bride%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Bride of Hell&lt;/a&gt;, escapes through a portal. Zatham suspects their destination is a mystic isle in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Sea\"&gt;Forgotten Sea&lt;/a&gt; where they can purify the Worldstone shard and bring it to the Hells\u2014but Zatham believes they can intercept the cult if they recover the isle's stolen &lt;a href=\"Pathstone\"&gt;Pathstone&lt;/a&gt;. Together, Zatham and the Shard-seeker sail into the Forgotten Sea, and defeat the thief of the Pathstone, &lt;a href=\"Morwith\"&gt;Morwith&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe ability to replay quests was added in the update.\nIn the update, a hint feature was added that indicates the map and region of a Chronicle page that the player hasn't found yet."}

Once a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, he later became a vessel for the&lt;a href=\"%20Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nIn his youth, Aidan studied and trained in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Prince of Khanduras.\nAidan was part of what would become the ruling family of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying his &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Asylla\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt; and their court from &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; to the Western land. Their court was set up in an &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;abandoned monastery&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and over time, Leoric gained the respect of the people. Aidan was tutored by &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time however, Leoric's mood became increasingly erratic, his rule brutal and in the throes of such madness, he sent his army against the neighbouring kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Aidan was among the soldiers sent into battle.\nReturn to Tristram.\nThe war against Westmarch was a disaster, the armies of Khanduras being cut to shreds. Aidan survived however, and made his way back to Tristram, already suffering under whatever evil was plaguing it and drawing numerous adventurers to the town because of it (that, and gold). By the time Aidan arrived, things had gotten even worse. His father had been struck down by the knight &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;Lachdanan&lt;/a&gt;, Albrecht was missing and his kingdom was in shambles.\nAidan vowed to rescue his brother and banish whatever power had gripped the kingdom, though Cain urged caution. He warned Aidan of the demons beneath the cathedral and of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, how he might have to face those he once knew. Cain also pointed out that there were others who could aid him and as such he was joined by a Rogue named &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt;, who was part of the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt;.\nVenturing into the cathedral, Aidan and his companions faced the horror and might of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. Quickly dispatching a demon called &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt;, they soon encountered Leoric, now the Skeleton King. Witnessing the reanimated visage of his father was a harrowing encounter for Aidan, made even more heartbreaking by the fact that he was forced to strike him down. Aidan brought news of the king's death before returning into the labyrinth.\nThe heroes pressed on, making their way into the catacombs under the monastery, eventually discovering the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Lazarus\"&gt;Staff of Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, which belonged to the bishop that had been Leoric's advisor. The same bishop had led Tristram's people into the labyrinth to be slaughtered before disappearing. Returning to Tristram, Aidan presented the staff to &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it was clear that &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; had deceived his people. Cain was not sure what to make of it, but realized that Lazarus himself must have kidnapped Albrecht. With this knowledge, Aidan and his companions made their way to the &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Altar\"&gt;Unholy Altar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLazarus was powerful and had many &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s at his side, but in the end, he was struck down. A youth had been sacrificed to whatever dark power he served, but it wasn't Albrecht. Returning to Cain again, the scholar told Aidan of what lurked beneath the labyrinth\u2014&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Terror. With this knowledge, Aidan and his companions ventured back into the labyrinth for one last battle.\nAs Aidan would later put it, Diablo's realm was \"the threshold of Hell itself.\" It was a realm fitted for Diablo certainly, for not only was their struggle physical, but mental as well. The demon forced Aidan to relive his worst nightmares, his greatest failures, and his fears that he would never live up to the expectations of his father. But, driven by the belief that his brother could still be saved, Aidan pressed on. He and his companions wore the demon down until, ultimately, Aidan struck the final blow...only for it to be revealed that Diablo had used Albrecht as his host.\nDeckard Cain would later speculate that Aidan seeing his brother's body before him would have shattered his mind. Regardless, whatever may have run through Aidan's head, there was one last loose end: Diablo's &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. Broken by Lazarus, it could not contain the demon indefinitely. Believing he could contain Diablo's essence, he plunged the soulstone into his forehead. Blood filled his vision, the whispers of the damned echoed in his ears and Aidan could feel Diablo himself clawing his way up from the dark recesses of his soul. But he had done it. Diablo had been contained.\nNightmares.\nAidan emerged from the bowels of the cathedral, coated in his own blood and all manner of demonic ichor. It was a victory to Tristram, but it was clear that Aidan was not the same person he once was. He increasingly shunned the company of others, spending the day in isolation and the night wandering the streets, seemingly without direction or purpose. Ultimately, the &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, seemed to be the only person who could offer him comfort, and the two spent long nights behind closed doors. This, however, was not of Aidan's intent, but of Diablo's. Adria saw the truth, that Aidan had not contained Diablo at all, and pledged herself to the Lord of Terror's service. Through Aidan, Diablo impregnated Adria, conceiving a child who would be his vessel. It would be over two decades, but when the time was right, Diablo would return to claim his &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;prize&lt;/a&gt;.\nAidan was cordial to those who approached him, but his mood didn't improve. In an attempt to liven it, a celebration was thrown in his honor. However, he slipped away during the event. That same evening, Cain visited him, finding Aidan muttering to himself, wearing a dark garb and a hood that covered his face. Aidan eventually related his story to Deckard Cain, telling him of his battle with Diablo. After the tale, he kept mumbling, whispering \"I thought I could contain it, I thought I could contain it...\" before mentioning his \"brothers\" awaiting him in the east. Cain could see that Aidan was disturbed, but at the time, saw it as meaningless ramblings. The next day however, Aidan was gone, armed only with a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and some provisions. According to Adria, he had traveled east, to seek out mystics who might exorcise the waking nightmare that plagued him. A half-truth. But as demons descended on Tristram after Aidan's departure, it was clear that there would be no-one from the town capable of following him.\nJourney to Aranoch.\nAidan, or what was left of him, now had a new moniker\u2014the Dark Wanderer. A vessel for Diablo and little else. Heading east, he sought passage to the port of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;. Passing through the &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Monastery\"&gt;Eastgate Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, the Wanderer encountered the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom had recently been corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;, now come over to the cause of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. The monastery desecrated, the Wanderer stopped at a tavern situated in the mountains that separated &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. Summoning demons and the forms of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to his side, the Wanderer set the tavern ablaze and everyone in it, apart for one\u2014&lt;a href=\"Marius\"&gt;Marius&lt;/a&gt;, who had fled the Rogue Monastery. For whatever reason, the Wanderer beckoned to Marius to follow, and he did.\nFor many weeks, the pair traveled across Aranoch. During the trip, the Wanderer told Marius of his past as a warrior, and that a burden had been placed on him. Eventually, they came within sight of Lut Gholein. The pair made camp, and Marius shared the Wanderer's dreams. Dreams that were more akin to memories, depicting the &lt;a href=\"Horadric\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; being bound to contain the essence of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. As the Wanderer explained, it was Baal who he sought. They set out with the dawn, searching for the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tomb of Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinding the tomb, the Wanderer appeared to gain strength. Or rather, as Marius observed, appeared to be losing what was left of his humanity, his visage becoming more demonic. Either way, the Wanderer led the way into the tomb, undeterred by the gloom. Eventually, the pair reached the &lt;a href=\"Binding%20Stone\"&gt;Binding Stone&lt;/a&gt; where Tal Rasha, barely containing Baal, stood. The Wanderer moved forward to release the Lord of Destruction but it was here that the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; intervened. The Wanderer and &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; did battle but Marius, manipulated by Baal, released him. Marius promptly fled with Baal's soulstone, but it mattered not. Baal was free. Tyrael was imprisoned in his place. And with that, the Wanderer and Baal set sail to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;.\nHellfire.\nThe Wanderer had a close shave at Kurast with a band of heroes that had been pursuing him, but managed to escape their grasp. Soon afterwards, the Wanderer and Baal arrived at &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, entering the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; had already been partially corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s influence, but Diablo used his powers of fear to cause the uncorrupted defenders to flee and/or turn on each other. Regardless, Mephisto's soulstone was found, and the Lord of Hatred quickly took possession of &lt;a href=\"Que-Hegan\"&gt;Que-Hegan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sankekur\"&gt;Sankekur&lt;/a&gt;. After centuries, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; were reunited.\nWithin a chamber, the Primes devised a final stratagem to retake the Burning Hells, claim vengeance on those who had turned on them and use their corrupted soulstones to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, thereby enslaving humanity to their will. The &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt; was opened and Diablo took full control over the Wanderer's body, assuming his true form. The Wanderer had served the Lord of Terror well, and Aidan seemed to be lost forever. However, the heroes that had pursued the Wanderer over the months had not given up, and confronted Diablo himself. Cain would speculate that even then, some small part of Aidan's old self remained, that as the heroes fought the demon without, Aidan fought him within. Regardless, Diablo was defeated, his essence returned to his soulstone and like Albrecht before him, Aidan's body was left behind. In honor of his memory, the champions ceremonially wrapped his broken body and threw it into the infernal fires that raged all around them.\nLegacy.\nYears after his death, Cain remained guilt-ridden by what had happened to his former friend. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;Eight years&lt;/a&gt; after Aidan's death, while in a &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; repository, a demon briefly took Aidan's form in order to psychologically torment Cain.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Two decades&lt;/a&gt; after Aidan's death, when walking the path to the Tristram Cathedral, &lt;a href=\"Li-Ming\"&gt;Li-Ming&lt;/a&gt; reflected that it was as if she was stepping back in time, following in the footsteps of the Dark Wanderer.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;\"\nAidan is the canon hero and represented by the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; class in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", though remains nameless throughout the game.\nDiablo II.\nThe Wanderer is briefly encountered in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;third act&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", right upon leaving the &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Docks\"&gt;Kurast Docks&lt;/a&gt;, where he pauses, then disappears before summoning five &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Beast\"&gt;Flesh Beast&lt;/a&gt;s, who appear after five trios of glowing orbs descend from the sky.\nThe player cannot interact with him in any way. If the player listens carefully, they can hear the Wanderer laugh as he teleports away.\nAidan's journey is charted through flashbacks in the form of the game's cinematics.\nDiablo Immortal.\nWhile not referenced directly, the &lt;a href=\"Wicked%20Wanderer\"&gt;Wicked Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cosmetic%20set\"&gt;cosmetic set&lt;/a&gt; appears to take inspiration from the Dark Wanderer. In the \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rebirth\"&gt;Dark Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;\" storyline, The Wanderer is featured in flashbacks, where the player has to play as a young Aidan.\nDiablo III.\nAidan is mentioned multiple times in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\n description implies that it may be the very same weapon he used to defeat Diablo with back in the first game.\nA &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;-only weapon called &lt;a href=\"Aidan%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;Aidan's Revenge&lt;/a&gt; is both named after him and also claims that he himself killed .\nOther.\nData exists for Aidan in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTo commemorate the 20th anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;\"Diablo\" series&lt;/a&gt;, Aidan appeared in a tavern brawl in \"Hearthstone\" as a card. This included the ability to transform into the &lt;a href=\"Cow%20King\"&gt;Cow King&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo similarly commemorate the anniversary, a Dark Wanderer player icon was made available in \"Overwatch\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nAidan was originally full of life and promise, but was also self-absorbed, though had some insecurities in regards to what his father expected of him. His experiences in war against Westmarch tempered him. However, he was broken physically and mentally due to Diablo's influence, and while shards of humanity remained within him, he steadily lost them over time as Diablo asserted his control.\nAidan was considered handsome before his fall.\nNotes.\nThe concept behind Aidan is effectively retroactive, as up until the conception of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", he was never given a name besides the \"Dark Wanderer\". In the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;first game&lt;/a&gt;, he was never given a name and did not conceptually exist; like the other classes, the Warrior merely represented all such individuals who traveled to Tristram to fight the Darkness.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", it was established that the Warrior class was the hero to canonically slay Diablo, and was given the title of the Dark Wanderer. However, his backstory remained the same as the warrior class, that he was a nameless hero. One fact was retconned: Deckard Cain spoke of the Dark Wanderer as though he was\u00a0foreign to Tristram, but NPCs in the game speak to the player as though the player is a villager returning from a long journey. This was also added to in the game's manual, as written by Deckard Cain. A warrior/thief character named &lt;a href=\"Qarak\"&gt;Qarak&lt;/a&gt; appears in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Awakening\"&gt;The Awakening&lt;/a&gt;\" as a possible take on giving the Wanderer a name, but can still conceptually exist as his own character.\nBy \"Diablo III\", the Warrior's background had been further altered, being given the name of \"Aidan\" with the backstory that he was Leoric's elder son. This is effectively a retcon, as previous lore had stated that Leoric only had one son (Albrecht), and, in \"Diablo\", the people of Tristram reacted no differently to the Warrior than to the other classes, despite Aidan being known to them. This is slightly amended in \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Cain\"&gt;Book of Cain&lt;/a&gt;\", where Cain explains that he used the term \"Dark Wanderer\" to describe Aidan because he could not bring himself to use his name after his fall. Marius and other characters used the name \"Dark Wanderer\" as well, which can more sensibly be justified in that few outside of Tristram knew the Wanderer's true identity."}

She is naturally suspicious of outsiders. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; described her as being soft-spoken, inscrutable, and wise. She believes that more women are needed to fight against the enemies of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nDuring her time in the Sisterhood, Akara became practiced in the use of the &lt;a href=\"Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;. She oversaw the spiritual aspects of the Order, while &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt; oversaw military matters. Kashya regarded Akara as being a surrogate mother.\nThe Sightless Eye.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Moreina\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt; returned from &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Akara felt ill at ease. She suspected that Moreina had stumbled upon some &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;evil force&lt;/a&gt; beneath the town.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, when Akara was in her early forties, &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt; was captured by &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;. She corrupted many &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and drove the rest of the Sisterhood out of their ancestral home. Akara ended up in an &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;encampment&lt;/a&gt; in the wilderness of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. She resided in a simple hut which granted her more privacy than other areas of the camp. Akara was deeply affected by the loss of Eastgate, and &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt; feared that she blamed herself for what had happened.\nSome travelers arrived in the camp, including &lt;a href=\"Warriv\"&gt;Warriv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gheed\"&gt;Gheed&lt;/a&gt;. She did her best to stay clear of the latter.\nAfterwards, a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the camp. She implored them to find a way to lift Andariel's curse. After they cleansed the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Evil\"&gt;Den of Evil&lt;/a&gt;, they gained her trust.\nAware of the threat Andariel represented, Akara bid the heroes travel to &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; in order to find &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;. They succeeded, and later went on to defeat Andariel. She thanked the heroes for their efforts, and hoped that one day, the Sisterhood could be rebuilt.\nWhile at the camp (or potentially in the following years), Cain entrusted Akara with a &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Bestiary\"&gt;Horadric origin&lt;/a&gt;. However, she later commented that \"its strange &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s were never meant for me.\" \nAfter the events with Andariel, Charsi chose to leave the Sisterhood. Before she left, Akara gave her an amulet that, if used, would open a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;, in case Charsi ever had to find her way back home.\nThe Bloodsworn.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, Akara, still high priestess of the sisterhood, was in the Dark Wood, as she and her forces moved against the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;. While at their &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Battlecamp\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt;, she was introduced to a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, who told her that they had been sent by Cain; that he had hoped that she could help them find one of the shards of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; which had fallen in the area. Akara mused that a Worldstone shard could explain the Bloodsworn's power. She agreed to provide &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; with assistance, and gave them the tome Cain had provided her with years prior, commenting that Cain had sent them here \"to complete the circle.\" She gave them the tome, and instructed them to speak with &lt;a href=\"Hemlir\"&gt;Hemlir&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter failing to conduct a ritual to cleanse the Dark Wood's corruption, Hemlir turned to Akara for advice. She intoned that &lt;a href=\"dark%20magic\"&gt;dark magic&lt;/a&gt; had corrupted the forest, and as such, dark magic was needed to bind the ritual.\nAkara later travelled to the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Ruins\"&gt;Sanguine Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, where she found &lt;a href=\"Liene\"&gt;Liene&lt;/a&gt;, either dead, or dying. When the Shard-seeker returned after slaying the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt;, they found Akara grieving over Liene's body. Bitterly reflecting on the deaths of Hemlir, Liene, and dozens of sisters, Akara declared that they couldn't allow their sacrifices to be in vain. The Shard-seeker told her that while the Blood Rose was dead, &lt;a href=\"Lakrii\"&gt;Lakrii&lt;/a&gt; had sacrificed herself to the creature, and in doing so, had fully revived &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt;. Akara declared that she had to be slain, as such an evil could not be allowed to possess the power of the Worldstone. Intoning the deeds of the heroes she had encountered five years prior, she told the new Shard-seeker that like the ones before them, they would have to travel to the Forgotten Tower, join with Kashya and the Rogues making their attack, and slay the Countess.\nSome time later, Akarat noticed some activity with the cultists; they were drawn towards areas overrun by fallen. She sent &lt;a href=\"Tamara\"&gt;Tamara&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a fellow rogue, to investigate.\nC. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231273\"&gt;1273&lt;/a&gt;, Akarat made an order for a silver pendant with an engraving of the Sightless Eye from Charsi.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nAkara is located at the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt; in of &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "16122", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16122", "title": "Akarat", "text": "Akarat was an ascetic from &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt;. It was he who would develop the faith that would give rise to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; church.\nBy all accounts, Akarat was kind, generous, and unassuming, and exuded selflessness and compassion. He believed &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; existence was unique, and that humans had the power to overcome darkness using a special &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; within them.\nBiography.\nEarly Life.\nAkarat was born on Xiansai, though his mother originated from &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt;. She spoke about the inner conflict between the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic sides of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. Akarat's mother and many others from Nahantu had fled their homeland due to &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s Hatred corrupting the land. Life on Xiansai was arduous, and his parents worked and fought with exhaustive determination to make a place of safety for their family.\nAkarat's childhood friend was &lt;a href=\"Ysevete\"&gt;Ysevete&lt;/a&gt;, who was also the child of a Nahantu refugee, and the two were bonded like sister and brother. \nThe Coming of Yaerius.\nAccording to historical accounts, Akarat was a wandering ascetic from Xiansai. Having become disillusioned with society and its incessant conflicts, he joined the ranks of a humble meditative order that sought enlightenment and peace. One night, while deep in meditation, he envisioned a spectacular flash of light and energy cascading across the sky. According to most accounts, this was the coming of an &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Yaerius\"&gt;Yaerius&lt;/a&gt;, or \"son of light\" in Akarat's native language. It is said that Yaerius revealed to Akarat the tenets of what was to become the Zakarum faith. These teachings stressed the necessity of resisting all things evil, and embracing, with total devotion, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. The angel appointed Akarat to be the prophet of these new teachings, and bade him take the word to the people of all lands.\nA theory postulated by &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; diverged from this account however. He believed that Akarat had instead seen an echo of &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, as there had been reports of &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;mystics&lt;/a&gt; with similar experiences. Thus he theorized that while in meditation, Akarat had seen the same phenomenon and attributed it to a being named Yaerius, which meant \"Son of Light\" in his native language. Whatever the truth behind the matter, Akarat came from the experience with a belief that humans were powerful vessels of light, and that all should seek their \"inner light\" in order to live good lives.\nWord of the Prophet.\nMoved by what he'd seen, Akarat set out on a grand journey to the cities of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, intent on enlightening his fellow men about the divine Light he claimed existed within everyone. When Akarat left Xiansai, Ysevete went with him and became his first disciple, or Dedicant, and remained with him throughout his travels.\nHarkening back to the teachings of his mother, he claimed that human existence was unique, and that humans had the power to overcome darkness by using their inner Light. He claimed that his words were not new, that &lt;a href=\"the%20Ancients\"&gt;the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; had also embraced the Light. He travelled all across Sanctuary spreading his beliefs, and over time, a number of local disciples flocked to his side.\nWhen Akarat Came to Nahantu.\nAkarat vowed to one day return to his mother\u2019s homeland, and he was accompanied by four of his Dedicants: Ysevete, &lt;a href=\"Adavin\"&gt;Adavin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Istabela\"&gt;Istabela&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guilla\"&gt;Guilla&lt;/a&gt;. They found Nahantu to be a land infected by Hatred. Seeds of Hatred had corrupted the lush rainforests and fruitful fields, even the animals had turned wild and ravenous. \nThe choking miasma of the hostile jungle made the Dedicants hesitant to enter, but Akarat strode forth bare-foot through the poisonous swamps to embolden them. He instructed them to reach for the Light within themselves and look for the Light within Nahantu, which they found wanting to flow much like a great river, but it was effectively being strangled and dammed by corruption. Akarat and Ysevete sensed something else, the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt;, though they did not know what it was. Akarat thought the two of them perhaps had a deeper connection to the land because his mother and Ysevete's father were from Nahantu.\nOn their first night in Nahantu, Akarat and his disciples were attacked by hellish rodents, and before they could be overwhelmed an &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; warrior named &lt;a href=\"Tusega\"&gt;Tusega&lt;/a&gt; arrived to help. After the rodents fled, Tusega interrogated Akarat at spearpoint and, satisfied that they were not evil, told them that he had been seeking his brother, who had traveled to a nearby village but not returned yet. Ysevete volunteered to help, and Tusega was convinced they were sincere. \nTusega revealed that the rodents used to be peaceful creatures but they had been twisted by Seeds of Hatred. This troubled Akarat, and he realized that his great and final enemy would be the origin of this corruption: Mephisto. Akarat believed that the Light had guided him to Tusega, and that it had also brought Tusega to Akarat, and they stayed the night at Tusega's village.\nAt daybreak, the party set forth, with Tusega sharing his survival skills so they could better traverse the jungle. Tusega was asked why he stayed in Nahantu, and he said it was because he could still feel the spirit of the land, and Akarat said that he too could feel the spirit, though he was not sure what it was other than it likely was not the Light. They came upon an isolated homestead and found a scene of horror; Tusega's brother had been butchered while defending the family that lived there. After helping Tusega prepare to lay the fallen to rest, Akarat invited him to join them in their quest to cleanse Nahantu of corruption.\nTusega was skeptical that Akarat had the power to stand against the Hatred, but agreed to lead them to one of the Seeds of Hatred. Akarat and his disciples channeled the Light onto the Seed and not even its great evil could withstand their strength and it was destroyed. Tusega immediately became Akarat's Fifth Dedicant upon witnessing this feat, and the group began hunting down Seeds of Hatreds to purge.\nNews of the miracle that was happening in Nahantu spread to Caldeum, and a young merchant named &lt;a href=\"Jualin\"&gt;Jualin&lt;/a&gt; headed south in search of trade. When Jualin learned of Akarat, he immediately sought him out. Through the Light, Akarat could tell that Jualin was like a caged bird, and he laid his hands upon Jualin to show him the Light and provide the key to his own cage. After finding the Light and seeing the world anew, Jualin became the Sixth Dedicant, and the youngest of the disciples.\nAkarat and the Dedicants were able to heal and cleanse Nahantu and restored the land back to the way Tusega had heard of it in the old stories. Despite this progress, Akarat's heart sat ill at ease as he knew such a great evil would not be easily vanquished.\nAkarat believed that he and his disciples still had much to learn from Nahantu, and that the Light would guide them. Akarat silenced the doubts that crossed his Dedicants' minds, and they began fasting for eight days while listening to the Light within them. On the ninth day they set out into the jungle, with an upwelling of spirit guiding them, until they arrived at a glade which was not on any maps, and was later known to Spiritborn as Nahantu's Gift.\nAfter much contemplation, Akarat discovered a veil between the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt; and Sanctuary, a realm uninfluenced by angels and demons. It had been with him since he arrived in Nahantu, but had been hidden until he was ready to see it. Akarat became the first mortal to cross the border into the Spirit Realm, within he found a land that was not a land, a place that was nowhere and everywhere. The Spirit Realm was populated with animals, plants, and all manner of beings, some looked familiar, while others had stretched beyond the bounds of their earthly forms. Awestruck, Akarat wandered into the Spirit Realm until he realized he may not be able to leave, but the Light guided him back to Nahantu.\nThe Dedicants struggled to comprehend what Akarat described, and began asking him questions about the origin of the Spirit Realm. Akarat believed it was part of Sanctuary, bound together while also being distinct from each other. He did not know for certain when it may have been formed but he knew that it was ancient, and not without danger.\nAkarat began teaching the Dedicants how to travel into the Spirit Realm, and they then spent days exploring this strange new land, with the knowledge they learned becoming the origin of the Spiritborn. While they had their attention elsewhere, the Hatred had begun to reinfect Nahantu and Seeds of Hatred began to regrow. \nAkarat and the Wolf.\nAkarat had wondered why the Light had brought him to the Spirit Realm, and over time he had conversed with the powerful beings who guarded the Spirit Realm. One day, a spirit guardian named &lt;a href=\"Ah%20Buran\"&gt;Ah Buran&lt;/a&gt; delivered a warning to Akarat and told him that Nahantu was being corrupted again and that the only way to stop the Seeds of Hatred would be to destroy their maker. Akarat knew then what he must do for his final tasks on Sanctuary, though he kept this knowledge from his disciples.\nAkarat instructed the Dedicants to begin construction on the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Light\"&gt;Vault of Light&lt;/a&gt;. It would be a bastion that was simultaneously in both Nahantu and the Spirit Realm. The Vault of Light would serve as a place where those who sought the Light would find protection, peace, and safety from all evil.\nOn the eve before the Vault's completion, Akarat gathered his disciples for a celebration, and they all let the Light flow through them as they sang and danced. Akarat delivered a speech known as the Valediction of Akarat, in which he spoke against Hatred and reminded his followers that the Light was within all of them, and even if they were parted from him they would still be together through the Light. This speech left Ysevete unsettled, and she watched over him that night out of concern that he was going to be leaving them.\nAkarat left before dawn, with Ysevete following discretely, and headed out into the jungles. Akarat used the Light to purge Seeds of Hatred wherever he could find them, and healed the wildlife that tried to attack him. Ysevete remained hidden, to her shame, but would have helped Akarat if he had needed it. \nDeep within the jungle, the corruption was stronger and the Hatred was so vile that Ysevete nearly fled in fear, but the Light gave her strength. Akarat headed into a cave of darkness which Ysevete knew contained the source of corruption, she had never felt an evil so powerful, and she feared for Akarat's life.\nWithin the cave Akarat met the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Wolf\"&gt;Bloodied Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, an avatar of Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred. When the Wolf spoke, it caused so much agony for Ysevete that she was paralyzed, though she felt an even greater pain that she wasn't standing besides Akarat. Some would later believe that the Light itself had kept Ysevete back so that she could witness Akarat's sacrifice.\nThe very land of Nahantu trembled as Akarat and the Wolf battled; trees fell, rivers changed their courses, while animals cried out in a terrifying cacophony. Akarat fought hard, but he was but a mortal while his foe was deathless, and so as the battle wore on, and he felt his strength ebbing, Akarat chose to end the battle in his own fashion rather than risk the evil going undefeated. Akarart lured the Wolf to bite him, and after it had sunk its teeth into him he trapped it in an embrace from which it could not escape. Akarat unleashed the Light from within himself, which poured over the Wolf in an unforgiving splendor, as if the sun itself had left the sky and appeared within the cave.\nThe Light burned the Wolf, searing away the flesh and fur and charring the bones. The Wolf had never known such pain, nor such fear, and when Akarat's strength waned the demon Wolf fled deep into the caves until returning to the Burning Hells. The Wolf would remember what happened there in the cave, and this memory led to a festering hatred of Akarat and Nahantu.\nYsevete rushed forward and took the dying Akarat into her arms. He gazed up at the face of his beloved friend and smiled in joy, a smile that remained on his lips even after death. \nYsevete carried Akarat's body back to the Vault of Light. She and the other Dedicants were overwhelmed with grief and a sense of failure. They questioned how best they could honor Akarat's legacy, and Ysevete was enraged when Guilla and Jualin proposed writing scriptures to bring Akarat's teachings around the world. Tusega suggested that they could mimic the old stories of Nahantu, which had been passed down from generation to generation, and Jualin proposed placing the teachings into stories, fables, songs, and art. This too displeased Ysevete, as she believed there was nothing other than the Light which would be resistant to Hatred, but with all the other Dedicants against her she put aside the conflict so that they could see to Akarat's burial.\nDawn of the Spiritborn.\nWhen it was time for Akarat to make his final crossing into the Spirit Realm, it would be under the watch of his devoted followers. Ysevete had decided that they should entomb Akarat within the Vault of Light, where his body would be safe from any who would try to desecrate it. The Dedicants brought his body into the Spirit Realm, and finished constructing the Vault of Light around him. Istabela protected the tomb with wards and spells to guard it. Ysevete was the last to leave, after spending much time alone in sorrow. The tomb was sealed and Akarat's body remained safe in the Vault of Light, beyond the reach of corruption and decay.\nBack in Nahantu, Ysevete's cries of sorrow would reach the Spirit Realm and were met with support from the spirits. Ysevete, also originally from Nahantu, would go on to form the basis for the &lt;a href=\"Spiritborn\"&gt;Spiritborn&lt;/a&gt; culture using the tenets she and Akarat created.\nLight-Bringer.\nAfter Akarat died Ysevete\u2014unwilling to let him go, chased his soul into the Spirit Realm. It is unknown what magics she performed on him, but as a result (after an unknown length of time) Akarat was reborn as a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Guardian\"&gt;Spirit Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, taking the form of a lion. Akarat stated that the process was painful, and implied that the faith offered to him by the Zakarum and Spiritborn helped. Akarat's spirit was known to the Spiritborn as a light-bringer. He was also highly referred, as they trusted his words in most matters.\nLegacy.\nAkarat was one of the most important figures in the history of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. However, outside his circle of acolytes, Akarat's fate was unclear\u2014all that was known was that he had disappeared in the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; (of which Nahantu was then part of). Some say that his tomb was located in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Light\"&gt;Vault of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Akarat's teachings had left their mark, they would flounder in obscurity for a millennium. It was not until Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tassara\"&gt;Tassara&lt;/a&gt;'s codification of the Zakarum faith that it became an actual church, and subsequently, the dominant religious force on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.

He patrolled &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; and engaged in ring bouts, but due to the timing of his birth, never saw actual battle. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, after the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, he heard stories from men who had returned from the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;.

Cain told Akarat of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic invasion he feared was coming, and unlike so many others, Akarat believed him. As they travelled across &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, he was eager to hear Cain's stories, and the two stayed up long after they should have entered slumber.\nThe two entered the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;, where they came across a &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; repository. They entered it, and sensed they were not alone. Cain warned Akarat to ignore whatever voice he might hear, and asked him to guard the entrance. Despite Akarat's unease due to Cain's age, Cain assured him he would be alright. He would deal with whatever was in the repository, Akarat would guard against anything coming at them from outside.\nDespite this, the true threat was a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; who lurked inside the repository. Akarat drew his &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; against the creature, but it simply passed through its smoke-like body. The demon swirled around Akarat, showing him terrible visions, and whispered terrible things about Cain and Akarat himself. Cain used an &lt;a href=\"Ammuit\"&gt;Ammuit&lt;/a&gt; spell to buy them some time, but despite Cain's urgings, Akarat swore to kill the demon. To avenge &lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim&lt;/a&gt; and the corruption of Zakarum. \nThe demon took Akarat's own form, and the Paladin again drew his sword, and again, to no avail. The demon possessed him, and while Akarat was able to regain some control with Cain's urging, it was not enough.

He was assigned to teach the boy by the &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt;, after Zhota chose Ymil as his patron deity, hoping that Akyev's rigid demenor would temper Zhota's hesitent nature, and vice versa. When he first encountered him, he snapped Zhota's flute in half and tossed it out of the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Sky%20Monastery\"&gt;Floating Sky Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. They would spar together in the monestary's training grouns, Akyev wielding a &lt;a href=\"scimitar\"&gt;scimitar&lt;/a&gt; he had forged himself against Zhota's &lt;a href=\"bo\"&gt;bo&lt;/a&gt;. He easily defeated him, cutting into his staff, and commented that Zhota had \"too much of the rivers in him,\" touching on his disdain for Ymil. He would forbid Zhota from ever fixing the blemish, lest he forget the lessons imparted to him. Over the years, Akyev worked feverishly to suppress his pupil's insistence on trusting in himself when presented with difficult situations. Whether or not Zhota' insights were correct didn't matter to Akyev. He believed such reliance on the self would compromise one's ability to obey the Patriarchs' commands and prosecute their divine will. Zhota was eventually annointed as a Monk, but Akyev carried doubts as to whether he was truly ready.\nThe Gorgorra.\nA few weeks after Zhota became a Monk, and the day after the sighting of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;, Zhota was summoned to Akyev's side in the monastery. Akyev sent Zhota into the &lt;a href=\"Gorgorra\"&gt;Gorgorra&lt;/a&gt;, ordering that his disciple examine all travelers within the forest, but remain wary, lest they be tainted by gods of chaos. Those touched by those gods were to be \"purified,\" he ordered, relaying the decree of the &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt;. He departed the monestary on his own mission the next day, in order to find a demon wearing the skin of a child. He came across a caravan that had been transporting him and, after they cursed the names of the Patriarchs, slaughtered them all. He even hired bandits to find his quarry. He later encountered Zhota in the forest, finding him alongside &lt;a href=\"Mishka\"&gt;Mishka&lt;/a&gt;. The child that he'd sought. He commented that Zhota had succeeded where he'd failed, giving his former student praise for the first time. He told Zhota that Mishka was a demon wearing the skin of a child. Mishka called Akyev the demon\u2014lies to hide its true identity, according to Akyev. He recounted Mishka's tale, that he was the son of one of the Patriarchs and his concubine. He'd been born with deformities, but his mother had convinced his father to sequester him in the palace instead of killing him. Mishka had lived in isolation until the coming of the Fallen Star, causing paronoia to sweep Ivgorod. In this climate, Zhota summized that the Patriarch had ordered that Mishka be put to death, lest his purity be called into question. Thus, through the work of his mother and a few loyal servants, he was carried into the Gorgorra.\nAkyev was unmoved\u2014these were lies that the demon had told him. Zhota stated that he believed Mishka, causing Akyev to deliver a roundhouse kick into Zhota, winding him. Akyev disgustedly commented that Zhota was still a boy, and gave him a second kick as Zhota claimed that the Patriarch Akyev served was no longer interested in maintaining the balance between order and chaos. He scraped off the circles embodied on Zhota's forehead, stating that Zhota was no Monk. He ordered him to return to the monastery and await judgement. The two engaged in combat, Zhota once again wielding his bo against Akyev's scimitar. Akyev gained the upperhand, and was unmoved by Zhota's accusations of his brutality. For a moment, Akyev seemed to consider that Zhota was correct, that he'd been sent to kill an innocent. But only for a moment, as he swung his &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe sword was swung, but Zhota grabbed it, breaking the weapon in two. Zhota used the broken blade to decapitate his master. He then built a pyre to cremate his master's body. He took some solace in the knowledge that the Patriarch wouldn't be able to find another Monk like Akyev\u2014one who could slaughter innocents without hesitation.\nPersonality and Traits.\nBy all accounts, Akyev was one of the strictest and unforgiving members of his order. Many initiates have been gravely injured (and, according to rumor, even died), due to his brutal training methods. &lt;a href=\"Zaim\"&gt;Zaim&lt;/a&gt; was his patron god, and he regards the god &lt;a href=\"Ymil\"&gt;Ymil&lt;/a&gt; as being capricious and indesciscive. Unlike many of his fellows, he had no love of the arts, such as music. He believed in the concept of a Monk treating a weapon as a natural extension of their body. He never flinched from any task given to him. His fanaticism and willingness to do anything to achieve an objective given to him by the &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt; marked him as an oddity amongst the order. Likewise, unlike other teachers, he did not attempt to foster friendships with his students. His beard was black, without any gray."}

As a result, the nephalem's children were born weak with short lifespans. Alaric and his kin turned to the demon &lt;a href=\"Nereza\"&gt;Nereza&lt;/a&gt;, who promised to restore their power. Instead, she turned them into her servants and sent them to war against Alaric and his followers. \nAlaric declared that his people could survive the coming battle, but &lt;a href=\"Edric\"&gt;Edric&lt;/a&gt; \"saw the truth in his eyes.\" He sent Edric and other &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s to guard the Beacon of Honor at &lt;a href=\"Warrior%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Warrior's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.

Amused at Leah's ignorance of his kind and (surprisingly) untouched by the sword's effects, Alaric told them that only a nephalem could enter the temple, but told the group to fetch keys to enter the temple from its outlying tombs. The heroes succeeded, and Alaric directed them to enter the tomb and defeat his fellow guardians.\nThe heroes succeeded, and Alaric commented that the Nephalem's strength rivaled that of their greatest champions, realizing that the hero(es) was/were indeed nephalem, even if they didn't know it. Regardless, he granted the group access to the temple's most sacred ground, where they were able to retrieve the shard they sought.\nIn-game.\nAlaric appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".

In various forms, all six classes reply that, with all due respect, Alaric must be mistaken.

It has an unsettling aura. Home to power thought to be extinct from &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, the Altar of Rites will bestow these mystic forces upon worthy &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;...after a sacrifice is offered.\nIt is implied that the altar has a collective intelligence.\nHistory.\nThe altar dates back to Sanctuary's ancient past. It was rediscovered during/after the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt; amid a hunting/mining expedition from &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, which was searching for ancient nephalem artifacts. They dug out the altar, but as they did so, a faint whisper infiltrated one of the miners' thoughts; not one voice, but a collective. The miner didn't know who these voices were, but was certain that they had to share their discovery. They hauled the altar back to New Tristram. A few days passed, many townsfolk came to view the altar, then left. Then, &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; marched into town and requested to see the altar.\nShaken to their core by the eldritch aroma of the monolith, the citizens enlisted the assistance of brave &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; willing to investigate. To unlock the powers of the altar, the nephalem had to travel all over &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. They also had to deal with scores of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s hellbent on preventing them from acquiring the altar's full power.\nGameplay.\n&lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt;al characters can interact with the Altar of Rites in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; as soon as &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 1. It contains 26 Seals connected in a progression tree. Seals are unlocked by sacrificing specific items to the Altar, and each one grants a bonus. Players have some discretion as to which order to unlock Seals, constrained by the tree. At the bottom of the tree are three &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt; Powers which are unlocked by sacrificing &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Ashes\"&gt;Primordial Ashes&lt;/a&gt;. A final sigil below everything else can be unlocked for free once the entire tree is complete.\nAll unlocked powers apply to every Seasonal character on the account with the same &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Solo%20Self%20Found\"&gt;Solo Self Found&lt;/a&gt; status. It is expected that players can unlock the entire Altar with a reasonable amount of effort each Season. The powers last for the entire Season, after which the Altar starts over with no Seals unlocked when a new one begins.\nThe Altar was introduced for &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season&lt;/a&gt; 28 with extremely powerful bonuses. These bonuses were reduced coinciding with the Altar becoming a recurring Seasonal feature starting with Season 30, although they remain very strong.\nSeals.\nThis table shows the names, lore, and powers of every Seal or Potion, labeled by their position in the progression tree shown below.\nThe original bonuses from Season 28 are stated in footnotes. Generally, the quality of life bonuses remain the same, while combat bonuses were reduced.\nUnlocking Seals.\nPlayers must select any locked Seal on the Altar of Rites screen to see which materials they must sacrifice. The cost is the same regardless of which Seal is chosen, but after any unlock, the cost for the \"next\" unlock changes, following a preset sequence listed below. When a specific item is required, the player chooses the one to sacrifice from their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlocking Potion powers works the same way, except they have their own simple sequence of &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Ashes\"&gt;Primordial Ashes&lt;/a&gt; costs: 55, then 110, then 165 Ashes for the respective unlocks, regardless of order and independent of Seal unlock progress.\nThe topmost Seal A must always be unlocked first. For subsequent powers, at least one Seal preceding or adjacent to it (connected from above or horizontally) must first be unlocked. For example, to unlock Seal D or E, Seal B must first be unlocked. To unlock R, any one of L, M, or S must be unlocked.\nUnlocking the final, bottom sigil requires no sacrifice, only that all other Seals and Potions have been unlocked. Doing so grants its power as well as the &lt;a href=\"Wings%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Wings of Terror&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cosmetic\"&gt;cosmetic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is no restriction on the rate of unlocks other than the materials the player can gather. A &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Rift\"&gt;Challenge Rift&lt;/a&gt; cache is the only time-restricted material, although some others may be hard to come by.\nAfter unlocking any Seal's powers, its generic text changes to a small story scrap about &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s tumultuous past, and the Seal's name is revealed.\nCosts.\nBelow are the costs to unlock additional Seals:\n\u2020 Bounty materials: &lt;a href=\"Khanduran%20Rune\"&gt;Khanduran Rune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caldeum%20Nightshade\"&gt;Caldeum Nightshade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20War%20Tapestry\"&gt;Arreat War Tapestry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Angel%20Flesh\"&gt;Corrupted Angel Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Westmarch Holy Water&lt;/a&gt;"}

In the jungles of their homeland, Amazons are adept at the tactics of misdirection, and can even draw on the jungle to support themselves. The jungle itself can be a hindrance though, and early in training, Amazon warriors are taught how to overcome these conditions. Indeed, all Askarri are taught how to hunt and fight during the night of the jungles.\nIntense training and stern discipline make Amazon warriors formiddable foes. Their agility and combination of magical and martial prowess make them flexible and adept opponents in battle. Specific training is carried out to help Amazon warriors avoid potentially devastating blows. Through strict martial discipline and focus, an Amazon warrior can attune herself to her environment and the dangers around her, allowing her to react to these hazards with superhuman agility. One aspect of this ability is her knack for avoiding missile fire.\nOn the martial side, Amazon warriors are highly regarded with their skill with the &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, their ability rivaled only by the Sisters of the Sightless Eye. Unlike the Sisterhood though, Amazons are also adept in the use of the &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; and other such weapons. In regards to magic, Amazons can wield &lt;a href=\"prime%20magic\"&gt;prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"holy%20magic\"&gt;holy magic&lt;/a&gt;. \nSome Amazons take upon the path of the healer, a worthy path due to the toxicity of many native plant species in their homeland. They may also be blessed by their deities should they prove worthy. \nTales of the Amazons' almost supernatural skills are well known throughout &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to guarding their homeland, Amazons are assigned to guard the vast Askari merchant fleets. They are a common sight beyond Skovos.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of the caste lie with the tale of &lt;a href=\"Philios%20%28Nephalem%29\"&gt;Philios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Askarra\"&gt;Askarra&lt;/a&gt;, their coupling giving birth to twin girls. The girls grew, and upon hearing tales of the &lt;a href=\"Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; (an artifact once held by the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lycander\"&gt;Lycander&lt;/a&gt;,) vowed to recover it. Finding the Eye on &lt;a href=\"Skovos\"&gt;Skovos&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered that while they could not use it to communicate with &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, they could use it to see the future. So it was that their culture grew with the Sightless Eye at the heart of their society. From the more stalwart sister, the Amazon Caste descended, while from the more ethereal one would come the Oracle Caste.\nRecent History.\nThe Oracle Caste predicted not only the events of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, but that the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; would return to plague the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;mortal world&lt;/a&gt; again. Thus, the Amazon Caste trained for millennia in preparation for the day in which they would be needed. Their efforts were rewarded when both events came to pass. One of their number, &lt;a href=\"Cassia\"&gt;Cassia&lt;/a&gt;, joined a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; that defeated the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the oracles' predictions had not ended there\u2014&lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s would return to once again plague &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mankind&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Cassia returned to her people to raise an army, rising through the caste's ranks to become its most distinguished commander."}

The Blades condemn the Scorpions' forced labor and attacks on caravans, and take every opportunity to disrupt their most vicious plans. Whether this approach is a matter of morality or a recruiting technique is known only to the Amber Blades themselves.\nThe Amber Blades appear to be interested in retrieving old kingdom artifacts.\nHistory.\nThe Amber Blades apparently split off from the Sand Scorpions; a crime that the Scorpions never forgave them for. While the Scorpions sought to continue the legacy of the &lt;a href=\"Fahiran%20Empire\"&gt;Fahiran Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Blades sought to transcend it. The two groups clashed over what few resources remained in the dunes of Shassar. \nThe Blades were able to establish their own encampment, and held out, albeit barely. Over the years, many adventurers spoke with the Blades, seeking information on Shassar's tombs, but according to Tabril, all of these adventurers \"wound up the same.\" Over time, the Blades and Scorpions continued to fight each other over control of Shassar.\nThe Light of Fahir.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, the Blades' encampment came under repeated attack by the &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt;. After one that injured a number of the camp's guards, and with a number of men taken captive, Tabri led a cadre into the desert to confront them. The lacuni were repelled with the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, who later slew a lacuni &lt;a href=\"Alvas\"&gt;pack leader&lt;/a&gt;. Its pelt was hung by the gates, but Tabri ordered the Blades to continue their patrols, and not be complacent despite their victory.\nThe Sand Scorpions later attacked &lt;a href=\"Sereth%20Outpost\"&gt;Sereth Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. However, the attack was repelled. Later, Tabri led the Blades into the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Chamber of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, where the hero(es) presented her with the last piece of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;Scepter of Fahir&lt;/a&gt;. With the scepter in hand, Tabri declared herself to be the new ruler of Shassar, and with it, she had a symbol the people of Shassar could rally behind against &lt;a href=\"Vataos\"&gt;Vataos&lt;/a&gt;. The Amber Blades knelt before her. Later, Peth told the hero(es) that thanks to their efforts, the Blades would retake Shassar.\nDespite this, the Blades still had to contend with the &lt;a href=\"lacuni\"&gt;lacuni&lt;/a&gt;. The panther-men attacked a small &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, killing dozens and causing the residents to flee. The Blades were unable to retake the village, let alone reclaim Shassar. They requested aid from any able-bodied fighters in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; to help them in their reclamation.\nCurse of the Scepter.\nAfter Tabri obtained the Scepter of Fahir, she declared war on the Sand Scorpions. She tried to strike against the Scorpions, but the Amber Blades were overwhelmed, and chased into the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;. Tabri disappeared during the night, intent on facing Vataos. Using a &lt;a href=\"terminus\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt;, she entered the &lt;a href=\"Obliterated%20Realm\"&gt;Obliterated Realm&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"terminus\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt;, but Vataos followed her. In the ensuing fight, both Vataos and Tabri were left in the realm, and &lt;a href=\"Zov\"&gt;Zov&lt;/a&gt; obtained the scepter, promptly abandoning the Amber Blades, intent on selling it.\nWith Tabri's apparent &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peth\"&gt;Peth&lt;/a&gt; became the new leader of the Blades.\nIn-game.\nThe Amber Blades feature in the Shassar Sea &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

The amount is fixed: only radius and duration increase with the skill level. In other words, Amplify Damage at least doubles the effectiveness of physical damage, and is most useful against tough &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Unique Bosses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Champions\"&gt;Champions&lt;/a&gt;, and monsters that raise other monsters such as &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mummy\"&gt;Mummies&lt;/a&gt;.

Additional points into this skill increases the area of effect, but does not further lower physical resistance. As such, more points are generally redundant, particularly for players that have access to +skill items.\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 4Physical Resist: -100%\nDiablo III.\nWhile no class in D3 can make use of Amplify Damage as a curse, it returned in form of &lt;a href=\"Succubi\"&gt;Succubi&lt;/a&gt; special ability: their attacks would halve the victim's &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; (removed in later patch).

The trade city has existed for thousands of years, predating even the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;.

The councilmen saw opportunity in the rapidly growing &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith, and they allowed the fanatics to build their enormous cathedral, &lt;a href=\"Saldencal\"&gt;Saldencal&lt;/a&gt;, within the center of the city.\" (\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Road%20to%20Alcarnus\"&gt;The Road to Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt;\")\n3. \"Not content to reign supreme in commerce and religion, the trade consortium council aspired to make Caldeum a nexus of learning as well. It proposed to unite the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; academics in a massive new structure - the &lt;a href=\"Yshari%20Sanctum\"&gt;Yshari Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; - which has remained a beacon of knowledge and advancement ever since.\" (\"&lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience\"&gt;A Royal Audience&lt;/a&gt;\")\n4. \"Caldeum changed drastically in recent years when the &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; nobles all but invaded the city. Soon after, their emperor, &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20I\"&gt;Hakan I&lt;/a&gt;, joined them and made Caldeum his capital. Though his actions seemed audacious, he managed to bring further peace and prosperity to the city for the duration of his reign.\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Unexpected%20Allies\"&gt;Unexpected Allies&lt;/a&gt;\")\n5. \"All was well under the new emperor until his untimely death forced the Zakarum priests to find a new heir for &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;'s throne. Through a series of elaborate rituals (undoubtedly a spectacle for their superstitious followers), they determined an impoverished &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;infant&lt;/a&gt; in the north was Hakan I's spiritual successor.\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Betrayer%20of%20the%20Horadrim\"&gt;Betrayer of the Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;\")\n6. \"After the Zakarum priests' rituals were complete, they employed a group of reckless mercenaries, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, to retrieve the child. They dubbed him Hakan II and installed him on the throne despite his scant years. Caldeum has been in decline ever since, and I can see no reprieve in sight.\" (\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;The Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;\")"}

Each of their arms stood for one of the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s of the Council, with the sixth symbolizing the order and harmony that bound them together. Anyone standing near them experienced calm introspection.\nLike other former servants of Malthael, the Anarchs fell to darkness once they joined their master in &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;. Their radiant wings disappeared, and their ethereal bodies were replaced with twisted flesh. Once known for their calm, balanced counsel, the Anarchs now only possess malice and cruelty, and the insatiable desire to destroy all living things.

They move quickly, floating above the ground, and can, if necessary, get beyond the normal borders, flying over empty space. Their melee blows from six bladed arms deal fast and deadly strikes. When encountered in groups, they can dispatch an average hero in a matter of two or three seconds, should they get close enough.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Angel\"&gt;Corrupted Angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Thrall\"&gt;Dark Thrall&lt;/a&gt;s, Anarchs can also charge, rushing roughly 40 yards forward and dealing high damage and Knockback to everything they reach. Alternatively, they can make a brief (20 yards) dash in close combat. In addition, their charge leaves a trail of energy that deals periodic damage. Before the charge, Anarchs prepare for a second, giving players time to move aside.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s, it's not uncommon to meet a group of Anarchs along with Corrupted Angels. Due to continuous Knockback from charges, this may be a very challenging monster combination.\nDevelopment.\nAnarchs were originally labeled as \"Wraiths.\""}

The attributes are increased by earning Activity Points from &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Cyrangar\"&gt;Defense of Cyrangar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Purge%20the%20Depths\"&gt;Purge the Depths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt; raids, &lt;a href=\"Bounties\"&gt;Bounties&lt;/a&gt;, s and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rift\"&gt;Elder Rift&lt;/a&gt;s. The points earned are increased when doing these with Warbands, Friends or Clans. The amount of points gained depends on the difference between the current Seeker Rating and the Server Seeker Rating, which increases by 10 per week. Players below the server rating get a boosted increase, while players above it are penalized.\nEvery 300 activity points are automatically converted into 5 Seeker Rating and 1 in each of the 5 stats.\nHistory.\nOriginally, the Tableau was part of the &lt;a href=\"Warband\"&gt;Warband&lt;/a&gt; interface, and provided a direct &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Rating\"&gt;Combat Rating&lt;/a&gt; bonus plus the stat bonuses when upgraded.\n&lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Weapons\"&gt;Ancestral Weapons&lt;/a&gt; needed to be placed in the Tableau, and their attributes served as a cap for the bonuses from the Tableau. This was removed in the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Manifest\"&gt;Nightmare Manifest&lt;/a&gt; update, after which the Tableau simply provided bonuses based on its upgrade level.\nGetting the bonuses required joining a warband, and even though the upgrades stayed when changing warbands, a player who quit their warband would temporarily lose the bonus, and had to join a new warband and earn 400 warband activity points to reactivate the bonus. In the update, it was moved to the newly introduced &lt;a href=\"Seeker%27s%20Path\"&gt;Seeker's Path&lt;/a&gt;, and the warband-related aspects were dropped. \"Warband Activity Points\" were renamed to \"Activity Points\".\nOriginally, Activity Points had a weekly cap of 1500, with the first 1000 points obtained at a 4x rate. Each upgrade of the Tableau cost 300 points (with the first few upgrades costing less), but the stats and Combat Rating gained was decreased depending on the player's tableau level compared to the server's level. In the update, the weekly cap was removed, each upgrade was fixed to provide 1 point in the five stats and 5 Seeker Rating, and instead the reduction was applied to the activity points themselves."}

When the monastery came under attack during the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Crusade\"&gt;Zakarum Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sladyan\"&gt;patriarch&lt;/a&gt; of the monastery released it as a last ditch effort to defeat the legion of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s besieging the monastery.\nThe Ancient Nightmare proceeded to spread its corruption throughout the monastery and its &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Valley\"&gt;surroundings&lt;/a&gt;, draining everyone caught in it and turning them to &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, using the stolen essence to birth a &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28monster%29\"&gt;new type of demons&lt;/a&gt;.

Together, the discovered the Silent Monastery and killed the Ancient Nightmare.\nReborn.\nThe Ancient Nightmare still stalks the Misty Valley presently, but brave &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s are always there to defeat it each time it reforms.\nAppearance.\nOriginally, the Ancient Nightmare was indistinguishable from the Black Mist. It first took form as a blue humanoid behemoth when it possessed Sladyan.\nAfter it reformed, it retained a similar look as before, but with fewer and thicker horns; and a more bestial visage.\nIn-game.\nThe Ancient Nightmare is the final &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; of the Silent Monastery . It has abilities similar to that of a &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;, but with &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; element.\nAfter it reforms, it acts as the boss for the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nightmare%20%28event%29\"&gt;Ancient Nightmare (event)&lt;/a&gt;. It still retains some abilities like a &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20Strike%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29%23Modifications\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkills.\nPhase 1.\n\"You have seen the forbidden, and for that you must die.\"\nPhase 2.\n\"Join me in the darkness!\"\nPhase 3.\n\"The Mists will spread and blot out the Light of Zakarum.\"\nPersonality and Traits.\nAs a nascent consciousness, the Ancient Nightmare's personality was heavily influenced by Sladyan (It spoke of saving Ivgorod). \nAfter Sladyan's consciousness within it was destroyed, the Ancient Nightmare had a basic personality that was defined by its hatred (especially towards the Zakarum), and its desire to spread it's Mist to swallow everything in darkness\nAbilities.\nLike all &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28monster%29\"&gt;nightmares&lt;/a&gt;, the Ancient Nightmare's heavily aligned towards &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; element, and can be incapacitated by &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a mist, it was capable of draining essence from &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; was then used to create different minions. Because of its corrupted nature, the victims were turned into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; after they died. After gaining form, it created &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Sorceress\"&gt;specialized&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;nightmares&lt;/a&gt; to harvest essence more efficiently, and control other nightmares.\nWhen it gained form after possessing Sladyan, it got many of his abilities, like the high speed movement used by monks. It could perform &lt;a href=\"Wave%20Strike\"&gt;Piercing Energy&lt;/a&gt; and different variants of . It also got better control of its previous abilities over shadow and &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; like a basic shadow bolt and . It could also release Black Mists from its body to consume people, though this could be resisted.\nAfter reforming, it lost most of the abilities it got from its host, but retained a few abilities like a powerful shield similar to &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Zen\"&gt;Shield of Zen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20Strike%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29%23Modifications\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;. It could also vomit a dark fluid which formed pools of darkness which harmed any who stood on them. It has a few crowd control abilities like massive Bone Spikes, and the waller &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Traits%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;trait&lt;/a&gt;."}

It pledged itself to Lord &lt;a href=\"Zir\"&gt;Zir&lt;/a&gt;, who promised his followers immortality. The nephalem, now a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; (and a powerful one at that) apparently descended into the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;City of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; to follow Zir into slumber. However, something apparently went wrong, as the vampire's skull was separated from its body, and the skull itself placed in the &lt;a href=\"Fetid%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Fetid Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason of Blood.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;Eons later&lt;/a&gt;, the skull was retrieved from the mausoleum and drenched in &lt;a href=\"potent%20blood\"&gt;potent blood&lt;/a&gt;, reviving it. The skull was aghast, in that not only was its body missing, but that Zir's promises of immortality had turned out to be bunk. It beheld the &lt;a href=\"Erys\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; before it, and could tell that Zir had tried to turn the latter into a vampire. The skull agreed to help the pair kill Zir, after which, it would sleep. To this end, it opened a portal to the City of the Ancients. The pair passed through, but quickly returned, as they were unable to progress through the city.\nThe skull advised the Wanderer that if they wished to defeat the undying, they too would have to become undying themselves. More specifically, it advised them to slay Zir's &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Seekers\"&gt;Blood Seekers&lt;/a&gt; and cripple his forces. The Wanderer departed, and while they were gone, the skull noticed that Erys \"learnt something,\" apparently by going over various texts. Whatever the case, Erys departed, leaving the skull alone.\nAt some point after Erys left, the office was ransacked by Zir's Bloodseekers, and the skull was knocked out of its basin, and the blood keeping it 'alive.' The Wanderer returned, slew the Bloodseekers, placed the skull back in the basin, and used their own blood to revive it. The skull told them that Erys had departed, and told them that they reeked of vampirism. That they were becoming more and more like Zir, and Erys didn't like it.\nAfter the Wanderer left, Erys left as well to pursue her own agenda. When she returned to the office, she found that the skull was missing.\nIn-game.\nThe Ancient Skull technically first appears as an item in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Profane%20Vampire%20Skull\"&gt;Profane Vampire Skull&lt;/a&gt;. Curiously enough, the item's image depicts what appears to be a standard human skull, bereft of a vampire's telltale fangs.\nThe Ancient Skull, once revived, serves as an NPC in the &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%27s%20Office\"&gt;Magistrate's Office&lt;/a&gt; sub-zone in &lt;a href=\"Ked%20Bardu\"&gt;Ked Bardu&lt;/a&gt;."}

When they left, it became ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Prevailing%20Wind\"&gt;Prevailing Wind&lt;/a&gt;, who was elected from a council of elders. Law and order was maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Conservator\"&gt;Conservator&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 who act as judges and assign punishments, and the &lt;a href=\"Sanctifier\"&gt;Sanctifier&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 who act as enforcers and enact punishments. \nThe Inari and Lilin grew crops in &lt;a href=\"the%20Granges\"&gt;farmlands&lt;/a&gt; located near settlements. However, they didn't raise &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s. Instead careful hunting practices allowed diverse fauna to persist on the island for millennia. In times of hardship, resources are rationed and distributed to everyone.\nHistory.\n was imbued by &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20of%20Life\"&gt;Fire of Life&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; was stored in Ancients' Cradle before being moved to where &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; would be formed around it.\nThe Inari and Lilin remained in conflict, each culture trying to recreate &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; on the island respectively, using whatever means were at hand. Famine regularly struck the island.\nIn the 13th century, after the latest round of famine (and resulting acrimony between both peoples), a Lilin elder named &lt;a href=\"Morwith\"&gt;Morwith&lt;/a&gt;, along with other Lilin she convinced to follow her absconded with the &lt;a href=\"Pathstone\"&gt;Pathstone&lt;/a&gt;. This event would later be known as the Mutinous Concord. As a result, the Fire of Life became unstable, and swept across the island, causing social breakdown in both cultures, and ravaging the island's flora and fauna, twisting them into new monstrosities.\nLater the island was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, who sought a means to purify a Worldstone shard. Shortly later, &lt;a href=\"Zatham\"&gt;an exiled Inari&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;an outsider&lt;/a&gt; arrived in pursuit of the cult. The Cult ravaged the land capturing the natives to be interrogated and or sacrificed. They also attempted to commune with the Fire of Life directly or using a captured islander as a proxy, but were rejected on both occasions. \nThe cult then tried to harvest the components of Life's Fire separately. They were able to harvest some of the Mother's Legacy but were stopped by Sacred Guardian on their way to the Father's Legacy. The guardians were easily defeated with a blast of Mother's Legacy which corrupted them, and began to corrupt &lt;a href=\"Shieldholm\"&gt;Shieldholm&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, the cult was unable to breach the barrier around Inarius's Shrine.\nIn-game.\nAncients' Cradle is a zone in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

As the Eyes are usually guarded by &lt;a href=\"Talons%20of%20Skarn\"&gt;Talons of Skarn&lt;/a&gt;, he couldn't carelessly attack it. Luckily, the Shard-seeker was passing by, and they agreed to distract the Talons while he binds the Eye. As a \"reward\", Andalon allowed them to deal the final blow to the Eye and crush its core.\nIn-game.\nAndalon appears in the Realm of Damnation &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;line in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

She controlled the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Realm of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. She was considered to be a close confidante of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and, in a sense, the \"twin sister\" of Duriel due to their similar domains of anguish and pain.\nThe Dark Exile.\nThe Lesser Evils came to be discontent with the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s' focus on &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, furious that the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt; had been apparently abandoned. Led by &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, the Lesser Evils enacted a stratagem to overthrow the Three. Andariel and &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; had their doubts at first, afraid that they would fall in the coming conflict. &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; however, kept them in the fold. The plan worked, and Andariel revelled in Diablo's misery, enjoying a state of unmatched bliss through the humiliation of her former ally. However, the pact that the Lesser Evils had made soon fell apart, as Azmodan and Belial warred for the position of the supreme ruler of Hell. She aided the Evils for many years, but eventually lost faith in their plots.\nThe Return of the Three.\nNearly three hundred years after the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo finally escaped from his captivity beneath the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, heading east to reunite with his brothers, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. Andariel and Duriel concluded that the Primes would inevitably reclaim their position in Hell. Therefore, they endeavored to gain favor with the Lord of Terror by protecting his &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;human host&lt;/a&gt;. Andariel was thus sent by Diablo himself to invade the citadel of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; in order to close the passage through the mountains into the desolate eastern lands of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. During the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20Gate\"&gt;Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;sisters&lt;/a&gt; were slain and &lt;a href=\"Corrupt%20Rogue\"&gt;others were turned&lt;/a&gt; to serve Andariel herself. Her foul &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s corrupted part of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;. By the time Diablo arrived and passed through the &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;Eastgate Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Andariel's position of power was well solidified. She sent &lt;a href=\"the%20Slayer\"&gt;the Slayer&lt;/a&gt; to guard the path between &lt;a href=\"Waystruck\"&gt;Waystruck&lt;/a&gt; and the Rogue Citadel.\nThe brief, yet horrific Reign of Anguish-reign did not last long however, as a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo_II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; pursuing Diablo stormed the monastery, eventually coming to face off against Andariel on the fourth level of the catacombs. She not only struck out at her foes physically, but battered them emotionally as well, stirring within each of them; memories of loss, sadness, betrayal, regret, guilt, even as she fed upon on their anger and relished in their despair. Despite the heavy toll on the minds of those whom she attacked however, the heroes managed to and succeeded in dispatching her, sending Andariel back to Hell through the flames that she so hated.\nAndariel had failed in killing Diablo's pursuers but had still bought Diablo valuable time. Even after her death, the corruption she'd inflicted on the Dark Wood remained, and &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt; made their homes beneath the trees she had corrupted.\nThe Black Soulstone.\nDue to the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;, Andariel's spirit eventually wound up in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. Andariel was the first essence which Adria marked; the ritual was quick, just as Diablo had promised. As she drew Andariel's soul into the Black Soulstone, Andariel looked into Adria's soul as she tried to subdue hers. The Maiden of Anguish discovered what Adria was trying to do, and fought as hard as she could. Adria later reflected that if Andariel had been fully formed, she would have been defeated. Nevertheless, Anguish's essence was marked.\nOver 20 years after her defeat, Andariel become merged with Diablo, now the sole Prime Evil left. After Diablo's defeat, all the lords of Hell were returned to the Black Soulstone, with their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s screaming for release. The stone was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to defeat &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, but he was defeated, and Diablo freed as a result, still containing the essence of Andariel and the other Evils. However, eventually, Andariel's spirit was able to break free from Diablo, just as all the other Evils. She was chained and put in a yoke by other demons, due to how dangerous she was and that she couldn't be trusted.\nAndariel's Return.\nElias planned to summon Andariel and take her power as part of his measures against the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the ritual was disrupted by and &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taissa\"&gt;the chosen sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; rescued.\nAs a result Taissa (the woman rescued from the sacrifice) was constantly plagued with the whispers and taunts of Andariel. with her voice getting louder over time.\nElias tracked them down to &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Chapel\"&gt;an abandoned chapel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Scarp\"&gt;the outskirts&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tarsarak\"&gt;Tarsarak&lt;/a&gt;. He was able to capture Taissa and complete the ritual, using her as \"a beacon across realms\" to summon Andariel. Andariel was defeated by the Wanderer. Her shackles were left behind in the sand.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nAndariel is the &lt;a href=\"Act%20Boss\"&gt;Act Boss&lt;/a&gt; of the first &lt;a href=\"The%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;act&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and is found on the fourth level of the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs\"&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. The first rooms are filled with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic minions; it is usually best to clear them so you can focus on Andariel herself. However, high-level characters that plan on rushing Andariel can safely skip the first two rooms altogether. Open the gates and proceed into the throne room; if you venture far enough, Andariel should approach you, saying either \"\"Die, Maggot!\" or \"Fear me!\"\"\nIt might be best to fight Andariel in the room with the blood pool in the center; you can run around the pool while Andariel chases you when you need to buy some time for healing potions to take effect or to flee back to town via the Town Portal. Andariel uses a potent &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Spray\"&gt;Poison Spray&lt;/a&gt; ability that spreads in a large area: &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; units and &lt;a href=\"minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt;s that get hit will most likely die from the &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; damage, given enough time. When you engage with her in melee combat, she can still poison you.\nThough it is possible to limit the &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; from the poison attacks by getting &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Resistance\"&gt;Poison Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and bringing &lt;a href=\"Antidote%20Potion\"&gt;Antidote Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, it is probably better to just heal through the poison damage with healing potions or retreating to town to avail Akara of her healing services. Andariel hits for a decent amount of damage in melee combat as well. Just keep hitting her and she will eventually fall (if you run out of potions, you can always portal back to the Rogue Encampment and get some more). Andariel has negative &lt;a href=\"Resistances\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; of -50. That means &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; attacks deal extra damage to her, so use Fire-based attacks or spells if possible.\nWhen Andariel dies, her body erupts in a pillar of flame, and the ground shakes as chunks of the ceiling fall down (the debris is not harmful), and a &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; opens up, which will take you back to the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;Rogue Encampment&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the way to the east is opened once more, and you can continue your journey to . If you return, the fallen ceiling debris will have \"magically\" disappeared due to the game engine's limitations.\nIn Andariel's throne room, there is a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Throne\"&gt;Bone Throne&lt;/a&gt; placed at the back, surrounded by flames, which can sometimes be looted through a glitch. Other than to function as a stand-in decoration, it serves no other purpose.\nNamesakes.\n, a , can be retrieved in the game.\nTactics.\nAndariel has a weakness for any fire-based damage, so try to use fire-based skills and weapons as much as possible. Amazons can use &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Arrow\"&gt;Fire Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, Paladins can use &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt;, Sorceresses can use any fire skill she might possess, and so on. Melee builds can also opt to augment their weapons with rubies or use charms to increase their fire damage if concerned about spending skill points on skills they will use only once. While Andariel's poison can be quite lethal, returning to town whenever the poison damage starts to overtake the healing effect, and returning to the battle is an effective tactic. Here are some helpful hints on how to beat her with different classes:\n&lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; - Utilize ranged attacks. Using a bow or javelins from long range allows Amazons to stay away from Andariel and possibly dodging some of her &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; attacks. Any damage increasing &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Arrow\"&gt;Fire Arrow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Arrow\"&gt;Cold Arrow&lt;/a&gt; will help.\n - If dual weapons are in use, then skills like &lt;a href=\"Double%20Swing\"&gt;Double Swing&lt;/a&gt; are excellent. Mana Stealing/Life Stealing weapons are useful too. Andariel isn't too tough to kill and should go down fairly quickly by good weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Boulder\"&gt;Molten Boulder&lt;/a&gt; or your best ranged weapon or spell. If you are a Shape Shifter, &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; can be good for fast damage, or &lt;a href=\"Werebear\"&gt;Werebear&lt;/a&gt; for added hit points and damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; - The Sorceress is an excellent spell caster. The main downfall for the Sorceress is her weak armor and health but, if she can get &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; into the room outside her starting room and get her stuck on one side of the lake, the sorceress may bombard her with as many spells as possible before she can retaliate. If she attempts to get within melee range, use &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Spells\"&gt;Cold Spells&lt;/a&gt; to slow her down. &lt;a href=\"Static%20Field\"&gt;Static Field&lt;/a&gt; is quite effective here, but keep in mind that in order to use it one has to get perilously close to the Maiden of Anguish. Use it once or twice to drop Andariel's hit points by about 1/3, and then get away. Do not forget that the element of Fire is Andariel's weakness, making spells like Fire Ball and Enchant useful, even on Nightmare/Hell. If you have Blaze, have her chase the sorceress, cast, and enjoy the spectacle.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; - Make sure to kill the creatures in Andariel's throne room before the fight. These corpses will provide a nearby place to raise more skeletons if the necromancer is utilizing summoning skills, but be aware that skeletons tend to die extremely quickly to Andariel's poison. Also, keep a golem in action at all times, as they are good tanks for the weaker skeletons. Use Poison and Bone spells to whittle down Andariel's life quickly while she is distracted, and Amplify Damage is a great way to bring her down.\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; - The &lt;a href=\"Might\"&gt;Might&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Concentration\"&gt;Concentration&lt;/a&gt; auras massively increase the Paladin's damage output; direct damage attacks such as &lt;a href=\"Zeal\"&gt;Zeal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vengeance\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; help out too. The &lt;a href=\"Cleansing\"&gt;Cleansing&lt;/a&gt; aura can also help the Paladin and his group if poison is an issue. The &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Fire\"&gt;Holy Fire&lt;/a&gt; aura is also a good offensive tool against the Maiden of Anguish, though this will not add fire damage to any other friendly entities nearby.\n&lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Strike\"&gt;Tiger Strike&lt;/a&gt; with a good finishing move can help bring down Andariel. Use traps to increase damage output.\nDiablo Immortal.\nAndariel is referenced in the flavor text of the &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Branch\"&gt;Blackened Branch&lt;/a&gt; quest item.\nDiablo III.\n&lt;a href=\"Andariel%27s%20Visage%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Andariel's Visage&lt;/a&gt; makes a return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Andariel's extra appendages can be received as &lt;a href=\"Anguish%27s%20Grasp\"&gt;wings&lt;/a&gt; as a reward for completing &lt;a href=\"Season\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt;'s journey.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Essence of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained, representing Andariel.\nDiablo IV.\nAndariel appears as the boss of of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". She is summoned to Sanctuary through a ritual performed by &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;Elias&lt;/a&gt;, using the witch &lt;a href=\"Taissa\"&gt;Taissa&lt;/a&gt; as a portal. She is initially fought with her back limbs shackled, but breaks free as the fight progresses. On phase one, Andariel lumbers about the chapel yard, casting rune chains, three waves of flames twice, a large fan of flames twice, and heat seeking firebolts, and even teleport from one area to the next to repeat this process. She cannot be attacked while teleporting. On phase two, Andariel attacks using the chains on her arms as a burning whip swung vertically or horizontally that leaves fire walls that inflict damage, an overhead claw and sting, a vicious quadruple sting, and a swinging sting that inflicts nasty knockback, while summoning rune chains. She will also throw a downward fire punch that inflicts knockback if one is standing too close. On certain parts of phase two, she will also power herself up for a short moment, making her attacks faster.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Andariel\"&gt;Echo of Andariel&lt;/a&gt; was added in .\nPersonality and Traits.\nAndariel is a sadistic entity, not unlike Duriel. However, while Duriel revels in physical agony, she derives pleasure from emotional suffering, believing in the \"purity\" of the emotion. A master manipulator, she set up scenarios in which the victim's mental state was twisted inside out. She loves seeing people torn apart by their own inner agony and emotional pain, and her whispers can drive mortals to madness. Her general bearing is one who is in a constant state of ecstasy, experiencing unthinkable pleasures. Considered one of the most relation orientated of the Great Evils, Andariel is said to abhor isolation, as she sustains herself on the suffering of others. Despite being one of the seven heads of Tathamet (whose body would come to form the whole of Hell itself), she is not fond of fire.\nAndariel was rumored by &lt;a href=\"Gheed\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; to be very beautiful\u2014at least, as far as Maidens of Anguish were concerned."}

{"id": "3755", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3755", "title": "Angel", "text": "Angels, also known as Seraphim, or Seraphs, are spirits of light and sound who are the denizens of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. Dedicated to the ideals of order, they are the opposite of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, and have fought against them since the dawn of Creation.\nLore.\nPhysiology.\nAngels are birthed from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;, though only during moments of perfect harmony in Heaven, through a process called the &lt;a href=\"Lightsong\"&gt;Lightsong&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of angels the Lightsong can give birth to is finite\u2014it is a case of them embodying a set amount of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;'s power, and as such, every angel is said to represent one of the five aspects of Anu (valor, justice, hope, wisdom, fate), and the 'purest' of angels become &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s. If an angel is killed, a replacement angel will be created by the Arch, but such an angel is still a different individual from the one (s)he is replacing. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; is the only known example of an angel reforming as the same individual, said reformation occurring after his destruction at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. The replacement angel is not born instantaneously.\nWhile able to be killed, angels are immortal beings and are not made of flesh and blood. Rather, angels are living manifestations of light and sound, and soar on wings of light itself. Each angel has a unique 'sound,' per their manifestation from the Arch. Their wings radiate pure energy, and under normal circumstances, any human weapon that strikes them will turn to ash. The wings can also impale demons.\nAngels possess great strength far above that of a human, but some angels are stronger than others depending on their significance, their rank in the celestial chain of command, or simply their nature as an angel. They can willingly forsake their immortality and become mortal, and even retain their angelic powers, but such an act does not give an angel access to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's latent &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; abilities as their souls remain purely angelic, free of demonic ancestry. Tyrael is the first (and currently, only) angel to have ever undertaken this transformation. The removal of his wings was a vital part of the process, but not the catalyst for it\u2014the removal of an angel's wings does not make that angel mortal by default.\nWhen wounded, a substance akin to 'liquid light' has been observed to spill from an angel's wound(s). This substance is not &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. Angels do not require sleep or food, and instead draw their lifeforce from the Crystal Arch. If this connection is severed/corrupted, angels can be incapacitated and rendered unconscious. Angels possess a sense of smell, and their eyesight is superior to humans in most regards. As with mortals and demons, angels carry &lt;a href=\"Essence\"&gt;Essence&lt;/a&gt; within themselves.\nAngels are able to disguise themselves as humans and walk among them. In their natural forms, however, angels do not possess faces, or at least, not as a human might understand such a thing. To humans, angels appear faceless, almost always covered by a hood, though their heads are humanoid in shape.\u00a0Angels have glowing skin and their eyes have eyelids (at least, this was true for &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;). Emotion is sensed from angels by the movement of their wings, which appear as streams of light. These streams can be used individually like tendrils, used to \"walk\", hold objects and even to bind an angel's foes.\nAngels can wield powerful &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Before the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, like demons, angels had great difficulty in manifesting on Sanctuary. Even &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; could only manifest for a night at a time.\nAngels are capable of interbreeding with both demons and nephalem. Indeed, it was such an act that led to the creation of humanity in the first place. They fear humanity for its ability to choose between good and evil, a fear intensified in recent times because of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and their bonding with &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn angel's wings flutter when they are happy.\u00a0Most angels' wings are blue-white in color, though Angiris Council members have demonstrated other colors such as orange (Imperius) and purple (&lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;). \nHumans have traditionally portrayed angels as physical beings with feathered wings and gossamer robes, rather than the tendril-winged, non-physical beings they actually exist as. This is because humans have difficulty perceiving angels as the harmonic entities they truly are. \nFall and Corruption.\nAngels may fall from grace if their faith in the heavens is broken. When this happens, their wings turned black (like the angels forgotten in &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;) or ash (eg. &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;). Some fallen angels may gain skin and a skeletal appearance (eg. the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;). \nDemons can coerce angels into falling through psychological or physical torture. These fallen angels possess faint demonic taint shown in the crimson color of their wings. As of note, only &lt;a href=\"Shaddox\"&gt;Shaddox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Verathiel\"&gt;Verathiel&lt;/a&gt; have shown this phenomenon. These angels can still purge themselves of corruption (turning their wings to ash), and even return to grace (turning their wings back to their original color). However, an angel\u2014once fallen, is no longer welcome in the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorrupted angels are formed when an angel's will is broken; usually through demonic means. Angels can also be corrupted before they are born in the Crystal Arch.\nBeliefs and Culture.\nAngels are ruled over by the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;. While the council has lost members over time, and have had these members change aspects, the council, in essence, represents the virtues of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;, the Creator. These virtues are valor, hope, fate, wisdom, and justice, and at least initially, were represented by the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Each angel that is created through the Lightsong is assigned to one of the domains/angelic groups of Heaven that represent one of these five aspects.\nUnlike demons, who war among themselves, angels seek to exist in harmony among their own kind. In battle, angels adhere to strict militaristic principles, and believe that only strict discipline can properly restore order to the myriad realms. Angels, and their ideals, can basically be thought of as 'good,' though angels can still take these concepts too far, as demonstrated in the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, and in its aftermath where, with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt; having reached stalemate, such dedication to order led to stagnation in Heaven. Nor are angels above vice or corruption by the lords of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. In the eyes &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt;, angels are, in their own way, no better than demons. While angels naturally gravitate towards unification, their rigid ideals do not allow them to adapt to changing circumstances easily. The existence of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity is one such example, and angels have displayed different reactions to their existence, even going so far as to advocate their eradication (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;) while others have even turned on their own brethren on humanity's behalf (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;). Many among humanity give reverence to angels, seeing them as shining paragons of heroism, but this is a half-truth. Angels exist for the sake of bringing order to Creation, while humanity, in contrast, is a source of disorder. As demons are true to their nature, so are angels, making order out of chaos because they know no other path. For angels, only absolute order can govern Creation.\nThe machinations of angels are inscrutable to mortals, but there are martyrs among humanity who follow their divine command regardless.\nAngels are generally not curious, as they believe everything there is to know is written in the &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Scroll of Fate&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach angel wears armor of some kind, though it is said that this is more for reasons of ornamentation and to provide a sense of individuality than to provide protection. The armor worn by archangels is a manifestation of their spirit. Some angels are considered brothers to each other, despite not sharing blood as humans may.\nFew angels have ever willingly abandoned Heaven, and those who do so are stigmatized by their own kind.\nHistory.\nAngels emerged in Heaven, just as demons did in Hell. The purest angels became &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s, and of the archangels, five rose above the rest (&lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;) to form the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; and lead their kind.\nThe Eternal Conflict.\nFor eons, angels and demons waged the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, as both sides fought for control of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact that could create worlds. However, while angels were able to claim numerous victories over demons, they failed to destroy them permanently, as any demon struck down inevitably reformed in Hell, and returned to the slaughter.\nThe &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, who grew tired of this war, led a group of like-minded angels and demons with &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; to steal the Worldstone and create a &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; of their own to co-exist peacefully and escape from the conflict. Eventually these group of renegade angels and demons would intermingle and gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, the forefathers of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. In the Worldstone's absence, the Eternal Conflict ground to a halt, as both sides were left without a goal.\nThe Sin War.\nEventually Heaven and Hell will come to take notice upon Sanctuary, the world &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; created with the Worldstone. The world was populated by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, stemming from a coupling of angel and demons. The &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; was dispatched to 'cleanse' the world, resulting in a three-way battle between Heaven, Hell, and the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt;. It ended with &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice, which swayed the views of &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, voting to spare Sanctuary from destruction and making a pact with Hell that it be left be.\nDarkness and Light.\nWith the pact between Heaven and Hell at the end of the Sin War, the Eternal Conflict ground to a halt. This was broken when &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, now a singular &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;, led the combined might of Hell against the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt; were shattered, Imperius wounded, &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; captured, and for the first time in history, demons ravaged the city's interior. With Auriel's capture, the angels began giving into despair, but after her rescue by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, hope returned, and the angels began fighting back with more fervor. While the city was ravaged and the Crystal Arch nearly corrupted, Diablo was nonetheless defeated.\nYet even after this, corruption remained, thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. A darkness began to creep upon Heaven, unnoticed to all but &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Angel\"&gt;Corrupted Angel&lt;/a&gt; was even born from the Arch. However, with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Soulstone was retrieved and the corruption lifted.\nThe Reapers.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; assault on Sanctuary, the various factions of Heaven reacted differently. However, Heaven was drawn into the conflict when the Reapers assaulted the Pandemonium Gate in order to prevent the Nephalem from pursuing &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Many angels were more disturbed at Malthael's betrayal itself (as he was the eldest member and former leader of the Angiris Council) than his genocidal actions against humanity on Sanctuary.\nThe Nephalem defeated Malthael with the aid of Imperius. Tyrael commented that the defeat of the Angel of Death had redeemed angelkind. However, the Nephalem's bonding with the forces of death intensified angelic fears about their power and potential to turn to evil. \nIn the meantime, angels continued to mend the damage Diablo's assault had rendered upon their home. Because of Malthael's actions, and the numerous angels his Reapers had killed, Heaven shuttered its gates to the realms beyond.\nIn-game.\nFor most of the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Series\"&gt;\"Diablo\"&lt;/a&gt; series, angels have not appeared as enemies. They are traditionally associated with the &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; orb in the user interface (\"Diablo\", \"Diablo III\") or &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; (\"Diablo II\").\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; marks the first instance of an angelic enemy, albeit corrupted. He was meant to originally appear in the first \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" game, but was cut from development. \n&lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hadriel\"&gt;Hadriel&lt;/a&gt; appear as angel NPCs.\nDiablo Immortal.\nAngels appear as both friendly NPCs and enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". They are found in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Realm of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; zone.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Angel\"&gt;Corrupted Angel&lt;/a&gt;s appear as a standard &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;-type in .\u00a0Various &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; angels also become standard enemies in .\nThe only non-corrupted, non-Reaper angels players can fight are\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Erelus\"&gt;Erelus&lt;/a&gt;, his minions,\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Haziael\"&gt;Haziael&lt;/a&gt;, all driven mad by an eternity spent in Pandemonium.\nPlayers encounter angelic warriors (as allies) in and . In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Skycutter\"&gt;Skycutter&lt;/a&gt; sword summons an angelic assistance. They are armed with maces very similar to &lt;a href=\"Skywarden\"&gt;Skywarden&lt;/a&gt;.\nAngelic Scouts (apparently mages) also exist: player only encounters them during &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Weapon%20%28Event%29\"&gt;The Great Weapon&lt;/a&gt; event. They are unarmed, but may channel beams of light to expel demonic corruption and conjure shields of force through the sheer willpower.\nDiablo IV.\nCurrently, &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; is the only angel to appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Heir%20of%20Perdition\"&gt;Heir of Perdition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"helms\"&gt;helm&lt;/a&gt; indicates the presence of angel enemies at some point within the game, as it gives damage buffs against angelic enemies.\nHeroes of the Storm.\nApart from the angelic heroes (&lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;), angel minions appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" in its Heaven-themed maps, battling against demons. In one of those maps, called Battlefield of Eternity, two colossal angels, called \"the Immortals\", fight against each other as part of the map's objective. One is called Ilarian, and the other, a corrupted angel, is called Beleth. \nThere are also angelic-themed cosmetics, such as banners, emotes and sprays. Both &lt;a href=\"Valla\"&gt;Valla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; have angel-themed skins. Tyrael also has a \"classic\" angel skin (with feathered wings), while Auriel has a demonic angel skin."}

The exorcism goes poorly; one of the wizards is killed, but just before the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; is sent back to &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, it tells Sarnakyle that great evils are coming. Sarnakyle is shaken, as it is impossible to tell what was a truth and what was a lie, and he leaves the Mage clans once again to seek the truth. He never returns, and his name becomes legend.\nFlash forward about seven hundred years. Two of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; have been captured in &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s, and the final Prime Evil, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, is about to be confronted by the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; army led by &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt;. A massive battle ensues, where Diablo barely escapes with his rearguard. After seeing to their losses, the Horadrim begin to pursue.\nUp in the lands, Siggard is living in peace amongst the Northmen. A sage comes to him and leads to him to a barrow, where the remains of Sarnakyle have lain buried for over six centuries. Siggard goes to the barrow, where a projection of Sarnakyle informs him of what the wizard was able to learn in his final wanderings, including a great secret that the &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;s will kill to protect. He leaves to contemplate this, but &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; appears before him and says that his services are once again needed to capture Diablo. Reluctantly, Siggard heads south.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, Jared Cain and his forces are pursuing Diablo and the remnants of his army. After the trail grows cold, the Horadrim are given shelter at the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Monastery\"&gt;Monastery of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;, the home of &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;a female order&lt;/a&gt; of healers and mystics. There, the Abbess informs Cain that there are rumblings of something evil to the north, and he takes a small group of Horadrim to investigate.\nIt turns out that what he has found is the rearguard of what is left of Diablo's army. The Horadrim are ambushed, but at the last minute they are saved by Siggard, wielding &lt;a href=\"Guthbreoht\"&gt;Guthbreoht&lt;/a&gt; like a demon. Siggard explains who he is, and that he has seen the main force nearby. Cain gathers the rest of his army, and they find Diablo and fight a pitched battle. Once again Diablo escapes, but not before fighting Siggard. During the melee, Siggard discovers that Diablo's sword has been enchanted with a glyph of unbinding, as the demonic blade shatters Guthbreoht. Siggard leaves the Horadrim, inconsolable.\nAfter Cain and his army have left in pursuit of Diablo, Tyrael appears to Siggard. Siggard holds up the shards of Guthbreoht and says that he is finished. Tyrael reveals that the only other person he has ever known who had Siggard's type of immortality was &lt;a href=\"Velund%20the%20Smith\"&gt;Velund the Smith&lt;/a&gt;, and sends Siggard off to find him. Siggard finds Velund on an island, where the smith agrees to remake Guthbreoht with even stronger enchantments. Guthbreoht is reforged and renamed, and Siggard goes off with his new sword to find the Horadrim.\nAs Guthbreoht is being reforged, Cain and the Horadrim come across the burnt out ruins of the Monastery of the Sightless Eye, which has been razed by Diablo. The Abbess, along with the handful of survivors, pledge themselves to become a military order, and join the Horadrim in their fight against the demonic forces. This time, the trail is fresh, and allows the Horadrim to pass Diablo's army and fortify themselves ahead in the town of Tristram. \nSiggard, guided by Tyrael, arrives at &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and rejoins the army. While they are waiting for Diablo to appear, he begins to fall for a local woman, who has lost her husband in a recent epidemic. And then, as the friendship begins to turn to a romance, Diablo appears.\nTo the horror of the defenders, Diablo has managed to reinforce his army. A brutal siege begins, where the Lord of Terror vows to destroy all of the Horadrim for the capture of his brothers. As the situation becomes desperate, Siggard and Cain lead a foray out during the night, where they capture Diablo in the soulstone. Without the power of Diablo to keep them in the mortal realm, the remainder of the demonic army vanishes.\nAs the leaders of the Horadrim celebrate the defeat of the last Prime Evil in the house of the mayor of Tristram, Tyrael appears, and Siggard states that the cost of the angels' secret has been too high. Despite Tyrael's warnings, Siggard reveals the truth: the angels and demons are of the same blood. In the distant past, some angels settled in Heaven while others settled in the Burnings Hells, fascinated by the chaos of the place. Those who settled in the Heavens became ethereal, creatures of the noblest aspects of their nature, while those who settled in Hell were overcome by the basest aspects of their nature, and were warped in both spirit and physical appearance by the place. \nAs soon as the secret is out, Tyrael uncloaks himself and uses his power to subdue the entire room. As the Archangel's sword is raised to kill all who have heard the secret, Siggard manages to convince him that the Horadrim are necessary, and without them the Prime Evils will escape their prisons and reign unopposed. The Horadrim promise that the secret will remain within their order, and Siggard, feeling a bit unwell but not understanding why, goes to visit his new love. \nOn the way, Tyrael appears and tells him that his life is ebbing. Siggard has finally found love, which is the only thing that can bring peace to his tormented soul, and death can finally claim him. Siggard protests that he now has a reason to stay, but Tyrael points out that Siggard's family has waited for him in the afterlife for seven centuries, and it is now time to join them. Siggard sees his wife and daughter again, and reaches out to them, breathing his last breath as he does. \nCain comes out to discover Siggard is dead, and Tyrael explains what has happened, instructing that the warrior should be buried like a hero, his sword with him, until the blade chooses a new master. Siggard is laid to rest in the old Tristram church, while the foundation stones for a new cathedral to house the soulstone containing Diablo are placed by the Horadrim and &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt;. \nReferences.\n2008-15-07, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.diablofans.com/forums/showthread.php%3Ft%3D12492\"&gt;New Diablo Novel by Robert B.

It initially consisted of five &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s, each of a particular aspect said to represent the chief virtues of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, however, the Council's unity and members has diminished, including the absence of &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt; is the de facto leader of the council.\nHistory.\nThe Eternal Conflict.\nThe Angiris Council formed early in the history of angels. The &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt; gave birth to angelkind, and the purest angels (those who were most in tune with one of the five virtues of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;) became &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s. Of the archangels, five rose above the rest to form the Angiris Council. They designed the architecture of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Angiris Council led their forces in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, including on the battlefield itself. When united, the Council could be unstoppable. Initially, the Council was led by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Council was not without dissonance, a case in point when &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt; slew Diablo on an impulsive decision, despite the suggestions of &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; that it would serve their cause better if the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; was taken prisoner instead. On his final breath, Diablo mocked the Angiris Council's so-called unity after being slain.\nThe Sin War.\nThe Angiris Council became aware of the existence of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; denizens, both world and beings the product of unions between &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and demons. It was the Council's initial edict that the world and its people be destroyed, viewed as \"abominations.\" However, &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice gave the Council pause and it convened to discuss the fate of the world. Imperius opted for eradication. Auriel and &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt; voted for the world's continued existence. &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; abstained. Tyrael, who had been expected to side with Imperius and thus doom Sanctuary to destruction (a tie would mean the original edict would be carried out), sided with humanity, moved by Uldyssian's sacrifice. Sanctuary and its people would be left to choose between light or dark, and after a pact with &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, both Heaven and Hell agreed to respect its neutrality.\nSeeds of Discord.\nThe events of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt; had ensured that the Great Conflict would take on a new paradigm, one that boded ill for the Angiris Council as much as the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. The ceasefire did not sit well with Imperius\u2014robbed of an enemy to fight, he became something of a \"legalistic tyrant.\" That Tyrael had not sided with him at the conclusion of the Sin War was another thorn in his side. Furthermore, Tyrael would continue to act on his own, aiding humanity despite the edicts of the Council. Auriel continued to act as a bridge between the two angels but Malthael was another story. It is said his mood darkened after the creation of Sanctuary. After the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, he simply vanished. In light of his absence, Imperius took over leadership of the Council, where division continued to exist between him and Tyrael. During this period, the Council eventually relented to the pleas of &lt;a href=\"Urzael\"&gt;Urzael&lt;/a&gt; to let him take leave to find his master.\nAnd the Heavens Shall Tremble.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining lords of Hell were threatening Sanctuary. Tyrael believed that only by allying with humanity could Heaven survive Hell's onslaught, but instead, the Council put him on trial, believing that his destruction of the Worldstone had endangered Creation. Tyrael and Imperius came to blows over the issue. Ultimately, Tyrael forsook his immortality, becoming mortal and descending to the world to guide &lt;a href=\"The_Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; against the forces threatening their world. In this they were successful. However, Diablo had made plans as far back as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt; and through the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, became the Prime Evil, with all the evils of Hell merged into one being. Besting Imperius outside the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt; and shattering them, he led his forces into the High Heavens. Auriel and Itherael were captured while Imperius was left to fight a losing battle. Thanks to Tyrael and &lt;a href=\"The_Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, however, Auriel and Itherael were rescued and the tide turned in Heaven's favour. Imperius was not so eager to side with the \"abominations\" he'd condemned 3,000 years ago, but it became a moot point as he was incapacitated and &lt;a href=\"The_Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Lord of Terror regardless.\nAs new light dawned on Heaven, Tyrael retook his place among his brethren, though this time, standing as Wisdom.\nLight and Shadow.\nThe Council members later discovered that the Black Soulstone remained in Heaven, and guarded it. The soulstone's malignant influence began to spread across the realm, bringing discord into the realm. Imperius and the other archangels refused to move the stone, so Tyrael, after reforming the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, was forced to abscond with the artifact and seal it in Sanctuary. Malthael, having become the Angel of Death,\u00a0intervened, incapacitating Tyrael and claiming the Black Soulstone for himself.\nLater on, Malthael led his &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; to attack all of Sanctuary. The Angel of Death retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in order to alter the Black Soulstone to capture all of the demonic essence lingering within humanity. But what shocked the angels the most was when Malthael attacked the Pandemonium Gate in Heaven to prevent the Nephalem from entering. This drew all of Heaven into conflict against the Reapers and in the end, Malthael fell."}

It was Anu who fought the battle with the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;, their struggle leading to their deaths, but also the births of &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Dawn.\nIt is written by the &lt;a href=\"Skatsim\"&gt;Skatsim&lt;/a&gt;i sage &lt;a href=\"Lam%20Esen\"&gt;Lam Esen&lt;/a&gt; that in the beginning, there was but a single, perfect pearl, in which Anu resided. Anu was the sum of all things: good and evil, light and dark, physical and mystical, joy and sadness\u2014all reflected across the crystalline facets of its form. And, within its eternal dream-state, Anu considered itself\u2014all of its myriad facets. Seeking a state of total purity and perfection, Anu cast all evil from itself. All dissonance was gone...for a time. These discordant parts formed into the being &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;, the first Prime Evil. Though separate beings, Anu and Tathamet were bound within the pearl. There they warred against each other in an unending clash of light and shadow for ages uncounted, neither gaining the upper hand. At last, their energies spent after countless millennia of battle, they delivered their final blows. The energies unleashed by their impossible fury ignited an explosion of light and matter so vast and terrible that it birthed the very universe itself.\nLegacies.\nIt is written that when it died, Anu transcended into a benevolent place beyond the universe, a paradise of which nothing is known. In the universe as it is known however, its legacy remained. The Eye of Anu, later known as the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, remained at the center of Creation as the foundation of all places, times, and possibilities. Anu's spine spun out into the primordial darkness, where it slowed and cooled. Over countless ages it formed into the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;, around which the High Heavens took shape and form. It is from this arch that &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s come into existence. Every angel represents one of Anu's five virtues (valor, wisdom, justice, hope, fate), and those who were most in sync with one of these virtues become &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe existence of Anu is known to some &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, though interpretations differ\u2014some, especially in more primitive cultures, view the above tale as being absolutely true. Other scholars and mystics take the tale as being an elaborate metaphor for good and evil and the constant, warring dynamic seen among the forces of nature. Of note, to many scholars, &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; are living embodiments of the virtues of Anu. Though some aspects have changed for these angels, the beings &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Itherael\"&gt;Itherael&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; represent(ed) Anu's virtues of valor, justice, hope, fate, and wisdom respectively.\nSome believe that &lt;a href=\"Rogar%27s%20Huge%20Stone\"&gt;Rogar's Huge Stone&lt;/a&gt; was fashioned from Anu's crystalized blood.\n&lt;a href=\"Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt; argued that it was &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, not angels, who were the true inheritors of Anu, for it was only when Anu rejected his darker half that true evil and suffering was born. In his mind, unlike Anu, humanity had to embrace its inner demons, and be all the stronger for it.\nIn-game.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Oculus%20Ring\"&gt;Oculus Ring&lt;/a&gt; makes reference to \"the one god\" in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". This is possibly a reference to &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnu is referenced in the flavor text of &lt;a href=\"Rogar%27s%20Huge%20Stone\"&gt;Rogar's Huge Stone&lt;/a&gt;."}

She received a broad education in the history, &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and healing techniques of her clan. As a child, the Elders told her about &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;, and how the Barbarians were sworn to defend it.\nShe lost her mother in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231255\"&gt;1255&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord of Destruction.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, Harrogath's seer, &lt;a href=\"Caldra\"&gt;Caldra&lt;/a&gt;, was afflicted with terrifying visions. Her screams woke up the entire village. Anya reached her first and offered her comfort, before being joined by her father. After awhile, Caldra was calmed down, but had clearly gone mad. She passed away the next day, after imparting her warning that &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; was approaching Harrogath. A claim that was verified the following day, as Harrogath learnt of the approaching &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Army of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt;'s fall.\nTo prevent the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s from scaling &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt; planned to conduct a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;ic warding spell. However, it was highly dangerous, and Aust saw Anya one last time before he and the Elders ventured beyond Harrogath's walls. The spell worked, but it cost the lives of all of the Elders bar &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt;. \nAnya was suspicious of this turn of events, and one night, confronted Nihlathak, the two arguing about her father's death. The next morning, she had disappeared. Nihlathak claimed innocence, and while a number of villagers had their suspicions, there was no evidence of his guilt. In truth, Nihlathak had imprisoned Anya with a freezing spell. He revealed to her that he had struck a deal with Baal to protect Harrogath. That in exchange for Baal's mercy, he would give Baal the &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Relic of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, which would allow Baal to ascend Mount Arreat unchallenged.\nNot long afterwards, a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; arrived, who at &lt;a href=\"Malah\"&gt;Malah&lt;/a&gt;'s request, found Anya in the &lt;a href=\"Crystalline%20Passage\"&gt;Crystalline Passage&lt;/a&gt;, having been imprisoned by Nihlathak with a freezing spell. With Malah's aid, they were able to rescue her.\nWith Nihlathak having fled due to his treachery being revealed, Anya was now the de facto elder of Harrogath. This was not unexpected, as Anya was next in line after her father, but she felt that the burden was too great for her to do alone. Nevertheless, she resolved to do what she could. She also reflected that perhaps things would have been different if Harrogath had requested aid from neighboring kingdoms, cursing her people's pride.\nAnya revealed to the heroes that Nihlathak had told her. As much as she would have liked to take revenge herself, she was too weakened from the ordeal to do so. She opened a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak%27s%20Temple\"&gt;Nihlathak's Temple&lt;/a&gt;, ordering the heroes to stop Nihlathak. That as noble as his intentions were, nothing could excuse his actions. The heroes slew him, but did not find the Relic on his body. Anya realized that he must have already given it to Baal.\nThe heroes ascended Mount Arreat and slew Baal, but not before he had corrupted the Worldstone, necessitating its destruction. Anya mused that nothing in the prophecies had mentioned this. Perhaps this meant that all would be lost, or that they would never have to fight again. In the end, the Worldstone's destruction decimated the surrounding area, leaving Anya's fate unclear.\nIn-game.\nAnya is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". Her rescue is the objective of the quest and after her rescue she gives the quest.\nAnya offers to personalize an item of your choosing with your name once you defeat Nihlathak. Personalizing an item simply adds your name to the beginning of the item's name. This works on unique weapons. Personalization can only be used once per difficulty.\nTrade.\nAnya offers the following list of items:\nShe also offers gambling, after Nihlathak is gone.\nPersonality and Traits.\nAnya appeared to be attracted to &lt;a href=\"Larzuk\"&gt;Larzuk&lt;/a&gt;, who, at the least, admired her in turn, commenting that even from a young age, Anya never stopped pursuing what she believed in. Malah described Anya as \"a strong, crafty woman with a spirit like no other.\" &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; noted that despite her youth, Anya was capable of commanding great respect.\nDevelopment.\nThere is an unused Ice Cage animation \"IceCage_melt\" which shows it was originally much bigger, before it was scrapped and replaced with the higher quality final one."}

In \"\", however, the &lt;a href=\"books\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; of Apocalypse can be obtained after defeating &lt;a href=\"Na-Krul\"&gt;Na-Krul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis powerful spell is used by &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself in the original Diablo game, but it appears different from the spell available to the player. It is the only spell capable of damaging enemies which were immune to &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20damage\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being animated as Fire, Apocalypse has a special type of damage that cannot be resisted (but can be &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;ed), and that no monster is immune to. In \"Diablo\" it hits everything on the screen, even over walls, and is frequently used to thin out the creatures inside of 's square before the bone levers are thrown. In \"Hellfire\" the spell can be learned from spellbooks, but they are only dropped by Na-Krul, and the spell requires a line of sight to work; it can't be used over walls anymore.\nApocalypse is arguably the most powerful spell in the game. The Mana cost is exorbitant, however, even for a fully maxed &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, and due to high requirements, learning it even at Spell Level 1 is a challenging task.\nDamage Calculation:\nItt stands for \"iterative\" function."}
