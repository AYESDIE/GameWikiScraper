The devices open a portal to one of several special Realms of Pure Evil in which two or three \"&lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber\"&gt;\u00dcber&lt;/a&gt;\" versions of &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;es can be fought, analogous to the &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cber%20Tristram\"&gt;\u00dcber Tristram&lt;/a&gt; event in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". They can only be used in the Heretic's Abode, a house in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. The bosses drop \"organs\" to create a \u00a0or .\n\"Clashing gears and foul &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; grind away within this cursed construct. Its malevolent passage can only be unleashed inside a house of the damned.\"\nAcquisition.\nThe Machines drop from &lt;a href=\"Keywarden\"&gt;Keywarden&lt;/a&gt;s on any &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; difficulty. At level 60, each of them has a chance to drop a single Infernal Machine. At level 70, each drops only one type (name of the Keywarden shows which machine they drop, and which material can be gained in result):\nThe devices are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Account\"&gt;account bound&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrop chances increase with difficulty (see &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; for exact percentages): starting at T4, it reaches 100%, with higher difficulties giving a chance for a second Machine to drop. At T13, there is a 90% chance for the second Machine to drop.\nAfter the machines have been collected (it is advised to collect at least 3, or 4 different ones at level 70), they can only be activated in a cellar in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; known as the Heretic's Abode in Adventure mode. The entrance is located next to Brother Malachi the Healer, and can be opened by using an attack on the door. Activating the device will create a red portal which leads to a realm where a pair of \u00dcber Bosses must be defeated for a chance to drop one of three organs. Activating the device will also destroy it, so the player will need to kill Keywardens again to get another one.\nNote that neither of the devices are guaranteed to drop, and level 60 and 70 Machines are not interchangeable. On level 60, you need three devices, on level 70, you will require four, and they \"must\" all be of different types.\nOn level 60, each used machine opens a randomly selected different portal; to open 3 different ones, you need to use 3 machines in the same game. As on level 60, each device opens a random portal, if you activate three devices in one game, you are \"guaranteed\" to receive one portal of each type. On level 70, there is a separate machine depending on which set of Uber bosses you wish to fight (see below).\nYou may only activate the device on &lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; I difficulty or higher.\nThere are four sets of Uber bosses, depending on which portal you open (the level 60 Infernal Machine opens a random portal, but using three machines in one game will open three different ones). See above for details on how to open these portals. The portals will have second names in descriptions, which match the crafting ingredient they can potentially lead to.\nRealms of Pure Evil are fixed for boss pairs: Leoric and Maghda in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Crypts\"&gt;Royal Crypts&lt;/a&gt;, Ghom and Rakanoth in &lt;a href=\"the%20Larder\"&gt;the Larder&lt;/a&gt;, or Siegebreaker and Zoltun Kulle in the &lt;a href=\"Edge%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Edge of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. On level 70, there is a fourth portal, where you will fight Shadow of Diablo in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Realm of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, along with two additional bosses.\nLoot is only awarded once the player defeats all bosses (does not matter in which order).\nThe Rewards.\nFor successfully defeating a boss pair, players will be rewarded with extra items and gold. In addition, they will also have a chance to harvest the crafting ingredients from each of their fallen foes, which can be used to create the Hellfire Ring or the Hellfire Amulet. Crafting ingredients will drop the same for all party members. If one player gets an ingredient, all players do. Drop rate scales with difficulty, up to 100% (PC only) at Torment VI. If difficulty is decreased to Master or lower, the drop rate becomes 0% automatically.\nWith the three (four for the level 70 variant) pieces mentioned above and 2,000,000 (5,000,000 for the level 70 plans) gold, buy the plan(s) from &lt;a href=\"Squirt%20the%20Peddler\"&gt;Squirt the Peddler&lt;/a&gt;. A level 10 &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Shen\"&gt;Jeweler&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%20Eamon\"&gt;Armorer&lt;/a&gt; on consoles) can craft the basic &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ring\"&gt;Hellfire Ring&lt;/a&gt; for a fee of 50,000 gold, while a level 12 Jeweler/Armorer can make the upgraded &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ring%20%28other%29\"&gt;Hellfire Ring&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Amulet\"&gt;Hellfire Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, for the same fee of 50,000 gold.\nConsole Version.\nPS and XBox versions of the game have slight differences in the system: reduced gold costs of recipes (100,000 for both variants).\nThe Components.\nPrior to patch 2.3, both 60 and 70 versions of the Machine required a set of keys to craft. To craft the Infernal Machine, players first needed to collect all components from Keywardens.\nOn consoles, the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Evil\"&gt;Key of Evil&lt;/a&gt; dropped from either Siegebreaker or Zoltun Kulle when using the Infernal Machine of War.\nDevices could then be assembled in town at the &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%20Eamon\"&gt;Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;. The Blacksmith would need to be level 10 (12 at 70) in order to learn the plans (sold by &lt;a href=\"Squirt%20the%20Peddler\"&gt;Squirt the Peddler&lt;/a&gt;, or dropped by &lt;a href=\"Odeg%20the%20Keywarden\"&gt;Odeg the Keywarden&lt;/a&gt;), and required 12,000 gold (100,000 on 70) to forge the device in his furnaces."}

It is basically a flamethrower that not only deals damage quickly, but also has a tendency to drain mana pool quickly with careless use. As Inferno's level raises so does the damage it does and its range. The torrent of flame &lt;a href=\"piercing\"&gt;pierces&lt;/a&gt; through enemies, regardless of how many get in its path, and grows in range with level.\nCombined with the proper equipment along with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Mastery\"&gt;Fire Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, a Sorceress can deal moderate damage, from a very long range, with Inferno. Due to the limited area of the flames only damaging enemies within a line of contact maintained by aiming left and right, slow travel time of the projectile and inability to move while skill is cast allows enemies to often move quickly in and out of range, observed damage per second is actually 1/3 to 1/2 of the average damage per second listed on the skill's mouse-over. In early versions of the game, only the first enemy hit was actually damaged, despite visually all of them being hit."}

The damage-focused Water, Fire or Earth runes maximize benefits of the extreme damage boost to the Allies. The set synergizes well with other Mystic Ally improvements, especially and .\nSet bonus notes.\nThe two-piece bonus only applies to the unmodified passive effects of Mantras, not the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Rune\"&gt;Skill Rune&lt;/a&gt; component. With two Mystic Allies from , each will grant the doubled passive effect, for a total of quadruple the normal effect - for example, +40% (+10% x 2 x 2) damage with Fire Ally rune.\nThe four-piece bonus grants the un-runed effects of all four Mantras, and all of them are enhanced by the two-piece bonus as well, even if no Mantra is chosen in the skill bar. Choosing one anyway grants its rune benefit and use of its active effect, but these are not enhanced by set bonuses.\nThe six-piece bonus has a number of specific mechanics:\nEnduring Ally issues.\nThe active effect of Enduring Ally does not work well with the six-piece bonus of Inna's Mantra. Only the permanent Ally can be sacrificed to gain health, but it is blocked from reappearing if any temporary Allies are out at the time it would have done so, even below the maximum of ten. Using the &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; restores the permanent one if used after the temporary Allies depart, but it otherwise does not come back on their own. If all permanent Allies have been sacrificed, activating the skill sacrifices nobody, gains no health, still goes on &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, and still does not trigger the permanent Ally to reappear.\n provide two Enduring Allies to sacrifice, one per activation. However, the rune remains ineffective overall, as both permanent Allies still face the \"blocking problem\". One new workaround is made possible with the Boots: Sacrificing the last permanent Ally and allowing it to reappear after the first has already been blocked \"will\" successfully restore both of them. Unfortunately this still requires waiting for the expiration of any temporary Allies.\nNote that even without these issues, neither the Air Ally nor Enduring Ally &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Runes\"&gt;Skill Runes&lt;/a&gt; synergize well with the damage bonuses of Inna's Mantra, since their active forms do not do damage.\nSet combinations.\nDue to the item type composition, it is possible to combine the six-piece bonus of Inna's Mantra and the two-piece bonus of another class set at the same time, or vice versa. Even six-and four-piece bonuses can be used together with the aid of a .\nSpecifically, this set leaves the Shoulder slot available to another, and because it only requires six of its seven pieces, one of the Chest, Feet, Head, Hands or Legs slots can be left for the other as well (or two if using the Ring).

{"id": "3433", "revid": "48296993", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3433", "title": "Inventory", "text": "An Inventory is an easily accessible backpack which contains all of the items you have gathered whilst adventuring in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. In it, the player carries the items that they can use anytime they want, and what they are not currently wearing (items that are equipped on a character do not count towards the inventory space).\nThe inventory can become a bit of an annoyance, as it can fill quite quickly (especially later in the game) in the midst of battle, and you may have to leave some pieces of loot behind; using the &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; spell on your quick-access bar to empty your overburdened inventory at a merchant is necessary to access and utilize all of your loot. In the endgame, most players stop picking up items they are sure they won't use, making sure the inventory space is conserved.\nThere is no limit on the items' quantity or weight; only the number of tiles, each item occupying 1, 2 (1x2), 3 (1x3), 4 (2x2 or 1x4), 6 (2x3) or 8 (2x4) tiles. Rearranging the items so that more of them can stick in is generally called\u00a0inventory management.\nDiablo / Hellfire.\nThe inventory of a hero is at its most basic form in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;/. It is comprised of a 4x10 grid, for a total of 40 slots. Small items, such as a &lt;a href=\"Potions\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; or a piece of jewelry, only take up 1 slot, while body armors, two-handed weaponry, and almost all shields take up a 2x3 portion. Weapons can take 1x2 or 1x3 slots. Helms and small shields take 2x2. &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; occupies space too, 5000 per slot, although with &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Amulet\"&gt;Auric Amulet&lt;/a&gt; one can store 10,000 gold per tile.\nA hero cannot expand their inventory over the course of the journey in the labyrinth, so efficiency must be made a priority, or treasures may just wind up being on the floor, leading to the need to constantly open a portal to &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; to sell. Since the\u00a0\"total\u00a0\"amount of items (and money!) in game is finite, it is imperative to sell\u00a0\"everything\u00a0\"the character finds, or at least everything that will bring more money than the cost of &lt;a href=\"identify\"&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt;ing an item.\nItems that players do not want to carry around, but will need later, are usually dropped in town, remaining on the ground. However, in the PS1 version of the game, in early versions, one must\u00a0NOT\u00a0click the &lt;a href=\"Shrine\"&gt;Shrine&lt;/a&gt; of Thieves at any circumstances, or must load the saved game immediately after doing so, for it causes all\u00a0items kept in town to disappear.\nIn addition to all this, each player has a &lt;a href=\"Belts\"&gt;Belt&lt;/a&gt;, which can hold up to 8 1-slot items (only &lt;a href=\"Potions\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scrolls\"&gt;Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Runes%20%28Hellfire%29\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt; in \"Hellfire\"), helping players to conserve space and easily get to the said items in combat.\nDiablo II / Lord of Destruction.\nThe Inventory has changed somewhat between the transition to &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;/. It is still the same 4x10 grid, but there exist items that take up a 2x4 portion, only allowing 5 such items to be carried.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stash\"&gt;Stash&lt;/a&gt; makes its debut in Diablo II, consisting of an 8x6 grid in the expansion, as well as a separate gold container. This gold container can only house up to 2,500,000 in gold.\nIf one finds themselves longing for more inventory space than is possible, other items that can do something close to this includes &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Tomes of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Identify&lt;/a&gt; which can hold up to 20 scrolls each, and the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; which has its own 4x4 grid. These items, however, do require the hero to sacrifice a small portion of their personal inventory, even though the total amount of items they can carry will grow in result.\nBelts can still hold Potions and Scrolls only, but the capacity now depends on the type of belt equipped: 4 items (no belt), 8 (simplest of belts), 12 (high-tier belts) and 16 (top tier belts, as well as all Exceptional and Elite belts).\nAs an extra measure of conserving inventory space, expansion characters can carry a second set of weapons that does not occupy any tiles.\nDiablo III / Reaper of Souls.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, the Inventory has been reworked countless times over the course of development (both visually and functionally), and in the released version, it is totally different from the D1 and D2 inventories.\nThe inventory has been expanded to 6x10 pattern (60 total slots). Jewelry, potions,\u00a0Gems,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Craftable%20items\"&gt;crafting materials&lt;/a&gt;, and Belts take up 1 tile each, and in addition gems and materials can stack up to 100, 1000 or 5000 in one tile. The Belt storage is gone, but one type of Potion can be bound to a hotkey. All armor and weapons except Belts occupy 1x2 tiles, regardless of type: that is, a minimum of 30 and up to 60 items can be carried at once.\nOnce all the slots are full, picking up new\u00a0&lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will not be possible until some are sold to a vendor, removed from the inventory by throwing items away or placing them in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"stash\"&gt;stash&lt;/a&gt;. As a first for the series, items key to quest completion do not take up inventory space.\nWhile the personal inventory your character begins with cannot be expanded, the stash can be upgraded, allowing to purchase extra tabs and rows. Each of 6 available tabs will have 7x10 slots.\nIn console version of the game, the inventory is instead limited to 60 (80) items of either type; there is no tile management, but rather a sorting of items by type in a list form.\nIn Patch 2.1.2, a highly requested feature was added to the game, \"item locking\". This made it possible to favorite an item, making it unable to be salvaged or destroyed without removing the lock from said item (Ctrl F &amp; R)."}

Afterwards, Iosef punched Oswen in the gut, escaped, and ran into the nearby woods.\nUpon their return, the Wanderer was drugged by the villagers and wheeled away by Oswen to be sacrificed. Iosef snuck into the barn and killed Oswen using an iron rod. He then assisted in the ensuing fight with the villagers, though was wounded. \nThe Wanderer began to retch &lt;a href=\"blood%20petal\"&gt;blood petal&lt;/a&gt;s, much to Iosef's horror. The Wanderer explained that Oswen had force-fed the petals, and Iosef wondered how the villagers had learnt such a practice. He suggested that they enter the village chapel to find answers before he burnt it.\nThe Wanderer did so but passed out; Iosef dragged them outside and set fire to the chapel. The Wanderer explained that they'd had a vision of a horned demon that had corrupted the villagers. Iosef recognized the demon as Lilith, and ordered the Wanderer to seek out &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; while he headed for &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Cold and Iron Faith.\nIosef made it to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%20%28Fractured%20Peaks%29\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt; in Kyovashad, where he reported the events in Nevesk to &lt;a href=\"Prava\"&gt;Prava&lt;/a&gt;. She blessed him in a ceremony, after which, the Wanderer arrived, reporting that Lorath had refused to travel to the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;. Iosef was frustrated, but Prava entrusted the Wanderer with the task she'd intended for Lorath; to investigate a demon sighting at &lt;a href=\"Gale%20Valley\"&gt;Gale Valley&lt;/a&gt; that matched Lilith's description.\nThe Wanderer later returned, explaining that they needed a blessing to cross a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; in order to pursue Lilith. Iosef directed them to &lt;a href=\"Kor%20Valar\"&gt;Kor Valar&lt;/a&gt; in order to receive one from Prava. He rejoiced, claiming that everything was proceeding as Inarius had foretold, and that his return to Heaven was nigh.\nAt some point after his return to Kyovashad, Iosef told &lt;a href=\"Voszalko\"&gt;Voszalko&lt;/a&gt; about the Wanderer, and what had happened in Nevesk.\nFrom the Wound Spilled.\nAfter Reverend Mother Prava denounced the Horadrim (even though Donan saved her life in the Burning Hells) Iosef was sent to kill Lorath Nahr. Iosef and the knights were quickly killed after.\nLegacy.\nVoszalko was haunted by Iosef's death, which further drove his bitterness towards the Wanderer.\nIn Game.\nIosef is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". He is first introduced in a shed in &lt;a href=\"Nevesk\"&gt;Nevesk&lt;/a&gt; during the \"&lt;a href=\"Dusk%20on%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Dusk on the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV%20Quests\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;.

It creates a minion from a metal item that fights for the Necromancer.\nLore.\n\"While many &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s spend their lives devoted to studying the transmutation of base metals into &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, the Necromancers have always had a somewhat different approach to transforming metals. Through complicated arcane rituals and great mental concentration, a Necromancer can summon forth a Golem from common base metals. The construct takes on the properties of the original source material, including any magical effects or other properties the original metal might have possessed. \"\nGeneral Information.\nIron Golem transmutes a metal item into a grotesque iron automaton that serves the Necromancer. The skill is targeted on a metal item lying on the ground, which is magically refashioned into the Golem. Much like other Golems, the Iron Golem accompanies the Necromancer and battles his enemies using its iron blades. But unlike other Golems, which are destroyed when the player exits the game, Iron Golems persist between games, magically respawning to rejoin the Necromancer by his side. Iron Golems inherit properties of items from which they are created, allowing Necromancers to tailor their Golem to suit their needs. Unlike other Golems who may struggle to cause damage later in the game, this peculiarity preserves the viability of Iron Golems for much longer, provided the Necromancer has access to powerful items from which to fabricate the Golems.\nIron Golems can be constructed from items of any quality, even non-&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Items\"&gt;magical items&lt;/a&gt;. Such items must be sacrificed when fashioned into an Iron Golem, as they are irreversibly destroyed, calling for careful and prudent use of the skill. The Golem will receive the additional &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; listed on &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Defense&lt;/a&gt; listed on &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. Currently Golems do \"not\" receive the damage benefit for using &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons. Thanks to the ability of Iron Golems to gain the traits of whatever item they are made from, they are potentially the best Golems for dealing damage in the game, while still discharging their defensive role as a durable target to distract enemies.\nThe Golem's defensive utility is further boosted by its sharp spikes and barbs that repercuss attacking enemies. Enemies landing physical blows on the Golem suffer damage in return by the Golem's personal &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; aura. Although the aura only affects the Golem itself, it improves with higher skill levels, causing more damage to be returned with each blow.\nOne can only create Iron Golems from metal items, and cannot make them from &lt;a href=\"Clubs\"&gt;Clubs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wands\"&gt;Wands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sword\"&gt;Crystal Sword&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Gloves\"&gt;Gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belts\"&gt;Belts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Weapons\"&gt;Throwing Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staves\"&gt;Staves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;Bows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crossbows\"&gt;Crossbows&lt;/a&gt;, Quest Items, &lt;a href=\"Jewelry\"&gt;Jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor\"&gt;Leather Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boots%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Boots\"&gt;leather Boots&lt;/a&gt;, and all variations of these items.\nSaving powerful Rare and Magical Items one doesn't wish to sell, use or trade to create Iron Golems is a popular tactic. Some magical item properties are not transferred to the Iron Golem, such as &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Find\"&gt;Chance to find Magical Items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Steal\"&gt;Mana Steal&lt;/a&gt;. Items with &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; should be avoided, as enemies knocked back by the Golem will tend to draw it behind enemy lines, where it is vulnerable to being surrounded, trapped and destroyed. Iron Golems gain the abilities of &lt;a href=\"Socket\"&gt;Socket&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"Gem\"&gt;Gem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rune\"&gt;Rune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jewel\"&gt;Jewel&lt;/a&gt; weapons.\nThe main purpose of Iron Golems lies in giving the Necromancer a customizable fighter. Sacrificing an item with &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wounds\"&gt;Open Wounds&lt;/a&gt; will result in an Iron Golem capable of administering powerful anti-&lt;a href=\"Act%20boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; effects with each strike. Using something with a chance to cast spells on each strike (for example, &lt;a href=\"Stormlash\"&gt;Stormlash&lt;/a&gt; for Static Field) will result in an Iron Golem unleashing potent spells in combat. A polearm with the &lt;a href=\"Insight%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Insight Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; will yield a walking source of &lt;a href=\"Meditation\"&gt;Meditation&lt;/a&gt;, freeing the Necromancer's mercenary's hands to wield something else. Extremely expensive and rare items can also be used, such as the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Rune%20Word\"&gt;Beast Rune Word&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Fanaticism\"&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt;. Iron Golems will stay around from game to game, moderating the sacrifice of a rare item, although they (and the item they embody) are still permanently lost if they are destroyed or their master is killed.\n&lt;a href=\"Metalgrid\"&gt;Metalgrid&lt;/a&gt;, a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Unique%20Amulets\"&gt;unique amulet&lt;/a&gt;, allows any class to summon high-level Iron Golems.\u00a0However, the Golem produced from this amulet does not carry over to new games and is instead destroyed on exiting the game. Instead, the summoner is reimbursed with the gold value of the item used to create the Golem. \nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 35\nDamage: 7\u201319 / 11\u201330 / 12\u201333\nAttack Rating: 80\nHit Points: 980\nGains additional damage or defense from the item that created it\nKnown bugs.\nDue to an error in &lt;samp&gt;SkillDesc.txt&lt;/samp&gt;, which has existed since Diablo II and is still present in Diablo II: Resurrected, the value of Defense shown is based on the total Iron Golem skill level instead of the base Iron Golem skill level. However, the actual calculation uses only the base skill level, which means the actual value will be either equal to or lower than the one shown. This affects all Golems receiving the Iron Golem defense bonus.\nIn Diablo II: Resurrected, the \"Thorns damage\" description display is arguably broken (since v2.4 up to v2.7 at least). The official docs state that \"Thorns no longer return a percentage of damage when hit. Now thorns will deal a flat amount of damage when the aura-effected targets are attacked\", which is consistent with the &lt;samp&gt;Skills.txt&lt;/samp&gt; file showing the relevant base and per-level values as 0.

The greater the skill of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, the greater the magnitude of torment the victim receives for his wrongdoings. \"\nUsage.\nThis Curse causes all melee damage done by the target to be reflected towards the attacker. On lower difficulties, the reflected damage can kill monsters who are attacking the caster or his/her allies. The more points invested in Iron Maiden, the more damage is reflected \u2014 to the point where attackers take many times more damage than they inflict. Iron Maiden is similar in function to the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; aura and the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Barbs\"&gt;Spirit of Barbs&lt;/a&gt;, though it is weaker than the former and more powerful than the latter.\nIron Maiden has several limitations. It only reflects &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt;, and resulting damage also counts as Physical. Iron Maiden doesn't reflect ranged attacks, with the sole exception of &lt;a href=\"Flayer\"&gt;Flayer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Dart\"&gt;Blow Dart&lt;/a&gt;s. Iron Maiden is useless against physical &lt;a href=\"immunities\"&gt;immunities&lt;/a&gt;. On Hell difficulty, where all monsters gain 50% physical resistance and have far more health than damage they are capable of dealing, Iron Maiden is not very powerful.\nA popular Necromancers' PvP tactic against unwary melee fighters is casting Iron Maiden curse coupled with &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wall\"&gt;Bone Wall&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison\"&gt;Bone Prison&lt;/a&gt;. This is often followed by the trapped player's attempt to destroy the bone barrier with their own melee attacks, typically resulting in instant suicide.\nItems.\nSeveral items grant Iron Maiden skill:\nDevelopment.\nBefore Patch 1.13, player characters were not the only ones who could use this dangerous curse. The &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Knight\"&gt;Oblivion Knight&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"the%20Harrowing\"&gt;the Harrowing&lt;/a&gt; could also use Iron Maiden on the heroes.

While mercenary companies are notorious for their habit of shifting allegiances, the Iron Wolves value loyalty and duty above all else, devoting their lives to protect and shelter the innocent and the weak, while punishing the wicked. The Wolves hold themselves to a higher standard than other mercenary companies of similar mettle.\nThough bold and reckless, Iron Wolves are hardened veterans who excel in disciplines ranging from &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt;manship to archery, and even the use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt is tradition among the Iron Wolves to reclaim the armor of their fallen so it may continue to serve. Iron Wolves of great valor are rewarded with a personalized medallion. Rarely is one crafted for an outside ally of the Wolves, in thanks for their heroic service.\nHistory.\nThe Iron Wolves were formed by &lt;a href=\"Asheara\"&gt;Asheara&lt;/a&gt;, a mercenary who was disillusioned by the brutal tactics of the mercenary companies she had previously served with. She formed the Iron Wolves as a company that answered to her, one that would be held to a higher standard.\nKurast.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, the Iron Wolves were stationed in &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. The group spent months combating the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s that prowled the jungle that had overtaken much of the area, but they just kept coming (granted, this allowed the mercenaries to make a good living off the steady stream of conflict). Some measure of salvation came from a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; who had crossed the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. The heroes were able to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Gidbinn\"&gt;Gidbinn&lt;/a&gt;, which reinforced the enchantments that protected the &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Docks\"&gt;Kurast Docks&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, fewer Iron Wolves were needed to protect the area, and a few volunteered to help the heroes free of charge.\nCaldeum.\nKurast fell despite the efforts of the Iron Wolves and their allies, and &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; became the new capital of Kehjistan. The &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; church hired the Iron Wolves to retrieve the country's new ruler, &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt;, from his home in the northern reaches of Sanctuary. With this task complete, the Iron Wolves became the child emperor's bodyguards, elevating the group to a level of power and influence unheard of for a mercenary company.\nA few years later, and a few months before the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;, refugees began arriving at Caldeum; fleeing from the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; and their summoned &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s wrecked havoc. The Iron Wolves were sent out in the desert to fight them, while the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; was created to \u201cprotect\u201d the citizens from the refugees. Eventually, the Imperial Guard supplanted the Iron Wolves' former role. The tenets of the Iron Wolves were studied by Belial's servants in an effort to understand their martial methods.\nSome Iron Wolves remained in Caldeum, though lost contact with their breathren in the Borderlands. &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; was instructed to head for the &lt;a href=\"Khasim%20Outpost\"&gt;Khasim Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, where they found Iron Wolves taken captive there, intended to be sacrificed for Belial. The Nephalem freed them and defeated the demons.\nWhen Belial rained fire down upon Caldeum, the Iron Wolves did what they could to evacuate its populace.\nThe Reapers.\nA few months after Belial's defeat, the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt; attacked Caldeum (along with much of Sanctuary). &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; and the Nephalem held faith the Iron Wolves would be able to defend the city, just as they had done so against Belial.\nThe Great Enmity.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, as Kehjistan fell to demonic invasion, Hakan II ordered the gates of Caldeum sealed; that it would weather the plague besetting the empire. After the gates were sealed, Asheara led her Iron Wolves out of the city knowing full well they would never return. Instead they roamed Kehjistan, pledging their blades to any who were in need. Not so craven as to wait for &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, the Iron Wolves sought to rid &lt;a href=\"Estuar\"&gt;Estuar&lt;/a&gt; from demonic influence. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, Iron Wolves began to die in mysterious circumstances. They sought to rally forces against the demons who emerged in &lt;a href=\"helltide\"&gt;helltide&lt;/a&gt;s, and salvaged demoinc &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s found in helltides.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nIron Wolf &lt;a href=\"hireling\"&gt;hireling&lt;/a&gt;s are available in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". They are akin to &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s, but are relatively durable, and are arguably the most useful hireling in the game due to their pure elemental damage attacks and ranged fire support.

Most advantages and disadvantages are shared among the two spells. Unlike the Fire Wall, it does not increase in size as Spell Level goes higher.\nMultiple Lightning Walls can be stacked on top of each other, increasing the damage proportionally. The central sprite of the Lightning Wall does double damage.\nLike Firewall, Lightning Walls work best when cast in a straight line, rather than diagonal, since there are gaps between the active sprites on diagonal walls. Lightning Wall deals double the damage of a Firewall, but it seems to have more gaps and spaces, since monsters are more likely to walk right through it.\nLightning Wall can damage the player who casts it, and this damage is treated as lightning from a trap (thus \"of thieves\" item will half it). Each space in the charges hits every .05 second for the duration.\nDamage Calculation:\nLore.\n\"The electrical energy of Lighting, when channeled by an able magic user, is a deadly and powerful weapon. Shaping this dramatic force of nature into the form of a barrier wall requires great concentration, but can be used as an extremely effective defense against an onslaught of murderous foes. As understanding and control of this spell grows, the endurance of the wall can be increased, providing the caster with longer periods of protection.\""}

Before he left, he made the &lt;a href=\"Pathstone\"&gt;Pathstone&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a conduit channel the embers of the Fire of Life, to his \"favored children,\" namely the Inari. The Lilin and Inari remained in perpetual conflict ever since.\nAs with every other nephalem culture on Sanctuary, the Lilin devolved into humans due to &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;'s tampering with the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the Lilin's position in their homeland steadily deteriorated. At first, both peoples were equal, but then the Inari made themselves greater, too slowly for the Lilin to realize. Each side created sacred places at &lt;a href=\"Shieldholm\"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Commingling%20Pit\"&gt;parts&lt;/a&gt; of the island, where they sought to recreate &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; respectively, using whatever means were at hand. This state of affairs lasted well into the 13th century By this point, everywhere the Lilin looked, they saw \"thieves\" stealing their future. The Lilin thus set out to reclaim their birthright. Because of their prayers, Lilith's favor was brought into Sanctuary. \nFamine further intensified the acrimony between the two peoples, and Lilin began to advocate leaving their homeland. Of these voices, &lt;a href=\"Morwith\"&gt;Morwith&lt;/a&gt; was the highest-ranking elder to state this position, and while she was rebuked, she was not stripped of her title, allowing her to convince many of her followers to flee the Cradle with her. The &lt;a href=\"Pathstone\"&gt;Pathstone&lt;/a&gt; was stolen by Morwith and her followers, and they fled the island. Not long afterwards, the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20of%20Life\"&gt;Fire of Life&lt;/a&gt; ran rampant across Ancients' Cradle, causing social breakdown for both the Inari and Lilin.\nFor the Lilin who remained on the Cradle, their fortunes worsened further. &lt;a href=\"Ymuthrus\"&gt;Ymuthrus&lt;/a&gt; became the new &lt;a href=\"Prevailing%20Wind\"&gt;Prevailing Wind&lt;/a&gt; and declared that Morwith had damned her home and people with her selfishness, and that all every Lilin who had advocated fleeing the Cradle was responsible. The punishment for their sins would be &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. Even some Inari were shocked at the severity of his declaration, but his hand was not swayed, and Inari &lt;a href=\"Sanctifier\"&gt;Sanctifier&lt;/a&gt;s were assigned to carry out the ordered executions."}

Once the lover of the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, her union with him led to the creation of the first &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Eternal Conflict.\nLilith was the daughter of Mephisto, and was not spared his hatred. From time immemorial, Lilith sought to rebel against him. \nAs the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt; dragged on, Lilith tired of her father's approach to the conflict, and took an equally dim view on the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, along with her brother, &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt;. In one such battle, Lilith took an &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; as a prisoner and brought him to her lair for amusement. She was ready to torture him, but to her surprise, her touch breathed new life into the angel. The angel, named &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, awoke and rambled incoherently about his desire to escape the Eternal Conflict. Lilith realized that she and Inarius were of similar mind concerning the never-ending war, and she began to see Inarius as an individual she could manipulate towards her ends, and she gave Inarius her name. She could tell that Inarius was besotted with her, and told him that they had to steal the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, to use it to create a new world. Only then could they be together. This was the first time in the Eternal Conflict that an angel or demon had ever set aside their differences, let alone form a union.\nThe Creation of Sanctuary.\nThe pair rallied like-minded followers and stole the Worldstone from the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. A new world, &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, was created, a place where they and their kind could find respite from the Eternal Conflict. One of their first acts was to imbue &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20of%20Life\"&gt;Fire of Life&lt;/a&gt;.\nLilith and Inarius ruled their realm with a council of angels and demons, residing inside the structure that would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;. Inarius was satisfied, believing that escape from the war was sufficient. Lilith intended to show him that, in time, victory was possible. But first, she would give him children...\nRise of the Nephalem.\nLilith and Inarius gave birth to a son they would name &lt;a href=\"Linarian\"&gt;Linarian&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt;. Each placed their hand on the altar and spoke a vow, their blood and &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; mixing to form a clay figure. Lilith eagerly reached out for her progeny, but recoiled as her son's hand brushed against her tentacled barbs. Her blood mingled with the clay, and an &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord\"&gt;umbilical&lt;/a&gt; nurtured the amalgam, severing as her lifestream passed from herself to the amalgam. Inarius, initially horrified at the creature they had created, was unable to back out of the ritual, and played his part in moulding the clay alongside Lilith, basing it around their own image. Thus, Linarian was born.\nThe union of angel and demon was without precedent, as was the birth of their offspring. Linarian was the first of these new beings called \"&lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;\", but was not the last, as the pair's fellow angels and demons also produced offspring of their own. The nephalem in turn produced their own offspring. &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Lilith\"&gt;Altars&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to Lilith were erected by &lt;a href=\"the%20Ancients\"&gt;the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this period, a group of nephalem called the &lt;a href=\"Lilin\"&gt;Lilin&lt;/a&gt; emerged as Lilith's favored children. Later generations of Lilin claimed direct descent from her.\nThe Gospel of Death.\nLilith and the council were present in the Temple of the Firstborn when &lt;a href=\"Kalmor\"&gt;Kalmor&lt;/a&gt; arrived, having been summoned to account for the &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bersarik\"&gt;Bersarik&lt;/a&gt;. Bersarik, aggrieved at the death of &lt;a href=\"Gratian\"&gt;Gratian&lt;/a&gt;, had come to meet his makers, intending violence, and Kalmor had been forced to slay him. The council did not hold Kalmor responsible for Bersarik's death, and explained that while the nephalem would not succumb to age, or be touched by plague, they were still able to be slain. Presenting them the &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Severian\"&gt;Severian&lt;/a&gt;, the council ordered it destroyed, and filed out...all but Lilith, who remained. She ordered Kalmor to follow her, and led him into the bowels of the fortress-temple. There, she lit a furnace, and broke the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of the bone-sword, twisting and imprisoning the essence of the blade with a new weapon of her own crafting. The blade seemed far too heavy and broad for Kalmor to wield, but Lilith explained that as long as he used it for the purpose for which it was intended, he would have the strength to wield it.\nLilith ordered Kalmor to seek out and punish Corvik and &lt;a href=\"Helgrotha\"&gt;Helgrotha&lt;/a&gt;, believing (correctly) that they had turned against their makers. Kalmor agreed, and departed the temple-fortress.\nThe Purge.\nThe renegade angels and demons began to see that the nephalem were more powerful than their progenitors, raising concerns that the nephalem might pose a threat to their parents, or might draw the attention of Heaven and Hell to Sanctuary, neither of which would condone such progeny. Because of this, conflict arose among the renegades, some arguing for the destruction of the nephalem, others advocating that they should be spared. Inarius called for a period of reflection, which his followers obeyed. During this period, Linarian told Lilith of dreams he'd had, that a descent into utter evil would mean terrible destruction for Sanctuary, whereas the complete absence of evil would result in stagnation and decay. He hoped Lilith would see the same truth he had.\nAccording to an ancient text, Lilith was driven into a mad frenzy at the prospect of her children's extinction. She saw the nephalem as the future, and as the means of ending the Eternal Conflict once and for all (albeit with the proviso of them serving as her own soldiers). She morphed into a new, horrific form, and hunted down her fellow renegades, slaughtering angels and demons alike. She ruthlessly murdered every follower of Inarius, but the violence she enacted did not discriminate between those she wished to save, and those she sought to eradicate. As such, nephalem were among those who met their end at Lilith's hands. Linarian later wondered if his warning to his mother about his visions was what drove her to act with such savagery.\nInarius later discovered the carnage Lilith had wrought. Horrified, Inarius clashed with Lilith for this action. In their conflict, they were supported by their favored children \u2014 the future &lt;a href=\"Inari\"&gt;Inari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilin\"&gt;Lilin&lt;/a&gt;. Lilith was defeated, but Inarius could not bring himself to kill her, so he banished her from Sanctuary into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. \nHe then attuned the Worldstone to cause the powers of the nephalem to diminish over time. Through each subsequent nephalem generation, their powers diminished, effectively giving birth to a weaker, mortal race known as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity.\nLegends and Legacy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; s (long before devolving into &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s) despised Lilith, to the extent that even mentioning her name was considered taboo in some circles. In contrast, &lt;a href=\"Edario\"&gt;Edario&lt;/a&gt; worshipped her. A priest of the city, &lt;a href=\"Hurit\"&gt;Hurit&lt;/a&gt;, preached that Lilith would return to Sanctuary when she was needed most, and lead the nephalem in a final battle against Heaven and Hell to save her progeny from their tyranny. To this end, an army of Edario marched on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; to claim the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, intent on bringing it under Lilith's control. It is unclear how much, if any influence Lilith had over Edario, but &lt;a href=\"Hiram\"&gt;Hiram&lt;/a&gt; (a Barbarian that had come to worship Lilith) claimed that Lilith had \"made it clear to him\" that a larger war was coming, and that every drop of nephalem blood spilt was a waste. The attack was a failure, but Bul-Kathos knew it wouldn't be the last. While Lilith was gone from the world, the words she'd left behind would mean there were no shortage of nephalem willing to fight and die for her. This, the Barbarians began their vigil of the Worldstone. \nAs time passed, the nephalem devolved into humans. However, Lilith was not entirely forgotten by her progeny, and she was regarded as \"the First Mother\" (of humanity) in legends. At some point, Rathma was imparted with a &lt;a href=\"Rathma%27s%20Prophecy\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt; that foretold Lilith's return to Sanctuary, along with Inarius.\nThe Sin War.\nLilith was able to return to Sanctuary three human lifetimes before revealing herself. She manifested in/around &lt;a href=\"Hashir\"&gt;Hashir&lt;/a&gt;, as this was one of the focal points of Sanctuary's reality. However, she was not the only power operating within Sanctuary, as the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt; began, as as the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; (led by Inarius) and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Triune\"&gt;Temple of the Triune&lt;/a&gt; (led by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;) secretly waged a war for control of humanity. She altered the power of the Worldstone with a spell, allowing the nephalem to develop their powers once more.\nBirthright.\nLeaving Seram.\n3000 years before the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, Lilith made her move. She came to the village of &lt;a href=\"Seram\"&gt;Seram&lt;/a&gt; in the guise of a noblewoman named \"Lylia,\" where she allowed herself to be seen by &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian%20ul-Diomed\"&gt;Uldyssian ul-Diomed&lt;/a&gt;, as she petted his horse. While she could have used her abilities to control Uldyssian as her puppet, she planned to make him a willing servant, and as such, a more effective one. After a brief encounter, she seemingly vanished. Not long afterwards, she let herself be found by Uldyssian again in a nearby forest. She claimed to have seen something in the gloom, prompting Uldyssian to investigate. He found the body of &lt;a href=\"Caligio\"&gt;Caligio&lt;/a&gt;, a Triune acolyte, not knowing that Lilith had been behind his murder. Following him, \"Lylia\" beheld the sight, and fainted, allowing Uldyssian to catch her. He\u00a0took her to the &lt;a href=\"Boar%27s%20Head\"&gt;Boar's Head&lt;/a&gt;, where she regained consciousness. She asked about what had happened and imparted words that her disdain for Sanctuary's two main religious bodies was close to Uldyssian's own.\nUldyssian was arrested for the murder of a second missionary (this one of the Cathedral of Light), as his knife had been found embedded in the man's rib-cage (again of Lilith's doing). Lylia visited him in the town guardhouse, telling him that she believed his claims of innocence. She also told him about how her family had been blamed for the burning of a temple, that it had remained out of the affairs of both the Cathedral and Triune, while other nobles had picked sides. Her family lost everything, including their freedom (if not their lives), while she had fled with what money she could. She told him that representatives of both sects would be arriving and that when they did, he would have to speak up defiantly in order to get the people on his side. She kissed him, then departed.\nThe next day, Lylia turned up to Uldyssian's trial, her presence disturbing the Cathedral representative. Before he could react, &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; began to strike the area, causing widespread damage. Lylia led Uldyssian away from the town, though pretended to fall, twisting her ankle. However, then it healed at Uldyssian's touch, as if by &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, the storm had stopped, and Lylia attributed both events to Uldyssian himself. She urged him to believe her, telling him to wish the clouds away, that if he did not, she would relent in her beliefs. The clouds did indeed clear. Furthermore, as Uldyssian charged back into Seram to rescue his brother &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt;, Lylia watched as his powers were unleashed upon the Cathedral's &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s, killing them. However, the display of such wanton power turned the people of Seram against Uldyssian himself. He and Lylia fled, accompanied by Mendeln, &lt;a href=\"Achilios\"&gt;Achilios&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Serenthia\"&gt;Serenthia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Road to Partha.\nOutside Seram, Lylia gave Uldyssian one last 'test' of his powers, causing a bush to grow. She urged him to travel to &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;, to rally the common folk against the Cathedral and Triune. How many, she asked, had suffered like him in similar circumstances. Uldyssian warmed to the idea, just as he 'warmed' to her as she declared that they would be together always. Thus, was their relationship consummated. It would not be the first time that they made love, and each time, Lylia was able to gain insight into Uldyssian's personality.\nThe humans back at the camp were attacked by a demon of &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt;, which they were able to fend off. Lylia suggested that it was the creature that was responsible for the missionaries' deaths. The demon mentioned his master by name, and Uldyssian suggested that this \"Lucion\" must be a member of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;. Lylia quickly backed up this theory, and they headed for Kehjan, in order to \"change the world.\" As they rode, Mendeln remained the voice of caution, but Lylia countered these concerns at every opportunity, playing on Uldyssian's sympathies in regards to her supposed personal history. She also took the opportunity to mentally torment Serenthia, whom she could tell was infatuated with Uldyssian. Not long afterwards, they were attacked by Triune forces led by &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt;, including demons. Uldyssian was able to fend them off, but one of the demons called out to Lucion, suggesting that this being was linked to the Triune, not the Mage Clans.\nNot long afterwards, they arrived near &lt;a href=\"Partha\"&gt;Partha&lt;/a&gt;. It was a destination that Lylia tried to steer Uldyssian away from, but Uldyssian nonetheless entered the town. Uldyssian began healing the townsfolk, and their stay lasted days at &lt;a href=\"Ethon\"&gt;Ethon&lt;/a&gt;'s household. Uldyssian's healing led to the awakening of the people's nephalem powers. Lylia noted that her plan had gone awry, in that she'd expected to be in Kehjan by now. However, she reasoned that Partha would be an adequate fulcrum for her plans regardless. One night, as they made love, Lylia nearly slipped into her true form. She managed to contain herself, and heal the scar she caused on Uldyssian's back without him even knowing it. However, it resulted with him receiving a nightmare in which he saw her in her true form. This caused her great concern, given that she didn't know the dream's origin. Still, she reasoned that if it came to it, she could simply kill Uldyssian and pick another. After all, there was no shortage of men in this world...\nOne night, at the estate, the group came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Morlu\"&gt;Morlu&lt;/a&gt;, led by Malic. Both Ethon and Cedric were killed, as was Malic himself. Uldyssian found her by Malic's eviscerated corpse. She claimed that, partly due to her powers that Uldyssian had awoken, she threw herself at Malic and thrusted his own arm into his chest, killing him. Once again, she was able to avoid suspicion.\nLilith Revealed.\nHaunted by the Morlu attack, Uldyssian left Partha, intent on heading to Kehjan himself. Lylia followed him and pleaded to remain at her side. They kissed, but Uldyssian stood back, as something...\"changed\". At first, \"Lylia\" was unaware of his change in focus, and was confused, but Uldyssian was now seeing her in her true, demonic form. She played to his sympathies, claiming that Lucion (a word that escaped her lips) had changed her, that only Uldyssian's love could restore her. Lilith, still playing the part of \"Lylia,\" recounted their history together, but this only convinced Uldyssian that this demon and Lylia were one and the same.\nEventually, Lilith dropped the charade, openly mocking her former lover. She claimed that every manifestation of Uldyssian's powers had been by her own doing. She admitted to killing the two missionaries at Seram, and ranted on, gloating at Uldyssian's ignorance as to the true history of Sanctuary. \"The nephalem will rise\" again, this time assuming \"their rightful place!\" She will assume her rightful place, \"no matter how\" (hard) \"the High Heavens and the Burning Hells cry out against it.\" The two came to blows, and Uldyssian found himself outmatched by Lilith as she tormented him, both verbally and physically, using her powers. He was without any of his own powers that he'd demonstrated previously, and shortly thereafter, Lilith disappeared. Uldyssian saw what she'd done\u2014without his powers, he would be seen as a fraud, perhaps worse. As her parting words reminded him, it would be a truth that he might not survive.\nUldyssian and his friends headed for &lt;a href=\"Toraja\"&gt;Toraja&lt;/a&gt;, only to be followed by several Parthans. It was in the &lt;a href=\"Torajan%20Jungles\"&gt;Torajan Jungles&lt;/a&gt; that Lucion appeared, seeking to test Uldyssian, and gauge whatever powers he might have. And he did possess them. Enough to defeat Lucion himself. So while Uldyssian, emboldened by both power and vision, formed the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; to dismantle both the Triune and Cathedral, \"Lucion\" returned to the base of the former, taking the seat of the Primus. \"Lucion,\" or more specifically, Lilith, disguised as her brother. Sitting on the throne, she awaited Uldyssian's arrival.\nScales of the Serpent.\nLilith maintained her appearance as Lucion. &lt;a href=\"Astrogha\"&gt;Astrogha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arihan\"&gt;Arihan&lt;/a&gt; noticed the shift in \"Lucion's\" demenor, especially how the Primus seemed unfazed by the destruction of Triune outposts, but did not suspect anything close to the truth.\nToraja.\nLilith was confronted by Uldyssian when he burnt down the Triune temple in &lt;a href=\"Toraja\"&gt;Toraja&lt;/a&gt;. While she had taken on the form of Lucion, her true form shone beneath the human she presented herself as. She attempted to seduce Uldyssian, and nearly succeeded. Regardless, she revealed to Uldyssian that destroying the Triune was what she wanted, just as she wanted him to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. In this, she claimed, he had no choice. Either he unlocked his nephalem powers and those of the Edyrem, wiping out the Triune and Cathedral, or he didn't, in which case, she'd use the vast forces of the Triune to crush the Edyrem. Uldyssian declared that he wouldn't do her bidding, but as she sneered, if that was the case, why had he yet to attack? She disappeared, her taunts echoing around her former lover.\nHashir.\nAt some point after Toraja, Lilith possessed &lt;a href=\"Serenthia\"&gt;Serenthia&lt;/a&gt;. Serenthia and Uldyssian became involved romantically over the period following Toraja, and Uldyssian noted that he had never felt as close to someone since \"Lylia.\" Lilith had definitely taken control of Serenthia by the time the Edyrem reached &lt;a href=\"Hashir\"&gt;Hashir&lt;/a&gt;, by which point she had also weakened Uldyssian. Hashir was also an intended destination for her. Serenthia was abducted by &lt;a href=\"morlu\"&gt;morlu&lt;/a&gt;, acting on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Astrogha\"&gt;Astrogha&lt;/a&gt; (who had taken her position as Primus), but immediately returned, and directed her powers against them. At that point, Uldyssian himself was abducted by &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;. This hadn't been Lilith's plan, as she'd hoped to use Uldyssian as her puppet; to control the Edyrem through him. However, this still furthered Lilith's own goals, as with Uldyssian gone, she now had de facto command over the Edyrem.\nLilith unleashed her army against Hashir's Triune temple, making a grusome display of the priests. She claimed that the priests themselves had abducted Uldyssian, and as such, the brutal treatment was warranted. The carnage went even further, as the priests claimed that they had no knowledge of what had happened to Uldyssian. Lilith thus directed the Edyrem to scour the city for supporters of the Triune. After three days, Hashir was little more than a scar. On the fourth day, Lilith entered the town square, declaring that she had brought peace to the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;. Its inhabitants might have disagreed, but as they had been herded out of their homes by the Edyrem, they held their tongues.\nLilith took up residence in the temple, namely the quarters that had been used by the high priest. Still possessing Serenthia, she seduced &lt;a href=\"Romus\"&gt;Romus&lt;/a&gt; (a member of the Edyrem), claiming that she needed his protection. Her influence continued to spread over the Edyrem, and they devolved into a cult that worshipped her. The temple in Hashir was converted to worship her. She declared that Uldyssian was dead, and using him as a martyr, announced her intentions to destroy both the Triune and Cathedral of Light. \nThe Sacrifice.\nUldyssian returned to the mortal realm, and informed Romus that Lilith was possessing Serenthia. Romus played along, but reported to Lilith. Uldyssian was able to incapacitate Lilith briefly, but Romus knocked him out\u2014all part of Lilith's plan.\nUldyssian came to, bound to an altar, with Lilith and Romus looking down on him. She killed Romus, intending to use his blood for a ritual. Lilith and Uldyssian verbally sparred, and Lilith suspected that another's hand was at play, given Uldyssian's sudden return. She suspected that he had been in contact with Inarius. Uldyssian claimed that was the truth, that Inarius wanted to kill her. However, in doing so, this made Lilith realize that Uldyssian \"hadn't\" been in contact with Inarius, as she believed (correctly) that even now, Inarius would never be able to bring himself to kill her.\nShe announced her plan to use Romus's blood to cast a spell over Uldyssian, to make her his dupe. When they'd first met, she'd made him her willing servant, but now, she didn't need Uldyssian himself to be as effective, because now, she had an army at her back, one that didn't see Uldyssian as their leader anymore. Uldyssian would gather converts, and have them pledge allegiance to her. She revealed that coming to Hashir had been her plan, given that it was located on one of Sanctuary's focal points.\nLilith began the ritual in the presence of her Edyrem servants, but they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Achilios\"&gt;Achilios&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, he was able to exorcise Lilith from Serenthia's body. Lilith cursed them, but promptly disappeared.\nThe Cult of the One.\nLilith returned to the Grand Temple of the Triune, and again took on the appearance of the Primus (much to the confusion of the staff, as there were now two individuals impersonating Lucion). Plans within plans forming, she concluded that her position was still stable. The Prime Evils sought Sanctuary as their own, and were terrified that Heaven would discover its existence. In the scheme of things, they would abide her taking control of the world under the rationale that they could retake it from her later. What they wouldn't be able to count on was an army of nephalem at her back.\nReturning to the quarters of the Primus, she summonsed Astrogha. Astrogha appeared, but had since realized that Lilith was not Lucion, but Lucion's sister. He attacked her, but anticipating that the demon might have discovered her ruse, Lilith was prepared, and fought back, forcing Astrogha to retreat. Now as the sole Primus, she took comfort in knowing that the Triune was now hers.\nThe Edyrem, now under Uldyssian's command and removed from the cult Lilith had turned them into, marched on the Grand Temple of the Triune. Having given up on her desire to control them, Lilith laid a trap for the army, with morlu approaching from its front, and Peace Warders approaching from its rear. She would wipe it out, and as such, be unchallenged by any force in Sanctuary bar the Cathedral of Light.\nThe Peace Warders attacked first, but Lilith kept the morlu at bay, much to Uldyssian's surprise. However, she unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Thonos\"&gt;Thonos&lt;/a&gt; (a massive demon) from below, mocking Uldyssian telepathically as it happened. She gave Uldyssian the chance to surrender, but Uldyssian refused. Victory seemed assured for Lilith, but then the fallen began rising, as Mendeln's &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; raised the dead on the side of the Edyrem. What had once seemed like victory became a rout for the Triune as the Edyrem and undead cut through their lines.\nUldyssian entered the temple, intent on finding her. Lilith conjured duplicates of herself, but Uldyssian saw through them, and finally found her, having taken on the form of a priestess. He caused the structure to collapse on her, seemingly killing the demon. However, Lilith survived; at the last moment, she left the priestss's body. The deception even managed to fool Rathma, who had arrived with every intention of confirming her death. But as soon as he departed, &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; revealed himself as the one who concealed her presence from their son to prevent their own spawn from killing his mother. Before Lilith could react, Inarius compressed her within a sphere. Even as she promised that Uldyssian would be his undoing, Inarius once again banished Lilith, this time assuring that the flaws that had allowed Lilith to return were removed.\nThe Veiled Prophet.\nMendeln encountered Lilith while searching for Rathma, who had also been banished to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; by Inarius. Lilith rapidly changed her form to Lylia, Serenthia and other women he had known and admired in an attempt to entice him to rescue her. Mendeln was briefly tempted, only to recoil in disgust for his weakness and left her cursing his name.\nInterlude.\nLilith would spend over 3000 years trapped in the Void, but her influence in Sanctuary remained. Devotees continued to worship her, and would go to any length to worship their matriarch, even tainting trinkets in her honor. It was prophesized that Lilith would one day return to Sanctuary.\nPandemonium Event.\nAfter her legions of &lt;a href=\"Succubi\"&gt;Succubi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; were killed by mortals who successfully defended the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, Lilith swore to personally intervene. She masterminded the revival of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; by manifesting herself in the mortal realm and performing a ritual of Dark Summoning. This ritual, long thought to be impossible by the most powerful mortal wizards, allowed Lilith to link with Diablo across realms, strengthening him until he was finally able to once again reincarnate himself in the mortal plane. Rage and a deep yearning for revenge boiled within the eyes of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Lord of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, and together he and Lilith resurrected the two remaining &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Duriel\"&gt;Duriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt;, two of their strongest agents.\nDiablo announced his grand plan - the Three were finally strong enough to spread Pandemonium throughout Sanctuary. Lilith could have easily conducted an assault on her own, but because she had been left severely weakened by the Dark Summoning ritual, she &lt;a href=\"Lilith%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;agreed to aid&lt;/a&gt; the Prime Evils and command some of their remaining forces.\nChildren of Lilith.\nIn/around &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1272&lt;/a&gt;, there was a resurgence in worship of Lilith in Sanctuary. Because of the prayers of the &lt;a href=\"Lilin\"&gt;Lilin&lt;/a&gt;, Lilith's favor was able to manifest in the mortal realm. Her favor rained down on her faithful, and she called out to her followers.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, the gospel of the Cathedral of Light stated that Lilith would one day return to Sanctuary, and that it would be the sin of mankind who would bring her into the mortal realm.\nLilith's Return.\nBy Three They Come.\nThousands of years after her banishment from Sanctuary, Lilith was summoned back to it by a macabre ritual in an underground chamber. Three &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and a scholar, the former looking for &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and the latter for knowledge, were pursued by zombies into the apparent safety of the chamber, but one of the adventurers turned out to be much more than he seemed (in truth, a member of the Triune named &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;Elias&lt;/a&gt;). The other two adventurers and the scholar were sacrificed on a triangle of pillars, their &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; forming a construct between them through which Lilith took form and passed.\nMother's Protection.\nLilith's return spawned a new wave of cultists and worshipers in Sanctuary. Her mere presence in the mortal realm awakened darkness in the hearts of many humans; old wounds were reopened and past hatreds rekindled. Her agents operated in &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, filling the &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; there with paranoia, not knowing who they could trust. People began to worship her as a goddess, and carried out blood sacrifices to appease her. Lilith began a brutal campaign to take Sanctuary as her own and bring humanity under her control. She ordered the &lt;a href=\"Devourer%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Devourer of Souls&lt;/a&gt; to obtain demon &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; for her, and the &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Whisper%20%28Cult%29\"&gt;Mother's Whisper&lt;/a&gt; cult served as her emissaries, spreading her design across &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Other cults dedicated to Lilith, though not necessarily acting under her direct orders, included &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Embrace%20%28Cult%29\"&gt;Mother's Embrace&lt;/a&gt; (nature-worshipping hierophants), &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Kiss%20%28Cult%29\"&gt;Mother's Kiss&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromatic&lt;/a&gt; cult dedicated to protecting Sanctuary), &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Mercy%20%28Cult%29\"&gt;Mother's Mercy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;-wielding fanatics), and &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Warmth%20%28Cult%29\"&gt;Mother's Warmth&lt;/a&gt; (violent &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s who attacked their fellow humans in order to claim their &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; birthright). &lt;a href=\"Hell%27s%20Champion\"&gt;Hell's Champion&lt;/a&gt; armor was utilized by her mightiest &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. Molded by the forces of Hell, they set out to purge the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; from Sanctuary.\nA Cold and Iron Faith.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, Lilith appeared in the church of &lt;a href=\"Nevesk\"&gt;Nevesk&lt;/a&gt; during a sermon by a priest of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. She claimed that the lords of Hell were coming to devour their world, and that salvation lay not in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, but in themselves. She bid her children \"break the chains and be beautiful in sin,\" and the congregation obeyed, murdering the priest that had preached the Cathedral's creed. Lilith exited the church and told Elias to head to the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to continue preparations.\nAt some point while in the Fractured Peaks, likely after her appearance in Nevesk, Lilith passed through &lt;a href=\"Velkhova\"&gt;Velkhova&lt;/a&gt;. Like in Nevesk, the people there were driven mad by her presence, and turned against the local &lt;a href=\"Cormond\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varshan\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt;.\nLilith was sighted at &lt;a href=\"Gale%20Valley\"&gt;Gale Valley&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Hill\"&gt;Pine Hill&lt;/a&gt;, she gained entry to the &lt;a href=\"Windfall%20Hollow\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; there amid a Cathedral retinue. Upon entering the underground city of &lt;a href=\"Kasama\"&gt;Kasama&lt;/a&gt;, she revealed herself as a demon to the Cathedral's forces standing guard. The result was a bloodbath as Lilith slaughtered the defenders. One of the retinue, &lt;a href=\"Vhenard\"&gt;Vhenard&lt;/a&gt;, begged for her life. Lilith spared her, and led her deeper into the city. She showed Vhenard Kasama's record of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, and explained how angels and demons had fought for control of Creation since the beginning of time. When Vhenard asked to what end, Lilith simply laughed.\nNot long afterwards, Lilith talked to Vhenard directly offering her knowledge. She pointed out that Vhenard had dragged her daughter all over Sanctuary in search of knowledge, despite Vhenard's protestations that it had been to teach her &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; to survive. Despite her misgivings, Vhenard fell to Lilith's temptations. As they moved through the city, Lilith told Vhenard of her seduction of &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, the creation of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and the origin of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. She was particularly prideful when she told Vhenard of the birth of Rathma, and told Vhenard his lair lay further within the city. \nMoving on, Lilith asked Vhenard if she had faith in her, to which Vhenard responded that she hoped she did. Lilith told her that all she needed to know for now was that they were going to meet Rathma, as he was the key to her plans.\nLilith later told Vhenard that she had mastered her fear, but could sense that she missed her daughter. Lilith told her to go or stay, that it was time to choose. Vhenard chose to stay with Lilith, who told her that to reach Rathma, they would have to cross a &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the ruins. It would require a ritual that she would teach to her. They shed the blood of a priest who had been part of the escort. The \"divine element\" within the man's blood gave Lilith the means to cross the lake. By this point (or perhaps as part of the ritual) Lilith had gifted Vhenard with magical abilities, but she crossed the lake by herself. Vhenard was left on the lake shore, insane.\nLilith entered the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Necropolis of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt; and found Rathma, slain by Inarius. She told him that while she wasn't certain if he would have sided with her, she would nevertheless keep a special place for him in the world she was looking to build. She took the key to Hell from her son's staff, and vowed that his sacrifice wouldn't be in vain.\nThe Knife Twists Again.\nWith a key to Hell in her possession, Lilith had to find a way to safely cross the hellfire barrier around the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cathedral of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;. For that, she needed &lt;a href=\"Astaroth\"&gt;Astaroth&lt;/a&gt;, Mephisto's lieutenant, and the keeper of the barrier. Unfortunately, Astaroth was said to have been \"killed\" during the &lt;a href=\"Days%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Days of Ash&lt;/a&gt; by a group of three. Knowing that a demon cannot permanently be killed, she searched for his so called killers.\nLilith first went for &lt;a href=\"Donan\"&gt;Donan&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Eldhaime%20Keep\"&gt;place of residence&lt;/a&gt; was the least hidden. She confronted him in his office within &lt;a href=\"Firebreak%20Manor\"&gt;his manor&lt;/a&gt;, after enthralling him to grant her entrance. Cowed by her presence, Donan broke free from her control. She asked about Astaroth's fate, but Donan refused to answer. Not even tempting him with the offer to return his youth was enough for him to answer. In her annoyance, she cut him on his lip. Looking around the office, she saw a portrait of the heroes of the Days of Ash. Satisfied with the clue, she left after being rebuked once more. In a bid of petty revenge, she enraged the local Khazra to attack &lt;a href=\"Eldhaime%20Keep\"&gt;Eldhaime Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nDance of the Makers.\nAt some point after her release, Lilith came to power within Hell. When Hell was invaded by a &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Knight\"&gt;mortal force&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Inarius, Lilith led an army of demons against them. During the battle, Inarius caught sight of Lilith and flew across the battlefield, landing amidst the demons. As Lilith looked on, Inarius hurled his &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; at her, which was blocked by an &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;.\nLilith retreats into a decayed hellish cathedral, as Inarius fights hordes of demons to chase after her. Inside the cathedral, she taunts Inarius from the shadows, asking him if there was any purpose for his actions. The angel discovers her and attacked, but she broke his spear with her wing. Inarius used the shaft of his spear to stab her, which she allowed. She then asked him why the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;Heavens&lt;/a&gt; still had not answered him, even after killing his own son and injuring her. Inarius tried to deny it, but the truth was glaring. In his grief he cried to the sky, asking if he had not done enough. Lilith stabbed Inarius in his back through the heart, with his own spear. In his pain and terror he cried to the heavens once again for salvation, but is left unanswered. Lilith replied that his place was in Hell, before violently ripping out his wings. After an explosion of Light, all that is left of Inarius are the half-molten remnants of his armor.\nLilith eventually reached &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cathedral of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;, where the essence of her father was residing. However, &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; managed to get there before her, and the latter sealed Mephisto in a &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; and fled from Hell. A wrathful Lilith fought the Wanderer, even taking her true form as the Daughter of Hatred. However, she was defeated and fatally wounded. Dying, Lilith expressed her grief towards the history going full circle yet again. In her last words, she warned the Wanderer that (without her) the price of victory would be too high for them to pay; that they threw out their only chance to survive, before turning into stone and crumbling into dust.\nLegacy.\nLilith's warning about what was to come was arguably prophetic. Not long after her defeat, demons from the darkest depths of Hell made their way into Sanctuary, ushering in a new age of death and wanton destruction.\nLilith's blood petals remained in Sanctuary after her death. An enigmatic figure arrived in &lt;a href=\"Estuar\"&gt;Estuar&lt;/a&gt; from the west, collecting the blood petals as they made their way across the continent. To what end, only they could answer.\nLilith's actions in Velkhova indirectly led to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Malignant\"&gt;Malignant&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Malignant were ultimately wiped out. \nLilith's blood indirectly saved the Wanderer from succumbing to vampirism. Because of the blood petals they'd ingested in Nevesk, the Wanderer was prevented from turning into a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; after they were bitten.\nThe Wanderer was influenced by Lilith even after her death. Her blood petals continued to pulse against the Wanderer's skin when they touched. Priest &lt;a href=\"Voszalko\"&gt;Voszalko&lt;/a&gt; tried to exorcise Lilith's influence from the Wanderer, but they blacked out and killed the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Penitent\"&gt;Knights Penitent&lt;/a&gt; he had brought with him.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nLilith appears as a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Event\"&gt;Pandemonium Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo Immortal.\nLilith is referenced in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" via the &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Lament\"&gt;Mother's Lament&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"legendary%20gem\"&gt;legendary gem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cosmetic%20set\"&gt;cosmetic set&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Hatred%27s%20Heritage\"&gt;Hatred's Heritage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Lilith\"&gt;Children of Lilith&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nThe re-emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; originated by Lilith is a major story element of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Lilith%27s%20Writings\"&gt;Lilith's Writings&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" explaining her role in creating &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and giving birth to the Nephalem. The fact that all mortals are descended from her, a demon, was &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s motivation to enact a plan to exterminate humankind in \"\", and the reason he was able to use the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; as a weapon against them.\n&lt;a href=\"Lilith%27s%20Embrace\"&gt;Lilith's Embrace&lt;/a&gt; is a set of wings available for &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202019\"&gt;BlizzCon 2019&lt;/a&gt; attendants.\nDiablo IV.\nLilith appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Players pursue her across the game's storyline, and the feud between she and Inarius is one of the game's key plot points.\n&lt;a href=\"Altars%20of%20Lilith\"&gt;Altars of Lilith&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the game's overworld. These serve as \"collectibles\" and grant account-bound stat bonuses to all characters the player may create.\nShe is referenced in the flavor text of the &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Embrace\"&gt;Mother's Embrace&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Unique\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rings\"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;, which is guaranteed drop from defeating her in the campaign.\nIn the final battle against &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;the Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, Lilith reveals her true form as The Daughter of Hatred, with features reminiscent of her &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn World Tiers I-III, Lilith's attacks generally tend to be slow (600ms), with the animations showing a lond wind-up followed by a quick strike. Players with squishy builds can easily be instakilled by her AoE attacks in phase 2. When she hovers over sections of the arena, players have approximately 10 seconds before the section gives way, leading to death. Interestingly, the fight is among the easier ones in the game, due to the sheer quantity of health potions dropped throughout the course of the battle as well as the ease of avoiding damage.\nOnce players reach World Tier 4, they can fight the Echo of Lilith, an \"\u00fcber\" version of her. The encounter is exactly like the final battle against Lilith in the Cathedral of Hatred, but she's instead at level 100 and much harder to defeat. The Echo of Lilith considered the ultimate challenge in \"Diablo IV\".\nIn Other Games.\nCall of Duty.\nLilith is available as an operator in \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty%3A_Modern_Warfare_II\"&gt;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOverwatch.\nA Lilith skin for Moira is available in \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/Overwatch_2\"&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nCruel and generous in equal measure, Lilith possessed a seductive, manipulative nature. &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt; noted that Lilith was a creature of many plots, but also noted that her handiwork could often be identified as being hers. Her plots were constantly shifting as the need and opportunity arose. \nAs a demon, Lilith stood taller than a man. During the Sin War, she had splayed hooves instead of feet. She bore no clothing upon her body thus in this unclad state she could be seen to be dark green of complexion. Fiery quills of an emerald sheen along with similar scales adorned her head in place of hair, and those same quills ran down her spine to culminate in a reptilian tail ending in savage barbs. Her hands were no stranger to this savage appearance and so her four-fingered hands ended in curved claws. Lilith's mouth bore sharp fang-like teeth for shredding her victims and her eyes were smoldering crimson orbs devoid of pupils. Uldyssian noted, however, that even in her demonic form, Lilith possessed seductive qualities. After being reborn within Sanctuary, Lilith possessed a more humanoid appearance, though gained/retained horns, wings and a tail.\nLilith's possible true form was displayed in her final battle with the Wanderer. In this form, she appeared similar to her father, but smaller in size. She had an emaciated demonic head and torso with enlarged and ribbed horns and wings. Her legs were reduced to vestigial spines, and her tail was enlarged to a spine that doubles as a coiling tail. Hints of the \"clothes\" she wore showed in this form; with her \"corset\" becoming an exposed ribcage, and her \"ornamental pauldrons\" becoming mutated shoulder blades. She hovered and flew instead of walking and appeared to lose most of what humans might identify as female physical traits.\nLilith awoke \"burning urges\" within all those who are near her, whether they be human or demon. Profound fears, unchecked rage, repressed impulses, sinful desires, all were brought forth violently and irresistibly by her mere presence. In the case of humans, Lilith's presence awakened their demonic half, driving them mad with hatred. Some who were touched by Lilith developed an insatiable hunger for that which was not theirs. Far beyond simple greed, these followers held covetousness as a virtue and approached the acquisition of their desires with religious fervor. Others were \"awoken\" with new fire stocked in their hearts. \nAbilities.\nLilith was a powerful demon, resilient to magic and steel alike, able to even slay an entire group of &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Penitent\"&gt;Knights Penitent&lt;/a&gt; by herself. Even while imprisoned in the Void, she was still apparently powerful enough to influence Sanctuary, though this required the aid of her followers in the mortal realm.\nLilith possessed the ability to change her form. During the Eternal Conflict, she appeared almost human-like in nature. Prior to slaughtering Inarius's followers, she morphed into a horrific form, \"of tooth and claw, of spike and blade.\"\nShe could take on human form and/or disguise herself as one, her \"Lylia\" persona being a case in point. However, in this disguise, some animals (such as horses) were instinctively put off by her. Likewise, she could disguise herself as other demons. She could possess humans in a manner that does not kill them, which allowed her to retain possession over extended periods of time, without awakening suspicion. In such examples, the human's consciousness was said to be sleeping, and could be reawakened, though with risk to the host. Lilith was able to gain access to her host's memories through this method.\nShe possessed the ability to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; (or a similar ability), doing so in a green flash, and healing abilities. She was able to (re)forge blades, as well as transfer the essence of one weapon to another. She could create fake duplicates of herself. She was also able to fly, as her large wings allowed her to take to the air in a large leap.\nShe was also proficient in &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;, and could craft &lt;a href=\"Lilith%27s%20Lament\"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amalgam%20of%20Rage\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. There is evidence that her constructs could even be created on Sanctuary while she was still trapped in the Void (at least after the Worldstone's destruction), though this was only possible due to the prayers of the &lt;a href=\"Lilin\"&gt;Lilin&lt;/a&gt;. She could also create constructs out of blood, and even liquify herself to blood and move very quickly. She could also wield flames, though it was not a favored means of combat. She blessed demons that gained her favor with the ability to create blood runes.\nShe also has some skill in divination, being able to sense when she was being scried, even if it was a powerful artifact like the &lt;a href=\"Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; that was used to scry her. She was also able to break the connection, or hijack it to trap her opponent in a nightmare.\nRelationships.\nBefore her betrayal, Lilith was especially close to her brother, Lucion. He considered to know her better than any other being in Creation save their father.\nLilith's relationship with the nephalem (and by extension, humanity) was complex and at times, contradictory. According to &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, Lilith was quite happy to manipulate others to her own means. Even her desire to save the nephalem from extinction was not due to any motherly concern, but because she wanted them as her servants. However, it has also been stated that Lilith would always love her children, despite her disappointment in them. One element of such disappointment was her claim that she had given humanity free will, yet humanity had squandered this gift by following causes and prophets blindly.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, Lilith appeared to display genuine affection for both humanity and Rathma. noted that Lilith's apparent desire to save humanity from Hell seemed genuine, and in their vision of the demon, Lilith urged her 'children' to embrace their true nature (sin). The &lt;a href=\"Mother%27s%20Embrace%20%28Cult%29\"&gt;Mother's Embrace&lt;/a&gt; cult claimed to spread Lilith's 'love' to humanity, though it is debatable as to whether such 'love' would be welcomed.\nHowever, even by Lilith's own admission to &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;Elias&lt;/a&gt;, she did not come to save humanity, but to empower them. Lilith was willing to treat her 'children' as pawns, such as casting Vhenard aside when she was no longer needed. Worse, she was willing to use Donan's son, Yorin, both as a vessel for Astaroth as part of their bargain so she can gain safe passage in Hell and as a measure of gaining revenge on Donan for defying her, showcasing that Lilith was both spiteful and vengeful towards anyone who stands in her way.\nIn the case of Rathma, Lilith appeared to display genuine grief for her son's death. She was favorable toward the &lt;a href=\"Animus%20Revenants\"&gt;Animus Revenants&lt;/a&gt;, for they heeded Rathma's teachings (in addition to worshipping her), and their loyalty to her son met with her approval.\nTrivia.\nCharacter Development.\nCharacter Design.\nLilith's appearance has changed over time:"}

She is sometimes known as \u00dcber Andariel due to her similar in-game model and &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; attacks. The Pandemonium Event may not be canonical accurate within the full storyline of the series, so it is unclear whether &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; as a story character was \"really\" present in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; during the time period of \"Diablo II\".\nIn-game.\nLilith's in-game model is a re-use of &lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt;'s, but colored grey and black. Lilith has a deadly poison attack she will cast when you get up close. It is safest to fight her from a distance whenever possible. &lt;a href=\"Antidote%20Potion\"&gt;Antidote Potion&lt;/a&gt;s come in very handy, as her poison attacks are far more potent than Andariel's. Her physical strikes are incredibly powerful, and gear which provides Physical Damage Reduction, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Resistance\"&gt;Poison Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and Reduced Poison Duration helps immensely. High health is also a must. Lilith cannot be slowed by &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nLilith regenerates life twice as fast as a normal monster. Her melee attack also has a 100% chance of dealing +33% poison damage on striking over 9 seconds.\nLilith uses the following Skills: &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Spray\"&gt;Poison Spray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Bolt\"&gt;Poison Bolt&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotice that her Poison Spray has a constant effect just like &lt;a href=\"Inferno%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;Inferno&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore , when someone is killed by her, it will say \"Player was slain by an evil force.\" This has now been fixed.\nShe also has the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Enchanted%20%282%29\"&gt;Poison Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; bonus."}

It is guaranteed to be found in the Chest, and drops &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Account\"&gt;account-bound&lt;/a&gt; for every party member. However, the Chest only appears in the Cave some of the time, and the Cave only appears rarely.\nAcquisition.\nThis ingredient can be very difficult to obtain, since the appearance of the Mysterious Cave and the Mysterious Chest inside is random. There are several possible approaches, which all rely on repeatedly loading a new game session (\"Leave Game\" then \"Resume Game\") until the Cave and Chest are found.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, new game sessions can be created until the &lt;a href=\"Act%20II%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; map shows a &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; to clear the Mysterious Cave. It is possible for the Cave to be in game without being a bounty, so an actual spawn of the Cave may be missed this way, but it saves the trouble of physically checking the spawn location.\nWhen not actively farming for the Rainbow, it is wise to check nearby spawn locations for the Cave while doing other bounties in the zone.\nThe other active strategy is to simply check one or both spawn points for the Cave, then reload the game if not present. It is more reliable to do this in &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20Mode\"&gt;Campaign Mode&lt;/a&gt;, where the \"Path to the Oasis\" waypoint is guaranteed to be reasonably close to the southern spawn point, and a second waypoint is in the north as well:\nZaven and the Mysterious Cave do not always spawn, in which case a new game session is needed. Spawn rate is estimated at 3-5% at each spawn point in Dahlgur Oasis.\nOnce Zaven is found:\nIf the Mysterious Chest is not present, then a new game session is needed once again. Spawn rate is estimated at 20-50%."}

He decided to make Liria his wife, and after a while, she agreed: the god of desire was too persistent in his efforts. However, despite all his jealous attempts to keep Liria off the face of the world, he could not guard her at night, when she had to travel the sky. Liria quickly became lonely and bored, but Dirgest would have never let her away.\n&lt;a href=\"Zei\"&gt;Zei&lt;/a&gt; eventually seduced Liria, stalking into her palace at night. Before disappearing, the thief has left her a gift: a large ruby on her neck. Infuriated and humiliated, Dirgest killed everyone Zei has ever held dear, including Liria herself, leaving his minion &lt;a href=\"Vekriss\"&gt;Vekriss&lt;/a&gt; to guard her &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;. Even though Zei did not love Liria, he avenged her death by trapping Dirgest into the very same ruby he once gave to her.\nLiria's spirit has been set free many years later, when &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Chen\"&gt;Covetous Chen&lt;/a&gt; killed Vekriss in the &lt;a href=\"Unearthed%20Ruins\"&gt;Unearthed Ruins&lt;/a&gt;.

Skills with charges similarly have a recharge time.

Going from the simple point save in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\" to the sometimes very annoying status save in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" that, though quite innovative, caused more frustration than a sense of achievement.\nDiablo I.\nThe save/load mechanism in Diablo I was more simplistic and easier on the players. The players just had to hit the Esc key and click on Save Game to save the state of the game. Upon reloading, the player has all the attributes, items and location that he/she had before the save.\nOf course, this elementary mechanism was not a first for any game back then, and many players found a variety of uses for this mechanic. Anytime someone died, they could just reload their last save point. This was also useful if they were on a budget and did not want to buy more &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Scrolls of Identify&lt;/a&gt; or get &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"identify\"&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt; your items for 100 gold each. They could use one identify scroll to identify one item in the inventory, reload, equip it if necessary and identify another item.\nSince the item lists for &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt; were randomly generated each time the player entered the confines of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, repeated saving and loading generated a random list whose quality depended on how far the player has progressed in the dungeon. This was especially useful due to &lt;a href=\"Spellbooks\"&gt;Spellbooks&lt;/a&gt; being available with Adria and (at higher levels) &lt;a href=\"Elixir\"&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;s being available with Pepin. This contributed to the rampant hatred towards Elixirs by players that found their deaths at the hands of an elixir-boosted, high-level-spell-casting &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s that became a fad in the heyday of Diablo I &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"Diablo II\", you cannot save on a whim. Seeing the rampant misuse of the save-load mechanism in \"Diablo\", &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; overhauled the system.\nThe only way you can manually save is if you also exit the game. Pressing the Esc key displays only the Save &amp; Exit option along with the mandatory Options. Conversely, exiting the game forces you to save as well. With the overhaul of the Skill system that did not promote up to fifteen levels of spells, the game did not allow respecializing of Skills, although indirectly which added to the challenge. This also made players depend on luck before doing certain one-time only rewards, like &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Imbue\"&gt;Imbue&lt;/a&gt; reward and the smashing of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe game also reloaded from the &lt;a href=\"Act\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;'s town area, it never saves the location where the game is saved. This feature frustrated players, especially in the jungle regions of &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;Waypoint&lt;/a&gt;s for the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Forest\"&gt;Spider Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Marsh\"&gt;Great Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Flayer%20Jungle\"&gt;Flayer Jungle&lt;/a&gt; are insanely difficult to find.\nIn spite of these measures, there still exists a rather risky workaround. Therefore, if you were in a really ugly situation and wanted to reload in a safer spot, what you could do is press Ctrl + Alt + Del to open up the \"Windows Task Manager\", shut down the process running Diablo II, and reload in your last saved spot.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"Diablo III\", each action performed is automatically saved on the server, therefore it is impossible to lose progress. However, &lt;a href=\"checkpoint\"&gt;checkpoint&lt;/a&gt;s system exists for the purpose of dying in battle: if players do not wish to (or can't) resurrect at &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;, they may choose to be revived in town or at the last checkpoint (usually at zone entrance).\n&lt;a href=\"Campaign\"&gt;Campaign&lt;/a&gt; progress is saved by completing a specific stage of a . After that, the player can choose to load this stage at any moment \"without\" losing the progress, effectively resetting the quest."}

Upon dealing one tick of damage, the locusts spread to one additional enemy within 20 yards, refreshing the duration to full on that target (but not on the old ones). Each enemy can only spread locusts to one additional enemy, and the swarm cannot jump to a target already affected by that specific cast. If there are no suitable targets in range to jump, the locusts will stop spreading.\nIt is thus a useful skill to use against clustered enemies. &lt;a href=\"Damage%20over%20time\"&gt;Damage per second&lt;/a&gt; of the split swarm remains the same, therefore the total damage may be greater than 1040%. The Swarm may not roll &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;Critical Hit&lt;/a&gt;s, but the damage increases proportionally to Critical Hit Chance / Damage ratio.\nWhile the Locust Swarm deals significantly less damage than &lt;a href=\"Haunt\"&gt;Haunt&lt;/a&gt;, it can affect more enemies at a time. Multiple Swarms on a single target, however, do not stack.

In a sense, it is replacing quantity with quality, with legendaries becoming rarer, but more effective. It involves the implementation of the Smart Drop System.\u00a0In game, it both increases chances that a newly found item can be a potential upgrade and reduces the ability to gear multiple characters by playing just one of them.\nSmart Loot.\nThe Smart Drop System is a type of 'background program' that was introduced in \"Reaper of Souls\". It takes note of a character's class, and sometimes provides items and affixes specifically fitted for that class (e.g. specifically providing a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;).\u00a0Smart Loot does not affect all loot: 15% of items will be dropped with stats for a random class other than the current one.\nWhen Smart Loot triggers, it will effectively prevent the item in question from rolling any stats that would be useless to the current character's class: i.e. wrong &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; type, wrong resource bonus, wrong skill bonus, wrong core stat etc. It does \"not\" take the current build in account, so the character does not get increased chances to roll bonuses for the skills they currently have. Also, contrary to popular belief, Smart Loot does not track the currently equipped or &lt;a href=\"stash\"&gt;stash&lt;/a&gt;ed items, and the chance of obtaining an item does not change if the player already has one (&lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Gems\"&gt;Legendary Gems&lt;/a&gt; are a notable exception to this rule).\n&lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Set%20Items\"&gt;Set Items&lt;/a&gt; drop rates change depending on the character's class, increasing chances to obtain items and sets fit for their class, while bringing chances to get the legendaries and sets for other classes to \"very rare\" occasions. Items with Legendary affixes and set bonuses that only affect one class will also drop rarely, if ever, for classes that would not benefit from them. Example: a class other than &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; will have greatly reduced chances to obtain &lt;a href=\"Jang%27s%20Envelopment\"&gt;Jang's Envelopment&lt;/a&gt; belt, and a class other than &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; will hardly ever see a drop of &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Land%20Waders\"&gt;Swamp Land Waders&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, a &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; getting hands on these two items will get those with &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; as primary stat, even though they can (in theory) roll &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegardless of whether the Smart Loot kicks in or not, an item that is determined to be used by a specific class (including sets and &lt;a href=\"class-specific%20items\"&gt;class-specific items&lt;/a&gt;) will never roll stats that can be used only by any other class; that is, even if a somehow obtains a &lt;a href=\"Quiver\"&gt;Quiver&lt;/a&gt;, it will always roll &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;-specific bonuses. However, non-class-specific item stats can be re-rolled manually through &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;, provided the current class can (technically) use that item."}

The term is an informal, conceptual way to discuss games' internal mechanics which randomly choose items for players to receive. It allows players to understand when it is or isn't possible to obtain a specific item from adventuring in different areas, and how likely they are to find it.\nLoot tables can vary by specific monster or chest type, &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Monster\"&gt;Elite Monster&lt;/a&gt; status, &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt; setting, zone, &lt;a href=\"Game%20Mode\"&gt;Game Mode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Class\"&gt;Class&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the game.\nDiablo.\nThe first game's loot is based on dungeon level (1-16), monster level and type (which itself is related to dungeon level), and difficulty level. Each base item type and each magical &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt; that can appear on it has a specific requirement to be eligible to drop.\nDiablo II.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" has a complex loot system based on labels called \"treasure classes\". These are assigned to every &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monster\"&gt;Super Unique Monster&lt;/a&gt;, and derived for every other monster based on an \"area level\" assigned to the zone and Elite status of the monster. Each treasure class represents specific categories of item, and defines a weighting between each item in the class, or no loot. Upon killing a monster, the game looks at its treasure class(es) and generates random numbers to compare to the probabilities to see what loot might be awarded. If no item is chosen from this random check, the process is repeated for lower quality treasure classes. Items also have \"quality levels\" which must be met by the monster's level to qualify to drop.\nDiablo III.\nThe first version of itemization and loot in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" was similar to its predecessor, with item levels defined by game area and difficulty, which affected which magic properties could appear on items.\nThe release of \"\" came with a complete overhaul of the difficulty and level system, as well as an updated item design and drop system called Loot 2.0. Item attributes are completely oriented around the character's level at the time the item dropped, with no requirement based on game zone. In this system, while some items and properties are more rare than others, there is almost no circumstance that would change the relative likelihood of which item or attribute will appear for a character once they have reached maximum level. Instead, most bonuses to item finding simply increase the overall frequency of higher quality drops.\nHigher difficulty levels improve drops in this non-specific way, except that the highest &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt; qualities require &lt;a href=\"Master%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Master difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, and some items are locked behind &lt;a href=\"Torment%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Torment difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. Various &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; and special &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; types have increased likelihood of specific item types (like gems) or a guarantee of one or more &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the in-game special modes or areas like &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s automatically increase the chance for higher quality loot or the overall amount of loot.\nLoot 2.0 also instituted \"smart drops\", a system where most items found are based on a loot table specific to the player's class. This helped ensure players could find desirable gear with the closure of the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;s. Items dropping in the main game world still have a chance to be an \"off-class\" item, but otherwise have a type and Magic Properties fitting the current class, including bonuses to &lt;a href=\"primary%20stat\"&gt;primary stat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; types, and specific &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAny kind of item crafting with &lt;a href=\"Artisans\"&gt;Artisans&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt; \"always\" results in class-matching items, unless this is impossible due to item type. This can make it difficult to equip a &lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;Follower&lt;/a&gt; that does not share a character's primary stat. In the case the type does not appear in the current class's loot table at all, the item will instead be crafted/re-rolled with stats appropriate to classes it does drop for. When a class has some but not all &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt; of a type in their loot table, such as &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s with the , the \"missing\" item cannot be produced by Kanai's Cube. In these cases it is common to craft with a different character that matches the desired item or stats."}

When &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; appeared to steal the soulstone and killed Lorath's comrades, Tyrael ordered him to flee and find &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; who had defeated &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; previously, which he obeyed as the former angel held off the Angel of Death long enough for Lorath to escape.\nLorath encountered Malthael's &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; forces as they laid waste to &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike many of its denizens, he survived the encounters with the creatures, and documented both their behavior and perceived origin. Eventually he found the Nephalem on the outskirts of Westmarch. His attempt to take them to Tyrael was rejected however as they wished to save who they could, instead agreeing to meet within the city.\nLorath reunited with the Nephalem inside Westmarch, along with Tyrael and &lt;a href=\"General%20Torion\"&gt;General Torion&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrael explained that with Diablo having been defeated, Malthael saw it as the perfect time to end the Eternal Conflict, which in this case, meant eradicating humanity, per their demonic heritage. Lorath was aghast, claiming that humanity had nothing to do with that war.\nHe assisted Tyrael in aiding Westmarch's people in the &lt;a href=\"Survivor%27s%20Enclave\"&gt;Survivor's Enclave&lt;/a&gt; while the Nephalem dealt with the Reapers. After &lt;a href=\"Urzael\"&gt;Urzael&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat he accompanied the Nephalem on their hunt for &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; to ensure they did not kill the &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; before learning Malthael's location from her.\nAfter the Nephalem killed Adria, Lorath was able to glean Malthael's location from Adria's scrying, discovering that he was in &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;. Lorath remained behind to help the survivors in Westmarch as the Nephalem and Tyrael departed to face Malthael directly.\nKanai's Cube.\nAt some point, Lorath looked at &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;. He discovered something within the artifact that caused him to reflect that everything he thought he knew about human history was now, at best, uncertain.\nThe Hermit.\nLorath remained a member of the Horadrim, even as the order's numbers dwindled. As one of the last members, Lorath compiled a &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful relics and the stories behind them. It was his hope that his volume would preserve his knowledge for all time, and pass it down to those who will inherit the fight against the Prime Evils.\nLorath was around to witness the return of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Like many others, he heard its priests speak of \"the Father,\" an &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike many others, Lorath knew this to be true, that the angel in question was &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lorath had little love for the Cathedral, given its fanaticism.\nEven after decades, Lorath was still scarred by events that transpired in Westmarch; the grizzly slaughter he witnessed, caused by &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, nearly destroyed his mind. Lorath renounced the Horadrim and sold his amulet, and took refuge to the mountains and began living as a hermit in the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, weighed down by his experiences. Having lost his faith in humanity, he chose solitude and ale over futile efforts to bring goodness back into the world.\nWhile in the Fractured Peaks, Lorath entered the city of &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt; a number of times. However, he always refused to take part in the cleansing ritual that would, under normal circumstances, be compulsory to enter the city. He suspected that the Cathedral had appropriated an element of local culture into the ceremony, twisting it to reinforce subservience to the Cathedral. Hence, his refusal, for there was nothing holy about it in his mind. He entered the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%20%28Fractured%20Peaks%29\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; at least once, and found it disconcerting. In part because of the reverence the faithful showed Inarius, in part because of the omission of Lilith, despite her being the co-creator of humanity. While he wasn't about to suggest that Lilith should be worshipped, he felt it robbed the Cathedral of credibility; how could it have a claim to truth, when it ignored a full half of humanity's origins?\nAt some point, while in Kyovashad, he sold his &lt;a href=\"Lorath%27s%20Polearm\"&gt;polearm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Amulet\"&gt;Horadric amulet&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ozren\"&gt;Ozren&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his later years, Lorath began to suffer a recurring nightmare. It always started with a journey to a distant land, where he found a city in flames, the streets choked with &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s. He witnessed brother turning against brother, followed by executions, until his time came. Then, he would wake in terror, fearful in the knowledge that there was no-one left in Sanctuary with the ability to stand against Hell.\nBook of Lorath.\nOne night, after he'd completed his tome, a scholar came to his &lt;a href=\"Windswept%20Cabin\"&gt;cabin&lt;/a&gt;, seeking a weapon against the darkness rising in Sanctuary. Lorath, having long since given into despair, nevertheless provided the scholar with the only thing he could\u2014knowledge. On the first night, he told them of the origin of Creation, of the formation of Heaven and Hell, of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;. With the fire dying, he told the scholar to come back tomorrow (if they were still alive), and prayed that their dreams would not be as dark as his.\nThe scholar returned and brought ale with them, much to Lorath's satisfaction. This night, he told them of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, of the story of &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, of their theft of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; and creation of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and their degradation into &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. The story ended, and Lorath told the scholar to remember that the Eternal Conflict raged within the hearts of Men. That no mortal was immune to sin, and that even the most righteous could fall.\nThe Great Enmity.\nDusk on the Mountain.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;Fifty years&lt;/a&gt; after the fall of Westmarch, Lorath remained in his mountain abode. One evening, after returning from a hunt, he found a trespasser rifling through his belongings. Instead of being angry, he invited them to dinner. told him a harrowing tale; that they had been fed the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Crazed%20Villager\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; who'd rescued them from a storm, and that it caused them to start having visions of Lilith. One of these visions involved a memoery of what had transpired at the &lt;a href=\"Nevesk\"&gt;Nevesk&lt;/a&gt; chapel, where the Wanderer had beheld not only Lilith, but a &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;pale man&lt;/a&gt; who served her. At Lorath's suggestion, the Wanderer agreed to use their link with Lilith to their advantage, and Lorath told them to rest before they set off for &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad\"&gt;Kyovashad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe journey was a grim one, for they had to deal with &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;; Lorath was dismayed to encounter them so close to Kyovashad, and commented that Lilith's evil was spreading. Later, at &lt;a href=\"Father%27s%20Cross\"&gt;Father's Cross&lt;/a&gt;, he told the Wanderer that the statue in question was that of the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. He further explained that as soon as Inarius discovered Lilith walked Sanctuary, the whole world would be drawn into their feud, unless they could prevent it.\nThe pair arrived at Kyovashad's &lt;a href=\"Kyovashad%20Gatehouse\"&gt;gatehouse&lt;/a&gt;, where yet again, Lorath refused to do the cleansing ritual. Lorath was allowed to enter, but the Wanderer was forced to take part in the ritual. Lorath told them he'd meet them inside. He headed to &lt;a href=\"Oskar\"&gt;Oskar&lt;/a&gt; in order to purchase a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;; he was still inspecting it when the Wanderer arrived. Lorath explained that he was heading for the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt; in search for the pale man the Wanderer had seen in their vision. Lorath asked the Wanderer to go see &lt;a href=\"Ozren\"&gt;Ozren&lt;/a&gt; to pick up a belonging he sold to him some time ago. The Wanderer obliged, and found out it was Lorath's polearm, and had to pay for it. Afterward, he continued negotiating with Oskar for a horse. While Lorath was unimpressed with the steed, Oskar told him that given what little &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; he was offering, he should count himself lucky.\nThe Wanderer returned with Lorath's polearm, as well as the amulet he had sold to Ozren. Lorath explained that the amulet was a symbol of the Horadrim, and that he himself was a member. He suggested that the Wanderer should visit the scholar &lt;a href=\"Donan\"&gt;Donan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;, given his knowledge of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, but told them not to forget about the members of the Cathedral of Light, who could be useful allies. Thus, he departed for the Dry Steppes. At the time, Lorath believed he a had a chance to protect humanity from Lilith, and their connection to the Daughter of Hatred gave him hope.\nThe Making of Monsters.\nLorath arrived at &lt;a href=\"Ked%20Bardu\"&gt;Ked Bardu&lt;/a&gt; in the Dry Steppes. The day he arrived, he wrote to the abbot at &lt;a href=\"Orbei%20Monastery\"&gt;Orbei Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, seeking insight on Lilith, while also trying to find out what he could about the pale man the Wanderer had seen in their vision. &lt;a href=\"Teckrin\"&gt;Teckrin&lt;/a&gt; acted as his intermediary. No word came from Orbei, but days after his arrival, he learnt that the pale man was &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;Elias&lt;/a&gt;, his old apprentice, and that he was the one responsible for summoning Lilith into Sanctuary. In the town's inn, Lorath drunk himself into a stupor, before staggering out and wrestling with a goat over a patch of mud for him to collapse upon.\nIt was in this state that the Wanderer found Lorath, who told the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; what he had learnt about Elias. They had to track him down, then kill him. He sent the Wanderer to Teckrin, who came back, reporting that there was still no word from Orbei, but that there'd been a sighting of a pale man in &lt;a href=\"Abahru%20Canyon\"&gt;Abahru Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. Lorath was still uneasy about the lack of word from Orbei, but resolved to investigate the canyons. He gave the Wanderer the choice of meeting him there or investigating the monastery.\nAbahru Rift.\nLorath hoped to find a witness who saw Elias, but upon arriving at the canyon, instead found a camp of dead merchants. As he explained to the Wanderer (who'd just arrived), the demons had not been summoned at the site of the massacre, and Elias could very well be the summoner. They descended into the canyon proper, which was filled with demons. They closed a &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Rift\"&gt;Hell Rift&lt;/a&gt;, but Lorath was perturbed\u2014the demons were weak, whereas a Mage of Elias's ability could have easily summoned much more powerful ones. They entered a &lt;a href=\"The%20Carver%27s%20House\"&gt;strange house&lt;/a&gt; at the canyon's end, and realized that the summoner was a man named &lt;a href=\"Genbar\"&gt;Genbar&lt;/a&gt;. Entering a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Eyes\"&gt;nearby cave&lt;/a&gt;, they found Genbar, clearly mad, and enthralled to serve Lilith. Lorath tried to get what information they could, but seeing through the deception, Genbar attacked them.\nGenbar's demons were easily dispatched, but Elias, contacting them from afar, gave them a 'gift' of a much more powerful demon, &lt;a href=\"Mahmon\"&gt;Mahmon&lt;/a&gt;. Still, both Genbar and Mahmon were slain. Lorath noted that Genbar had stated \"the Master has all he needs,\" which meant that Elias and his followers were about to do something drastic. However, Elias had made an error in sending Mahmon, as it required constant human sacrifices. If he cut Mahmon open, he could ascertain where it had come from, based on the nature of its victims. He told the Wanderer to return to Ked Bardu, where he would bring Mahmon for examination.\nLegacy of the Horadrim.\nAfter the Cathedral of Light seized the Vault of the Horadrim, Lorath felt it was urgent to write a book as a record in which he would recount the history of Sanctuary and the Horadrim, and create a catalogue of the many relics that could be found throughout the world. Lorath wrote not only for the sake of those who would need the knowledge to stop the next resurgence of evil, but mostly in hopes he would be able to give the book to Neyrelle. Elias' betrayal meant that not even the Horadric ciphers and codes would sufficiently safeguard the book, and so Lorath embarked on a journey across Sanctuary to gather relics which he would use to make protection wards for his book. The ritual would include designs found in Zoltun Kulle's \"&lt;a href=\"Arma%20Haereticorum\"&gt;Arma Haereticorum&lt;/a&gt;\", a tome containing extraordinary concepts and abilities for creating legendary armor, and relics representing the five elements: earth, fire, air, water, and time.\nThe journey began in Scosglen, where Lorath had buried Donan next to his wife and son. The relic Lorath sought from Scosglen was a leaf from the great oak tree, &lt;a href=\"Gl%C3%B3r-an-Fh%C3%A1idha\"&gt;Gl\u00f3r-an-Fh\u00e1idha&lt;/a&gt;, which was granted to him by a druid chieftain. The leaf was to be an expression of what can grow from Sanctuary's water and earth. This would be combined with an imperfect amethyst ring which Lorath enjoyed gazing upon in order to form the base for the protection spell, with the amethyst an expression of what could be made in the fires and pressure in Sanctuary's foundation.\nWith the first relics secured, Lorath continued his travels towards the Fractured Peaks, where he successfully fended off an attack by wargs. Lorath returned to his cabin near Kyovashad, and after checking on his secret stash of ale he discovered Neyrelle had been there before him and had left a letter in a bottle. Neyrelle urged Lorath not to blame himself for what happened with Elias, and told Lorath that she would be leaving more letters for him just in case their journeys crossed paths. Lorath replaced her letter with one of his own in case Neyrelle returned to the cabin.\nLorath's journey continued south into the swamps of Hawezar, where he was anxious due to the proximity of the Tree of Whispers. He wanted to check on Taissa, but dared not due to her connection to the Tree. Lorath traveled to the Snake Altar in the Writhing Mire where he spent days searching the nearby jungle to locate the next relic, a Scale of Rathma's Serpent. This would represent balance and harmony for the ritual.\nLorath continued west to Caldeum where he used Horadric records to locate an arrow called the Breath of &lt;a href=\"Philios\"&gt;Philios&lt;/a&gt;. He then headed south to Kurast, where he intended to hire a ship. When Lorath arrived he found the city in chaos, with people murdering one another in the streets. After helping restore the city to order, Lorath learned that Neyrelle had been there before him, and though she stayed less than a day she had brought Mephisto's hatred in her wake. Lorath went to hire a newly arrived ship and found that it was the very same one Neyrelle had departed on. Neyrelle had left him a letter in which she admitted that coming to Kurast, Mephisto's former domain, had been foolish as Mephisto had become incited and harder to resist, and she was continuing onward to find a way to silence Mephisto and keep her sanity.\nLorath paid an extremely large amount of gold to the ship's captain to get him to go on a detour to the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Skovos%20Isles\"&gt;Skovos Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Lorath was hoping to offer the Breath of Philios as a gift to the &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for information on a delegation of Horadrim which Tyrael had sent to Skovos years ago and had not been heard from since. As they neared the capital, the ship was waylaid by several Askari ships which ran them aground and began interrogating them. The Askari did not respond well when Lorath told them he was Horadrim, and before he could bring up the gift or ask any questions they ordered the ship to leave their waters.\nThe ship sailed onwards to Lut Gholein, where Lorath sought out the next relic, &lt;a href=\"Radament\"&gt;Radament&lt;/a&gt;'s Hourglass. Lorath located the Hourglass in a tomb outside of Lut Gholein. This artifact was capable of slowing time for the user, which made it a key part of the ritual as the protection must last outside of time. With the relic secured, Lorath joined a caravan heading westwards into Khanduras, with the goal of returning to his homeland, Westmarch.\nEven after fifty years the devastation caused by Malthael and his Reapers remained evident in Westmarch, with quiet streets, somber markets, and vacant, boarded up houses and buildings left to rot. Lorath was relieved that Neyrelle had not graced Westmarch with her presence. Lorath found his father's smithy was abandoned like so many other buildings in Westmarch, and within it he retrieved his father's kiteshield. Lorath had hoped to find &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt; and have her use the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Malus\"&gt;Horadric Malus&lt;/a&gt; to reforge the shield, but he could not locate her.\nUsing knowledge from the Ritual Tome which Elias had created from Rathma's writings, Lorath was able to speak with the spirit of his father, who agreed to teach Lorath how to use the forge. Lorath spent days learning the trade of a blacksmith, until he was prepared to reforge the shield using the Arma Haereticorum. The water and earth of the leaf was merged with the fire of the amethyst ring, to which was added the air of the Breath of Philios, and the element of time for Radament's Hourglass. These elements were bound together in balance and harmony using the Scale of Rathma's Serpent. A final relic, Meshif's pipe, was added to incorporate courage and goodness. Lorath dubbed the magical shield the Shield of Nahr and bid his father one final farewell before continuing his journey. In a letter left for Neyrelle, Lorath thanked her for introducing him to the Ritual Tome as it let him get closure.\nLorath wanted the strength of a &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Child of Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt; to be behind his shield, a strength which drew from Sanctuary itself, and so he traveled north through the &lt;a href=\"Sharval%20Wilds\"&gt;Sharval Wilds&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;. The relic he sought, an amulet named Raekor's Resolve, was exactly where his research indicated, and Lorath was saddened at the state of the Barbarians that such a relic was left unprotected. The final stop of his journey was to be in &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt;, but first Lorath wanted to head towards &lt;a href=\"Ivgorodd\"&gt;Ivgorodd&lt;/a&gt; as Neyrelle had said that she might head there to see if the &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Monks of Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; could help her with their mental training.\nWhen Lorath arrived at Ivgorod he met with a master monk, who, with a voice trembling with fear, confirmed that Neyrelle had indeed been at the monastery, but she had left a few days prior. The monk described Neyrelle as an agent of pure chaos and hatred, though an unwilling one. The monks had been so terrified of her that only a few were willing to go near her and they had forced her to stay far outside the monastery walls in a guest hut. Here Neyrelle had left another letter for Lorath. She wrote that she had a vision of Lorath crossing the Dreadlands and decided to leave in order to protect him, as she had already lost so much and she wouldn't be able to handle it if anything happened to Lorath because of her. Neyrelle said that the teachings of the monks had been helping her ignore the voices and visions and that she was doing better than she had been, but she was worried about staying too long in one place and felt it was best if she traveled alone, though she wasn't sure where she would be headed.\nLorath was torn. He was afraid he was losing Neyrelle, if she wasn't already lost, and no one knew which way she had traveled. Lorath spent two days trying to decide whether to search for Neyrelle or to finish the ritual for his book. He ultimately chose to continue towards Xiansai, after deciding that he must finish the book as he meant for Neyrelle to have it and he had faith in her.\nThe voyage to Xiansai was uneventful. While sitting on a terrace in a coastal town, Lorath finished writing a letter to Neyrelle, though he was not sure where he would leave it other than in the book. Lorath ended the letter with a vow that as soon as he was finished in Xiansai he would be coming to help Neyrelle no matter where she was, and that if helping her was the last thing he did then his head would go to the Tree of Whispers bearing a smile.\nThe final relic was located by Lorath's contact on Xiansai. It was called Rin's Conduit and Lorath believed it was originally a tool for healing as it allowed the voluntary transfer of essence. Lorath used the Conduit to transfer the magical essences of the Shield of Nahr and Raekor's Resolve into glyphs, which he then placed at the front and back of his book to serve as the strongest protection wards he was capable of creating. The wards would prevent anyone with demonic or dark intent from reading the book. Lorath ended the book with a message to Neyrelle. He told her that if she was capable of reading his book then she had done something unheard of in the history of Sanctuary: she would have carried a soulstone containing a Prime Evil without succumbing to his influence.\nVessel of Hatred.\nStill working with the Wanderer, Lorath continued searching for Neyrelle's whereabouts.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nLorath appears in &lt;a href=\"Act%20V%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". He functions as an &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, temporary &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; and starts \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;The Fall of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;\" quest. He also narrates many of the game's journal entries alongside\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and Tyrael. In &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, he stays in town along with Tyrael, and sometimes can be overheard having conversations with him, mostly regarding &lt;a href=\"Orek\"&gt;Orek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kadala\"&gt;Kadala&lt;/a&gt; (to whom Lorath shows a particular interest) and Tyrael's difficulties with adaptation to mortal life.\nDevelopment.\nConceptually, Lorath began as a background character, as per the developers wanting Tyrael to save someone in the intro cinematic for \"Reaper of Souls\". As soon as he was told to find the player character however, Lorath was given more story importance.\nDuring the expansion's development, he sold equipment in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s. He used to sell &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Horadric%20Cache\"&gt;Greater Horadric Cache&lt;/a&gt;s as well.\nDiablo IV.\nLorath appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". He is the primary companion of the player in the story, serving as narrator, and effectively fills the role of the late Deckard Cain. He voices the narrative and is a major role in the game, being somewhat of a mentor to &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the segments where Lorath joins the player's party temporarily during certain campaign quests, he'll fight using his polearm, and will also cast Horadric magic, such as homing magic missiles that will slow enemies, as well seals on the ground that will explode when monsters walk over it.\nPersonality and Traits.\nAs a Horadrim, Lorath served faithfully and with conviction. He was adept in martial weapons from his time serving in the &lt;a href=\"Rakkisguard\"&gt;Rakkisguard&lt;/a&gt;. He is also said to have some talent in &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, though to what extent is unknown.\u00a0He was a capable fighter, having fought the Reapers several times during their invasion of Westmarch. He later recorded the encounters detailing the creatures he faced.\nHowever, Lorath's experiences with the Reapers scarred him, and over the decades, fell into depression and grog. He came to believe that evil could never be eradicated, that humans were weak, and that those who did nothing in the face of such malevolence were cowards. Which, by his own criteria, included himself. By the time he met the Wanderer, he was a completely different man from the one he'd been fifty years ago. In Ked Bardu, Lorath did not show proper respect to the dead until he was given a much needed humbling. Donan, being one of the few who could call Lorath a friend, stated that Lorath lacked consideration when it came to sharing his plans and that forging strong bonds were not one his strong suits. Despite this, Lorath remained a steadfast ally to The Wanderer in their quest to combat Lilith, becoming something close to a mentor figure to both them and Neyrelle, albeit a cynical and grouchy one.\nLorath detested the Cathedral of Light, finding its blind adoration of Inarius naive, and its practices too fanatical. Lorath, likewise, held a deep anger for his former student, Elias, for delving into demonic works in his mission to save Sanctuary that ultimately led to countless innocents suffering. However, this anger was born from disappointment in himself, having failed Elias as a teacher, being unable to properly guide him down a proper path."}

Initially, no one except Malah, believed the player to be of any use in the ensuing conflict against Baal's &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Legion\"&gt;Demonic Legion&lt;/a&gt;s other than being cannon fodder for the Barbarians, especially the last surviving member of the doomed &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut the player quickly proves his worth when he bests one of Baal's strongest generals, &lt;a href=\"Shenk%20the%20Overseer\"&gt;Shenk the Overseer&lt;/a&gt;, in combat, finishing the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20on%20Harrogath%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Siege on Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; quest. &lt;a href=\"Larzuk\"&gt;Larzuk&lt;/a&gt; the Blacksmith offers to &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt; one of the player's items as a reward, a service not normally given to anyone.\n&lt;a href=\"Qual-Kehk\"&gt;Qual-Kehk&lt;/a&gt; warms up to the player but still wants him to prove his worth. He sends the player out in the &lt;a href=\"Frigid%20Highlands\"&gt;Frigid Highlands&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20on%20Mount%20Arreat%20%28quest%29\"&gt;rescue some of the Barbarians&lt;/a&gt; who have been held captive by Baal's forces. Soon, the player finds that the very fortifications that the Barbarians built to hold the demons at bay are being used against the Barbarians themselves by the Legion. The player is successful in rescuing the captive &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Warrior\"&gt;Barbarian Warriors&lt;/a&gt; and the player earns Qual-Kehk's trust, who allows some of his men to aid the player in his quest. As news of the player's exploits spreads, Malah requests the player to aid her in something that was prodding her mind, the daughter of the Head of the Council of Elders, &lt;a href=\"Anya\"&gt;Anya&lt;/a&gt; had disappeared. And she feels that Nihlathak is responsible for her disappearance. The player follows Malah's clues to the &lt;a href=\"Crystalline%20Passage\"&gt;Crystalline Passage&lt;/a&gt;, where he finds Anya trapped in a &lt;a href=\"Prison%20of%20Ice%20%28quest%29\"&gt;prison of ice&lt;/a&gt;. Anya is rescued but Nihlathak goes missing.\nAnya explains Nihlathak's real plans to give Baal the &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Relic of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; to spare Harrogath. But in doing so, Nihlathak has allowed Baal to pass into the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20Keep\"&gt;Worldstone Keep&lt;/a&gt; unhindered. There Baal hopes to corrupt the blessed &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, an act that would utterly doom all of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Baal was to meet Nihlathak at &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak%27s%20Temple\"&gt;his temple&lt;/a&gt;. So, the player follows him, trying to stop the traitor from dooming the world. After finding Nihlathak and defeating him, the player searches his lair for the Relic, but does not find it. Baal already has it and rushes towards the &lt;a href=\"Arreat%20Summit\"&gt;Summit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player follows Baal and meets &lt;a href=\"the%20Ancients\"&gt;the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. After a great fight, the Ancients are bested and the hero proves himself worthy. The Ancients allow the player rightful passage to the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone%20Chamber\"&gt;Worldstone Chamber&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut Baal was already inside the chamber waiting for the player. Taking a cue from &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;his fallen brother&lt;/a&gt;, he summons his finest Warriors from beneath &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. The melee inside the Worldstone Chamber ends in Baal fleeing inside the heart of Arreat itself, where the player battles the Lord of Destruction ending the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; over Sanctuary. Tyrael appears, informing the player that Baal, although defeated, succeeded in corrupting the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. The stone now drains the world's energies, weakening the boundaries between &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. This would allow the hordes of Hell to spill forth into the mortal realm unhindered.\nTyrael, after allowing the hero to reach safety, proceeds to destroy the Worldstone. The resulting explosion causes Mount Arreat to erupt, destroying the homeland of the Barbarians, and causing some damage to a &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;nearby keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpilogue.\nThough the Prime Evils are no more, everyone fears for the future. A demonic invasions seems imminent, now that the boundaries between the realms have weakened. Years go by, yet nothing happens.\nTwenty years later, &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;has it really ended&lt;/a&gt;?\nQuest Necessity and Tips.\nFor one to end Baal's reign of Destruction and progress to the next Difficulty level, he/she must complete the Arreat Summit and Eve of Destruction quests, although the other quests reward your deeds in the following ways:"}

It is usually connected to the &lt;a href=\"Flayer%20Jungle\"&gt;Flayer Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, and connects to the &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Bazaar\"&gt;Kurast Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts entrance from the jungle-side is usually guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique Monster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormtree\"&gt;Stormtree&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe buildings of Lower Kurast consist of lower-class communal huts with openings in walls (no doors, nor windows). Lower Kurast was meant for the lower-class commoners. This might also imply Kurast had a strict caste system.\nA bug in these buildings is that when you're inside these buildings, a &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Buzzard\"&gt;Hell Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; clips through the roof to swoop down and attack you. Even though the roof fades so that you can see inside, the roof is supposed to still be there. Near the buildings, piles of oddly shaped skulls can be found.\nThere's a &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; located somewhere in Lower Kurast.\nOne feature of the location is that it is always generated with one or two campfires, which has a hut with one chest above it and another hut with two chests to its left. All three of those chests, due to their own nature and a programming quirk, have an unusually large chance of dropping rare runes up to &lt;a href=\"Ber%20Rune\"&gt;Ber&lt;/a&gt; in Hell. In single player, it is not difficult to generate a map which has two of this set of structures close to the waypoint, allowing the character to open six chests within about half a minute, which is generally accepted as the fastest way to acquire these rare runes in Single Player."}

Unlike &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt;, it does not lower &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; Resistance. However, because of its effects, Lower Resist is extremely helpful in multiplayer situations, especially in combination with elemental fighters such as &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es that find themselves stumped by monsters in &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; mode immune to certain spells. For characters that rely on elemental damage, Lower Resist may well be the most useful charged skill one can find on items.\nLower Resist can bring an opponent's resistances into negative values, meaning that corresponding elemental damage against them is increased by that percentage.\nLower Resist is the only skill that can worsen a target's defenses against Poison. Should the Necromancer in question be a &lt;a href=\"Daggermancer\"&gt;Daggermancer&lt;/a&gt;, or aiding a party member who uses poison, this is one of the only skills that directly increases their damage.\nWhen breaking an &lt;a href=\"immunity\"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt;, Lower Resist only works at 1/5th effectiveness. Lower Resist stacks with the effects of &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; (when breaking immunities, the 1/5th effectiveness rule still applies even after the immunity is already removed). Even with the two working together, many monsters in Hell mode are still immune to some elements.\nItems.\nSeveral items grant Lower Resist skill:\nSkill Progression.\nMana Cost: 22\nDiablo III.\nLower Resist returns in Diablo III as one of four possible curses from an &lt;a href=\"Enslaved%20Nightmare\"&gt;Enslaved Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. It has (for the most part) been kept the same, in that upon incanting the curse, the victim's resistances are debuffed. The only easily seen change is the name of the curse; it has been renamed to Curse of Resistance."}

Realizing that a full scale invasion would inevitably draw attention of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; (which would very likely result in a heavy struggle that would devastate Sanctuary, rendering it useless to either side), the Lords of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; opted for a more subtle approach. They devised a cult that would gradually lure its followers deeper into the darkness. Which at first seemed a harmless, peaceful cult turned out to be a dark, unholy sect devoted to the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s. At the head of this cult stood the Primus, the \"pontifex maximus\". However, the Primus was nothing but a facade, a disguise used by the demon Lucion.\nThe Triune soon grew to become one of the dominating cults of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, being second only to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the counter-sect led by Inarius in his guise of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Prophet\"&gt;Veiled Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. The two sects continued to vie for control over the human race but without any open warfare, as it would draw unwanted attention. Instead, Lucion and &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; plotted against each other through subtle scheming, always anticipating their opponent's moves.\nLucion conducted some sermons himself, in order to induct the weaker-minded followers of the Triune into the true, darker nature of the cult.\nThe Sin War.\nTheir subtle plans were disturbed by the sudden reappearance of Lilith, a renegade demoness who had her own goals and plans. In the guise of the fugitive noblewoman Lylia, Lilith sought to awake the special powers of the humans (who were in fact the offspring of pairs of renegade &lt;a href=\"angels\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;), harboring it for her own goals. Her unwitting champion was to be &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;, a simple farmer from the lands near &lt;a href=\"Seram\"&gt;Seram&lt;/a&gt;. Noticing Uldyssian due to his immense powers (after it was used to the detriment of several travelling missionaries) and quickly seeing his potential, Lucion dispatched his trusted lieutenant, the high-priest &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt; to capture the farmer and his companions. However, unaware of Lilith's presence, the raiding party was overwhelmed and utterly destroyed, sending Malic back fleeing to Lucion. Realizing his sister could have returned, Lucion 'blessed' his failing lieutenant with a demon limb, allowing him to remove Lilith's guise. He did not tell Malic that the hand contained abilities that would destroy its human vessel. Nor did he inform his father that Lilith was on Sanctuary, as he feared punishment.\nAfter a second and much more powerful raiding party consisting of many undead &lt;a href=\"morlu\"&gt;morlu&lt;/a&gt; attacked Uldyssian and his followers near the town of &lt;a href=\"Partha\"&gt;Partha&lt;/a&gt;, but failed again (this time leaving Malic dead by the hands of Lilith), Uldyssian decided to leave the town, after seeing the onslaught. Lilith followed him, still in the guise of Lylia, but soon after their reunion Lucion's spell took effect, revealing Lilith's true form to a horrified Uldyssian. Lilith easily defeated the farmer, leaving him severely wounded. Still, Uldyssian recovered and reunited with his companions, setting out for the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Toraja\"&gt;Toraja&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was here that Lucion personally intervened. Disguised as a white stallion, the demon tried to lure Uldyssian with him but the latter was timely warned by his brother, &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt;. Once again taking the form of the Primus, Lucion sought one more time to persuade the farmer to join him. After both attempts failed and Uldyssian and his gathering followers started attacking the demon, Lucion changed tactics. With relative ease the demon incinerated many of Uldyssian's followers and caused the latter's close friend &lt;a href=\"Achilios\"&gt;Achilios&lt;/a&gt; to die by one of his own enchanted arrows. After seeing his comrade and followers die, Uldyssian's true powers awoke as he burst out in rage. Being unable to maintain his position, Lucion finally revealed his true form: a horrid, reptilian demon with hooved legs and three tails, covered in thick scales. But even as a mighty demon, Lucion turned out to be overpowered by the sheer force of Uldyssian's abilities. As a last desperate act the demon even offered his obedience and subservience to the farmer, but all for nought. Instead of killing the demon, Uldyssian simply imagined the demon to be \"nothing\", and so the great Lucion faded away and disappeared.\nPersonality and Traits.\nA powerful demon, Lucion appeared to serve his father without question, though he feared him. By Lucion's own admission, while he was a being of hatred like Mephisto, the level of his depravity paled in comparison to his father. He had a close relationship with his sister before her betrayal, and considered to know her better than any other being, save, perhaps, his &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;. Lucion was an orderly being (at least by the standards of demonkind), and he preferred things to be likewise. He similarly preferred to do most of his planning himself rather than relying on underlings. He despised &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s, regarding their compassion as a weakness, and had similarly low regard for humanity. \nLucion had the ability to shapeshift, taking forms humanoid and otherwise. In his mortal guise, Lucion was described as being a charismatic and wise man with a voice so soothing it bordered on the hypnotic. A sadistic individual, Lucion enjoyed the adulation of his followers (whom he considered \"sheep\"), though accepted that their worship ultimately flowed towards the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. He had a taste for human women, especially \"untried\" ones."}

Most credit this to the city's coastal location and strong sea trading ties with the kingdoms to the east and west.\nLut Gholein is a very large city, with good defenses, including well-built structures and a well-trained army. It is located on a fertile strip of land, which, along with its bordering of the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt;, has contributed to its prosperity. Its people wear colorful clothing, at least compared to the more dour styles of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;. Lut Gholein's sailors distill the waters of the Twin Seas and apply the bright blue mixture to their sails in order to blend in and avoid detection by pirates.\nIt is common for families in Lut Gholein to have crypts beneath their houses, to store their dead. \nLut Gholein is apparently known for its poets. It has its own trading language, and a distinct Lut Gholein accent exists.\nHistory.\nLut Gholein was built on top of the ruins of a &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; fortress.\nSeveral conquerors had tried to take over the city. All of them met with failure.\nThe Secret of the Vizjerei.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, troubles started in Lut Gholein. The &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt; gained entrance to the city's palace, and through it, entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn the time that followed, a sense of dread descended upon the city. When the troubles first started in the desert, with &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s emerging upon the sands, Jerhyn, acting on &lt;a href=\"Drognan\"&gt;Drognan&lt;/a&gt;'s advice, closed the port, and put the town under strict watch. When the &lt;a href=\"Harem%20Guilds\"&gt;Harem Guilds&lt;/a&gt; sought sanctuary within the palace, Jerhyn obliged. However, one night, screams echoed from the palace's harem. The guards arrived to find the women being slaughtered by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. The guardsmen tried to push the demons back into the rift from which they'd emerged. However, they were fighting a constant, losing battle, with demons continuing to pour into the palace. This forced Jerhyn to hire mercenaries to defend the city. \nFew people conducted business in the streets, and those who did were watched closely by the mercenaries. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"Radament\"&gt;Radament&lt;/a&gt; began raiding the town at night, killing a number of people. He was barricaded in the sewers, but still took victims. Every now and then, a would-be hero headed into the sewers to confront him, but failed to slay the creature. The town's mercenaries planned to send an organized group into the sewers to kill the creature, but with the trouble plaguing the desert, they couldn't afford the chance of losing any men.\nRecent History.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt; ordered his staff expelled from &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, many of them headed for Lut Gholein.\nIn-game.\nLut Gholein is visited by the player(s) in &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".

The player is also required to find the key pieces (&lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; and the two pieces of the ) to unlock &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb where &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; is imprisoned. &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;The Summoner&lt;/a&gt; takes control of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Arcane Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, releasing demons into the Palace and threatening the city.\nNPCs.\nThe townsfolk of Lut Gholein offer various services, these being:\nQuests.\nThere are six &lt;a href=\"quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; in Lut Gholein:\n&lt;a href=\"Waypoints\"&gt;Waypoints&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following waypoints can be found and used (after activation) in &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Vizjerei\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt;:\nPoints of Interest.\nThe city's main gate leads to the &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Waste\"&gt;Rocky Waste&lt;/a&gt;. It is located either at the end of the street where Greiz stands guard, or at the end of the alley hosting Drognan's shop. In spite of this, caravans (with Warriv and the player's starting location) are parked at the opposite end of the city, suggesting that trade with merchants inside the wall exists. Lut Gholein's waypoint is located in a quiet, leafy neighborhood between the Palace and the main marketplace.\nFara and Lysander offer their services in the main marketplace, in the east of the city near Atma's tavern. Deckard Cain (and the Stash) are located in the marketplace as well. Drognan's shop is down an alley just up the street separating the market from Atma's tavern, with Greiz being found further up the same street. Elzix keeps his inn down the street from Greiz, against the city's western wall, behind the Palace.\nThere are various buildings throughout the city, yet none of them can be entered except for Atma's tavern, and much later, Jerhyn's Palace. If you explore Atma's tavern, you can find your way into the kitchen, though there is nothing to interact with in there. Jerhyn's Palace is dominated by the entrance to the Harem, but there is also a small balcony to the left of the stairs."}

By sanctifying his weapon with some of his own blood, a Paladin of Zakarum is able to increase his efficiency in combat by forfeiting a portion of his own physical essence. This sacrifice is a symbol of faith that even the lowliest Paladin must submit before the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, in order that he may prove himself worthy of victory.\"\nStrategy.\nSacrifice may seem counter-productive, taking health from the Paladin to increase his attack effectiveness. But as points are invested in this skill, the amount of damage inflicted increases. The relative amount of harm inflicted to the Paladin himself, though, is at most 8% of the physical damage the Paladin inflicts, and decreases with skill investment, in exchange for the damage-boosting effect.\nThis makes Sacrifice more harmful to Paladins the more damage they do, but also makes their attacks independent from &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; pool (which is beneficial for builds that focus on &lt;a href=\"Aura\"&gt;Aura&lt;/a&gt;s and therefore do not invest into Mana-increasing gear).\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shrine\"&gt;Combat Shrine&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0increase the life lost when using Sacrifice as they increase physical damage dealt, but on the other hand may decrease the damage part dealt to self.\nCombined with a &lt;a href=\"Life%20Steal\"&gt;life-stealing&lt;/a&gt; weapon, Sacrifice becomes a powerful tool; otherwise the use of this skill at high levels can be suicidal and cannot be healed quickly enough by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, except by &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation%20Potion\"&gt;Rejuvenation Potion&lt;/a&gt;s. This is more problematic on higher difficulties: lifesteal on Nightmare is cut to 1/2 the original value and on Hell it is cut to 1/3 of the original value.\nThe health damage works as a negative lifesteal, so a character with at least as much lifesteal to nullify Sacrifice's self-damage at a given difficulty level, difficult as it may be, doesn't suffer any health damage. Enemies that shrug off life steal are exceptions to this rule. &lt;a href=\"Prayer\"&gt;Prayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;Redemption&lt;/a&gt; work well with Sacrifice as both serve to replenish health. \u00a0\nAs a powerful synergetic skill for\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Zeal\"&gt;Zeal&lt;/a&gt;, Sacrifice is a useful skill to invest in even if it isn't used directly.\nSkill Progression.\nDamage to Self: 7%...1% (min on 19 lvl)"}

He is &lt;a href=\"Norrec\"&gt;Norrec&lt;/a&gt; 's best friend and ally, they both have saved each other's lives many, many times. He, along with &lt;a href=\"Fauztin\"&gt;Fauztin&lt;/a&gt; and Norrec, travelled the world searching for treasure.\nTryst was one of the characters in the book. He is alive at the beginning but dies early on (along with Fautzin), his head savagely twisted aside, and his arm broken to the point of near-severance. He is killed by Norrec (who had just succumbed to Bartuc's armour while raiding the tomb). He is re-introduced later by &lt;a href=\"Kara%20Nightshadow\"&gt;Kara Nightshadow&lt;/a&gt;, a follower of &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, who uses her enchanted dagger to speak with him and Fautzin and learn of the disturbance in the tomb. However, he and Fautzin both \"mysteriously\" gain independence during the communications, seizing the dagger and \"using\" it to become sentient revenants, powerful undead that chased after their killers and would never rest until they exacted their revenge. It is later shown in the book that Kara's spell and dagger are not the cause for their re-animation, but rather an &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel's&lt;/a&gt; doing, who is not named in the book.\nAppearance.\nTryst is described as a weasel-like character by Norrec. He is a wiry, battle-scarred war veteran. His hair is long and black, and thinning slightly.\nAs a revenant, he looks the same as in his final moments, except much paler. His head remains tilted to one side, as his twisted neck unable to hold it up. His face is a visage of his last moments, having a lopsided smile permanently fixed on his face. He is also unable to use his broken arm, which remains almost torn off. However, despite these horrendous handicaps, he is able to fight inexhaustibly due to his undead nature. He is shown several times to be able to move incredibly swiftly, as well as throw a dagger accurately and powerfully despite only having one arm and lopsided vision. During a battle with Captain Jeronnan, he also loses his ring finger and little finger on his good hand to the Captain's silver blade.\nOver the course of the book, Tryst also succumbs to the natural decomposition of normal corpses. His teeth are yellow and his gums are black by the end, and he is shown to be the victim of decay.\nPersonality.\nTryst has a dry sense of humour, and a roguish charm about him. He is also loyal, remaining faithful to Norrec in the end, and only targeting the Armor. Unfortunately, not a lot of information about his post-humorous behaviour is given. Once he was re-animated, he became much more morbid. However, he is still somewhat upbeat, talking to the Necromancer quite often about his and Norrec's adventures. It seems that he also longed for companionship and the comforts of life, even after death, attempting to taste food (which ended in him spitting it out, as his tongue had long since stopped functioning), and making not-so-subtle advances on Kara."}

These gods are divided into gods of order and gods of chaos. The gods apparently have signs associated with them (e.g. an individual may be born \"under the sign of &lt;a href=\"Ytar\"&gt;Ytar&lt;/a&gt;\").\nThe &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; (or the monks' interpretation of them) apparently plays a role in this system of worship. Every Monk holds a god as their patron. As many of the Monks value strength and resolve, it is common for them to seek the patronage of deities in the faith that embody these traits (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Zaim\"&gt;Zaim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ytar\"&gt;Ytar&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt; are at the head of the faith. Four are dedicated to Order, four to Chaos, and one remains neutral. According to the tenets of their faith, when a patriarch dies, their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; is released to be reborn in their replacement. Reincarnation plays a role in the wider Sahptev religion, the Patriarchs teaching that \"death is simply a chance to be reborn.\"\nIt is an accepted fact of the Sahptev faith that the mightiest relics are those most sublime in appearance."}

He had a high opinion of himself and a low opinion of the \"dumb herd\" that constituted the theater-going audience within the kingdom. \nBiography.\nEarly Life.\nDrest was a thief and a beggar. However, he was still able to write plays, which came to the attention of Lord &lt;a href=\"Barimos\"&gt;Barimos&lt;/a&gt;. Barimos became his patron.\nRivalry with Marlowe.\nDuring his career, Drest had a rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Marlowe\"&gt;Marlowe&lt;/a&gt;, another playwright within Westmarch. Drest was jealous of his fame, and considered him a fraud. This hit hard when he turned up at the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Desote\"&gt;Grand Desote&lt;/a&gt;, during a rehersal of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Broken%20Four\"&gt;The Broken Four&lt;/a&gt;\". Drest was certain that his play had found purchase, but then in walked Marlowe, who presented his own play. It was performed in the Desote, a play that Drest considered to be cliched, juvenile, and trite, but nonetheless, it won the audience over. Over the next three years, their rivalry festered, with Drest refusing to go to Marlowe's plays. However, Marlowe's fame only grew, while Drest's declined. At the height of their rivalry, Drest and Marlowe couldn't even be in the same room without trading verbal blows (or in one or two instances, physical ones), and they tried to convince actors to not work with their counterpart.\nDrest made a comback of sorts with \"&lt;a href=\"Rathma%27s%20Curse\"&gt;Rathma's Curse&lt;/a&gt;\", which outsold Marlowe's most recent play. In the aftermath, Marlowe took a three month sabbatical without a performance of his work. Drest assumed that Marlowe had made a \"final surrender\" as the \"hack\" he was. However, Marlowe did make a return, this time styling himself as some kind of dark prophet, a writer of horror regarding &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s lording over mankind. Drest assumed it was an act; a desparate attempt to gain fame. However, act or not, it worked, and the people of Westmarch flooded to see Marlowe's plays. In despair, and without his muse, Drest took to the pipe, hoping for inspiration to find him. However, none came. For a year, Drest lived as a \"pipe fiend\" until Barimos visited him. Barimos was now Marlowe's patron, but still wanted to know what Drest had been working on, as he was still providing Drest with &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. Drest assured him that he was indeed working on something; his \"finest work.\" Barimos saw through Drest's lies, and told him that he wanted a play in one week's time. Otherwise, he'd have Drest thrown out from his lodgings.\nDespite Drest's proclemations, he returned to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ram%27s%20Head\"&gt;smoke den&lt;/a&gt; which he had called home for the past year. There, he was visited by a strange man, who claimed that Marlowe had put an incantation on Drest, which was why he had lost his muse. Drest's first reaction was incredulity, but the man's icy gaze gave him second thoughts. He claimed that Marlowe had struck a pact with &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; a year ago, and that only Drest could stop him. Marlowe was conducting a ritual this very moment, he claimed, and Drest had to interrupt it. With nothing left to lose, Drest headed to Marlowe's tenement. Inside, he found skulls and entrails (&lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; in origin, he couldn't say). But among all that, he found a manuscript titled \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Exile%20%28Play%29\"&gt;The Dark Exile, Part One&lt;/a&gt;\", as written by Marlowe. Marlowe took the manuscript home and read it. It described the events of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt; of centuries past. Drest was engrossed in the play, but then Marlowe knocked at his door, demanding that he return the manuscript. He claimed that he'd made a terrible mistake, speaking of horrors he had seen, and horrors that Drest would as well if they didn't end this now.\nDrest took pleasure in seeing Marlowe reduced to such a sorry state. He taunted his rival playwright before Marlowe attacked him with unnatural speed and strength. Nevertheless, Drest prevailed, using a candlestick to smash Marlowe's head in, killing him. With Marlowe dead, Drest read the rest of the play, finding that it ended on a cliffhanger, at the point prior th the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; launching their uprising against the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. Drest realized that with this play, he had everything he needed to return to glory. He hid Marlowe's body under his floorboards and submitted the play to Barimos. Barimos noticed the similarities to Marlowe's style, but commended Drest for adapting \"to the new tastes of our audience.\"\nThe Dark Exile.\nAuditions began for \"The Dark Exile\", but things went wrong from the start. &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey\"&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Didier\"&gt;actors&lt;/a&gt; died while auditioning for Prime Evil roles. Barimos wanted to shut down the production, as the actors believed that the play was cursed. That, and there was worry as to what had happened to Marlowe. On the night of the play's debut, as Drest made preparations to attend the performance, the floorboards beneath his house began to bang, as he heard Marlowe call his name. He begged Drest not to show the play, but Drest refused, yelling that Marlowe was dead. He attended the play, and the audience was enraptured, calling out for him at the play's performance. Meriment followed, but two days later, Drest heard Marlowe call out for him again. This time, he did not fall silent.\nTalk of the play spread throughout Westmarch, and people flocked to see it. It caught the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; clergy, and a group of clerics led by &lt;a href=\"Malchus\"&gt;Malchus&lt;/a&gt; came to investigate the blasphemy. However, the controversy around the play only bid more people come to see it. Drest however, was stuck in a living nightmare. Marlowe continued to torment him, but he couldn't move the body for fear of being discovered. Marlowe whispered that Drest had to finish what he'd started. Then, one morning, a messenger bid him come to Lord Barimos's office. Barimos hugged Drest, telling him he was pleased with the reception to \"The Dark Exile\", but without Marlowe, the Desote was relying on Drest. In essence, he wanted the second part. Drest returned home to hear Marlowe laughing at him. For two days and nights, Drest struggled to write something that would match \"Part One\", but nothing came. His muse had left him. He planned to cut his losses and run, but Marlowe whispered that he had to finish what he'd started. That all he had to do was ask for his help. Drest covered his ears, begged for Marlowe to stop, but in the end, he relented. Marlowe said he'd show Drest the ritual, but first, he had to set him free. He unfastened the floorboards and found Marlowe's body in a pugnant state of decay.\nThey began the ritual. Marlowe told him that they would be channeling the powers of &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;. The ritual was conducted, and Drest found his vision changed. He could see shadowy demons on the walls of his abode. He caught glimpses of the Dark Exile of ages past. He saw the banishment of the Prime Evils into &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and how the Lesser Evils had subsequently fallen into civil war. Finally, he awoke from his fervor. Hours had passed, he could not see Marlowe anywhere, and the floorboards were back in place. And before him was a manuscript\u2014\"The Dark Exile, Part 2\".\nIt was at this point that guards burst into Drest's hovel, led by Constable &lt;a href=\"Rantz\"&gt;Rantz&lt;/a&gt;. Drest fled with the manuscript in hand, but they were able to find Marlowe's body (the maggots gave it away). Drest was captured soon afterwards.\nInterrogation.\nDrest was interrogated by Rantz and a &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; priest named &lt;a href=\"Malchus\"&gt;Malchus&lt;/a&gt;. He told his story up to the point where he killed Marlowe. Rantz, who was impatient, declared that this was all they needed as a confession, but Malchus bid him continue. He told the rest of his story, up to where he had written the second part of \"The Dark Exile\" and his subsequent capture by Rantz. Rantz went to prepare the gallows, while Malchus stayed behind. Drest begged him to understand, that his actions were due to the influence of demons. Malchus lowered his hood and revealed himself to be the individual Drest had seen at the opium den. He revealed that Marlowe had realized what he was writing, and had been on his way to burn the manuscript, so Malchus arranged Drest to complete Marlowe's work, praying on Drest's jealousy. He further revealed that he was a servant of Belial, who had devised the play as a 'mind worm,' a tale of his victory that would live forever in the hearts of men. That he had led the Zakarum priests to protest the play had been a dogwhistle, a way of increasing its infamy. And now, the scheme had reached its climax\u2014the last work of a hanged, mad playwright, who had told constables stories of receiving visions of demons. The play would tour, and all mankind would know of the horrors that dwelt among them. Or at the least, feel them. The story would become part of their lives forever, and those lives would never be the same.\nDrest screamed for help, but none was forthcoming. The hangman's noose awaited..."}

Its biomes range from frigid mountains to sand-swept canyons. Filled with horrific monsters, one must be merciless toward their enemies if they are to survive in this world. Even the wealthiest areas in Sanctuary are challenging to exist in. As a land plagued by darkness, upholding a semblance of justice in Sanctuary is seemingly an impossible task. Some of Hell's most dangerous creatures have made their way into this world.\nThe forces that shape Sanctuary are unknown to most of its denizens.\nA number of focal points exist within Sanctuary; places that have been \"hammered down,\" that hold Sanctuary's reality together. This is due to the nature of its creation by both angels and demons, who combined their powers into these focal points. Similarly, sites of power exist across Sanctuary, and leylines transmit energy between these sites. The leylines drift, and are difficult to follow. It is common for &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s to erect shrines or altars on these sites, and while these structures come and go, the sites themselves remain.\nSanctuary has seasons such as autumn and winter, both of which occur late in Sanctuary's calendar year. Harvest is carried out in the former, in order to survive the rigors of the latter. On the last day of harvest season, the wisest folk lock their doors, hang their wards, hide under their beds, and wait for dawn. Winter can be harsh, but those who survive the winter fever retain the strength of the madness it brings. The closer the year moves to winter, the longer the nights become.\nMaps of Sanctuary depict two major landmasses, separated by the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt;. The eastern landmass is called Estuar, otherwise known as the Eastern Continent. This is boarded by the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sea of Light&lt;/a&gt;, while the western landmass is bordered by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. To the north of both continents lies the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The seas of Sanctuary are vast and volatile, and have claimed the lives of countless foolhardy &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSanctuary's landscape has been altered a lot over time, especially due to the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; being one of the more (in)famous examples. During the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Reign of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helltide\"&gt;Helltide&lt;/a&gt;s repeatedly morphed Sanctuary's landscape.\nAstro-geography.\nSanctuary resides in a pocket dimension, separate from both &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;,and surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt; akin to a veil. The &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; believe that Sanctuary lies upon the back of &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lintel%20XII\"&gt;Lintel XII&lt;/a&gt; maintained the existence of a \"world disc,\" along the circumference of which is the serpent &lt;a href=\"Kepeleke\"&gt;Kepeleke&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt; holds that Sanctuary is a spherical world. The world possesses a single &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;, a single &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; and beyond Sanctuary lie stars.\nBoth the moon and stars can affect the practice of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; within Sanctuary. The stars themselves are grouped into constellations such as the phoenix. Stars may fade and plummet to Sanctuary akin to bolides.\nSanctuary has solstices and equinoxes, and the alignment of heavenly bodies beyond Sanctuary generate power due to the harmonic nature of Creation. The moon sometimes moves in front of the sun, causing an eclipse. \nSanctuary experiences an atmospheric phenomenon known as aurora borealis. Its endless shimmer, an untamable dance, is best admired from afar. For those who cross this unspoken boundary are upended by a most heinous curse.\nAt times, over the centuries, Sanctuary and Hell touch in a manner that allows the summoning of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s into the mortal realm to be easier than it might otherwise be. Similarly, the glory of the Heavens sometimes verges onto Sanctuary, turning hidden places into &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;hallowed&lt;/a&gt; ground.\nLands of the West.\n&lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; lies on western shore of the Twin Seas, with the &lt;a href=\"Tamoe%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;Tamoe Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt; separating it from the lands of the West. These lands are collectively known as the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, and consist of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Off the coast of Westmarch lies a series of islands, one of which is &lt;a href=\"Greyhollow%20Island\"&gt;Greyhollow Island&lt;/a&gt;. The north most island is &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint\"&gt;Stormpoint&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the north of the western continent lies the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as the Northern Steppes. To the east of this realm lies &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod%20%28Country%29\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, though as a country, these realm no longer exists bar a single &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;city-state&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouth of the western continent lies the &lt;a href=\"Skovos%20Isles\"&gt;Skovos Isles&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of four main islands with the names of Philios, Skovos, Lycander, and Skartara.\nThe northern Part of the ocean to the west of the western continent is the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Sea\"&gt;Forgotten Sea&lt;/a&gt;; and it is filled with surging tides and fog.\nLands of the East.\nThe eastern continent is biodiverse, and prior to its collapse, was dominated by the empire of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;, which encompassed a full third of Sanctuary's eastern hemisphere. The area covered by Kehjistan can broadly be defined by its northern desert and southern rainforests. To its north lies the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and further still, &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt;. Off Scosglen's western coast lies the island of &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo Kehjistan's southwest lies the &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Torajan Jungles&lt;/a&gt;, and bordering the Twin Seas, the &lt;a href=\"Marshland\"&gt;Marshland&lt;/a&gt;. To the far east lies the &lt;a href=\"Swampland\"&gt;Swampland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crown of the World.\nBeyond Sanctuary's main continents\u2014at its north pole, lies the Crown of the World, commonly called the &lt;a href=\"World%27s%20Crown\"&gt;World's Crown&lt;/a&gt;. It is a barren land devoid of life, and has been described as a blank spot in the canvas of creation.\nLands Unknown.\nLands and countries are known to exist/have existed whose locations are unclear. These included the now-defunct &lt;a href=\"Samuren%20Empire\"&gt;Samuren Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the nation of &lt;a href=\"Wojahn\"&gt;Wojahn&lt;/a&gt;, the island nation of &lt;a href=\"Uie\"&gt;Uie&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bakuli%20Jungle\"&gt;Bakuli Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSanctuary has always been a deadly world\u2014even before the coming of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. It possesses a bloody history, filled with struggle and conflict. A number of its casualties have been lost to history.\nOrigins.\nSanctuary has its origins with &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, and the renegade &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s who followed them, seeking an escape from the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. They absconded with the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and shifted it into a pocket dimension. There, they used its extraordinary power to shape a new world. A refuge free from war, free from unending strife. A Sanctuary.\nThe coupling of angels and demons resulted in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. The nephalem spread across Sanctuary, and their parents realized that their children were more powerful than they. This raised concerns among the renegades, who not only feared the nephalem's power in of itself, but the risk that their offspring might draw the attention of Heaven and Hell. Many of the renegades held the opinion that the nephalem be destroyed, while others believed their children should be spared. Inarius, troubled by the dissension, called for a period of reflection. A period that was broken by Lilith as, maddened by the threat of her children's extinction, turned on the renegade angels and demons.\nLilith was defeated by Inarius, but not before she'd killed almost every angel and demon that had followed them. Enraged, Inarius still couldn't bring himself to slay Lilith, and thus banished her to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Inarius then attuned the Worldstone to cause the powers of the nephalem to diminish over time. Thus led to the subsequent weakening of the nephalem and emergence of their descendants\u2014&lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity.\nThe Sin War.\nOver the subsequent millennia, the nephalem faded from Sanctuary, becoming the origin of various myths. Humanity, however, spread across Sanctuary, ignorant of its origins. However, because of the actions of &lt;a href=\"Jere%20Harash\"&gt;Jere Harash&lt;/a&gt;, Hell was made aware of the existence of the mortal realm. The &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, sensing the dormant power of the nephalem within these mortal beings, resolved to corrupt humanity to turn into a weapon against Heaven. To gain followers, the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; was founded\u2014a seemingly benevolent religion that was in reality a front for this darker purpose. The Triune spread in number and influence across &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;, with only its highest echelons knowing the truth behind the faith.\nInarius, aware of what the Triune really was, and afraid of what would happen if Heaven discovered humanity's existence in the same way Hell had, formed the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; to counter the Triune's influence. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, as the two faiths warred to claim the hearts of humankind. This spiraled into open conflict as Lilith returned to Sanctuary, awakening the powers of the nephalem in a mortal named &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian%20ul-Diomed\"&gt;Uldyssian ul-Diomed&lt;/a&gt;. Lilith sought to rid Sanctuary of the influence of both Inarius and Hell, but she was willing to sacrifice as many lives as necessary to make that happen. After discovering Lilith's true nature, Uldyssian refused to be her pawn, and turned his wrath against both the Triune and Cathedral. The Sin War concluded with a three-way battle between Heaven, Hell, and Uldyssian's &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt;, ending in Uldyssian's self-sacrifice.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, a peace was brokered between Heaven and Hell. The memories of the Edyrem would be erased, and humanity would be free to chart its own destiny, be it toward the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; or Darkness. The Prime Evils however, had no intention of honoring the truce, and would continue their efforts to corrupt humanity.\nFreedom Imperfect.\nHistory marched on. The &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt; ended the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Magic\"&gt;Age of Magic&lt;/a&gt;, ushering in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Age of Faith&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, the events of the conflict 'stained' the fabric of Sanctuary, making it easier for demons to manifest within the mortal realm. The Age of Faith would see the formation of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, though the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt; flourished in obscurity for the next millennium.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt; likewise changed the fortunes of Sanctuary, and not for the better. In the time since the Sin War, the Prime Evils had continued to focus on subverting humanity to their side, while the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; believed that the Primes were afraid to continue the war with Heaven. The result was a civil war in Hell, which saw the Prime Evils banished to Sanctuary. This led to &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; creating the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, which spent over a decade hunting down and imprisoning the three Primes. Before their capture, the Primes had spread terror, hatred, and destruction throughout humanity for years, and while all three were eventually imprisoned, this was a temporary victory, for &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; would all come to corrupt their jailers in time. Furthermore, like with the Mage Clan Wars, the events of the Dark Exile negatively affected the very nature of the mortal realm. Unnatural and evil forced influenced most, if not all, of Sanctuary's native creatures to some degree.\nFollowing the sealing of the Primes, the Zakarum faith emerged into prominence. While the religion had been founded a millennium before, the conversion of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tassara\"&gt;Tassara&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; to the faith, and subsequent election of the first &lt;a href=\"Que-Hegan\"&gt;Que-Hegan&lt;/a&gt;, Zakarum was formally codified. The subsequent &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Crusade\"&gt;Zakarum Crusade&lt;/a&gt; spread the faith to the far west, ensuring that few reigions of Sanctuary were untouched by the faith. However, two centuries later, this was followed by the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Inquisition\"&gt;Zakarum Inquisition&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the suppression of other faiths and schisms within the church.\nReturn of the Primes.\nThe 1260s saw a series of cataclysmic events rock the mortal realm. By this point, Zakarum had been corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, who sent his servant, &lt;a href=\"Lazarus\"&gt;Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, to awake Diablo in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. This led to the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, which saw the &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;s of King &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; and Queen &lt;a href=\"Asylla\"&gt;Asylla&lt;/a&gt;, the abduction of their son, &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;, and general calamity befalling the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;. While Diablo was ultimately defeated by a &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;trio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moreina\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, this was naught but a pyrrhic victory. Diablo corrupted Aidan (the hero who had slain him), who, under Diablo's thrall, journeyed eastward in the guise of the Dark Wanderer.\nUnder the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;new group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; pursued the Wanderer, but were always one step behind. &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; was freed from his prison in &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, the three Primes were reunited for the first time in centuries. The heroes were forced to fight their way through Travincal, slay the members of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20High%20Council\"&gt;Zakarum High Council&lt;/a&gt;, and in so doing, topple Sanctuary's largest faith. Ultimately, Mephisto was slain in Travincal, and Diablo in Hell itself. Baal, however, remained at large, and mustered an &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; to march on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nDespite the efforts of the Barbarians, &lt;a href=\"Sescheron\"&gt;Sescheron&lt;/a&gt; fell to Baal's army, and &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt; came under siege. The treachery of &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt; allowed Baal to enter Mount Arreat itself, and while the Lord of Destruction was slain by the heroes, this was not before Baal had corrupted the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. If nothing was done, Baal's destructive energies would corrupt all of humanity. Thus, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt; to shatter the Worldstone. The resulting explosion devastated the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, turning it into the hellish, toxic landscape that would become known as the Dreadlands.\nAge of Unmaking.\nAfter the destruction of the Worldstone, blight began to overrun the world's oceans and forests, and a wasting sickness began to spread through its cities. Where once the Worldstone had hid Sanctuary from Heaven and Hell, now the world was open to the eyes of angels and demons, and both stared intently at the mortal realm. The essence of Sanctuary itself and every person on it began to change. By this stage, human civilization was fragmented, with only a few functioning cities left on Sanctuary.\nc. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;1273&lt;/a&gt;, Diablo's growing influence warped sections of Sanctuary into nightmarish hellscapes. Foreboding creept across the world as thousands found their dreams plagued by unexplained nightmares. The dread of the afflicted gave way to madness. Tales of self-mutilation and depraved crimes spread like silent fire. In shadowed places across the world, the air was rent as &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Rift\"&gt;hellish maws&lt;/a&gt; burst out of the world's topsoil. As Diablo's emergence drew nigh, demons paved the way for his manifestation, running rampant across the mortal realm.\nThe End of Days.\nAfter twenty years of relative calm, calamity once again befell Sanctuary. &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;, who had been enemies since the Dark Exile, both shared the same goal of subjugating humanity into their fold. Belial came to impersonate &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt; of Kehjistan, and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, having forsaken his immortality to aid humanity, descended to the mortal realm as the Fallen Star. There, he allied with a group of heroes, including &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt;, the ward of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe heroes travelled to &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; where they allied with &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt;. She helped them uncover the location of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, which could trap multiple essences of both angels and demons, and permanently destroy them. Black Soulstone in hand, they confronted Belial and revealed his great deception. Defeating him, they sealed him inside the Black Soulstone, leaving Azmodan as the last Great Evil to be imprisoned.\nThey did not need to wait long, as Azmodan launched an invasion of Sanctuary, &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;besieging&lt;/a&gt; the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. After a titanic battle, Azmodan was defeated, and in turn imprisoned inside the Black Soulstone. However, it was at this point that Adria revealed her true colors as a servant of Diablo. Enacting a plan over 20 years in the making, Leah served as Diablo's host, leading the Lord of Terror to be reborn as a singular Prime Evil, incorporating all the essences of the Great Evils into a singular being.\nUltimately, Diablo was defeated, but peace was not to last, as months later, Sanctuary was assaulted by the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;; a force of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; thralls and &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s in service to &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;. With the Great Evils defeated, Malthael reasoned that humanity was the last \"demonic\" force left in Creation, and thus, had to be eliminated.\nThe Reapers assaulted numerous cities and populations. Making matters worse, Malthael took the Black Soulstone for himself and used it to tear out the demonic essence of humanity across Sanctuary. Malthael was confronted by the Nephalem inside the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, and in the ensuing battle, Malthael destroyed the Black Soulstone to take the essences of the Great Evils into himself. Even this was not enough to stop the Nephalem however, and the Angel of Death was defeated. However, not only was Diablo freed by Malthael's death, but by this point, 50% (or even 90%) of the human race having been killed. Misery followed for mankind as religious schisms, war, and famine ravaged Sanctuary.\nThe Great Enmity.\nAfter the defeat of Malthael, &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; became an issue all over Sanctuary. Scouts regularly reported to &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; on these events, so he could best send &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; to where they were most needed. As time wore on, Tyrael began to realize that the tasks of the Nephalem were never-ending. \nOver the next five decades, Sanctuary became a bleak and shattered hellscape, bereft of hope and beset by demons. Chaos threatened to consume Sanctuary as evil and impiety continued to spread. Depraved demons and wildlife roamed the land unchecked, as terrified townsfolk huddled in dark corners, trying to survive one more day. This period of time became known as \"the Great Enmity.\"\nDemons gained control over areas of Sanctuary, the most afflicted being those subsumed by &lt;a href=\"helltide\"&gt;helltide&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt; spread his falsehoods to make the mortal realm ever more fractious.\nIn light of the power vacuum Malthael's actions had created, some rose up to attempt to fill the void, including the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; church and a resurgent &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Triune\"&gt;Temple of the Triune&lt;/a&gt;. With the return of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; to Sanctuary, more demons rose from Hell to blight the mortal realm, and a new wave of cultists and worshippers were spawned, but regardless of one's faith, all prayers remained unanswered. Lilith herself began a brutal campaign to conquer the now ruined world. The &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Fields of Hatred&lt;/a&gt; formed as a result of her presence.\nAfter Lilith's death, demons from the darkest reaches of Hell manifested within Sanctuary, ushering in a new era of death and wanton destruction. Endless waves of demons threatened to overwhelm Sanctuary's meager defenses."}

This light is an anathema to the undead, summoned as they are through the machinations of the Prime Evils. The aura carries with it the essence of life and the strength and purity of the Paladin's convictions.\"\nGeneral Information.\nEffectively an area of effect &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Bolt\"&gt;Holy Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, Sanctuary passively damages all &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; (and only Undead) enemies around the Paladin. It does not affect &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;minions&lt;/a&gt; of the player or allies such as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDamage scales based on distance to the caster. Aura deals double damage at melee range and linearly scales to normal damage at maximum range. The displayed maximum Area Damage value incorporates the maximum proximity damage bonus.\nThis skill also completely removes &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Immunities\"&gt;Immunities&lt;/a&gt; of any &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; monsters, so they are always guaranteed to suffer full damage from all Physical attacks of the Paladin and his allies. As Undead foes in general tend to have high physical resistance (and some, such as &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, are flat out immune on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28Difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell difficulty&lt;/a&gt;), this is an extremely powerful, though situational, tool against Undead.\nIn addition to damage and vulnerability, it is also knocking Undead back from the caster. This is especially effective on slower undead foes such as s.\nSeveral weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"rune%20word\"&gt;rune word&lt;/a&gt; or the unique sword automatically causes their wielder to project this aura, and thus can become a good backup weapon for any attackers causing physical damage (this extends to characters who cast spells that cause physical damage too, such as Windy &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s).\nThis skill works on &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; Undead monsters (including &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Radament\"&gt;Radament&lt;/a&gt;), but not on &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es.\n&lt;a href=\"Steal%20Life\"&gt;Steal Life&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Steal%20Mana\"&gt;Steal Mana&lt;/a&gt; items work well with Sanctuary against Physical Immune monsters, as long as they have positive drain effectiveness.\nBugs.\nDepending on game version, damage bonus of this Aura may be bugged (applied mistakenly not to the projector of the aura, but its targets, effectively, it gives all Undead monsters in the vicinity enhanced damage against Undead)."}

They have numerous pairs of legs on their sides and have large pincers. Their exoskeleton serves as a tough shell that protects them from attack. They have the ability to spit &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; at their prey and when threatened, they may burrow into the ground and emerge from beneath for an effective ambush. Sand Maggots &lt;a href=\"Lay%20Egg\"&gt;lay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Maggot%20Egg\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; on the ground.

Given by &lt;a href=\"Geglash\"&gt;Geglash&lt;/a&gt;'s advice, Sand Maggots aren't recommended against by using crossbows or other long-range weapons due to their thick armor and can only by easily taken down by using melee weapons. They have a fairly slow attack speed which makes them easier to defeat. \nSand Maggots come in four other variants: &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Worm\"&gt;Rock Worm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devourer\"&gt;Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lamprey\"&gt;Giant Lamprey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Maggot\"&gt;Blood Maggot&lt;/a&gt;.\nSand Maggots are immune to &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Difficulty\"&gt;Hell Difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"super%20unique\"&gt;super unique&lt;/a&gt; Sand Maggot is &lt;a href=\"Coldworm%20the%20Burrower\"&gt;Coldworm the Burrower&lt;/a&gt;. \nBackground.\nSand Maggots, named for their burrowing abilities, are actually arthropods and not worms at all. These insects were once a staple diet for those that resided in the desert regions. The eggs were gathered and prepared as a protein-rich paste. Serving to supplement the dry foods naturally available in the region, the paste enhanced the nutritive value and flavor of meals. Now, however, the eggs, larvae, and flesh of the adults have acquired poisonous properties. Adults of the species even spit a poisonous substance that is not only toxic, but corrosive to unprotected flesh. In maturity, the chitinous exoskeleton of a Maggot is tough to penetrate, although once pierced, the creature is easily felled.\nStatistics.\nSand Maggots are the first Sand Maggot type. They are found laying &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Maggot%20Egg\"&gt;Sand Maggot Eggs&lt;/a&gt; in: \nDevelopment.\nTheir projectiles were originally supposed to leave an caustic/poison goo as they have an unused graphic called \"sangmaggotgoosplat\". This graphic bears resemblance to the unused &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt; goo graphic, but is more detailed.\nA Pre-release gameplay video from 1999 June shows that Sand Maggots were found outside with &lt;a href=\"Huntress\"&gt;Huntresses&lt;/a&gt; (Possibly &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Hills\"&gt;Dry Hills&lt;/a&gt;)\nAnother video from 1999 June 26 showed Sand Maggots appearing in a tomb with &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Soldier\"&gt;Dung Soldiers&lt;/a&gt; and Huntresses (Possibly &lt;a href=\"The%20Stony%20Tomb\"&gt;The Stony Tomb&lt;/a&gt;) \nMany Pre-release screenshots also show them with flatter looking body."}

They disgorge streams of their own winged larvae to maim prey.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nSand Wasps are encountered in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", inside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Fahir\"&gt;Tomb of Fahir&lt;/a&gt;. They fire green projectiles at the player.\nDiablo III.\nSand Wasps are Beasts, found in &lt;a href=\"Act%20II%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act II&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Possessing a relatively powerful projectile attack and \"very\" fast movement, they usually appear in groups, but lack high health or defensive stats. The primary attack is shooting smaller wasps from the abdomen at the player.\nThey bear resemblance to the &lt;a href=\"Flayer\"&gt;Flayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mosquito%20Demon\"&gt;Mosquito Demon&lt;/a&gt; enemies from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTips and Additional Information.\nSand Wasps are deadly because of their numbers and their missile attack. The smaller wasps have a deadly poison, and four or more direct hits from them is normally a certain death for a glass cannon character. However, the small wasps move slowly in a straight line, and do not 'lock onto' targets, so they can be easily avoided. One way to avoid the small wasps involves walking in circles, as the spawns 'detonate' a few seconds after 'launch'.\nPlayers should be careful if they are surrounded by several Sand Wasps, as it is easy to underestimate them due to their slow, linear movement. Dodging shots from multiple Sand Wasps can prove frustrating, as the Wasps create a 'bullet hell' effect. Also note that Wasps move around quickly, often attacking from unexpected angles. Melee and slow missile attacks are ineffective against them, but area of effect attacks or instant hits (like &lt;a href=\"Electrocute\"&gt;Electrocute&lt;/a&gt;) can be very deadly. Also note that Wasps cannot fire their Spawns in succession at point blank range (but will try to move away from the player if given a chance).\nThe best way to deal with the Sand Wasp is to quickly close the distance and eliminate the source of the missiles (for melee heroes) or kite them and attack with instant or independent ranged attacks (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Hydra%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning Hydra&lt;/a&gt;).\nDevelopment.\nSand Wasps were originally labeled \"Desert Wasps\" in concept art.\nIn early versions of the game, Wasps were ones of the most dangerous monsters in the game, because in desert their missiles were barely visible. The coloring of the small wasps was changed later, to be at least recognizeable on time."}

He was soon after chosen to be Mephisto's host within &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, with Mephisto's &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; being punctured into the priest's hand. At some point during his reign, Sankekur also fell under the will of Mephisto. When &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, they freed Mephisto from his soulstone. The Lord of Hatred quickly took possession of Sankekur completely, the body of the Zakarum priest twisting and distorting to mirror Mephisto's demonic form. However, Mephisto was defeated by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, and Sankekur was slain as a result.\nSankekur's corruption, and that of the Zakarum faith as a whole, later became public knowledge. It was a revelation that nearly destroyed the organization. Sankekur was succeeded by Que-Hegan &lt;a href=\"Dirae\"&gt;Dirae&lt;/a&gt;, and the faith took steps to mend its reputation.\nThe Black Tomb.\nThe corpse of the former Que-Hegan seeped corruption, as Mephisto's influence still leaked demonic energy even after his defeat. To ensure the contagion of Mephisto's hatred wouldn't spread over the land, &lt;a href=\"Carthas\"&gt;Carthas&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; Marshal who was part of the group of heroes that defeated the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, took Sankekur's body back to &lt;a href=\"Hawezar\"&gt;Hawezar&lt;/a&gt;. The Paladin and his Order sealed the priest's body inside a chamber built at the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Rakhat%20Keep\"&gt;Ruins of Rakhat Keep&lt;/a&gt;, a former Zakarum temple. The resting place of Sankekur's body became known as \"The Black Tomb\". Carthas and his Paladins locked themselves inside the keep to prevent anyone from reaching the tomb, as a final display of devotion to protect Sanctuary from Mephisto's influence.\nThe Black Tomb turned out to be a passage to a much larger crypt where Sankekur was entombed. His eyes, ears and tongue had been removed by the Zakarum Paladins and placed in ceremonial urns scattered across the tomb, in an attempt to contain the demonic energy seeping from the priest's corpse. Hatred had begun spreading in the tomb due to the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; and the seemingly resurrected &lt;a href=\"Fell%20Council\"&gt;Fell Council&lt;/a&gt; meddling with it. When the &lt;a href=\"Wanderer\"&gt;Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Locran\"&gt;Locran&lt;/a&gt;, a Triune cultist loyal to &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, found Sankekur's body, they discovered it had been severely corrupted. After fending off the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; as well as a Council member, they managed to halt the corruption thus preventing the veil between &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; from being completely torn asunder, at the cost of Locran's life."}

Of note, he not only had the ability to summon &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to his side, but would gain their power upon their defeat. He despised &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, seeing them as nothing more than \"a pale shade\" of their nephalem forebears, and as being unfit to inherit &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAmbitious, gifted, Sargoth was the sole student of a cabal pledged to instruct him in &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;craft. Impatient with his progress, he murdered them in their beds and stripped away their very existence; he was just fifteen. At the apex of his power, Sargoth offered an entire &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Namari\"&gt;temple city&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;. Only the desperate efforts of the priestess &lt;a href=\"Namari\"&gt;Namari&lt;/a&gt; sealed him in the temple's ruin.\nBarriers were erected inside it to help contain his power. Three beacons imbued with &lt;a href=\"preservation%20magic\"&gt;preservation magic&lt;/a&gt; were installed to ensure that Sargoth remained alive. However, such was Sargoth's rage that his power increased over time, as did his connection with Hell. At some point, Namari confronted Sargoth, and found that his rage had granted him terrifying power. The two fought, and she was defeated. Her &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was bound to the site to ensure that he never escaped.\nOver time, the temple was plundered, including the beacons. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, someone stole the last of the beacons from the temple, which prevented Namari from intervening as Sargoth's power continued to grow. AFter the beacons were returned, Namari guided a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; through the temple. It turned out that Sargoth had enslaved nephalem spirits to his side, forcing the hero(es) to fight their way through them, along with his other minions. They were forced to deactivate the barriers, which allowed Sargoth's strength to continue.\nThe hero(es) confronted Sargoth, who summoned demons to his side. The hero(es) were able to defeat them, but drawing upon the power of the slain demons, Sargoth's power increased even further. He stepped into the fray, battling the hero(es) himself. However, he was slain, and in his last moments, called out to &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; to lend him strength.

{"id": "37904", "revid": "3407035", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=37904", "title": "Sarnakyle", "text": "Sarnakyle was a &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt;. He was fond of travelling and enjoyed wide open spaces to the stifling cities of his homeland, though took great pride in the architectural and cultural (especially academic) feats of his homeland). He appeared in a perpetually good mood, but could be serious when needed. He reguarly dressed in red, appearing to wear robes and a cloak of no other color.\nBiography.\nEarly Life.\nAs a member of the Vizjerei, Sarnakyle had experience in both summoning and battling &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. While in &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;, he was called upon to investigate a demonic possession. A small child, no older than two, had killed his parents. Left without recourse, he had to kill the child to banish the demon, an act with left him morally and emotionally shaken.\nSarnakyle spent decades studying the spirits of demons, and he came to be a member of the Vizjerei ruling council. In his studies, he came to know the names of all the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, and learnt of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Baron%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Barons of Hell&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Assur\"&gt;Assur&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later fought in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt; and helped to slay &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt;. After the war's end at &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt;, he became a wanderer like many other clan lords, trying to \"rediscover what was real.\" In his travels, he had some run-ins with demons as well.\nDemonsbane.\nMeeting Siggard.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23302\"&gt;302&lt;/a&gt;, Sarnakyle was in &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that he met &lt;a href=\"Siggard\"&gt;Siggard&lt;/a&gt; in a forest. He had seen some disturbing things in the land. Siggard told him that he intended to head for &lt;a href=\"Blackmarch\"&gt;Blackmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Sarnakyle hadn't been there, but offered to travel there with him. Siggard agreed, and Sarnakyle took first watch. The next morning, Siggard was eager to get going, but Sarnakyle was not so hasty. He revealed that the army of Blackmarch had been obliterated by a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic force. Siggard knew that with the army defeated, the demons would be free to rampage throughout Entsteig, and thus, decided to head for the country's &lt;a href=\"Entstieg%20%28City%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;. Sarnakyle stated that he would come with him.\nAs they travelled, Sarnakyle told Siggard stories of the east, of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;, and of the &lt;a href=\"dark%20magic\"&gt;dark magic&lt;/a&gt; of the south. After a day of travelling, they finally emerged from the forest to the fields of Entstieg (a sight that Sarnakyle found most pleasing). The two travelled to the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Road\"&gt;King's Road&lt;/a&gt; so that they could get their bearings. They reached at midday on the morrow. Siggard declared that they would head for &lt;a href=\"Brennor\"&gt;Brennor&lt;/a&gt;. Sarnakyle followed suit. His mood darkened however as they came across a ruined village. Demons had passed through, killing every one of the townsfolk and livestock. Siggard wanted to move on immediately, but Sarnakyle urged rest, stating that the demons would move in a circular pattern, trying to cause as much destruction as possible. Even with rest, they would be able to make it to Siggard's &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; before them. \nThe next day, they continued travelling. Sarnakyle pointed out that they would be travelling faster than the demons, given that their army consisted of thousands. That night, Siggard still refused to eat, despite the days of travel. He told Sarnakyle of his history at &lt;a href=\"Bear%27s%20Hill\"&gt;Bear's Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and of his &lt;a href=\"Emilye\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and daughter. Upon finally arriving at the town however, they found that it had been destroyed also, its people slaughtered. Sarnakyle suggested that Siggard's family might have made it out alive, but it was not the case, as Siggard found the body of his wife among the dead.\nA Blade in the Night.\nSiggard was left in quiet shock, while Sarnakyle rested under a tree. As sunset came, Sarnakyle told Siggard that they weren't alone, that at least three people were watching them from the shadows. Siggard called out and from the shadows emerged &lt;a href=\"Tylwulf\"&gt;Tylwulf&lt;/a&gt;; a man of Bear's Hill. Sarnakyle was suspicious of the man, but nevertheless followed Siggard and Tylwulf to the latter's farm, where they were fed. After dinner, Sarnakyle told Siggard to expect treachery\u2014things were amiss. First, how had Tylwulf and his &lt;a href=\"Camylle\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; survived the demons? Second, during the conversation, they had called Sarnakyle a \"spirit &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;.\" The fact that they somehow knew he was a Vizjerei aside, that was a term used only by the Mage Clans and by demons. Third, where were the graves for the fallen? He suggested that Siggard prepare for someone to attack them...\n...which Tylwulf and his wife did, though Siggard and Sarnakyle disarmed them. Tylwulf revealed that they had thrown in their lot with the demons for power, leading the people of the town like lambs to the slaughter. In a rage, Siggard killed both of them, along with the others that had taken shelter in the farmhouse that had also thrown in their lot with &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;. Siggard slaughtered them all, but was left aghast at his actions. Sarnakyle consuled him, stating that demonic possession could not be ended without the death of the host. He told Siggard of his experiences in Viz-jun, and that to end this, they had to slay the &lt;a href=\"archdemon\"&gt;archdemon&lt;/a&gt; that led the demonic forces. \nThey set off the following day. Sarnakyle suggested that they find a fortified town and wait for the archdemon to come to them, since hunting him directly would only result in their deaths. They headed down the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Road\"&gt;Queen's Road&lt;/a&gt;, noticing the lack of travellers. Given the signs of destruction they saw along the way, it didn't take them long to guess the reason why.\nBrennor.\nFinally, they made it to &lt;a href=\"Brennor\"&gt;Brennor&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a city by Entsteigian standards, a small town by &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt; ones. They went to the town's castle to see Earl &lt;a href=\"Edgewulf\"&gt;Edgewulf&lt;/a&gt;, but the steward, &lt;a href=\"Hunfrith\"&gt;Hunfrith&lt;/a&gt;, informed them that Edgewulf had been slain at Blackmarch, and that his son, &lt;a href=\"Tilgar\"&gt;Tilgar&lt;/a&gt;, had taken earlship over Brennor. Sigard told Hunfrith of the approaching demon army, but Hunfrith scoffed at such a notion. He sent the two of them out of the castle, accusing Siggard of being a deserter at Blackmarch despite Sarnakyle defending him. The two retired to an inn and Sarnakyle urged Siggard to try and remember something about the archdemon he had fought. The only distinguishing feature he could remember was a glyph upon his chest. However, the conversation couldn't continue further as Brennor came under attack by the demon army. The two battled the creatures alongside Brennor's defenders. The demons were repelled, though at the cost of lives, and it left Sarnakyle exhausted from the effort required to wield his magic. However, before he could rest, they were approached by Hunfrith and Tilgar, the latter of whom offered a reward. However, Sarnakyle refused, pointing out that the town would come under siege by the bulk of the archdemon's army within days. Tilgar bid them visit his castle the next day, and Hunfrith gave his apologies.\nThe two took Tilgar up on his offer, and they had a seat at his war council. Sarnakyle told him of how he had fought against Bartuc in the Mage Clan Wars, and suggested that the archdemon was following the same tactics as the Warlord of Blood. Namely to destroy all the settlements supporting a city before assailing the city itself. Certainly that fit in with the number of destroyed towns they had passed on their way. Sarnakyle advised them that if they killed the archdemon leading the army, the other demons would be banished from the mortal plane. However, as the archdemon was enchanted with a glyph of power, this would make it difficult to destroy at best. As they prepared for the siege, Sarnakyle spent time reading old spellbooks he had carried with him. His mood had darkened, and Siggard got the brunt of it. They received a note from Tilgar that the army had been sighted, and would arrive in one day's time, and that all the surrounding villages had been destroyed.\nThe army approached, and Sarnakyle recognised the standard as belonging to &lt;a href=\"Assur\"&gt;Assur&lt;/a&gt;, favored baron of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. Sarnakyle was crestfallen\u2014not only because the army was larger than initially estimated, but in his mind, there was no way Assur could be slain. He told Siggard that they had to evacuate Brennor. They returned to see Tilgar where they met a newcomer, the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;; one whom Siggard had seen not long after Blackmarch. Sarnakyle explained that the glyph Assur bore, while only capable of being cast once a millennium, made him invulnerable to any mortal or angel while he bore it. Tyrael stressed the importance of defeating Assur, but given his apparent invulnerability, advised Brennor's defenders to focus on his army. If they could drive it back, they could claim victory. The alternative was Sanctuary falling to Hell.\nAssur's forces besieged the town in two waves. The wall held, but it was for naught, as &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; had infiltrated the town and began attacking the defenders from the rear. Tilgar led Sarnakyle and Siggard to some tunnels while the defenders made their last stand. They reached a hill that overlooked the town, now in ruins. Siggard announced his intention to slay Assur himself, despite Sarnakyle's protestations. He offered to help him, but Siggard refused, bidding that Sarnakyle stay with Tilgar and the refugees, reasoning that his magic would help protect them. \nDespite the odds, Siggard succeeded in slaying Assur, and Tilgar returned to Brennor, removing the remaining demons.\nLater Life.\nAfter the events at Brennor, Sarnakyle spent five years traveling in the western lands before returning to Kehjistan. He resumed his leadership role within the Vizjerei and led them back into the practice of &lt;a href=\"elemental%20magic\"&gt;elemental magic&lt;/a&gt;. However, twenty years later, he again began to wander, and this time, never returned. His &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; was never recorded. He was remembered as \"the Red Wizard,\" and to this day, the Vizjerei believe that in a time of great troubles, he will come back to lead them."}

They were hunted to near-extinction several centuries prior to the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, but the hardiest of their kind survived, and bred among themselves in secret places, renewing their species.

They have powerful legs which they use for swift springing attacks, striking at vulnerable faces and throats. They prefer to move in packs, and attack their prey \"en masse\". However, if their intended prey puts up a good fight, the Scavengers may hesitate to continue their assault.

Scavengers can be found near any kind of filth and decay, and can camouflage themselves within it. They are attracted to &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s, immune to rot, and carry disease. Unlike most carnivores of this type however, they are extremely aggressive and will not hesitate to attack those unfortunate enough to encounter them.\nScavengers have powerful legs which they use for swift springing attacks, striking at vulnerable faces and throats. Their anatomy bears a striking resemblance to that of the &lt;a href=\"leaper\"&gt;leaper&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt; desert, and thus, many researchers classify the two groups as part of the same family of creatures.

They have a skull similar in shape to real world hyenas, built for crushing bone while searching for any usable meat in a carcass.\nThey have a black mane from their heads to their mid-backs and their rear ends have a short and hairy tail like that of a horse. But their most striking, albeit disproportioned, feature are their limbs, which are actually as long as their torsos. Their hands are lean but have palms as large as their heads complete with long nails that are used for burrowing beneath the ground. These can also be used to great effect as weapons against what they think as potential competition to their meal. Even though they rely on carrion for their food, they will not hesitate to create carrion using their sharp claws.\nThey look more like animals than demons, and are somewhat badger-like in their furry, striped appearance. But they leap and dart around wildly, and seem quite capable of swarming an unwary hero by sheer numbers. Due to their ability to burrow, Scavengers can even escape combat or ambush the unsuspecting from below.\nTips and Additional Information.\nScavengers are more dangerous than they seem. They move with blinding speed and often swarm players with their numbers. They make difficult targets due to their speed, their constant moving, and their ability to burrow.\nUsing snare abilities or cold attacks can help gain control of the situation. Outrunning them is not advised as Scavengers can easily catch up with you. Scattering their packs and swiftly taking them down are your best options."}

The third and final piece was retrieved from the Chamber of Truth, and the newly reconstituted staff presented to Tabri. With the staff, she now had the right to rule Shassar, and more importantly, given her a symbol to rally the people of Shassar behind, in order to defeat &lt;a href=\"Vataos\"&gt;Vataos&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing the power of the scepter, Tabri declared war against the Sand Scorpions, but the Amber Blades were forced to retreat into the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Zoltun%20Kulle\"&gt;Library of Zoltun Kulle&lt;/a&gt;. Tabri and &lt;a href=\"Vataos\"&gt;Vataos&lt;/a&gt; ended up in the &lt;a href=\"Obliterated%20Realm\"&gt;Obliterated Realm&lt;/a&gt;, where they fought. Vataos took the scepter from Tabri, but he was defeated in turn by the Shard-seeker. They tried to escape, but Vataos, still not dead, attacked Tabri, preventing her from escaping the realm. In the chaos, the scepter went through the portal back into the Library, where it was picked up by &lt;a href=\"Zov\"&gt;Zov&lt;/a&gt;. He ran away with the scepter, intent on selling it."}

It borders the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to the south and the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest. Rugged and beautiful, \nThe wilds of Scosglen are dangerous, and are no place for the timid or the weak. The land is an untamed verdant wilderness, covered by emerald forests infested by &lt;a href=\"Night%20Howler\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt;. Those who get lost in the woods seldom return, their screams muted by spine-chilling howls. The forests are constantly covered by rain and gloomy fog, and the people of Scosglen are in a constant battle against the encroaching wilderness. Scosglen has a cold climate.\nThe dwellings of Scosglen consist of ancient stone towers called Druid Colleges, scattered throughout the land. While this form of civilization might seem crude to some, the Druids do not value urban centers in the same way as the &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt;. On the coast, the state of affairs is more desperate. In a futile attempt to withstand the harsh elements, Scosglen's coastal structures are comprised of whatever materials the locals can lay their hands on and are in various forms of disrepair. Stone walls, salvaged wood, and thatch for the roofs. A place of consolation for the brave fishermen that trawl the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt;. An exception is dwellings found atop the coast's hilltops, which have deep rooted foundations.\nHistory.\nThere is evidence that the &lt;a href=\"Ancients\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt; made their way into Scosglen in antiquity, riding upon powerful steeds.\nIn Scosglen's distant past, a &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Mystic&lt;/a&gt; set up their own 'kingdom' in the marshes of Scosglen. The Mystic was more elusive than spirits, and they repelled all those who wandered too near their quagmire kingdom. The kingdom apparently fell, and the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of those slain within its borders were its only heirs.\nThe Druids entered Scosglen at around the same time &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt; united the Barbarian tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vasily\"&gt;Vasily&lt;/a&gt; gathered together a small group consisting of the tribes' greatest warrior-poets and shamans and retreated into the forests surrounding the area known as Scosglen. There, he and his people created the first of the Druid Colleges, forging a new way of life for themselves. They created a new culture and language, cutting themselves off from their Barbarian cousins and their ways, vowing not to return to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt; until the time of the &lt;a href=\"Uileloscadh%20M%C3%B3r\"&gt;Uileloscadh M\u00f3r&lt;/a&gt;. With the coming of the conflict, Scosglen became a battleground between the Druids and the minions of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, the entirety of Scosglen's coastline had been overrun by the Drowned, and the inland areas fared little better.

The scroll is consumed in the process.

They were one of many scrolls of different spells that could be generated.\nIf the player right-clicked on them to use it. A town portal is created near the player character. The scroll is consumed in the process.\nSeeing their use, and due to the revamping of the skills system, the scroll of town portal and the &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Scroll of Identify&lt;/a&gt; were carried over to \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". Their functions were still the same as previously.\nUp to 20 Scrolls of Town Portal can be stored in a &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Tome of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll portals created from a scroll are for one-time use only.

This is defaulted to the (T) key and without a scroll as well.\nGameplay.\nThe Scroll of Town Portal is one of the most important items in the first two games. It is imperative that the player(s) keeps/keep at least one scroll in their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; at all times. It is one of the few items which the player(s) finds/find very early in the game, though remains useful throughout the whole game."}

{"id": "26938", "revid": "36794082", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26938", "title": "Season", "text": "Seasons are a game mode of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" in which players periodically start and progress fresh characters within a set time period, usually 10 to 20 weeks long. New Seasons are major events associated with new content, rewards, and &lt;a href=\"patches\"&gt;patches&lt;/a&gt;. Competing for &lt;a href=\"Leaderboard\"&gt;Leaderboard&lt;/a&gt; rankings and earning rewards from seasons is considered part of the end-game of \"Diablo III\".\nMost seasons have themes with special mechanics unique to that Season. Seasons 30 and beyond revisit previous seasonal themes, and always include the Seasonal-only &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Rites\"&gt;Altar of Rites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Visions%20of%20Enmity\"&gt;Visions of Enmity&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeasons are the equivalent of &lt;a href=\"Ladder\"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt;s from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". They were introduced for the PC in (August 2014), and for the &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Evil%20Edition\"&gt;console&lt;/a&gt; in Season 10 (March 2017). Seasons align between both platforms.\nOverview.\nSeasons are only available to freshly created characters who must be leveled all the way from level 1 after the season begins. Seasonal characters have a separate &lt;a href=\"stash\"&gt;stash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and other currencies, &lt;a href=\"artisans\"&gt;artisans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; experience etc., starting fresh and completely clear when the season begins. These are also separate for Softcore and &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; Seasonal characters, making a total of four types per account. Seasonal characters take up one of the regular 12 or 15 character slots and will remain in this slot after the end of a Season, simply having their Season status removed.\nSeason participation benefits include exclusive rewards and unique &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt;, which are only available to Seasonal characters. It also awards special &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; options.\nThe goal and key feature of Seasons is the ability to climb &lt;a href=\"Leaderboard\"&gt;Leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;s by completing achievements, earning &lt;a href=\"Conquest\"&gt;Conquest&lt;/a&gt;s, or running &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s. Each type of Leaderboard is divided by goal, by class and by solo/group mode rather than a \"by account\" one. There is a fierce competition within the Leaderboard of the same type, but it has no effect on other boards.\nAfter the season ends, all of the player's progress (Paragon experience, crafting recipes, items, gold, etc.) will be rolled into the main roster, and the season-exclusive items are added to the normal loot tables. In other words, all seasonal characters become normal, and with the start of the next season, new characters must fresh-start all over again, competing for the clear Leaderboards. Each new season adds new rewards.\nSeason Journey.\nThe Journey is an interface that was added in Season 4, as a means of tracking player progress. This feature is divided into chapters, which include major milestones that are achievable by most players, and tiers, which are designed for advanced players. Beginning with Season 5, players receive &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Haedrig's Gift&lt;/a&gt; as a reward for completing Chapter IV of the Season Journey.\nConquests.\nConquests are special feats within Season, not related to Seasonal Journey (however, chapters 7, 8 and 9 require 1, 2 and 3 conquests to be completed respectively). These are among the hardest of goals to accomplish. They change with every Season. Examples include:\nEither of the Conquests will be credited separately for &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nRebirth.\nSeason Rebirth is a feature added in Season 5 which takes a non-Seasonal hero, and turns them into a Seasonal hero starting at level 1 with no gear or any other progression. Any gear removed from a hero in this way is automatically mailed to the player in the non-Season, with thirty days to reclaim the items. It is equivalent to putting all the character's gear into the shared stash for other characters to retrieve, then deleting the character and making a new Seasonal one with the same name, class, and gender. Rebirth avoids the hassle of doing this process manually. It is limited to three uses per season.\nGame updates.\nThe cyclical nature of Seasons was used by the designers and developers to pace general updates to the game, including with features and balance changes for non-Seasonal play. Seasons provided an opportunity to test new game mechanics and features in a somewhat self-contained way before making them permanent. For a time, it was also common for new items to be exclusive to the Season before becoming generally available after the season ended.\n&lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt; implementing these changes are usually released just before a new season starts - since Seasons began, only Season 1 has received balance or content patches mid-Season. With the cessation of active development on \"Diablo III\" after season 29, it is expected that only minor maintenance patches will appear between future seasons, if any.\nList of Seasons.\nSeason 1.\nSeason 1 launched on Friday, August 29th, 2014 at 6 PM, following . It ran until February 3, 2015 at 4 PM.

This is the first season where both the start and end times of the season were at 5 pm, resulting in an exact number of days of length. All subsequent seasons continued the 5 pm time tradition.\nLimited-time rewards.\nThis season introduced the Season Journey as an additional feature for measuring progression and obtaining rewards, in addition to the Season Achievements of previous seasons.\nSeason 5.\nSeason 5 launched on Friday, January 15, 2016, following &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4\"&gt;Patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;.\nLimited-time rewards.\nSeason 5 was the first season to not have temporarily exclusive legendary items, as the new legendaries in Patch 2.4 were made immediately available to both seasonal and non-seasonal characters. Instead, seasonal players would obtain a guaranteed free set for one class in the form of \"Haedrig's Gift,\" a series of mail packages received upon completion of certain stages of the Season Journey up to the fourth chapter. The set obtained by each class is predetermined, and rotates with each new Season.\nNew or redesigned legendaries at the time of the patch include: &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Tribes\"&gt;Blade of the Tribes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Iron\"&gt;Heart of Iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elusive%20Ring\"&gt;Elusive Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyoshiro%27s%20Blade\"&gt;Kyoshiro's Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wilken%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Wilken's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Twisted%20Sword\"&gt;The Twisted Sword&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20Nightmares\"&gt;Legacy of Nightmares&lt;/a&gt; ring set and some class sets also saw redesigns.\nThis season notably introduced the first additional stash tab as a limited time reward.\nSeason 6.\nSeason 6 launched on Friday, April 29, 2016, following &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.1\"&gt;Patch 2.4.1&lt;/a&gt;. \nLimited-time rewards.\nThis season and patch premiered with many cosmetic transmogrification items and pets which were not exclusive seasonal rewards, but instead obtained as rare drops in chests, from monsters, and from the new &lt;a href=\"Menagerist\"&gt;Menagerist&lt;/a&gt; goblin.\nNew legendaries were also released concurrently with the patch, and others given new powers: , , &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Grasp\"&gt;Skull Grasp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flail%20of%20the%20Ascended\"&gt;Flail of the Ascended&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Augustine%27s%20Panacea\"&gt;Augustine's Panacea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bakuli%20Jungle%20Wraps\"&gt;Bakuli Jungle Wraps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halo%20of%20Karini\"&gt;Halo of Karini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Fist\"&gt;Crystal Fist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fleshrake\"&gt;Fleshrake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Land%20Waders\"&gt;Swamp Land Waders&lt;/a&gt;.

It ended on March 17.\nSeason 10.\nSeason 10 launched on March 31, 2017, following &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patch 2.5.0&lt;/a&gt;. It ended on June 23. It was the first Season for the console version of Diablo III. This season was 2 weeks longer than the 3 previous seasons (7, 8 &amp; 9) due to the Necromancer release before Season 11.\nSeason 11.\nSeason 11 launches on July 20, 2017, following &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patch 2.6.0&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first season to feature the class, since the arrival of the \"\" expansion. There were no new items or balance changes for other classes.\nIt was noted that personal bests from Season 2 would be removed with Season 11. This 9 Season difference would carry on into Season 12 with Season 3 being removed then.\nThe season premiere date was moved from Friday to Thursday, in order to hotfix potential issues before the weekend. The Season ended on October 20.\nSeason 12.\nSeason 12 launched on November 9, 2017, following &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patch 2.6.1&lt;/a&gt;.

It marks the beginning of themed Seasons, Season 14 being the \"Season of Greed.\" For the duration of Season 14, all &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Goblin\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt; spawns were doubled. However, this does not affect goblins encountered via Bandit Shrines, Goblin Rift packs, or in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;Realm of Greed&lt;/a&gt;.

This buff did not stack with additional Ring of Royal Grandeur (either equipped or in &lt;a href=\"Kanai%27s%20Cube\"&gt;Kanai's Cube&lt;/a&gt;) and unlike previous Seasonal buffs, this buff did not apply to non-Seasonal players.\nWhen completing a Greater Rift level 70 solo for the first time in a Season, a &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items%23Primal%20Ancient%20Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Primal Legendary&lt;/a&gt; was guaranteed to drop from the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Guardian\"&gt;Rift Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason 17.\nThe season 17 PTR went live on Friday, April 5, 2019.

Titled \"Shades of the Nephalem,\" it is a repeat of Season 22's theme.\nDevelopment.\nThe concept for seasons in \"Diablo III\" existed as early as the game's pre-release version.\nJosh Mosqueira first announced seasons as an implementation of \"ladders\" in March 2014, to be included in the first major content update (Patch 2.1) following the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSeasons were initially not present in the &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Evil%20Edition\"&gt;console version&lt;/a&gt; of \"Diablo III\". At &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard announced that seasons would be coming to console players. This was implemented when Season 10 launched in March 2017."}

Players must create new characters that can only be used during the Season, and progress through their seasonal journey by completing specific objectives and unlock caches containing legendary gear tailored for a specific class build (similarly to &lt;a href=\"Haedrig%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Haedrig's Gift&lt;/a&gt; in \"Diablo III\"). Seasons are directly tied to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; system, which allows players to reap additional rewards.\nThe first Season in \"Diablo IV\" became available soon after the game's launch. It is intended that the game will have four Seasons per year, each with major new features, questlines, enemies, legendary items, class balance patches and more. Each Season is expected to last three months. There will always have a small interval between the end of a Season, and the start of the next one. Every new character created will start at &lt;a href=\"Character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 1 at the beginning of a Season. \nEvery Season will feature its own unique questline, that reveals more of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and the player's place in it. New characters will be introduced in some Seasons, while old ones may also be revisited. Live events will be featured during Seasons, such as the warning of an impending invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt;, which may last a weekend, or the arrival of a strange peddler amidst the crags of the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. These events provide gateways to new adventures and unique rewards.\nThe plot of each Season will be a self-contained side-story taking place in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat by the hands of . They're usually unrelated to the main plot of \"Diablo IV\" (which will be continued through expansions), but may be a result of the actions that transpired in the main storyline. Players must have completed the campaign in order to access Seasonal content. However, if the player has completed the campaign once, they can skip it for Seasons. Blizzard thinks of Seasons and expansions as being \"chapters\" of the overall storyline for \"Diablo IV\". Chapter 1 covers the base game to \"Vessel of Hatred\" (covering Seasons 1 to 6), while Chapter 2 begins with Season 7.\nSeasons will be used to experiment with innovative gameplay features and mechanics. Some of these features may end up in the base game.\nHow Seasonal Characters Work.\nTo participate in Seasons, a new character must be created on the Seasonal Realm. Players do not need to purchase a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; or any add-ons in order to play the Seasonal content, but they must have completed the campaign on either the Eternal or Seasonal Realm with at least one character. Players who haven't finished the campaign can still create a character in the Seasonal Realm, but they're required to finish the campaign with that character before the Seasonal Storyline and content opens for them.\nOnce the player have completed the Campaign, any Seasonal character will start the game with:\nOnce the Season has ended, all seasonal characters and their progress will be transferred to the Eternal Realm, including items on the Seasonal Stash. However, Season-specific features won't be accessible anymore. When a new Season begins, players must create fresh new characters in order to participate.\nSeasonal Rewards.\nDuring a Season, player will earn rewards by just playing the game. There are be two types of rewards: &lt;a href=\"Seasonal%20Journey\"&gt;Seasonal Journey&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeasonal Journey.\nThe Season Journey is broken into Chapters with tasks to complete, which range from simple things such as crafting items, clearing cellars and dungeons to defeating specific types of enemies and obtaining certain items. As players progress through the Journey, they\u2019ll earn rewards such as new Legendary Aspects, a Mastery Title, and a &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Amnesia\"&gt;Scroll of Amnesia&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a free &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;Skill Tree&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20Board\"&gt;Paragon Board&lt;/a&gt; reset. The Seasonal Journey also provides \"&lt;a href=\"Favor\"&gt;Favor&lt;/a&gt;\", a resource used to climb through the Battle Pass' Tiers, which is also earned naturally by playing the game, whether it be killing demons, completing Quests, and more.\nBattle Pass.\nThe Battle Pass is divided in three versions: Free, Premium and Accelerated, which all award cosmetics (transmogs, emotes, etc.). The Free version has 27 Tiers, and players can also earn a currency called \"Smoldering Ashes\", which can be spent on Season Blessings, that provide players with a bonus to earning experience, Gold, or Obols, depending on the Blessing chosen. The bonuses gained from Season Blessings will not carry over to the Eternal Realm once the Season is over.\nPlayers who purchase the Premium Battle Pass will have access, in addition to the rewards of the Free Tiers, 63 additional Tiers that grant exclusive cosmetic sets for characters and horses exclusive to that season, as well &lt;a href=\"Platinum\"&gt;Platinum&lt;/a&gt;, the currency used in the Cosmetic Shop. The Accelerated Battle Pass is a variation of the Premium Battle Pass that skips 20 tiers and comes with a special cosmetic. None of the paid Battle Passes will not provide any pay-for-power nor pay-for-boost benefits.\nList of Seasons.\nSeason 1: Malignance.\nSeason 1 launched on Thursday, July 20, 2023, following patch 1.1.0b.

{"id": "51500", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=51500", "title": "Season of Loot Reborn", "text": "Season of Loot Reborn was the name/theme of the fourth of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". It began on May 14, 2024, and ended on August 7, 2024.\nPlot.\nThe legions of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; regroup to coordinate a most formidable display of force through &lt;a href=\"Helltide\"&gt;Helltide&lt;/a&gt;s. Inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Harvest\"&gt;Blood Harvest&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Season of Blood&lt;/a&gt;\", the ferocity of has caught the attention of increasingly dangerous foes. Only the strongest and most well-prepared can survive this potent onslaught. Meanwhile, members of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; have been dying under suspicious circumstances. The Wanderer seeks out the source of the slaughter to earn the Wolves' favor. \nGameplay.\nItemization.\nSeason 4 overhauls many core game systems to refresh how &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; are earned, how they function, and how they improve as players level through &lt;a href=\"World%20Tier\"&gt;World Tier&lt;/a&gt;s during the season. Unlike previous seasonal themes that affect only the &lt;a href=\"Seasonal%20Realm\"&gt;Seasonal Realm&lt;/a&gt;, with Season 4, these itemization changes persist beyond the Seasonal Realm and affect the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Realm\"&gt;Eternal Realm&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nOne of several goals for the itemization changes is to make it easier to understand which items are upgrades when they drop. The number of affixes on items has been reduced (down to 3 on Legendary items, 2 on Rare items), while each affix has been made more effective. Instead of seeing an affix that relies on conditional values (e.g. +10% damage on non-injured Elites), players will see affixes such as base increases to their Movement Speed, Max life, or single ranks of a Core Skill. Dropped items are now simpler to evaluate, and the developers have moved their complexity and customization to new crafting systems, &lt;a href=\"Tempering\"&gt;Tempering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Masterworking\"&gt;Masterworking&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy making items more individually impactful, the developers have decreased the number of items that drop when slaying &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s. The goal here is to spend more time obliterating and less time sorting through the many items that drop. The result is that fewer items will drop overall, but those items will be more likely to be valuable. To compensate and stay on par with the norm, materials gained from salvaging and crafting have been adjusted to match this change. Also, &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Soul\"&gt;Forgotten Soul&lt;/a&gt;s can now be earned from &lt;a href=\"Whisper\"&gt;Whisper&lt;/a&gt; bounties and are a rare drop from all Elites. The &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; cost to re-roll items when Enchanting now has a maximum, and the developers have cut down on the materials needed to perform all activities when at a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, which World Tier the player plays in will directly affect the rarity of the items they earn. Sacred items or higher only drop in World Tier III, and only Ancestral items will appear in World Tier IV. Similarly, Legendary items dropped from enemies over Level 95 will always have a value of 925 Item Power. All Uniques have a chance to drop starting in World Tier III, and Uber Uniques can start appearing once killing monsters that are Level 55 at max Item Power level.\nCodex of Power.\nSalvaging Legendary items stores their powers as Legendary Aspects in the &lt;a href=\"Codex%20of%20Power\"&gt;Codex of Power&lt;/a&gt; to be reused indefinitely. Players can upgrade their Legendary Aspects by salvaging legendary items of higher power value at the blacksmith. Instead of taking up space in their inventory, any legacy Aspect items a player possess will automatically be converted into appropriate upgrades in the Codex of Power when players first log in after Season 4 begins.\nAspects can now be searched, filtered, and favorited within the Codex of Power. When selecting a power for imprinting at an &lt;a href=\"occultist\"&gt;occultist&lt;/a&gt;, an icon and a tooltip will denote which powers the player already has equipped. Note that in the Seasonal Realm, when the Season ends, the player's Codex of Power will be transferred to the Eternal Realm. If a player already has the same Aspect learned in the Eternal Realm, the Codex of Power will keep the higher value of the two.\nHelltide Reborn.\nThe game's &lt;a href=\"Helltide\"&gt;Helltide&lt;/a&gt; system has been changed, and is now available at World Tier I onwards. Overall monster density will shift in accordance with tier.\nAs a player cleaves their way through a Helltide, they now generate Threat. Threat is earned based on the difficulty of the monsters slain and how often a player opens Tortured Gifts within a Helltide. There are three Threat Levels in total, with each level increasing the danger and frequency of ambushes. Once you hit Level 3, a player becomes Hell-Marked.\nWhen a player has been Hell-Marked, they'll be besieged by a frenzy of densely packed monsters. If they make it out alive, a &lt;a href=\"Hellborn\"&gt;Hellborn&lt;/a&gt; will come for them.\n&lt;a href=\"Accursed%20Ritual\"&gt;Accursed Ritual&lt;/a&gt;s have also been added to Helltides, and a new elixir, &lt;a href=\"Profane%20Mindcage\"&gt;Profane Mindcage&lt;/a&gt;, will be available for the season. \nOther.\nAppearing only on Ancestral Legendary and Unique Items, Greater Affixes are 1.5x more powerful versions of normal affixes. Items with Greater Affixes drop with a distinct audio cue, alerting you to their presence, and have a unique icon both in the world and within your inventory. Each affix on an item has a chance to be a Greater Affix in World Tier III and IV. Players cannot Enchant an affix into a Greater Affix\u2014their awesome power may only be discovered.\n&lt;a href=\"Gems\"&gt;Gems&lt;/a&gt; are simpler, streamlined and more effective across your Character\u2019s journey. Crude Gems have been removed, and crafting levels have been shifted back. Normal Gems are available at Level 51, Flawless at 71, and Royal at 91. Diamonds have had their All Resistance values increased. Topaz now provide increases to Intelligence, and Sapphires increases to Willpower. Amethyst increases your Strength, and Emeralds now provide bonus Dexterity.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Artificers\"&gt;Pit of Artificers&lt;/a&gt; has been added, as has the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Andariel\"&gt;Echo of Andariel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Echo\"&gt;Tormented Echo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es.\nReception.\nThe season was well received, and the game experienced a surge in player count, with over 29,000 concurrent Steam players."}

Each Heart has a color type, and can only be socketed into jewelry with Infested Sockets, which can be purchased from a jeweler, or found on drops. There are three different types of color sockets and four different types of Hearts; the fourth Heart type is called a Wrathful Heart, and can fit into any color socket.\nThe player can only start the ritual on the Malignant Heart after obtaining an item called the &lt;a href=\"Cage%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Cage of Binding&lt;/a&gt;, which is given to the player by Cormond.\nThe Season also features a new type of replayable &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20%28Diablo%20IV%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Malignant%20Tunnels\"&gt;Malignant Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, which will be filled with Malignant Monsters. Malignant Tunnels can be accessed in specific portions where the corruption is stronger. Inside Malignant Tunnels, players can hunt down specific colors of Hearts by using Invokers, a new type of item which is crafted from a currency obtained by salvaging Caged Hearts; using the Invoker in an outgrowth, which can be found at the end of the dungeon, will summon a Malignant Monster with the specific color of the Invoker, and will guarantee that the Caged Heart dropped is of the same color as well.\nA new &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; debuts, &lt;a href=\"Varshan%20the%20Consumed\"&gt;Varshan the Consumed&lt;/a&gt;, which is expected to be the final challenge in the Season.\nThis Season's &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; has 90 Tiers, 27 Free Tiers and 63 Premium Tiers.\nThe Season does not have a leaderboard.\nTrivia.\nStatistics.\nBy season's end:"}

According to employees speaking under anonymity, St\u0119pie\u0144's revisions to the script were a source of controversy. In meetings held with St\u0119pie\u0144, employees faced various setbacks, which delayed the story\u2019s development for months, according to five current and former employees. Although St\u0119pie\u0144 had held a creative director title before, his background was more in cinematic directing than in game mechanics, and he approached \"Diablo IV\" from the perspective of taking the entire game and rewriting it himself. In 2019, many Blizzard employees were disgusted by a version of the game's script that repeatedly mentioned the rape of a love interest and referred to this female character as the raped woman as her primary description. St\u0119pie\u0144 had spent months working on this script, penning it in Polish and having a translator change it to English, according to several employees. Employees pleaded with leadership to revise his version of the story, saying rape had no place in a Blizzard game. Many expressed discomfort with the idea of adding rape to the game in what they considered to be an effort to make \"Diablo IV\" feel grittier and tonally darker than the previous game, rather than engaging with the subject in a sensitive way. The \"rape version,\" as multiple employees called the script, was ultimately overhauled in the same year, and the female character was cut from the story. St\u0119pie\u0144 refused to give comment on the issue when asked in 2022."}

The woman warriors attracted many followers, and many was the father that wept as his daughter went to become a Seeker, for he knew that he would most likely never see her again. \nYears of intense training make the Seekers exceptional at swordplay, as they are capable of wielding two weapons at a time.

During the time of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s awakening, he offered his services to heroes as a smuggler/peddler.\nBiography.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nWirt grew up in &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and had a knack for getting into trouble. He also had a knack for shady dealings, ranging from simple sign stealing to setting up connections with guilds outside town. However, his troubles were compounded along with the rest of the townspeople when a darkness settled over King &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, the result of Diablo's corruption. Events reached a head when &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20One%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Fallen Ones&lt;/a&gt; raided the town, kidnapping a number of children. Wirt was among them, torn from the arms of his &lt;a href=\"Canace\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;. Down in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, Wirt and the children were tortured by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt; saved Wirt and returned him to Tristram. &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt; the Healer did what he could for the boy, but while Wirt's life was saved, his left leg wasn't. The events led to a change in Wirt's personality, a darkness hanging over him. His mother died soon after his rescue\u2014from a broken heart, according to &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt;. Griswold offered Wirt a job at his smithy, but Wirt refused\u2014his plans were to make &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, get out of Tristram and hopefully take Gillian with him, whom he had a crush on (not that she was aware of it). Still, in the meantime, he was willing to work as a stable boy in the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun\"&gt;Tavern of the Rising Sun&lt;/a&gt;, being polite to those who needed their horses stabled...and privately accosting adventurers to sell them his stolen merchandise.\nOf Business and Butchery.\nAfter the incident, Wirt became delusional, believing Tristram has no hope for salvation. Given his condition, he has no chance but to stay in town. By striking secretive dealings with urchins and unspoken guilds of nearby towns, Wirt was able to gain access to all sorts of distinct goods that couldn't be found so easily in Tristram. He then starts to slowly build a small fortune from the many adventurers heroes that were drawn to Tristram, hearing news of the evil said to lurk beneath the cathedral. This suited Wirt just fine by selling his goods to them, and planned to use this money to leave town. Eventually, a trio of heroes led by &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;'s son, felled Diablo and an uneasy peace returned to Tristram.\nAfter a period of time, Aidan, who had been corrupted by Diablo after inserting the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; on his head in the hopes of containing the Lord of Terror, suddenly left, and demons descended upon the townsfolk. With no able bodied warriors present, the result was a bloodbath. Wirt was among those killed\u2014the first victim of rampaging &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Bovine\"&gt;Hell Bovine&lt;/a&gt;s. His body was later found by a new group of heroes.\nIn-game.\nDiablo.\nWirt appears as an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;. He does not initiate any quests, but he sells items to the player. However, his method differs from other NPCs in that the player has to pay 50 gold pieces to see what item he's selling, not to mention that Wirt only sells one item at a time. This was the first form of &lt;a href=\"gambling\"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt; in the Diablo franchise, although the mechanics differ from later iterations.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Wirt's corpse lies among the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. His is the only corpse identified by name; with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, the rest of the town's familiar faces are either missing, assumed to be dead from skeletons where they once stood, or &lt;a href=\"Griswold%20%28monster%29\"&gt;worse&lt;/a&gt;. His body contains a lot of gold and &lt;a href=\"Wirt%27s%20Leg\"&gt;his leg&lt;/a&gt;, one of the objects required to open the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;Secret Cow Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Wirt's corpse is clicked his gold doesn't drop to the ground all at once as normal, but individual piles \"rain down\" around his corpse.

The flavor text of each item reads \"Who's Wirt?\"\nPersonality and Traits.\nWhile Wirt was a \"rapscallion and a scoundrel\" before the loss of his leg, the ordeal cast a darkness over his soul. The boy became cold, pragmatic and delusional, believing Tristram was beyond salvation and that the only path was fleeing the cursed town; something he had in plan once he amassed his fortune.\nMost of townsfolk of Tristram were sympathetic to Wirt's condition. &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt; in particular lamented the situation, as he was the one who mended the boy's wounds and attached the wooden peg to his leg; the town healer stated that no one, especially a child, should suffer the way Wirt did. &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt; was the most kind towards the boy, but was also unaware of his feelings for her.\nThe boy's connections and methods to acquire goods of dubious origins were well known among the town. &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt; worried for the boy and hoped he would instead take honest work rather than those shady dealings. &lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt; disapproved Wirt's actions and the company he kept, referring to the merchants and urchins who would come to Tristram, and part of the source of the's boy acquired goods.\nWhen interacting with heroes, Wirt demonstrated a sarcastic, profit-driven mindset\u2014dismissive of his fellow villagers and just as dismissive of the hero's efforts. He focused entirely on himself, and what he could steal. His heart was further darkened by Gillian being blind to his affections."}

All circles of worth, even those that weren't in contact with each other, knew the duty of caution when drawing their power.\nHierarchy.\nBased on comments made by certain witches, it appears that some circles were of higher standing than others (though this could be attributed to arrogance on the witches' part). \nThe Witch Circles appear to have used the following ranks:\nHistory.\nLong ago, the Circles made contact with a group of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s called the &lt;a href=\"Voidwound\"&gt;Voidwound&lt;/a&gt;. The Circles were divided on how to approach these beings; &lt;a href=\"Ophinneb%20the%20Skin-Veiled\"&gt;Ophinneb the Skin-Veiled&lt;/a&gt; made an offer of a stay of one generation, and while the &lt;a href=\"Untameable%20Wilds\"&gt;Untameable Wilds&lt;/a&gt; circle was ready to refuse, the &lt;a href=\"Nightgrant\"&gt;Nightgrant&lt;/a&gt; circle appeased the demons, as they believed the Voidwound had much to teach them. They begged for a stay of three generations; to sit in their lairs and feed. The Voidwound offered the Nightgrant dark blessings in return. \nThe Untameable Wilds circle disrupted the arrangement, as they drove the Nightgrant off, and sealed &lt;a href=\"Catarag%20the%20Strangling%20Sun\"&gt;Catarag the Strangling Sun&lt;/a&gt;. To seal the other demons, the Untameable Wilds circle constructed the &lt;a href=\"Voidwound%20Cage\"&gt;Voidwound Cage&lt;/a&gt;. The Voidwound possessed them, but this was a trap, and the Voidwound were caged to the witches, just as they were caged themselves. They offered the Voidwound a deal; their lives and warmth for their revelry. They contained the Voidwound within their poisoned bodies long enough to reach the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Sea\"&gt;Forgotten Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and sank the cage beneath the waves. The remaining witches of the circle were charged with renewing the cage's wards. \nThe aftermath of the events drew a wedge between the circles; the &lt;a href=\"Waning%20Sentinel\"&gt;Waning Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; circle refused to speak with the Nightgrant in any other fashion than pacts. The Nightgrant was exiled from Sharval, and would be given no shelter. The circles also had to adapt to the arrival of new faiths in &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the construction of cities."}

The Witch Doctor possesses several elements of previous \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" character classes, namely the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nMost believe Witch Doctors to be figments of legend. Indeed, few outlanders have encountered a Witch Doctor in the flesh without losing their own. In truth, the role of a Witch Doctor is a hallowed one in &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; society, though only a few men and women can ascend to the position for they must possess both a history of battle and a talent for communing with spirits. The latter ability belongs solely to those born with the touch of the &lt;a href=\"Unformed%20Land\"&gt;Unformed Land&lt;/a&gt;. The Witch Doctors are finely attuned to this realm and are able to train their minds to perceive this reality through a combination of rituals and the use of selected roots and herbs found in the jungles of their homeland. They call the state in which they interact with this other world the \"&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Trance\"&gt;Ghost Trance&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWitch Doctors frequently wear masks, hiding their identities. Through this, they are said to be an aspect of the spirits of the Unformed Land.\nWhen a person dies, Witch Doctors feel what they suspect is the breath of life leaving their cooling body. And, when calamity or genocide sends hundreds to their graves at once, Witch Doctors can sense their trembling and shrieking from beyond. They cannot avoid hearing this\u2014they must restore the balance between their world and the Unformed Land, or watch the torment of generations past for the rest of their lives...and forever after.\nAbilities.\nWitch Doctors are spiritual warriors who summon dead &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s and crawling creatures to do their bidding. By surrounding themselves with a mix of conjured &lt;a href=\"Gargantuan\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Zombie%20Dogs\"&gt;vermin&lt;/a&gt;, Witch Doctors are free to assault their enemies with exploding skulls, acrid poison clouds, and wasting curses. Through their connection to the Unformed Land, Witch Doctors are able to tap into &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;. Although some Witch Doctors avoid melee combat in favor of augmenting their pets and crippling their enemies from afar, they are also more than capable of slaying weakened foes with their own hands. This includes the use of &lt;a href=\"Mojo%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;mojos&lt;/a&gt; and enchanted &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20Knife\"&gt;ceremonial daggers&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike common knives, these blades are honed towards one purpose \u2013 human sacrifice \u2013 and so they are well-suited to ending lives.\nGameplay.\nThe Witch Doctor is classified as a \"dark class,\" or \"&lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; class.\"\u00a0Their tribal culture reflects the combat capabilities, as most of the skills are grim and outworldly in nature. They draw on &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; for their abilities. Mana regenerates slowly, so Witch Doctors have to choose what abilities to cast with care, resulting in bursts of immense damage. Unlike most of the other classes their main resource, &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt;, increases in maximum capacity at every character level, gradually increasing their ability to unleash a lot of damage at enemies in a quick initial burst before falling back and letting their pets finish the job.\nOn the Hero Creation screen, the following is stated: \"With a wide range of offensive spells to choose from, the Witch Doctor doesn't shrink from the fray. The Witch Doctor utilizes the power of Mana to cast devastating spells.\"\nWitch Doctors have unique equipment:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mojo%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;mojos&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20Knives\"&gt;ceremonial knives&lt;/a&gt;, and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20Mask\"&gt;voodoo masks&lt;/a&gt;.\nWitch Doctors have six class sets in game:\nSkills.\nWitch Doctors mostly rely on &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, with some &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; skills in their arsenal. They are the only class to really benefit from Poison skills.\nThe Witch Doctor's specialized skill sets are categorized as Terror, Decay, and Voodoo. Many of the Witch Doctor's skills bear some resemblance to those of the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. Witch Doctors rely heavily on &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Over%20Time\"&gt;Damage over Time&lt;/a&gt; skills and summoned pets, as well as curses that destroy their opponents' ability to fight back (and humiliate them as well). Pets are a good way to keep engaging enemies without the cost of using &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt;. An advantage of this skill system is that the Mana pool allows the Witch Doctor to use multiple, powerful abilities over a short period before the mana is depleted.\nWitch Doctors are also able to cast debilitating abilities on their enemies, actually being the best class in &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;: they can &lt;a href=\"Hex%20%28Mechanics%29\"&gt;Hex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Confuse\"&gt;Confuse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; enemies in large numbers. Combined with pets who shield their master, a Witch Doctor can kill a horde of enemies without ever casting a damaging spell.\nPopular Witch Doctor skill combinations include:\nDevelopment.\nThe Witch Doctor was, in the words of &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Wilson\"&gt;Jay Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, \"championed by the art team.\" It was also the easiest class to nail visually. \nIt was quickly agreed during development that the Witch Doctor should be quirky, creepy, and a little scary. Feathers, body paint, and painted wood were settled on as the class's base materials. Developing the Witch Doctor's large mask was a turning point in its development, and remained an iconic component of the character design.\nThe Witch Doctor was not designed to be a replacement for the Necromancer. Developers have stated that if there was ever to be a playable Necromancer class for Diablo III, the presence of the Witch Doctor would not prevent them from implementing it. According to Jay Wilson, a key difference between the classes is that the Witch Doctor is more inclined to deal direct damage than the Necromancer, which aside from specific builds, was pet heavy. The desire to distinguish the Witch Doctor from the Necromancer meant that it took awhile to develop the class's abilities. As there was a desire to add the Necromancer post-release, the Witch Doctor's skills were designed to avoid overlap."}

Wizards and Sorcerers both wield the hidden mysteries of the arcane; there, the commonalities end.\nRenegade spellcasters, many Wizards are obsessed with power, and are known for a number of qualities: not only rebelliousness and flair, but also disdain for the endless lessons and prattling about caution and safety that echo from academic schools of magic. Wizards\u2019 superior attitudes seem to stem from their natural talent \u2013 their ability to wrestle the ambient force of magic into submission and direct it to their ends by will and instinct. Any accidents that might occur due to their lack of finesse are unfortunate...but that rarely stops wizards from indulging in their unstable magic power. For Wizards, the risks of magic are irrelevant as long as the reward is great enough.\nAbilities.\nWizards use their bodies as vessels for &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power\"&gt;arcane energy&lt;/a&gt;, forsaking the more careful path favored by other magic users. Because of this use, wizards rarely find themselves without the power of magic. They can nearly always afford to cast their weaker spells thanks to their swiftly-regenerating arcane power, and they invoke certain powers more easily as their experience grows. They are only in danger of depleting their stores of energy when attempting a number of invocations at once. However, arcane energy can ravage wizards\u2019 bodies if its use is not carefully paced.\nWizards manipulate all manner of forces to disintegrate, burn, and freeze their foes, claiming dominion over Sanctuary's natural elements, and they can control time and light to teleport, create powerful illusions, and deflect oncoming attacks. Wizards grip wands and staves to focus their less potent magics, blasting at their enemies while gathering the energy or time necessary to destroy them in a dazzling hail of arcane might. Though all material items serve as channels for a wizard\u2019s immense power, &lt;a href=\"orb\"&gt;orb&lt;/a&gt;s have special uses, in that they provide them with visions and knowledge to aid their spellcasting, or serve as reservoirs of power.\nWith few exceptions, wizard attacks are conducted at a distance, away from danger. As living artillery, wizards are well suited to relying on long-range destructive power. Though not as physically agile or strong as some other heroes, wizards cloak themselves in defensive magics. They can encase their skin in diamonds, create mirror images to befuddle their enemies, and harm or slow those foolish enough to strike at them directly.\nGameplay.\nDiablo Immortal.\nThe Wizard is a playable class in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo III.\nThe Wizard is a playable class in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

It is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; class of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\". With the proper skill combinations the Wizard also has quite extensive &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; abilities while simultaneously still being a heavy damage class.\nWizards have three class-specific item types: &lt;a href=\"Wands\"&gt;Wands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Source\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Hat\"&gt;Wizard Hat&lt;/a&gt;s. They rely on &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; as their primary core stat, and use &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power\"&gt;Arcane Power&lt;/a&gt; as a resource.\u00a0Important Wizard attributes include &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, all &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;, reduced &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s, bonus &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage\"&gt;elemental damage&lt;/a&gt; for skills, &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt; / critical damage, Arcane Power on critical hit, &lt;a href=\"Area%20Damage\"&gt;Area Damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nClever use of some of the Wizard's skills can put significant damage on enemies at a range that other classes can't even begin to target. can be cast almost anywhere within sight, including a far away area several layers below yours which is completely beyond the attack range of any normal skill of any class, and can attack enemies up to a further 60 yards away from it.\nOn the Hero Creation screen, the following is stated: \"The Wizard can inflict, withstand and avoid damage with a vast and formidable array of directed and area spells. The Wizard draws on Arcane Power, a quickly regenerate resource, to cast spells\". \nWizards have six class sets in-game:\nFollowers.\nThe Wizard's damage output is significantly greater than any of the &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt;, unless provided with better gear than the Wizard itself. As such, it is generally redundant to base a Follower around damage output (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Lyndon\"&gt;Lyndon&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent choice as a companion for the Wizard due to his multiple healing abilities, his AoE stun with Charge and his power regeneration with Inspire (if chosen over the also useful Guardian ability) to directly counter the squishy nature of the Wizard.\n&lt;a href=\"Eirena\"&gt;Eirena&lt;/a&gt; is also quite viable due to her multiple crowd-control abilities and her buffs that can boost both the attack and the defense of the Wizard.\nSkills.\nWizards do not have internal healing abilities, but can conjure shields of force or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Skin\"&gt;encase themselves in diamonds&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to &lt;a href=\"absorb\"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nThey also have a very limited ability to enhance their allies, but some of their attacks make enemies more vulnerable to damage, benefitting all members of the group. Almost all Wizard skills are oriented at maximum damage output; even defensive skills may be turned into damage boosters. In a group, Wizards rely heavily on other classes for protection, but when uninterrupted by enemies' counterattacks, can devastate large areas in a blink of an eye.\nMany &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damaging skills are variants or remakes of those of the Sorceress class: barrages of molten fire, deadly storms and freezing icefalls. , , , , and many other skills make their return. The &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt; skill branch is entirely new, focusing on Arcane damage, illusions, uncontrolled energy and temporal manipulations. Only these four damage types are used by Wizards, which makes them highly favor the gear that can increase damage done by specific damage types. Moreover, Wizards are\u00a0\"the only\" class to use Arcane damage for their skills. The pinnacle of the Wizard's mastery over the arcane energy are their &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; form of the star-aligned energy, and cosmic &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hole\"&gt;Black Hole&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMost, if not all of the Wizards' skills can hit more than one enemy at once, making Wizards lethal for hordes of lesser enemies. Many of their skills also become more potent as they are continuously cast against the same target, and many are channeled: while sustained, they grow in power, compensating for the danger of standing in one place. In return, Wizards' &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; capabilities are tied closely to &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage\"&gt;elemental damage&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; effects for &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; skills, &lt;a href=\"Chill\"&gt;Chill&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany defensive abilities of the Wizard grow in power and are released more often if the Wizard is under fire, making the enemies' own attacks help the hero survive.\nPopular Wizard Skill combinations include:\nDevelopment.\nThe Wizard was the second class developed for \"Diablo III\". The term \"Wizard\" was used as a means to \"get out of our [Blizzard's] comfort zone,\" rather than primarily trying to distinguish the class from the Sorceress. Specifically, the developers wanted to do something from the fire/ice/lighting combo of the Sorceress, and making a different class was part of the mental shift. Inspiration was taken from magical abilities from \"Dungeons and Dragons\", hence the existence of abilities such as Disintegrate and Magic Missile. Inspiration was also taken from \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_%28film%29\"&gt;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Wizard went through many artistic concepts before a final version was settled upon.\nThe Wizard made its debut at BlizzCon 2008. Only the female version of the Wizard was playable at Blizzcon 2008 along with both versions of the and &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring BlizzCon 2010, Blizzard stated that the meteor skill of Sorceress would return as a Wizard skill.\nUntil the complete revamp of the skills in patch 2.0, Wizards had skill runes with &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage, as well as &lt;a href=\"Blood\"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt; magic in their arsenal; this was removed to only leave 4 elements under their control."}

Lots of Wizard Hats look like stereotypical witch hats, turbans or exotic headdresses of the East.\nDiablo III.\nIn game, Wizard Hats are treated as normal helms, but in addition to stats typical to helms, they can also roll increased damage for certain Wizard skills, maximum &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Power\"&gt;Arcane Power&lt;/a&gt; and Arcane Power on &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;s.

Gnarled Walkers) are huge &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic plants. They often disguise themselves as other trees, only to ambush and attack unknowing animals or travelers.\nLore.\nGnarled Walkers are creatures which have taken on the guise of foliage to ensnare their prey. They move ponderously, and some are known to exude a foul stench that poisons their victims. Bark harvested from Wood Wraiths contains faint traces of life energies, which make the wood ideal for creating effigies or ritual incense.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20DeSoto\"&gt;Pablo DeSoto&lt;/a&gt;, the Gnarled Walkers are vile mystical creatures from another realm who can only sustain their existence in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; by sapping life energy from &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s or animals. He claimed that the Walkers shifted their appearance to that of trees thereby luring their prey close so as to consume it whole and enrich their reserves of dark power. He claimed that the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for their existence.\nConflicting with this, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Wood Wraiths were once human spirits who were drawn to the peace of nature, unwilling to move on after death. Some even imagined themselves as protectors of their new homes. The Wood Wraiths were apparently corrupted; by carving a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; lord's symbol into their trunk, the Wraith would change almost immediately. A strong hand could bend it to their will.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nGnarled Walkers appear as enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", found at &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bilefen\"&gt;Bilefen&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiablo III.\nGnarled Walkers appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", possessing both demon and animal properties (they count as Beasts for game purposes). They can either attack normally in melee (delivering slow, but powerful bashes with their 'arms') or create up to seven sprouts growing in line.\nThe sprouts cannot be damaged and 'bloom' immediately after player steps on them, or after 6 seconds. Once they open, a cloud of acidic spores is released, dealing very quick ticks of &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage to enemies standing close enough for roughly 4 seconds. There is no limit of how many sprouts can be active per walker. The best tactic to counter these is to run away as soon as the Walker creates his sprouts, especially if there are more enemies in the area.\nOccasionally, Walkers will ambush the player by pretending they are trees (there is no way to see if they are real trees or monsters) and unrooting when enemy comes close enough.\nDue to their sheer size, Walkers are immune to &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;.\nWildwood Bulwark.\nWildwood Bulwarks are a variant of Gnarled Walkers, only appearing on the &lt;a href=\"Greyhollow%20Island\"&gt;Greyhollow Island&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Woods\"&gt;Eternal Woods&lt;/a&gt;. They are of nearly white color, and do not pretend to be trees.\nTheir sprout attack is replaced with creating 3 round marks on the ground for several seconds.

Despite his grim role, he was a friendly person. \nTransformed.\nOne day, he found a &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;red rock&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deepstrider%20Lair\"&gt;tidal cave&lt;/a&gt; beneath his office. Taking it as an ordinary rock, he put it on his bedstand. The next day, he passed it around the mess to see if any of the guards could identify it. A rookie guard reached to grab it for a closer inspection. Next thing, the guard started vomiting seawater, and his body began twisting to a monstrous form. &lt;a href=\"Meris\"&gt;Another guard&lt;/a&gt; had to put the rookie down, using a fire poker.\nLater, Woodruh noticed that his hairs began falling out. Seeing as the transformation was affecting most of the residents, both prisoner and jailor alike, he arranged for the prisoners with lighter crimes who had not started transforming to be moved to &lt;a href=\"the%20Shanties\"&gt;the Shanties&lt;/a&gt;. The hardened criminals who were \"monsters in human skin\" remained locked up.\nWhen it was clear that reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; were not coming, he ordered &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Kenton\"&gt;Commander Kenton&lt;/a&gt; to seal the prison. As he was already changing, he decided to stay in the prison to make sure none of the monsters make it out.\nEven as the changes ravaged his body, he managed to retain parts of his mind, and still made patrols around the prison. One day, he befriended a sea creature he found in the cave. With his mental faculties already warped, he decided to share \"&lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;his Heart&lt;/a&gt;\" with the creature.\nAs a result, the creature started to transform over time, eventually growing into a &lt;a href=\"Deepstrider%20Behemoth\"&gt;behemoth&lt;/a&gt;. One day, it stole the shard and swallowed it. By now Woodruh was a shadow of his former self, and was obsessed with the shard. The despair of losing the shard proved to be the final straw for his mind.\nBound for Eternity.\nTrapped in the prison and with close proximity to the Worldstone, he continued to painfully warp and warp; constantly clawing at himself in pain and despair.

Sought by both &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, it would be used to create &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; before being destroyed as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. And yet for all its importance, few of Sanctuary's inhabitants are aware that it even existed.\nLore.\nPossessing infinite power, the Worldstone had the power to shape entire realities or unmake worlds with but a thought. Anything that came into contact with it, even its shards, was altered. If anything was corrupted by the Worldstone, the condition was impossible to reverse, and its shards by themselves are able to force sudden and violent change to a landscape on a whim. The Worldstone could shape &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Worldstone itself could be damaged only by exceptionally powerful weapons, such as the blade of an &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne could not &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; straight up to the Worldstone\u2014there was apparently a proximity where the process became too dangerous.\nEven fragments of the Worldstone possess immense power. Examples include the &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Fragment of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and according to the beliefs of some, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s. \nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThe Eye of Anu originally lay in the realm of &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;, the scar of the universe's violent birth from the battle between Anu and &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;. It was the foundation of all places and times, a nexus of realities. When the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s were young, &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; was the one who discovered the Eye, and named it the Worldstone, and swore all of Heaven to protect it. \nBoth Heaven and Hell sought control over the Worldstone. Oral history states that whichever side controlled the stone allowed it to alter reality and create life and worlds with barely any restriction. Both angels and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s created worlds that reflected their nature, but all of these worlds were inherently flawed, and were doomed to wither and die. At some point, the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; ordered that a bastion be built around the stone, which would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. The fortress changed hands many times over the course of the Great Conflict, and the possession of the Worldstone alternated in turn. As the conflict dragged on, the Worldstone became 'poisoned' by Heaven and Hell according to Tyrael, due to their desire to control its power, altering its original nature.\nSanctuary and the Sin War.\nOver the course of the Great Conflict, a number of angels and demons had grown tired of the endless war and desired a place away from the conflict. These renegades were led by the angel &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and the demon\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. Either through strength of arms or misdirection, Inarius and his renegades gained access to the Worldstone. Altering its frequency or dimensional alignment, they used its power to conceal it from the angels and demons still fighting in the Eternal Conflict. Subsequently, the Worldstone was shifted into a pocket dimension. There, Inarius and his followers shaped a world around it. A world of refuge they would call &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The forces of Heaven and Hell became aware of the Worldstone's disappearance, but had no idea where it was or who had taken it. \nNotably, when the pair altered the Worldstone, the magic between these two great powers released a clouded veil of magical energy, creating the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt;. This was a ghostly reflection of Sanctuary, which would go on to be shaped by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; beliefs.\nThe Worldstone was initially located on what would become known as &lt;a href=\"Ancients%27%20Cradle\"&gt;Ancients' Cradle&lt;/a&gt; before being moved. Far removed from the squabbles of his former allies and enemies, Inarius shaped &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; as a kind of protective shell around the Worldstone. From there, the rest of the world would be formed.\nThe Worldstone could be used to alter the abilities of certain individuals. Unknown to the renegades, Inarius tied the energies of the Worldstone into himself, enhancing his powers greatly. The Worldstone was further used to inhibit the powers of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the offspring of both angels and demons and with the potential to become greater than both. Over time, as each generation of nephalem became weaker than their predecessors, the race that would be called humanity arose. However, the potential for Man to reclaim his former strength still existed, and during the last days of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, it was potential that began to be reclaimed. Lilith, having long since fallen out with Inarius, cast a spell on the Worldstone that would allow humanity's former power to return.\nEvents began to get out of hand, however. &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;, the first to reclaim his nephalem birthright, came into contact with the Worldstone, changing the pattern of a small part of the artifact from five-sided to six-sided, thus changing its resonance. Unlike Lilith, he had changed the nature of the Worldstone itself, and the nephalem's powers began to return at an even faster rate. And Inarius could not undo the effects that Uldyssian's contact had wrought.\nUldyssian ultimately defeated Inarius and severed his connection with the Worldstone, but lost his own life as well. At the end of the Sin War, the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; agreed that Sanctuary and its inhabitants would be allowed continued existence, though one of the conditions was that humanity be taken 'back to the beginning.' This meant a second loss of their nephalem abilities, per another alteration of the Worldstone.\nWorldstone's End.\nIt is stated that when the world was young, the people of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt; were given a sacred charge of protecting that which lay in the heart of Mount Arreat. These people were called &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Children of Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt;, a moniker that encompassed two distinct groups\u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt;, who remained in the steppes, and the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, who developed their own culture in &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt; but vowed to return to the steppes at &lt;a href=\"Uileloscadh%20Mor\"&gt;Uileloscadh Mor&lt;/a&gt;, the final battle between Heaven and Hell. For the Barbarians, the protection of the Worldstone was the cornerstone of their culture. Consequently, the Barbarians were quick to thwart any incursions into their lands and developed a reputation for savagery in the kingdoms to the south.\nEventually, the moment came. &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Destruction, approached Mount Arreat at the head of a demonic army. His plan was to infuse his soulstone shard with the Worldstone that had spawned it. His shard pulsated with energies of destruction, and, if fused with the Worldstone, humanity would fall prey to the powers of destruction as well. The Barbarians fought to stem the tide, but were driven back to the slopes of Arreat and their last bastion of &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;. Baal's forces laid siege to the fortress while thanks to the treachery of &lt;a href=\"Nihlathak\"&gt;Nihlathak&lt;/a&gt;, Baal was able to claim the &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Relic of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him passage up the slopes of the mountain.\nUltimately, Baal was defeated by a group of heroes that had previously defeated his brothers, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and Mephisto. However, they were too late to prevent him from enacting his plan. Tyrael, coming to aid the heroes one last time, determined that the only recourse available was to destroy the Worldstone. After opening a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; for them, the angel hurtled &lt;a href=\"El%27druin\"&gt;El'druin&lt;/a&gt; into the stone, shattering it.\nLegacy of Destruction.\nThe destruction of the Worldstone had grave consequences. Baal's body and his demonic forces were destroyed, but the surrounding area was devastated. Mount Arreat was left a smouldering crater, and even 20 years later toxic clouds of ash and arcane dust hung over the surrounding area. What was once the Northern Steppes became known as the Dreadlands and the demonic corruption ran rampant, altering both man and beast. The &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Dreadlands\"&gt;Southern Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt; were particularly affected, as shards of the corrupted Worldstone turned the region into a horrifying new environment. Splinterstorms \u2014 horrifying red storms that carried tiny splinters and particles of the destroyed Worldstone\u2014 raged for years after the Worldstone's destruction. When a storm passed through a settlement, it either cut the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;inhabitants&lt;/a&gt; to pieces or transformed them into &lt;a href=\"Shardborne\"&gt;Shardborne&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;Seven years later&lt;/a&gt; the storm, though weakened, had spread to various parts of the western continent. The &lt;a href=\"Untameable%20Wilds\"&gt;Untameable Wilds&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Circle\"&gt;Circle&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Seysild%20the%20Surveyor\"&gt;their surveyor&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve some of the splinters for study.\nThe Barbarians were left scattered. The heart of their culture had been destroyed, and many tribes fell into a state of regression. With the destruction of the Worldstone, the very essence of Sanctuary and every person in the world began to change.\nThe Worldstone's destruction also held grave implications for Sanctuary as a whole. Sanctuary was no longer hidden from the sight of Heaven and Hell, and both angels and demons stared intently at the mortal realm. Furthermore, its dampening effect had prevented armies of demons and angels manifesting \"en masse\", but with that protection gone Sanctuary was open to invasion \nWhile the Worldstone itself was destroyed, multiple shards were scattered across the world by the blast that followed its destruction. The shards carried its corruption with them across Sanctuary; wherever they landed, corruption and death followed. The power of the shards varied, some imbued with the power of Creation, others with the ability to warp reality itself.\nAncient evils emerged, looking to take control of the shards to use them to enslave humanity. One such evil was &lt;a href=\"Skarn\"&gt;Skarn&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to use the shards to reignite the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;. If he could obtain just one shard of the Worldstone, he would be able to remove humanity's angelic essence, leaving only their demonic side.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; also took advantage of the chaos, spreading corruption wherever they trod. &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, who'd conducted a Horadric ritual to ascertain the location of the shards, sought to destroy them. He enlisted the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; in this endeavor. The Wortham shard came into the hands of &lt;a href=\"Eskara\"&gt;Eskara&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to summon Skarn into Sanctuary, but was thwarted by the hero(es) and the shard retrieved. Cain informed them of the existence of the Ashwold shard.\nThe Ashwold shard came into the possession of &lt;a href=\"Lethes\"&gt;Lethes&lt;/a&gt; a rogue &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. She was confronted by the hero(es), and despite using the shard to bolster her own power, she was slain, and the shard taken into their possession. The hero(es) returned to Cain in Westmarch, who had no means of destroying the artifact, but told them of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt; shard, which had come into the possession of &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt;, which she wore around her neck. After the Countess was slain, her Worldstone shard was likewise retrieved.\nThe hero(es) returned to Deckard Cain in Westmarch, where he attempted to conduct a Horadric ritual to destroy them. However, the shards pulsed with corrupting energies (a result of Baal's corruption of the Worldstone five years prior), and the shards not only resisted their destruction, but spawned demons as well. While the demons were destroyed, Baal's corruption had apparently made it impossible to destroy the shards. The shards were later destroyed using &lt;a href=\"Yl%27nira\"&gt;Yl'nira&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother shard landed on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt; and was found by &lt;a href=\"Monks%20of%20Ivgorod\"&gt;Veradani Monks&lt;/a&gt;. It was stored in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctified%20Earth%20Monastery\"&gt;Sanctified Earth Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. By &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, Dravec summoned demons to attack the Sanctified Earth Monastery. In the midst of the chaos, he stole the shard and made his way to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. There, he was able to give Skarn the shard.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;The Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; killed Skarn and retrieved the shard, but by then Skarn had corrupted it and attuned it to himself. When it was destroyed his spirit was released.\nThe largest shard landed in the sea near the shores of &lt;a href=\"Stormpoint\"&gt;Stormpoint&lt;/a&gt;. It was swept into a &lt;a href=\"Deepstrider%20Lair\"&gt;tidal cave&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"the%20Warden%20%28Stormpoint%29\"&gt;Woodruh&lt;/a&gt; found it. From him, it warped all occupants of the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;. Woodruh also exposed the shard to a sea creature that he befriended, causing it to turn into a &lt;a href=\"Deepstrider%20Behemoth\"&gt;behemoth&lt;/a&gt;, which came to reside beneath the Abandoned Prison of Stormpoint.\nThe emergent &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Cult of Terror&lt;/a&gt; invaded the island, summoning hordes of demons to retrieve the shard.\nAt the end, Akinees was able to claim the shard, and delivered it to the Bride of Hell, who would then give it to Diablo. Having claimed the shard, Diablo used its power to speed up his rebirth.\nThe End of Days.\nTwenty years after its destruction, the Worldstone's absence allowed &lt;a href=\"Azmodan\"&gt;Azmodan&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Sin, to summon his army onto the mortal plane in the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt; leading them against &lt;a href=\"Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Yet this was thwarted by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, for without the Worldstone's dampening influence, humanity's inherent power was able to return in at least a select few.\nMonths later, angels were also able to manifest in force under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;, though they too were defeated.\nThe Great Enmity.\nIn order to imprison Lilith, and &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt;, together with &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Donan\"&gt;Donan&lt;/a&gt;, attune a shard to create a soulstone to trap her.\nWith the shard prepared, they follow &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and his army to &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; in order to use the Hell gate located there. Donan reveals the shard, but Inarius takes it. In the chaos of the conflict in Hell, the Wanderer and their allies retrieve the shard. However, when the time comes to use it on Lilith, Neyrelle takes charge of the stone and chooses to imprison Lilith's father &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; instead, having deemed him a far greater threat to Sanctuary.\nThe current location of the stone is uncertain, but Neyrelle is known to be traveling with it.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nThe Worldstone appears in the last part of \"\", however, it is never interacted with directly.\nQuotes.\n&lt;a href=\"Malah\"&gt;Malah&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"QualKehk\"&gt;QualKehk&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Anya\"&gt;Anya&lt;/a&gt;\nDiablo Immortal.\nWorldstone shards or just shards are fragments of the Worldstone that remained after it was shattered by &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;.
