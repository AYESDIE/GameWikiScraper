The goal is to find the lever and open the door to the treasure chamber, which is very close to the entrance. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Will%20of%20Khan%20Dakab\"&gt;The Last Will of Khan Dakab&lt;/a&gt;\" is found in a satchel before the door, revealing that Khan Dakab, afraid of his riches bringing bad luck to his family, sealed the door so that no one ever recovers it.\nThe chest within the chamber does not contain loot. Instead, opening it causes four &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Wraith\"&gt;Grim Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s, including the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Khan%20Dakab\"&gt;Spirit of Khan Dakab&lt;/a&gt;, to manifest and attack. His spirit drops the usual amount of loot for a &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Monster\"&gt;Unique Monster&lt;/a&gt;."}

When read however, the text similarly scrolls up across the screen with voiced narration.\nIn Diablo II tomes are also items which can collect magical scrolls. The two types of tomes, &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Tome of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Identify\"&gt;Tome of Identify&lt;/a&gt;, are designed to hold volumes of similar spells, each tome can store up to 20 scrolls of the same type. Vendors who sell scrolls generally sell tomes as well. Right-click on a tome to cast one of the scrolls stored within it. When a tome is empty, it remains in inventory until it is replenished with more scrolls, sold, dropped, or traded. Add scrolls to a tome in your inventory or Stash by dropping the scroll directly onto the tome. Dropping one tome onto another will consolidate both into a single tome, unless the tome being placed has more scrolls than the other tome has room for.\nDiablo Immortal.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", a single 'mega tome' called the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Bestiary\"&gt;Horadric Bestiary&lt;/a&gt; features. However, there are a few cases of tomes that can be found in the larger world. In most cases, tomes do not exist per se, but rather, pieces of writing (or even illustrations) can be found. The writing is displayed on-screen, then disappears.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", tomes are approached differently and indeed, few actual tomes are found in the game. Rather, in the game, short writings can be found across the game's acts, sometimes encompassing different parts of the same overall writing. These tomes are voiced, but appear in a corner of the screen, allowing the player to keep control of their character while listening to/reading the text. Any discovered manuscripts can be accessed at will.\nDiablo IV.\nTomes return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". They function in a similar manner to \"Diablo III\". Unlike \"Diablo III\" however, tomes are not stored, meaning they cannot be re-read unless the player finds them again in the field. At least in some cases (e.g. s), tomes can be read more than once upon revisiting the area."}

However, upon closer look, they turn out to be twisted, sadistically mutilated and literally bent beyond recognition human bodies, constantly experiencing agonizing pain that drives them to madness.\nDespite their origin, they fall into the Beast monster type (Stygian Crawler subtype counts as Demon). Tormented Stingers usually attack in large numbers, often hiding in the demonic nests or underground. They hit relatively hard in close combat (with both Physical and Poison damage), but are very fragile and easily swept by any area damage attacks.\nLarge numbers of Tormented Stingers are a good source of combat healing with a high Life per Kill statistic. In return, non-elite Stingers award less gold, experience and loot than most normal monsters."}

It estimates the amount of raw damage an enemy must direct at a character to bring them from full &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; to zero HP (i.e. death), and is much larger than the character's actual Life pool due to effects which reduce damage taken. Overall, these effectiveness statistics are designed to give players a quick way to judge the effects of changing items and skills; the percentage change to each of them that would occur is shown whenever a potential new item is hovered on in the &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\nToughness was first shown in the pre- patch &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0.1%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nContributing stats.\nToughness is an approximate characteristic, as not all defensive properties are taken into account. It is based on maximum &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, all &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s and powers, &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Dodge chance&lt;/a&gt;, and some other modifiers. The resistances are averaged, and not all attacks may be dodged, so actual Toughness varies based on the attack being faced. Some modifiers are not included in the displayed Toughness value at all, such as reduced damage from &lt;a href=\"elites\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt; or the guaranteed 30% damage reduction that the &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; classes possess.\n&lt;a href=\"Recovery\"&gt;Recovery&lt;/a&gt; is measured in Toughness units/Effective HP per second. Individual stats may affect them differently:\nWhile damage reduction is positive for both aspects, the key idea is that it's multiplicative with total Life, so Toughness suffers increasingly severely without enough Life. Overall, a balance of stats is required for success, with Life, reduced damage taken, and regeneration all supporting each other.\nImpact.\nVery low Recovery relative to Toughness may require frequent use of &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potions\"&gt;Healing Potions&lt;/a&gt; or even trips back to town to recuperate from fights, while very low Toughness relative to Recovery leads to dangerous rapid swings between low and high health during combat. Very low &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; output compared to the defensive stats leads to long fights and slow progress, while very low Toughness leads to \"glass cannon\" gameplay with a high risk of sudden death. The \"required toughness\" for any fight varies widely by the player's game style, build, and personal preferences.\nIn the endgame, using multiple percentage-based &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; powers is an especially effective way to increase Toughness. They apply multiplicatively with each other and do not suffer from the diminishing returns that would be encountered by stacking even more Armor or Resistance."}

This gives the weapon huge elemental damage of various types on top of its very significant physical damage as a good method of dealing with physically immune monsters. &lt;a href=\"Jalal%27s%20Mane\"&gt;Jalal's Mane&lt;/a&gt; is an obvious choice for headgear.\nHireling.\nAn Act II melee hireling, particularly the Nightmare offensive hireling, fits well with the melee enhancers, such as &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Wolverine\"&gt;Heart of Wolverine&lt;/a&gt;.\nTactics.\nThe general idea is straightforward melee with the Dire Wolves as additional damage, bolstered by the spirit and mercenary aura. Maul is the primary melee attack with &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt; as an occasional \"refill\" of both mana and health or used when incoming damage is very significant to maintain as a tank. &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Wave\"&gt;Shock Wave&lt;/a&gt; can be used, especially in large minion packs, to keep monster damage down until they can be dispatched.\nAgainst bosses, the tougher single grizzly stands up better to the heavy elemental damage than the trio of wolves.\nPrior to the IK maul, the weapon should be the hardest hitting to synergize with Maul and Hunger. PIs can be ignored or can potentially be taken down slowly via weapon upgrades or the 1-point &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Claws\"&gt;Fire Claws&lt;/a&gt; skill with +skill mods.\nReferences.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//diablo.incgamers.com/forums/showthread.php%3Ft%3D590115%26amp%3Bhighlight%3Dguide\"&gt;The original Town Dump Werebear post by Safetypro&lt;/a&gt;"}
{"id": "2582", "revid": "30295195", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2582", "title": "Town Portal", "text": "A Town Portal is a &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; independent &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; which opens a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; to the character's spawn location. You can walk through the Town Portal by clicking on it. Doing so teleports you to the &lt;a href=\"Towns\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; that is related to your current &lt;a href=\"Acts\"&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;. In the town there is also a town portal. Through that portal you can go back to the place where you cast the same Town Portal. The portals will then disappear once the player goes through them from the town, unless that portal was opened through a Portal shrine in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". However, if player manages to go around and approach the portal from the original side, they can use it to get to town again: the portal only closes when it is used to get from town elsewhere.\nDiablo I.\nTown Portal is a spell in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThis spell can be cast from a &lt;a href=\"scroll\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Staff\"&gt;Staff&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the actual spell (in that case, it does not even have &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Attribute%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; requirements). The Spell Level only lowers Mana cost to a certain limit.\nTown Portals remain open indefinitely, until the character who cast it uses it to return to the dungeon from town. If two or more players cast town portals, they can keep them open forever by only returning via the portal cast by the other player. Each character can have only one active Town Portal, and if a second is cast, the first will vanish (but in town, multiple portals from multiple players can exist).\nAn open Town Portal also increase the light radius in the dungeon.\nIn \"Hellfire\", there are also portal .\nLore.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; constructed numerous magical gateways between the mighty fortresses so that they could quickly concentrate their defenses against any incursion by the &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s. With but a thought, the Crusaders of the Light could transport themselves to predetermined destinations many leagues apart. Although the secret of creating these gateways has been long lost, it is still possible to use the pathways that are already in place. A Portal opened by means of this spell will always take the caster to the location of the nearest gate and remain open long enough to bring the caster back to his point of origin. The Church of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt; is built upon the remains of a Horadrim monastery, and it is quite probable that a gateway lies nearby.\"\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", Town Portals still work in (roughly) the same way. However, this time, they are not created by a separate spell. Instead, &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Scroll of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; items can be bought and stored into &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Town%20Portal\"&gt;Tome of Town Portal&lt;/a&gt; books. One Tome can hold up to 20 scrolls. This is an easy way to store Town Portals without losing too much &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; space.\nWhen going through large areas between Waypoints, It is a good idea to open up a Town Portal as a quick escape route. You can use it to retreat from danger or to get back to your body much more quickly if you die. &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; can easily kill a player relying on this tactic, though, as he has the ability to &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Prison%20%28monster%20skill%29\"&gt;encase the opened portal in bones&lt;/a&gt;, preventing it from being used.\nAlso, in the wilderness, players may encounter Portal &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Shrines&lt;/a&gt;. These shrines give players the \"freedom to go home...\", opening a Town Portal that lasts twice as long as regular Town Portals. The players can use these shrine portals as many times as they want. If the player casts another Town Portal from a scroll, a second, normal blue portal will be created. But, if the player activates another Portal Shrine, the original shrine portal will be replaced by the new one.\nRestrictions on Town Portal usage.\nYou cannot enter Town Portals cast by other players in areas beyond the \"blocking quests\" without having completed those quests, for example:\n\"NOTE: A player who kills the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council\"&gt;High Council&lt;/a&gt; (but doesn't use &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Will\"&gt;Khalim's Will&lt;/a&gt; to smash the &lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Orb\"&gt;Compelling Orb&lt;/a&gt;) may take a Town Portal into the Durance of Hate.\"\nThis is to prevent higher level players from helping lower level players to advance further in the game without working for it. If a player is unable to enter a portal, this means they need to complete a quest.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"Diablo III\", Town Portal has once again been altered. It now occupies a permanent place in the user interface and can, rather than using up mana or scrolls, be triggered at any time once it has been acquired. Unlike its previous appearances, Town Portal now takes several seconds to cast properly (a blue progress bar will appear above the player's head during casting). A successful attack from a monster will interrupt casting and force the player to remain in the area until they try again. Using a pair of &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Pads\"&gt;Homing Pads&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will allow &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; to continue channeling the portal, even through taking damage, but status ailments like &lt;a href=\"Frozen\"&gt;Frozen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; can still interrupt the Town Portal. Rather than creating a portal and allowing players to enter it, the spell will teleport the player to town, opening a portal that can be used to get back.\nTown Portal may not be used in instanced boss fights. Once players enter the boss zone, there is no turning back until one side dies in the ensuing battle.\nTown Portal is acquired by all characters after retrieving &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Crown\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Normal%20Difficulty\"&gt;Normal Difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. Although it does not have to be re-acquired on higher difficulties, it must be acquired separately for all characters. The default key for activating it is T.\nDiablo IV.\nTown Portals return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

The One Who is Forever, among other translations of the name) is an ancient and mysterious dragon-like being who guards &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and maintains the &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;, intent on keeping Sanctuary free from &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic influences. His fate is tied to that of Sanctuary.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; use a five-sided pattern to represent Trag'Oul, the five points each holding a symbol representing one of the five elements they believe Trag'Oul to be linked to\u2014earth, air, fire, water, and time. As the fulcrum of the Balance, they believe that the elements of Creation are tied to him.\nBiography.\nEmergence.\nTrag'Oul was born through the creation of Sanctuary itself, and as such, is tied to the mortal realm's existence. Trag'Oul was the first being to understand the &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrag'Oul entered Sanctuary for the first time just after &lt;a href=\"the%20Purge\"&gt;the Purge&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;'s subsequent reactions. The dragon materialized for just a few seconds, long enough to lay the groundwork for &lt;a href=\"Linarian\"&gt;Linarian&lt;/a&gt;'s discovery of him. \nThe Student.\nLong after the Purge (at least centuries), Trag'Oul, with some hesitation, took on Linarian as a student. He taught Linarian the concept of the Balance\u2014the delicate interplay between the powers of order and chaos. Linarian eventually changed his name to \"Rathma\" (a name given to him by &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt;) which meant \"Keeper of the Balance,\" representing both his identity and his charge. Rathma proved himself an able student, and through Trag'Oul, received wisdom that angels and demons lacked. He began working to keep Sanctuary hidden from the High Heavens and limit the influence of the Burning Hells there. Rathma served Trag'Oul for centuries, and in doing so, kept the Balance within Sanctuary.\nThe Sin War.\nTrag'Oul tutored &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. He believed that war on Sanctuary could devour all of existence if left unchecked. After learning of a pact between &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, he tried to intervene, but was stopped by his fellow guardians that kept guard over worlds of their own. They warned him that interference would risk all Creation. Fortunately, the Sin War ended, and Sanctuary was spared destruction.\nAftermath.\nHaving founded the Priests of Rathma and set the Necromancers on their path, Trag'Oul vanished. He has not been seen since. The implications are dire, but the Priests of Rathma have not lost faith.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", the Necromancer set, &lt;a href=\"Trang-Oul%27s%20Avatar\"&gt;Trang-Oul's Avatar&lt;/a&gt;, is the first mention of the dragon. Certain spells (&lt;a href=\"Bone%20Spear\"&gt;Bone Spear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teeth\"&gt;Teeth&lt;/a&gt;) draw upon his power.\nDiablo III.\nTrag'Oul has no presence in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" nor its &lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;. However, there is an item named &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul%20Coils\"&gt;Trag'Oul Coils&lt;/a&gt; which are legendary bracers.\nWith the introduction of the class, more items appeared: the legendary scythe, &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul%27s%20Corroded%20Fang\"&gt;Trag'Oul's Corroded Fang&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul%27s%20Avatar\"&gt;Trag'Oul's Avatar&lt;/a&gt; set.\nDiablo IV.\nDuring the Wanderer, Lorath and Neyrelle's pursuit of Elias and how to eliminate his immortality, they travelled to Hawezar where, in the depths of the swamps, they undertook a ritual to guide them to the Tree of Whispers. Under the influence of incense they could see a gigantic serpent leading them through the swamp, and in whose scales they could glimpse the future. Lorath later suggests this serpent to be the one mentioned in Rathma's prophecy, who is believed to be Trag'Oul.\nPersonality and Traits.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Books%20of%20Kalan\"&gt;Books of Kalan&lt;/a&gt;\" describe Trag'Oul as a celestial dragon whose body resembles a constellation of stars. In each of these stars, a different part of life is shown\u2014past, present, and future choices to be made, so one cannot see a definite future. The &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; believe that it is on Trag'Oul's back that the world lies, and is the closest thing the cult has to a deity. It is from Trag'Oul that Necromancers draw their power. It has also been suggested that he is a manifestation of the past, present, and future of humanity."}

All six are required to complete the set, and all six are Necromancer-restricted.\nSet Bonus:\nThe first effect combines effects of all runes to the point where Blood Rush no longer costs Life, but still gets an additional charge. Moreover, despite spending no Life, it is still affected by the two other bonuses.\nThe second effect duration is refreshed every time it is applied at full Life, however, this extra Life does not change the Life cost of Blood spells (in relative values): their cost is still a percentage of the new maximum Life. It is therefore possible to use this extra Life to safely cast Blood spells. If this effect fades and any excessive Life remains, the Necromancer is simply returned to 100% Life, otherwise the same (absolute value) of Life as before fading. A buff is displayed on the panel to indicate the percentage of additional Life gained.\nThe third bonus multiplicatively boosts all skills that cost Life, including the Blood skill rune variants (prior to 2.6.1, it would also double all Life costs). It also doubles all healing from skills (including indirect sources such as minions and passives). Note that &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, although it is technically a Life-spending ability, will only deal increased damage with basic attacks and Blood spells (i.e. those that would be empowered if used by the Necromancer).\nVisually, the &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul%27s%20Corroded%20Fang\"&gt;Trag'Oul's Corroded Fang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul%27s%20Wings\"&gt;Trag'Oul's Wings&lt;/a&gt; complement this set."}

Traits were passive skills that allow character customization and diversifying builds. They altered core character attributes and, to some extent, even mechanics of the class. They were replaced with Passive Skills before the game was released.\nOverview.\nTraits were mostly unique to character classes, with some overlap. They were designed specifically to replace the statistics from \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", as this system has become outdated and didn't allow genuine character customization. Since active skills and passive skills (traits) have now been completely separated, players no longer need to feel like they are 'sacrificing' points in order to get permanent benefits and not spectacular skills and abilities.\nTraits let players diversify their builds and create characters they want. For example, if a player wished to play a strong and tough , they could choose traits like Legendary Might (increases Strength) or Iron Skin (increases Armor). Alternatively, if a player wanted to build a more damage-oriented Berserker Barbarian, they could choose traits that increase attack rate or power of debuffs on their enemies.\nTraits were gained every other level. Every class had roughly 30 traits, where player could spend between 1-5 points in them.\nExamples of Traits.\nBall of Lightening (&lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;)\nA shocking defense will make enemies ponder the wisdom of their assault.\nRank 0/1\nPeriodically shocks a nearby enemy for 1-120 electrical damage.\nInner Rage ()\n\"While most orders teach the merits of calming the seas of the soul, the guardians of Arreat have embraced the raging inner storm.\" - Chronicler Ravgres\nRank 0/5\nReduces the rate of Fury lost and increases Fury gained for hitting the same target.\nPrismatic Cloak (&lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;)\nAn icy mist that freezes to the bone, the low hum and spark of electricity in the air\u2026 even touching a Wizard can have dire consequences.\nRank 0/3\nIncreases the effects of Ice Armor and Storm Armor by 100%."}

Using this skill will initiate a &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; check, and two things can happen in result:\nChance to Disarm:\nThis skill cannot be used to disarm wall traps and &lt;a href=\"barrel\"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMuch like the other class skills, it is rather useless, especially since traps are rather rare and don't deal a whole lot of damage. The skill will always work once the Rogue gets at least 90 Dexterity.\nDisarm Trap is not learnable by &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s and does not reappear in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;\"Diablo II\"&lt;/a&gt; for game balancing reasons.\nLore.\n\"The innate sixth sense that all Rogues seem to possess also allows them to sense trapped fixtures, and aids them in attempts to disarm these traps.\""}

They can be freed with a few shots or a swing of the player's sword.\nTrapped Souls can deal damage to characters or minions who happen to stand in their range, but they are largely harmless. They cannot drop items, and are usually noticed only when all summoned creatures and mercenaries run off to kill them when you would prefer your minions stay put and fight against the monsters that pose a real threat. The &lt;a href=\"Zookeeper\"&gt;Zookeeper&lt;/a&gt; build has an especially tough time controlling his minions in difficulty in the presence of Trapped Souls.\nContainers.\nThe second type of Trapped Soul is a &lt;a href=\"Containers\"&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;. These souls are chained down on the ground where they can do no more than wobble in their torment. Striking them may free them from their agony and reward you with treasure.\nWhile unlike the former versions, these Trapped Souls do not have a life bar, they may still require more than one kick before they are freed.\nTrapped Souls are not rigged with any of the usual &lt;a href=\"traps\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;, but some may expel jets of fire before collapsing. Standing too close will result in damage.\nAs these Trapped Souls are containers, minions will not actively hunt them down."}

On most occasions a creaky sound can be heard before the trap springs. The trap also often fires after a short delay. Traps have appeared since \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", were carried over to \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and have been modified in functionality in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Some traps harm players only, while others can be used to damage enemies as well.\nDiablo I.\nIn Diablo, any interactable object (door or container of any kind) can turn out to be rigged. Upon touching it, a distinctive sound is heard, and the trap springs. Usually it releases an arrow from the wall, but can also release a random damaging spell (up to, and including, ). Non-missile spells are released from the object itself.\nIn a manner of speaking, &lt;a href=\"barrel\"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt;s can be traps too, for they may explode when touched, or summon a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; can see the traps (name of an object turns red) and disarm them with her special &lt;a href=\"Trap%20Disarm\"&gt;Trap Disarm Skill&lt;/a&gt;. Other classes may buy items that halve damage of traps, although effects of several such items do not stack. Alternatively, one may just try to outrun the bolt... or simply survive through the damage.\nDiablo II.\nIn \"Diablo II\", one of the following things could happen:\nApart from 'normal' traps, some special areas are also trapped:\nDiablo III.\nNeither\u00a0\u00a0nor &lt;a href=\"containers\"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt; trigger traps\u00a0in\u00a0\"Diablo III\"\u00a0like they did in previous games. Of all the potential dangers to be considered a 'trap', the following environmental objects are the most likely to be considered as such:\nOne can (and should) lure enemies to these traps: nearly all traps are affected by friendly fire as well; if a &lt;a href=\"Goatman\"&gt;Goatman&lt;/a&gt; were to try to cross the path of a falling tree log, but it hits the demon, it would suffer Physical damage. A , life permitting, can also intentionally try to set a trap off; if he/she suffers damage from the trap, &lt;a href=\"Fury\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt; can be generated. &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Chests\"&gt;Cursed Chests&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Shrines\"&gt;Cursed Shrines&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will trigger events, but this is expected from these objects, and should not be called \"traps\"."}

To supplement her array of tools and abilities, the Assassin has access to an ingenious group of devices. These mechanisms, engineered by &lt;a href=\"Viz-Jaq%27taar\"&gt;Viz-Jaq'taar&lt;/a&gt;i sages, have been perfected over many years of use. They range from simple thrown missiles and bombs to more complex proximity-triggered sentries.\nTraps are a very unique and innovative set of skills; they can be placed anywhere and will activate when the enemy approaches. They compliment the Assassin's stealth abilities and her ability to lure enemies into areas where her traps exist. Traps are a very powerful set of skills, and are not to be taken lightly. When used judiciously, they can make the difference between victory and defeat--and are quite fun to use too.\nUsage Notes.\nThere is a limit of 5 Traps.\nTraps are very effective in Normal and later on into &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Players traveling to &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; might find traps start to become less effective at higher acts due to monster resistances and Life. Traps are, however, easy to use and there is not much risk of harm which balances this out. Traps can be used at higher difficulty levels for additional help and the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Sentry\"&gt;Death Sentry&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt; ability can be great anywhere.\nIf players hide behind corners, pillars and the like where monsters can't see/attack them, they can lay traps in specific spots so that the traps can shoot the helpless monsters.\nCertain items will allow a player to lower an enemy's &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt; and/or heighten elemental damage. These items will not function with most traps as some traps are minions of the character and the damage is not generated directly from the character in question. That means that they are not affected by items that give +%lightning/fire damage or -% lightning/fire.\nAll three blade skills (&lt;a href=\"Blade%20Sentinel\"&gt;Blade Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Fury\"&gt;Blade Fury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Shield\"&gt;Blade Shield&lt;/a&gt;) receive an additional 50% penalty to the \"weapon\" portion of the damage while wearing 2 handed weapons. So equipping a thunder maul would make blade fury add only 3/8 of your 'normal attack' damage instead of 3/4, and would make blade sentinel do 3/16 instead of 3/8, and blade shield do 1/8 instead of 1/4."}

It contained the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt;, from which the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; ruled. The city fell into ruin due to &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption.\nLore.\nTravincal was surrounded by walls. It was linked to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; via a causeway.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; sealed Mephisto in a &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, the order gave it to the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping. At this time, Zakarum was a small and humble order. &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt; had an affinity with the monks and believed they were the only ones who could be trusted with guarding the soulstone. As the Horadrim continued their hunt for the other &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, the Zakarum set about building a temple within the dense jungles near &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;, where Mephisto's soulstone would be stored. Construction began in the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231017\"&gt;1017&lt;/a&gt;. The undertaking brought about interest in the order and Zakarum teachings. In a matter of months, throngs of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;'s downtrodden masses flocked to the temple to lend their aid. Construction was finished in less than a year, and what began as a small temple grew into Travincal, the Temple City. The Zakarum faith grew, and Travincal was held as the faith's holiest site, and by the 13th century, was the most heavily guarded site in all of Kehjistan. \nHowever, over the centuries, Mephisto was able to corrupt the Zakarum faith. Corrupt priests captured and sacrificed anyone who passed by the city. By the time the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wanderer\"&gt;Dark Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Travincal, many of the greatest Zakarum &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and their commanders fell to corruption. Not all had fallen so, but as Diablo approached, many of the temple's defenders fell prey to overwhelming fear and fled the complex altogether. Additional reports suggest that many turned against each other, thinning out their ranks even further. Thus, the Lords of Terror and Destruction passed through Travincal to unite with their brother, Mephisto.\nA &lt;a href=\"classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; who had pursued Diablo since &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the city later. Fighting their way into Travincal, they had to contend with not only demons, but corrupted zealots and the High Council members themselves. In this, they succeeded, and gained access to the temple in which Mephisto dwelt. \nCurrently, Travincal lies abandoned. The city was visited by &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt;, who encountered an &lt;a href=\"Archivist\"&gt;Archivist&lt;/a&gt; in one of its ruined temples.\nVessel of Hatred.\nIn her search for &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Light\"&gt;Akarat's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neyrelle\"&gt;Neyrelle&lt;/a&gt; visited Travincal. The lingering darkness in the city reacted to Mephisto's soulstone, spreading black rot and &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually the city was walled off.\nIn game.\nDiablo II.\nTravincal acts as a zone in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" It is of constant design, meaning it is one of the few areas in the game not randomly generated. It is usually considered a very dangerous area due to the presence of many strong monsters, including the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique%20Monsters\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Council%20Member\"&gt;Council Member&lt;/a&gt;s that comprise the High Council. There's a &lt;a href=\"waypoint\"&gt;waypoint&lt;/a&gt; hidden in the northern section of the city.\nDiablo IV.\nTravincal will be explorable in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" in the expansion \"&lt;a href=\"Vessel%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Vessel of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\".

Mischievous scavengers, they have a hunched posture due to the weight of the treasures they carry over their backs, and possess grayish bodies and lizard-like heads. As quickly as they enter &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, they depart, disappearing into portals with their goods in tow. Old stories refer to these creatures as the \"Drunkard's Faerie,\" as intoxicated individuals often see a small creature carrying a bag of gold out of the corner of their eye. A guarded species, if observed during one of their hunts, Treasure Goblins will retreat through these portals, utilizing a type of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; not unlike that of the kind the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; employed to summon &lt;a href=\"Town%20Portal\"&gt;Town Portal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;Waypoint&lt;/a&gt;s. This was done at the will of &lt;a href=\"Greed\"&gt;Greed&lt;/a&gt;, a demon that Treasure Goblins serve. She aimed to lure greedy adventurers into her &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; to their doom in a sea of riches they would never spend. \nHistory.\nTreasure Goblins are a more recent addition to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s bestiary. They gained a place in &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; folklore, and some scholars theorized they were an indigenous species of goblins. Before the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; discovered the true nature of the Goblins, and how they served Greed, but apparently never shared her findings beyond the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, to best knowledge, no mortal had ever followed a Treasure Goblin through its portal.\nSightings of them increased shortly after the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Fallen Star&lt;/a&gt;. Little is known of the Goblins by Sanctuary's inhabitants bar the fact that they are not native to the mortal realm. After the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Bastion%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Siege of Bastion's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, tales of Treasure Goblins scurrying about &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;'s battlefields have riddled Sanctuary\u2019s taverns. At first believed to be frenzied grave robbers, the Goblins' true nature became known only once they were witnessed in broad daylight. Now, their appearance is recognizable to all but the most cloistered of citizens, and prove a welcome sight to powerful &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; in search of easy loot. As their presence has become more common, so have rumors of their gold-filled \"vault.\" It is said that beyond a goblin's portal untold riches await, as well as untold horrors. In this, there was some truth, though Greed was killed by &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nDiablo Immortal.\nTreasure Goblins can be found in all wilderness zones in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". They don't attack, and always try to move to a safe location, dropping a trail of gold in their path. At a safe distance, they conjure a portal to escape. Attacking the Goblin disrupts their portal channeling. Killing them gives the player a lot of gold, some equipment and rarely, some gems.\nSome modifiers to &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rift\"&gt;Elder Rift&lt;/a&gt;s cause Treasure Goblin(s) to spawn inside. The random \"Warp to Final Boss\" modifier in &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s causes Treasure Goblins to spawn while the empowered boss is being killed. In &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Plane\"&gt;Fractured Plane&lt;/a&gt;, rooms have a random chance of being Treasure Goblin rooms, which are filled with lots of Treasure Goblins that drop Chaos Coins when killed. During a &lt;a href=\"Survivor%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Survivor's Bane&lt;/a&gt; match, a Treasure Goblin appears once, and drops an Equipment Upgrade when killed.\nDiablo III.\nTreasure Goblins are found throughout \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Five types of Treasure Goblin exist, each identified by color; the blue Treasure Pygmy, the green Treasure Goblin, the red Treasure Seeker, the Treasure Bandit, and the Rainbow Goblin. As of Patch 2.0., there is no difference between their loot tables. The unique Treasure Goblin (found in &lt;a href=\"The%20Unknown%20Depths\"&gt;The Unknown Depths&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and other zones) is no different from them as well. A special breed of Goblins called Treasure Fiends can be found in the Treasure Realm, often hiding in the gold piles.\nTreasure Goblins cannot attack the player, and remain idle until attacked. Upon taking hit, they stagger for a moment (suffering reduced damage for a few seconds, so it is impossible to kill them before they start running) and then flee with great speed away from the player, running towards other monsters if possible. As they take damage, they will drop gold, leaving a trail of coins to be traced easily. Killing them will spill their entire loot onto the floor, which typically includes &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, extra &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20material\"&gt;crafting materials&lt;/a&gt;, as well as magical and sometimes rare armor and weapons, with a chance for a legendary.\u00a0\nFrom time to time, Goblins stop and start opening the portal. If not struck in 6 seconds, they escape, leaving no loot and awarding no credit for the kill. This can be interrupted (to set them fleeing again), Since patch 2.1.1 goblins Flee with a speed boost for about 2 seconds and with increased speed after the portal is interrupted the goblin gets faster the more times you interrupt the portal. &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;down, &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;, and other similar &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; tools have no effect on Treasure Goblins at all, but &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; effects can be useful. Otherwise, only direct damage will suffice. &lt;a href=\"Followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; do not attack idle Goblins until those are within 10 yards.\nThere is a very small chance to encounter a Goblinfest in &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s. The Fest consists of 10-30 Treasure Goblins in one location, resting together. It may be a very good opportunity to obtain a huge portion of loot, provided player manages to kill them all in time.\nGoblins cannot harm the player in any way. However, they will try to run into other enemies, who will make it significantly harder to chase the greedy mocking packrat.\nNote that all Treasure Goblins, regardless of type, count as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"elites\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of Patch 2.1, there is a very small chance that Treasure Goblin slain in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; will leave an opened portal to the Treasure Realm, which the players can use. Treasure Goblins in Rifts and Campaign cannot open this portal. See main article for details. As of patch 2.6.5, there is also a chance for this portal to lead to &lt;a href=\"Not%20the%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;somewhere udderly ridiculous&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of Patch 2.1.1, Goblins appear with a small minimap icon and show a portal \"before\" they are engaged. This is not a bug, but a trait designed to let players detect them easily. In patch 2.1.2, the icon was replaced with an actual image of the goblin on the map, which is really hard to miss.\n&lt;a href=\"Puzzle%20Ring\"&gt;Puzzle Ring&lt;/a&gt;s can summon Treasure Goblin &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; to exchange a player's white (common) loot for rares.\nAs of patch 2.3, Bandit spawn (very rarely) in game world. Activating a Bandit Shrine will summon 10-15 Treasure Goblins of random types.\nVariants.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt;, special variants of Goblins can be encountered, distinguished by their color, that drop special rewards, amount increasing with &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nThe Treasure Goblin was a late addition to Diablo III's monster roster. When the sound team was presented with the creature's, there was some trepidation in the need to tackle \"yet another bi-pedal monster.\" Its grin (as depicted in said artwork) was seen as a defining feature. In the recording studio, a series of of laughs, guttural giggles, and playful exclamations were made by &lt;a href=\"Seph%20Lawrence\"&gt;Seph Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;. These became the basis for the creature's sound design, after which &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Johnson\"&gt;Michael Johnson&lt;/a&gt; raised the pitch.\nDiablo IV.\nTreasure Goblins return in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". They function similarly to their predecessors, but lack the many variations found in \"Diablo III\". They can even cross zones as they flee from the player. If a player &lt;a href=\"mounts\"&gt;mounts&lt;/a&gt; while chasing a Treasure Goblin, it'll stop and become immune to all damage, and proceed to escape through their portal.\nWhen a Treasure Goblin is killed, they drop 1-3 &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary Items&lt;/a&gt;, and 2-6 &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Items\"&gt;Rare Items&lt;/a&gt;. The higher the number of Legendary drops, the lower the number of Rare drops, and vice versa. For example, if 2 Legendary Items drop, then 4 Rares will drop. Treasure Goblins also drop 1-2 &lt;a href=\"elixir\"&gt;elixir&lt;/a&gt;s, and are guaranteed to drop ore, herbs, leather, and gem fragments.\nTreasure Goblins also drop gold which increases by &lt;a href=\"World%20Tier\"&gt;World Tier&lt;/a&gt; and character level. In World Tiers III/IV, Treasure Goblins drop Forgotten Souls, and have a 10/20/30% chance to drop 1-2 &lt;a href=\"Scattered%20Prism\"&gt;Scattered Prism&lt;/a&gt;s in World Tiers I and II/World Tier III/World Tier IV respectively.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nA \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" Treasure Goblin &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowpedia.org/Treasure_Goblin\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; exists, awarded to players who also purchased the Collector's Edition of \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn \"World of Warcraft: Legion\", the Treasure Demon was introduced which functions identically to Treasure Goblins (giving a reward if players kill them before their casting of an escape portal is complete).\nDuring the 20th Diablo anniversary in \"World of Warcraft\" one could kill a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Treasure_Goblin_%28mob%29\"&gt;Treasure Goblin&lt;/a&gt; to get access to a \"Warcraft\" variant of &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;The Secret Cow Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom May 25-June 14, 2023, Treasure Goblins will appear across capital cities and \"Dragonflight\" zones in \"World of Warcraft\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/A_Greedy_Emissary\"&gt;A Greedy Emissary&lt;/a&gt; event. Similar to their \"Diablo\" counterparts, killing these goblins will grant players loot.\nOther.\nTreasure Goblins appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; \"for a limited time, where they could be killed for extra gold.\nA &lt;a href=\"https%3A//starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Treasure_goblin\"&gt;treasure goblin&lt;/a&gt; can be spotted in the mission \"Into the Void\" in \"StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void\".\nA Treasure Goblin prop for Xbox Live can be purchased for $5. It is referred to as the \"king of bling.\""}

The &lt;a href=\"Western%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Western Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; are well known for their rich woodlands, a result of the area\u2019s nutrient laden soil, pleasant rainfall, and mild climate. From the massive pine and spruce, to the supple yew and ash, these woodlands are unequaled anywhere in Sanctuary. These abundant, fine-grained woods are forested for housing, farming tools, and weapons of warfare. The &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; are renowned for the &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; that they fashion from these trees.\nFurther east are the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt;.

The Tree spoke of its bargain with Elias and of a place he went that was \"beyond it's sight\", a place located at the coastline filled with wrecked ships. The Tree instructed to enter a coffin which would take them to where they need to find the source of Elias's immortality. Doing so allowed the Wanderer to find a Sunken Temple of Rathma's hidden beneath the waters and where Elias's secret was located: a piece of Elias's finger which housed his essence. So long as this piece of Elias existed, then Elias himself could not die. With Elias's mummified finger in their hands, the Wanderer and &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath&lt;/a&gt; burned the finger, robbing Elias's of his immortality and thereby leaving him open to be confronted for a final time. With Taissa by their side, the Wanderer confronted the fallen Horadrim mage and in a pitched battle, gravely wounded him. Realizing that he no longer has immortality, Elias attempted to flee, but his wounds were too grave, allowing the Wanderer, Lorath, Taissa and the Tree's Crow to catch up to him. After some few spiteful last words, Taissa killed Elias for the last time, allowing the Crow to sever his head and bring it back to the Tree, its debt collected at last.\nWith Elias dead but Lilith still at large and close to reaching her goal, Lorath made a risky, if not needless, bargain with the Tree like his former pupil. He asked where the nearest Gate to Hell was located, knowing that is where Lilith is also going to be, the Tree answered that the Gate to Hell was beneath the city of &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Wanderer, &lt;a href=\"Donan\"&gt;Donan&lt;/a&gt; and Neyrelle were horrified by Lorath's decision, he nonetheless accepted the price he will have to pay, leaving the Tree's numerous heads, Elias's included, to laugh in mockery.\nAfter the Wanderer succeeded in defeating Lilith in Hell and learned that Neyrelle has left for places unknown with Mephisto's essence, they returned to Sanctuary with Lorath to plan their next move in the event Neyrelle loses herself to the Lord of Hatred. In the meantime, the Wanderer returned to Tree of Whispers, conducting missions for it in finding others who owe the Tree.\nGameplay.\nThe Tree of Whispers is part of the endgame system of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". The Tree provides players with frequently cycling world objectives and &lt;a href=\"bounties\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt; that reward them with Legendary gear, experience, crafting materials, and more. This includes the &lt;a href=\"Whispers%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Whispers of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; gameplay system."}

{"id": "12", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12", "title": "Tristram", "text": "Tristram, later known as \"Old Tristram\", was a small, humble town in the western realm of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, now nothing more than &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Ruins\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area around Tristram is a land of lush fields and picturesque rivers.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn ancient times, &lt;a href=\"Jered%20Cain\"&gt;Jered Cain&lt;/a&gt;, and his fellow &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt;, slew &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;, and sealed him within one of the three &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s. Jered then hid the soulstone in the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Horadric monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Over the course of many generations, the Horadrim Order began to dissipate, with the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s bound within the soulstones. As their numbers dwindled, the monastery fell into ruin. Over time, villages were established in the surrounding area, the denizens unaware of the terror that lurked in the labyrinth beneath. Tristram was a case in point.\nA tree on the road to Tristram was used to hang those accused of practicing the dark arts. This practice continued (or started) during the reign of &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nAfter many years, &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; established himself as king of Khanduras, and brought with him the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith. He made Tristram Khanduras's capital, with his seat of power in the ancient &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Horadrim monastery&lt;/a&gt;, now a cathedral. &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, Leoric's most trusted adviser and an envoy of the Zakarum, ventured deep into the cathedral, attracted by some mystic energy. In the deepest recesses, he found Diablo's soulstone.\nDiablo, having fully corrupted the soulstone, was able to influence Lazarus into shattering it. He tried to take control of Leoric's body, and while he managed to drive the king mad, he was never able to fully possess Leoric. Diablo then left the king's body and demanded that Lazarus bring him\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt;, Leoric's son. Rapidly possessing the prince, the Lord of Terror finally was able to fully manifest in the mortal realm once again. Leoric was left completely insane by the disappearance of his son, and thought the townsfolk, and even his loyal knights guilty of betraying him.\nHis knights, led by &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;Lachdanan&lt;/a&gt;, were sent (by the advice of Lazarus) into a suicidal war against the larger kingdom of Westmarch; more than half of Tristram's citizens were charged with treason and murdered. When Lachdanan returned, defeated, to Tristram, he found the city devastated. He confronted the king, finally understanding that there was no salvation for Leoric. When King Leoric attacked Lachdanan and his knights, Lachdanan ordered them to defend themselves, and a fierce battle ensued. Lachdanan and his forces were at last able to overcome the darkened monarch. With his dying breath, Leoric cursed Lachdanan and his knights to serve him in darkness, forever.\nSoon after, Tristram was attacked by a horde of demons, and the once-holy cathedral became a place of dark cults and rituals. The archbishop emerged from the ancient Horadric monastery, and rallied the townsfolk into finding the lost prince in the dungeon; only to lure them into a confrontation with &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful demon, who slew many that night, and left very few survivors. What was left of Tristram's townsfolk either left or tried to survive however they could in the demon-infested town.\nSalvation and Damnation.\nMany heroes were attracted to Tristram, whether it be for the rumored riches within the cathedral or a chance to test their mettle against the monsters that plagued the town. Among them was Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, son of Leoric. He ventured into the cathedral's depths and slew the Lord of Terror, binding his essence within the soulstone, and joining it to his flesh. This was an act intended to contain the demon, but it only resulted in Diablo asserting his will over the prince. Tristram celebrated the victory, but Aidan, now the Dark Wanderer, left the town. Upon his departure, demons returned to the town, slaughtering its inhabitants, though they were able to take some of their &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;attackers&lt;/a&gt; with them. Survivors included &lt;a href=\"Gillian\"&gt;Gillian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adria\"&gt;Adria&lt;/a&gt; (both having left before the carnage) and &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt;, who was rescued by a new group of heroes in pursuit of the Dark Wanderer.\nAmong the Ruins.\nTristram never recovered from the horror Diablo inflicted. A new settlement dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;\" grew up in an area not too distant from the original town site, based on travelers seeking to reap what treasures remained in the cathedral, as well as the ruins of Tristram itself. The &lt;a href=\"Sigils%20of%20Dendas\"&gt;Sigils of Dendas&lt;/a&gt; were among the artifacts recovered from the town. However, New Tristram fell into decline once the cathedral was picked dry. By &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, the fires of the past had long since burnt out, leaving nothing but charred ruins.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nTristram is the hub of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" and its . The following &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s can be interacted with:\nDevelopment.\nThe original concept for Tristram included a temple, general store, and training center.\nDiablo II.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, Tristram is shown to be destroyed by demons. The zone can be accessed through a special &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; opened within the circle of &lt;a href=\"Cairn%20Stones\"&gt;Cairn Stones&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Field\"&gt;Stony Field&lt;/a&gt;. The zone is not randomized in the environment. Near the portal entrance to the zone, and scattered across the town, are cow corpses that explode if the player character clicks on them, dealing a small percentage of their Life in damage as Fire (a possible reference to &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;The Secret Cow Level&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn the southern part of the town the now &lt;a href=\"Griswold%20%28monster%29\"&gt;undead Griswold&lt;/a&gt; can be found, and west of him is usually a Unique &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Archer\"&gt;Skeleton Archer&lt;/a&gt; and his minions. In the center is Deckard Cain's prison, guarded by Champion &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and surrounded with &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. In the northwest are &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;Carvers&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Shaman\"&gt;shamans&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Wirt\"&gt;Wirt&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse and a house with gold in it. Other monsters are randomly spawned.\nIn addition to Wirt's body, corpses are shown near the locations where the original townsfolk of Tristram once stood, apparently signifying that they were killed. However, Deckard Cain wasn't the only person who avoided death at Tristram; &lt;a href=\"Adria%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Adria the Witch&lt;/a&gt; left the town before the massacre, and her hut across the river was inaccessible to anyone, including the demons.\nDiablo III.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Ruins\"&gt;The Old Ruins&lt;/a&gt; are the ruins of Tristram, and players visit this area in &lt;a href=\"Act%20I%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act I&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt; have been attacking the town, under the command of the newly risen &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rumford\"&gt;Captain Rumford&lt;/a&gt; and his guards tried to defend the town, and it would have fallen if not for the actions of the &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. It is here where &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; was brought when he was rescued by the heroes. Near the shattered fountain, the remains of Deckard Cain's infamous cage still sits where it was lowered to. The exploding cow corpse has rotted away, leaving the skeleton behind.\nDiablo IV.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\", Tristram itself is not visited, but a simulacrum of the town appears in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Vision of Tristram&lt;/a&gt; dreamscape in .\nKnown Inhabitants.\nThe following is a list of all known inhabitants of Tristram, &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise:"}
{"id": "6141", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6141", "title": "Tristram Cathedral", "text": "The Tristram Cathedral is an ancient &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadric&lt;/a&gt; edifice. Underneath it, the Horadrim imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt;. When the Horadrim faded away, the cathedral was left as decrepit ruin. The cathedral briefly became the seat of power of &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt;, but with the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%23The%20Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;The Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;town's&lt;/a&gt; destruction, the cathedral has since remained abandoned.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nAfter the Horadrim defeated Diablo, they buried his soulstone in a secluded cave near the &lt;a href=\"River%20Talsande\"&gt;River Talsande&lt;/a&gt;. Above this cave the Horadrim constructed a great monastery from which they could continue to safeguard the soulstone. As ages passed, the Horadrim constructed a network of catacombs beneath the monastery to house the earthly remains of the martyrs of their order, and also used it to store the weapons they had used during their war against the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;. As time passed however, the Horadrim fell into obscurity, and with their passing, the cathedral fell into ruin. Although villages grew and thrived around the shell of the old monastery, no one knew of the dark, secret passageways that stretched into the cold earth beneath it.\nOver time, the Horadrim settled the land and founded &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. As the town grew, other settlers and farmers came to the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;. As the years passed, none suspected that the cathedral which overshadowed Tristram was home to the Lord of Terror.\nMore than two centuries after the cathedral's construction, the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; lord &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;. The cathedral was appropriated as his seat of power, and was restored to its former glory. Multiple &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s were stockpiled as the clergy used them to treat the sick and wounded, and part of it was appropriated as a royal crypt. However, Leoric was unaware of the catacombs that lay beneath the cathedral.\nThe Darkening of Tristram.\nSensing his chance to escape, Diablo lured &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; into the catacombs beneath the cathedral, and compelled him to shatter his soulstone. Thus began a series of events that would become known as the Darkening of Tristram. Leoric served as Diablo's original host, but stymied from fully controlling the king, Prince &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;Albrecht&lt;/a&gt; was brought into the depths of the labyrinth to serve as Diablo's vessel. Albrecht's fears were made real, and large bodies comprised of living rock erupted from the walls and bowed to their dark master. The ancient, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeletal&lt;/a&gt; corpses of the Horadrim arose from archaic crypts and lumbered off into the red washed corridors beyond. Such was Albrecht's terror that &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; itself spilled over into the mortal realm, twisting the labyrinth beneath the cathedral into a bastion of terror.\nLeoric died at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;Lachdanan&lt;/a&gt;, ending his reign of terror, but the people of Tristram couldn't rest easy. Strange, eerie lights shone out from the monastery, and strange creatures could be seen venturing out from the church. Lazarus led a group of townsfolk into the labyrinth in a bid to find Albrecht, but it was a trap, as they were set upon by a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt;. Only a few returned to the surface to recount what had transpired. A hellish drone emanated from the cathedral, and the incantations of dark rituals could be heard.\nDark rumors spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; as to the evil that had taken hold of the cathedral. &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s alike were drawn to Tristram in response, whether it be for riches, or to discover Horadric tomes. A few warriors ventured into the cathedral, but were never heard from again.\nTristram's situation improved with the arrival of Prince &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;. Aided by the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Moreina\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jazreth\"&gt;Jazreth&lt;/a&gt;, the three descended into the cathedral. After overcoming many &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s, they were able to slay Diablo himself. The screams that had echoed from the cathedral at last fell silent. However, it was only a brief respite, for mere weeks after Diablo's supposed defeat, Tristram was laid waste to by demons. Both the town and cathedral lay abandoned.\nPlunderers.\nIn the years that followed Tristram's destruction, a collection of merchants looking to profit on adventurers and travelers drawn by legends of riches within the old cathedral came to settle near the cathedral, founding the town of \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt;.\" The cathedral was stripped bare of riches, and afterwards, New Tristram fell into decline. Some &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunters\"&gt;Demon Hunters&lt;/a&gt; entered the cathedral, but many refused to enter it. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231284\"&gt;1284&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leah\"&gt;Leah&lt;/a&gt; arrived in New Tristram. Cain spent his days poring over the tomes and manuscripts found in the ruined &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fallen Star.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;1285&lt;/a&gt;, the cathedral was visited by &lt;a href=\"Abd%20al-Hazir\"&gt;Abd al-Hazir&lt;/a&gt;, but he could only muster the courage to take a few steps into the structure before departing.\nLater in the year, a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;fallen star&lt;/a&gt; slammed through the cathedral. Leah and Cain were in the cathedral at the time, and were separated by the star's impact. Leah tried to search for him, but the fallen star had awoken the dead, and she was forced to flee. The &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Militia\"&gt;Tristram Militia&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the cathedral per Leah's request, but were slaughtered. The cathedral was entered by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, who rescued Cain, and defeated the resurrected Skeleton King.\nIn-game.\nDiablo I.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Diablo_I_Walkthrough%23The_Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; comprises of levels 1-4 of the \"Dungeon\" (the basis for the majority of the gameplay in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\"). Players must navigate its levels in order to access the lower dungeon levels and ultimately confront &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe levels have a gothic architectural style with large, open rooms that most of the time are connected by closed doors. &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Shrines&lt;/a&gt; give various magical effects or other enchantments, and a variety of sarcophagi, chests and barrels can be found, as well as hordes of undead and minor animals or demons ready to ambush unprepared adventurers. Stairs to the next level are surrounded by squared-off stone walls.\nThe entrance to the Cathedral levels is at the front of the cathedral near the edge of Tristram, with eerie, red light spilling out through the doorway and windows to lead the way down. Mousing over it reads \"DOWN TO DUNGEON\".\nQuests.\nThe Cathedral is involved in two multiplayer quests, and six single-player quests. Three to four of these quests will appear in a given single-player game.\nThe &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Butcher&lt;/a&gt; quest can be initiated by speaking to the &lt;a href=\"Wounded%20Man\"&gt;Wounded Man&lt;/a&gt; lying outside of the cathedral entrance, and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Butcher&lt;/a&gt; quest monster can be found in a square-set piece of room somewhere on Level 2.\nThe singleplayer-only &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20Water%20Supply%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Poisoned Water Supply&lt;/a&gt; quest can be started by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Pepin\"&gt;Pepin&lt;/a&gt; any time after entering Level 1. The &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20Water%20Supply\"&gt;Poisoned Water Supply&lt;/a&gt; area is accessed through a hole in the wall somewhere on Level 2.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt; quest can be initiated by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Ogden\"&gt;Ogden&lt;/a&gt; any time after entering Level 2. In singleplayer games, &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;King Leoric's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20King%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Skeleton King&lt;/a&gt; enemy is located, is accessed via a stone archway on a filled, square-set piece on Level 3. In multiplayer games, the Skeleton King is just a random encounter somewhere on Level 3 itself.\nThe singleplayer-only &lt;a href=\"Ogden%27s%20Sign%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Ogden's Sign&lt;/a&gt; quest can be started by speaking to Ogden any time after entering Level 3. The quest can be completed by finding the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20Sign\"&gt;Tavern Sign&lt;/a&gt; in a set-piece on Level 4. The set-piece surrounds the entrance to Level 5 and contains a number of enemies related to the quest.\nThe singleplayer-only &lt;a href=\"Gharbad%20the%20Weak%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Gharbad the Weak&lt;/a&gt; quest can be started by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Gharbad%20the%20Weak%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Gharbad the Weak&lt;/a&gt; on Level 4 of the dungeon.\nThe singleplayer-only &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Rock%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Magic Rock&lt;/a&gt; quest can be started by talking to &lt;a href=\"Griswold\"&gt;Griswold&lt;/a&gt; any time after entering Level 4, though the &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Stone%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Heavenly Stone&lt;/a&gt; needed to complete the quest is found on Level 5.\nPoisoned Water Supply and Skeleton King share a quest group, such that one or the other will appear in a given singleplayer game. The Butcher, Ogden's Sign, and Ghardbad the Weak share a quest group, such that two of the three will appear in a given singleplayer game. Magic Rock shares a quest group with &lt;a href=\"Arkaine%27s%20Valor%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Arkaine's Valor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20the%20Blind\"&gt;Halls of the Blind&lt;/a&gt; such that it has a 2 in 3 chance of appearing in a given singleplayer game.\nDiablo II.\nThe cathedral does not appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", as the portion of Tristram where the cathedral would be is not accessible.\nDiablo Immortal.\nTristram Cathedral appears as a &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDiablo III.\nThe cathedral returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". It is a complex 4-level dungeon that houses all quests up to and including the defeat of the .\nThe first level is rather small, and ends when players enter the hidden stair to &lt;a href=\"Leoric%27s%20Passage\"&gt;Leoric's Passage&lt;/a&gt;, finding &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Headcleaver\"&gt;Headcleaver&lt;/a&gt;. This is the only place the rarely-appearing &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mushroom\"&gt;Black Mushroom&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nOnce the quest advances further and Leoric's crown is found, the door to the second level can be unlocked. The third level houses &lt;a href=\"Kormac\"&gt;Kormac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jondar\"&gt;Jondar&lt;/a&gt; and their storyline. It is heavily infested with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cultist\"&gt;Dark Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s, the first time they are fought in-game.\nThe final level ends with access to &lt;a href=\"the%20Royal%20Crypts\"&gt;the Royal Crypts&lt;/a&gt;, where the can be found. Defeating him gains access to the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Chamber\"&gt;Desolate Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, where the crater of the Fallen Star and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;the stranger&lt;/a&gt; at its center can be found.\nThe Cathedral is mostly filled with &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Dead\"&gt;Risen Dead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungry%20Corpse\"&gt;Hungry Corpse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Archer\"&gt;Skeleton Archer&lt;/a&gt;s, s and &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Summoner\"&gt;Skeletal Summoner&lt;/a&gt;s, the latter of whom can appear from murals on the walls. Level 3, as mentioned above, is where the cultists and Jondar are.\nIt also features unique environmental traps: chandeliers. Each chandelier can be released by touching its supporting chain, falling on top of the area marked with an X-shaped shadow. Monsters below will take Fire damage and be &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;ned. There is an achievement for killing a thousand monsters with it.\nThe cathedral as it appears in \"Diablo I\" becomes replayable in the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt; event.\nOther.\nThe cathedral appears in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//overwatch.gamepedia.com/Blizzard_World\"&gt;Blizzard World&lt;/a&gt; map in \"Overwatch\"."}

Whilst outwardly a benevolent religious body, in reality, it was formed by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s as part of their plan to corrupt &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity and convert them to their side.\nAt some point after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s fall, the group re-emerged.\nLore.\nThe evil that permeates the Triune consumes, ending in violence and death.\nOrganization.\nThe Cult of the Triune was composed of primarily by the swarthy natives of &lt;a href=\"Toraja\"&gt;Toraja&lt;/a&gt;. The Triune's message to the populace was that through selfless worship and devotion, one could improve their lot in life. It likewise preached peaceful resolution to conflicts. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, it championed the individual, rather than the whole. The number three was sacred to the Triune\u2014it is said that the number was represented in the cult's own architecture, mirroring its three deities, and even its &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Warders\"&gt;Peace Warders&lt;/a&gt; always traveled in threes.\nThe Triune had temples in various major settlements, mainly in the eastern regions of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Each temple was subordinate to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Temple%20of%20the%20Triune\"&gt;main temple&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Triune consisted of three smaller cults, each devoted to one of the Triune's three guiding spirits, which were in truth the alter egos of the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;s. All three cults were lead by a &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; from the main temple. Other, lesser temples were generally led by a cleric, beneath which were lesser priests that administered each separate branch of the faith. or a band of lesser priests. The governing authority and leader of the Triune was the Grand Priest - the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. Peace Warders, cowled guards who wore the symbols of each order on their chests guided newcomers to a cult of their choosing. The demonic &lt;a href=\"morlu\"&gt;morlu&lt;/a&gt; served as an elite fighting force, only deployed in special circumstances.\nThe three guiding spirits were named after the Prime Evils themselves, and were titled with exact opposite of the aspects of the Prime Evils. Unsuspecting initiates were lured into the cults, fooled by the seemingly kind guiding spirits. Gradually their hearts would darken as they were initiated into the true teachings of the Triune, and the true spirits they served. The three guiding spirits were known as Dialon, Bala and Mefis, and each had their associated order. Acolytes of the Triune traveled together, preaching \"the Way of the Three.\" The acolytes could be identified by their style of robes.\nThose who knew the true nature of the Primes carried out &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; sacrifice in their honor.\nOrder of Dialon.\nDialon, Spirit of Determination, was represented by a stubborn ram. Dialon was believed to bring purpose to humanity. Statues of Dialon were usually depicted wearing the Tablets of Order, which taught how to achieve blessedness. In truth, followers of Dialon served the Prime Evil, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Terror.\nOrder of Bala.\nBala, Spirit of Creation, was represented by a leaf. Bala preached the blessings of nature and the architectural triumphs of humanity. Statues of Bala were usually depicted wearing a hammer and a bag, which presumably contained the seeds of Life. In truth, followers of Bala served the Prime Evil, &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Destruction.\nOrder of Mefis.\nMefis, Spirit of Love, was represented by a red circle, the Kehjani symbol for the heart. In a sense Mefis was the most crucial of all spirits, as the Primus taught that Creation and Determination could not thrive without Love. Statues of Mefis were depicted with empty, cupped hands, as if they were cradling an infant. In truth, followers of Mefis served the Prime Evil, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Hatred.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; by the hands &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, a rogue &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, the demonic forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; noticed the existence of the mortal realm and the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; within it. Seeing the potential of turning the tides of the war, the Prime Evils sought ways to corrupt mankind from behind the scenes and take control.\nDuring this period, Mephisto sent his son &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt; to Sanctuary, where he established the Cult of the Triune in the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23-1880\"&gt;-1880&lt;/a&gt;, as a front for the Prime Evils to manipulate and enslave humanity through blindsided religion. The Temple intentionally sowed chaos among humanity in order to achieve this aim.\nOver the decades, the cult's numbers swelled. When Inarius discovered the truth about the Triune, he sought the means to counter the Prime Evils' influence over &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. He then formed his own sect, known as the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, in the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23-1820\"&gt;-1820&lt;/a&gt;, as a rival religion, in order to compete with the Triune in even grounds and bring humanity to his side. While other faiths had existed before them, the Triune and Cathedral eclipsed them all. Over the next decade, both religions achieved immense influence in &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;, and an ideological battle erupted between the two, polarizing &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt; society. None knew that this was the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt; on the verge of war themselves, many in Kehjan flocked to one of the two faiths.\nDownfall.\nIn the last days of the Sin War, mankind's &lt;a href=\"nephalem\"&gt;nephalem&lt;/a&gt; birthright awoke within a number of mortals, due to the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. She sought to topple both the Triune and Cathedral, and while she was ousted, she inadvertantly gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt;, the next generation of nephalem who were normal people. &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian%20ul-Diomed\"&gt;Uldyssian ul-Diomed&lt;/a&gt;, their leader, awakened the Edyrem's latent nephalem powers, and began a crusade against both organizations. The Triune had to content with the loss of Primus &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt; for a time, but Lilith, disguising herself as her brother, took over the Triune.\nThe Triune rapidly fell into disarray after the mysterious disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. The Edyrem cut a bloody path against the Triune over Kehjan, removing their power bases from towns such as Toraja and &lt;a href=\"Istani\"&gt;Istani&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the Triune was utterly destroyed, and their Grand Temple fell. While some lesser temples remained, Uldyssian knew that without the Grand Temple's guidance, their influence would quickly fade. The Edyrem spread across the land, purging whatever remaining influence of the Triune they could find. The Cathedral of Light was quick to exploit the power vacuum the Triune's downfall left.\nFragments.\nDespite the tumult of the Sin War, the Triune survived, and continued to operate. The cult's remnants eschewed the Triune's formerly benevolent facade and operated in the shadows, preserving their order's secrets, awaiting a sign from the Prime Evils. The &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; formed also as a splinter group of the Triune. It was considered likely by &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; that other splinter groups also existed.\nResurgence.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat by the hands of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;, a power vacuum developed in Sanctuary. The Triune was among the groups who attempted to fill it. The Triune retained its worship of the Prime Evils and sought to return the Three to Sanctuary. However, this new Triune Cult also apparently began worshipping Lilith, calling her \"The Blessed Mother\". As best can be seen, there appears to have been a schism among the ranks of the Triune between their patrons. Some cultists completely rejected the Three, instead being completely devoted to Lilith, claiming their power and birthright as \"favored children\" instead of \"servants for uncaring masters\". However, later noted that members of the Coven appeared to be worshipping the Prime Evils even while the greater whole of the cult worshipped Lilith.\nThe Triune established and appropriated temples for worship in &lt;a href=\"Nahantu\"&gt;Nahantu&lt;/a&gt; during this period.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elias\"&gt;Elias&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; and now a Triune priest, summoned &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; into Sanctuary. With the return of the daughter of Mephisto, the Triune's members, filled with hatred and drunk on sin, emerged from the shadows. Triune agents integrated themselves into &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt; society, spreading paranoia throughout the populace. The Triune also operated in the &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Peaks\"&gt;Fractured Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nostrava\"&gt;Nostrava&lt;/a&gt; coming under their sway. The Triune marched across the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, shackling unfortunates and bringing them to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Civo\"&gt;Mount Civo&lt;/a&gt;, where they were slaughtered. Others willingly joined the Triune, as the cult promised an escape from their suffering. The Triune also burnt trading caravans. Triune &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s were entrusted with finding the perfect candidates for ritual sacrifice and protecting those carrying out powerful summoning.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nTriune cultists appeared in concept art for \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". In the final version of the former game, their position was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; (formed from the remnants of the Triune). The following Triune enemies were supposed to appear, many of which have Coven counterparts:\nDiablo IV.\nTriune enemies appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\". Enemy types include the following:\nKnown Members.\nSin War.\nThe following members of the Triune were active during the Sin War:\nThe Great Enmity.\nThe following Triune members were active during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;:"}

They are, most likely, related to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cultists\"&gt;Dark Cultists&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not known whether they are a subtype of Dark Cultists, or if Dark Cultists are a subtype of Triune Cultists or if they are from different monster classes altogether.\nAppearance.\nThe Triune Cultist looks much more tropical than their Dark counterparts who look more like medieval evangelists. They wear an attire similar to that worn by the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey wear a kind of single, long cloth that covers their lower bodies. On their upper torsos, they wear some sort of Light Armor. They may wear various types of headgear that can been seen in the concept art.\nThe Cultists carry a whip with them with which they flagellate themselves to bring out the demonic frenzy from within them. It is not known whether the Triune Cultists are also capable of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Demon\"&gt;summoning demons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Activated%20Vessel\"&gt;transforming into demons themselves&lt;/a&gt; like their Dark brethren. But the whips seem to assist them in channeling whatever demonic powers they may possess.\nFrom their concept art, it seems that the Triune Cultists also chant some demonic verses and that may allow them to cast certain spells, as chanting is regarded to be related to the Occult. They are also mentioned to ring bells that may further augment their occult powers.\nIt may be noted that the Triune worshipped three entities, &lt;a href=\"Dialon\"&gt;Dialon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bala\"&gt;Bala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mefis&lt;/a&gt;, the alter egos of the three Prime Evils. The concept art also shows three different upper bodies of the Cultist. Whether these are how the three orders of the Cultist look like or if they are only variants of a common Cultist type-enemy is not known. If they are indeed from different orders of the Triune, which torso depicts which order is also not discernible. But there appears to be a connection between their headgear and the insignia of the Prime Evils as seen in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt; manual. From the similarity, it can be said that the full-bodied Cultist worships Mefis, while out of the two torsos, the upper one appears to worship Bala while the lower one worships Dialon.\nTriune re-emergence?\nThe &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; were an ancient religion dedicated to the worship of Mephis, Bala and Dialon, the alter egos of the three &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; in the mortal world of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. They recruited men and women in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; to work against the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. The existence of the Triune Cultist in Diablo III points towards the re-emergence of the Triune.\nThey also seem suggest that the player may get to interact with the Temple of the Triune in some way in the final game. Whether the Triune have a greater role in Diablo III's story is not known, but it seems very likely.\nIn Game.\nThe Triune Cultists are not present in the final Diablo III release, therefore their special abilities and skills are not known at the moment.\nConsidering the skills of their Darker brethren, it is possible that they could summon demons and hurl some kind of ranged projectile to complement their summons."}

Seeing the similarities, it can be said that the Berserker is either a variant of the Blood Guard or the Blood Guard is a more powerful version of the Berserker.\nThe Blood Guard is a heavily muscular entity, personifying the true power of brute force and melee in combat. They are hulking members of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt; who are related to (or are possibly the same as) the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cultist\"&gt;Dark Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIts concept art reveals some facts about the Blood Guard's abilities and nature. It has blinders covering its eyes like a work-animal, so that it can concentrate on only one target at a time. Their targets are chosen not by themselves but by a higher power who are only known as \"their masters\" at this time. These masters may either be the Triune Leaders themselves or some other commander type monster which may spawn with them in the game.\nThey are always in a berserk state of mind, which can be seen by their frenzied stance in the concept art. A point to be noted is that their hammers have what are called the \"Teeth of Diablo\". These so-called \"Teeth\" have also been mentioned in the concept artwork of the &lt;a href=\"Activated%20Vessel\"&gt;Activated Vessel&lt;/a&gt;. These Teeth confirm a relation between the Triune and the Dark Cultists. These Teeth may serve to augment their demonic powers or, in the case of the Blood Guard, their melee attacks in their frenzied state.\nIn-game.\nThe Triune Cultist Blood Guard seen in the artwork is mentioned to be a Gladiator type monster. This seems to indicate the existence of another, or possibly a number of, variants of the Blood Guard.\nThey were supposed to be the personal bodyguards of the Triune Leaders (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Maghda\"&gt;Maghda&lt;/a&gt;), who may spawn with them. The Blood Guard may in fact be the base monster name of the Dark Berserker type of monsters, looking at their similar states and functioning. Another theory doing the rounds is that the Berserkers were only a beta version of the Blood Guard."}

However, in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, while on the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, the stone was stolen by a &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Stone%20Thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt;, who left Trond temporarily incapacitated. Trond requested aid from an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the relic, which they did. The adventurer informed Trond that the thief had met his end, and handed the stone back, hoping Trond avoided the same fate.\nLater Trond spotted an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Clan\"&gt;Ice Clan&lt;/a&gt; Shaman leading &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt; around like an experienced &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;.

Trond could not be freed because the ice wall was reinforced by &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "7718", "revid": "50366882", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7718", "title": "Health Globe", "text": "Health Globes or Health Orbs are small globes in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\" that can be used by a character to replenish &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;. They are immediately used when the player runs over them and cannot be carried in the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0They are almost always created by killing or damaging enemies, and were developed as a way to reduce emphasis on &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s in combat.\nOverview.\nHealth Globes have been touted as the spiritual successor of the &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt; system in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\". Health Globes are red-colored globes that replenish the &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; of the character. They have some chance (usually 15%) to be dropped by most of the monsters on death, or whenever they lose a portion of their health (25% for &lt;a href=\"elites\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt;, some bosses may drop them as often as every 10% life lost). At the moment, they replenish a percent of the player's life, increased by respective secondary statistic, over 1 second. Every globe restores approximately 10% of the maximum Life.\nThe secondary property \"Health Globes and Potions Grant +xx,xxx &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;\" increases the &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt; gained from Health Globes, as well as &lt;a href=\"Potions\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt;. Maximum healing bonus is 207991 (rolls up to 29713 on &lt;a href=\"Jewelry\"&gt;Jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boots\"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chest%20Armor\"&gt;Chest Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helms\"&gt;Helms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pauldrons\"&gt;Pauldrons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt;), or 270375 with &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Legendary\"&gt;Ancient Legendary&lt;/a&gt; bonus (38625 per piece).\nMany items and passive abilities enhance Health Globes or make them award extra effects to the player, such as replenishment of primary resource (&lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20Wraps\"&gt;Reaper's Wraps&lt;/a&gt;). The pickup range can also be increased by many means. However, to pick the Globe, character must move: it will not be picked automatically even if dropped within pickup radius. Normal pickup range is the same as for &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;: 3 yards.\nThere is no competition over the Globes, as picking one applies it to all players within 40 yards, as well as their &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;s, summoned &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt;, minions and creatures.\nThe Globes have been named the successor of the Potion system in Diablo III. The older method of chugging Potions while fighting a powerful monster, effectively giving the player infinite health so long as they're never instantly killed, does not work in Diablo III.\u00a0\nVariants.\nPower Globes.\n&lt;a href=\"Power%20Globe\"&gt;Power Globe&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0are a rare variant of the Health Globes, dropped less often, awarding no health, but instead applying one stack of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Glory\"&gt;Nephalem Glory&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0buff.\nProgress orbs.\nProgress orbs appear in &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift\"&gt;Greater Rift&lt;/a&gt;s. Collecting them works quite similarly to Health Globes, but they are otherwise a completely different mechanic.\nDevelopment.\nDiablo III is built to emphasize skills and abilities rather than luck and faster hands. The health globes were introduced in order to foster a faster gameplay experience. It gives the player a reason to kill in order to survive. &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; made the decision to feature the orbs as it was reasoned that &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s could potentially give the player what essentially amounted to infinite health, necessitating, for the player to at all feel threatened, monsters that could remove all of that health in a single blow, which limits the number of viable strategic options and gameplay styles. Orbs could allow for less invulnerable and powerful monsters and more strategic gameplay when it came to fighting them.\nControversy.\nThe Globes were initially met with stiff resistance from the veteran gaming community. After much reasoning from Blizzard's side, the disgruntled members of the community eventually warmed up to the new idea.\nThe inclusion of Globes and the reduction of the Potion system has drawn mixed responses from the gaming community. Most oppose the latter of the two. While they feel that Globes make the game play out fast and more smoothly, the removal of unrestricted Potion use was a price they did not expect to pay.\nOthers saw the inclusion of Globes as making the game more childish, side-scroller type and more Zelda-ish, especially the news that some monsters would drop Globes at intermediate health states. It can be said that the Globes were as debatable as the controversy over the \"cartoonish\" art direction.\nTrivia.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Whimsyshire\"&gt;Whimsyshire&lt;/a&gt;, Health Globes are replaced with cupcakes. Their effect is exactly the same.\nDuring a &lt;a href=\"Nephalem%20Rift\"&gt;Nephalem Rift&lt;/a&gt; with Infernal Bovine spawns, Health Globes are replaced with T-Bone steaks.\nPrior to 2.1, the amount of health a globe can heal could be predicted by its size: the larger globe is, the higher percent of maximum health it would have replenished. However, as of 2.1, all Health Globes heal the same percentage of Life."}

To this end, the Heavenly Host adheres to strict militaristic disciplines, as angels believe that only absolute discipline can bring order to the myriad realms. The Heavenly Host appears to rely predominantly on &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, and to an extent, swords, though the &lt;a href=\"Skycutter\"&gt;Skycutter&lt;/a&gt;, a mace, has been stated to be its favored weapon.\nComposition.\nA number of types of warrior compose the Host. Most common of these appears to be \"lancers;\" angels equipped with spears who fight in formation, though have also been observed to use swords. Specialized types include the following:\nThe Host has utilized siege weapons, of which &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Weapon%20%28Event%29\"&gt;massive conduits of Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Tower%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;lightning towers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Diversion\"&gt;ballistae&lt;/a&gt; have been observed. Unlike the Legion, angels may repair their siege weaponry in the field. &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Prison\"&gt;Timeless Prison&lt;/a&gt;s are sometimes utilized to trap the demon champions in time, preventing them from being reborn in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Heavenly Host waged battle in Heaven, Hell, and &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt; alike. However, the war ground to a halt with the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Host came to &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in what would be the last battle of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;. Under the command of the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, the Host descended from the skies and struck their wrath on all who opposed them. To the Host, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity was nothing but a horde of demons, and as actual demons erupted from the ground to ignite a three-way battle, the angels made no distinction between the two of them. However, the angels and demons involved in the battle were sent back to their respective realms by &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian%20ul-Diomed\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt;. This led to a truce between Heaven and Hell, as they agreed to allow mankind to follow its own path towards Order or Chaos.\nMillennia later, the Host defended the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; and his minions. With the capture of &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Host became listless and dejected without her influence, allowing themselves to be scattered. Total defeat was only averted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nephalem\"&gt;The Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was said that no animal could conceal its tracks from them, and no beast could stand against them. Always, the four hunted together, and were as close as kin.\nThe Gospel of Death.\nEncounter With Death.\nOn what would be their last hunt, they ventured to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;green steppes&lt;/a&gt;, where none had ever hunted. There, according to Bersarik, they would hunt &lt;a href=\"aurochs\"&gt;aurochs&lt;/a&gt;. After three days\u2019 preparation, they left the golden city which they called home, and traveled northward. In the mountains, they were attacked by creatures similar to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Hawk\"&gt;Blood Hawk&lt;/a&gt;s, but they were able to fend them off. While troubled by the creatures\u2019 boldness, they nevertheless carried on. \nIn the steppes, they tracked the aurochs\u2019 trail for four days, ignoring the weakness creeping into their limbs. On the fifth, they finally found the herd. They cornered one of the beasts, but at this point they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Ahduma%20the%20Earthbreaker\"&gt;Ahduma the Earthbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, who killed Gratian. Helgrotha and the others ran to their beloved, while Adhuma returned to the herd.\nNever before had the nephalem known &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, yet Helgrotha and the others knew that Gratian was no longer Gratian. That something vital had left him. A long time passed before Helgrotha spoke, declaring themselves to be fools, and no better than the beasts they had slain. When the moon rose, Helgrotha declared that she had to leave, to go where death could not find her. After giving a parting embrace to Corvik and Bersarik, she walked into the darkness.\nThe Wood Witch.\nAges passed. &lt;a href=\"Kalmor\"&gt;Kalmor&lt;/a&gt;, acting under orders of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, was ordered to slay Corvik and Helgrotha, and while he succeeded in the former task, he searched for Helgrotha for years, and for years, she eluded him. Paranoid about death, she gave up living under the sun, and only moved under cover of night, trying to hide from death. Taking residence inside a forest, she became known as the Wood Witch. It was said that she knew every branch of every tree, and could speak with animals and have them do her bidding. She instructed the animals on how to avoid traps left by hunters. She encountered a bear which she named \u201c&lt;a href=\"Bersarik%20%28Bear%29\"&gt;Bersarik&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d in honor of her old friend.\nKalmor eventually tracked Helgrotha down, and entered the forest in which she dwelt. In a glade, come night, Kalmor shouted Helgrotha\u2019s name. One animal after another attacked him until Bersarik maimed him, before Helgrotha ordered it to halt, but only that they may learn something of this hunter before devouring him. Kalmor asked if the bear was named after Bersarik, which Helgrotha confirmed. He admitted to slaying both Bersarik and Corvik, to which Helgrotha showed no surprise. She called herself a fool, stating that after all these years of trying to evade death, death had finally caught up with her. Death, she realized, was inevitable.\nHelgrotha asked Kalmor if he intended to kill her. Keeping his thoughts to himself, he told her that he did not, that his errand was finished. He broke his &lt;a href=\"Severian\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt; in two, and buried the pieces in the glade. Helgrotha watched his task with sadness at the final ending of his former company. He told her that he would leave her wood, if she would allow him to leave in peace. Helgrotha told him that he would leave unharmed, but peace was something he would have to find for himself. With that, the two parted ways.\nAfterdeath.\nMany tales exist for Helgrotha as to what she did after this meeting, and how she eventually came to her death. It appears that Helgrotha and a number of her fellow nephalem were among those slain by &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, alongside numerous &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Unlike their forebears, however, the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of Helgrotha and her kin were able to endure on Sanctuary.\nAeons later, during the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, Helgrotha and a full legion of nephalem were summoned by &lt;a href=\"Mendeln%20ul-Diomed\"&gt;Mendeln ul-Diomed&lt;/a&gt;. Mendeln stretched out his hand, and Helgrotha\u2019s spirit bowed, so that his hand touched her hair. In doing so, Mendeln learnt her name and history. He asked if they would march against Lilith for him. In response, Helgrotha conjured a bone and gifted it to Mendeln, before she and her fellow nephalem faded. The bone twisted into a &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt; explained that the nephalem had accepted Mendeln as one who would prevent Sanctuary from being akin to either &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and Traits.\nBlack-haired, silver-eyed, and discerning, she would sometimes let her quarry live to see another sunrise. She was almost as powerful as &lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt;. Having encountered &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, she became a protector of the nocturnal &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. She was kind, but also firm in the protection of those she cared for.\nShe carried a &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;, and later, a short &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; considered her to be beautiful."}

In order to complete the quest players need to bring &lt;a href=\"Mephisto%27s%20Soulstone\"&gt;Mephisto's Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; (which they either picked up themselves at the end of &lt;a href=\"The%20Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Act III&lt;/a&gt; or were given by Deckard Cain at the start of this quest) to the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;, located within the &lt;a href=\"River%20of%20Flame\"&gt;River of Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe quest is completed after players smash &lt;a href=\"Mephisto%27s%20Soulstone\"&gt;Mephisto's Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;. Rewards can include several high level &lt;a href=\"Gems\"&gt;Gems&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt;. In addition players may prepare themselves for this act's final quest and the showdown with &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;the game's&lt;/a&gt; main antagonist: &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nBackground.\nThe sacred &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s were given to the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; by the Archangel &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; in order to imprison the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; that had been set loose upon the world. However, the fallen angel &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; had told the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; how to corrupt the sacred stones and bend their tremendous power to their will. By doing so the &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;s no longer acted as a prison but instead strengthened the Evils beyond the boundaries of the realms and even functioned as an anchor into the mortal realm: if the corporeal forms of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed their spirits remained within the stones, making a rebirth into the world possible.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; was the first of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; to be captured and the first to break free. However, he was slain at the hands of brave adventurers who had come to stop the Prime Evils from reuniting. Now his corrupt &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; has to be destroyed at the only possible place: the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;, in order to banish &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s enraged spirit back into the Black Abyss and to prevent him from manifesting into the world of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; ever again.\nFurther Tips and Information.\nFind the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;City of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. Somewhere in this City is a staircase leading down to the &lt;a href=\"River%20of%20Flame\"&gt;River of Flame&lt;/a&gt; (you'll find a &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;Waypoint&lt;/a&gt; near the stairs). Search the &lt;a href=\"River%20of%20Flame\"&gt;River of Flame&lt;/a&gt; until you find the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;; if you find a &lt;a href=\"Waypoint\"&gt;Waypoint&lt;/a&gt; located near a corridor with demon statues you have to turn back. When you approach the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt; the quest log should appear and you should encounter &lt;a href=\"Hephasto%20the%20Armorer\"&gt;Hephasto the Armorer&lt;/a&gt;, a Unique &lt;a href=\"Overlord\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt; boss similar to &lt;a href=\"The%20Smith\"&gt;The Smith&lt;/a&gt;. Much like &lt;a href=\"The%20Smith\"&gt;The Smith&lt;/a&gt;, Hephasto has a powerful melee attack and moves fast. It's best to lure him away from the forge and kill him when he's alone; it might be a tricky fight however. When he dies he should drop the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge%20Hammer\"&gt;Hellforge Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Clear the area near the Forge and equip the hammer - it does not have requirements and may thus be used by any character. When you click on the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto%27s%20Soulstone\"&gt;Mephisto's Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; should disappear from your inventory and appear on the forge. Attack the forge; after several swings the &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; should shatter into several fragments and a storm of souls is unleashed.\nNotes.\nThe chance of each rune dropping for destroying Mephisto's Soulstone is the same. For example, destroying the soulstone on Nightmare difficulty will result in a 1/11 chance for dropping any of the runes between Sol and Um."}

Level 60 rings require three ingredients, while level 70 rings require four.\nMaking a Hellfire Ring.\nTo make a Hellfire Ring, the following steps need to be completed:\nThere are four sets of Uber bosses, depending on which portal you open (the level 60 Infernal Machine opens a random portal, but using three machines in one game will open three different ones). See the Infernal Machine page for details on how to open these portals.\nOnce all ingredients are gathered, you can craft either one of the four level 60 rings or a level 70 ring, depending on the level of the bosses. Level 60 rings are crafted with one guaranteed stat regardless of your class, but level 70 ring is crafted through the Smart Loot system (that is, attributes are rolled according to the player's class).\nAlternatively, the same ingredients as those for the level 70 Hellfire Ring can be used for crafting a &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Amulet\"&gt;Hellfire Amulet&lt;/a&gt;."}

He would twist &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s to use as catalysts in the forge, and the remaining coals carried the mark of their torment. &lt;a href=\"Gishtur\"&gt;Gishtur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beledwe\"&gt;Beledwe&lt;/a&gt; also worked at the forge.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Izual\"&gt;Izual&lt;/a&gt; led an assault on the Hellforge, in an attempt to prevent the creation of the &lt;a href=\"demonblade\"&gt;demonblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang\"&gt;Shadowfang&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was overcome by the &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Legion\"&gt;demonic legions&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong after Izual's fall, a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; made their own assault on the Hellforge. It was their intent to use the Anvil of Annihilation to destroy &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"soulstone\"&gt;soulstone&lt;/a&gt; and after retrieving it, &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s as well. In both counts they were successful, and the soulstones were destroyed and their contained spirits supposedly banished to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. They were the first mortals to have ever entered the Hellforge.\nGame Effect.\nThe Hellforge appears in &lt;a href=\"The%20Harrowing\"&gt;Act IV&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and is protected by an &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Hephasto%20the%20Armorer\"&gt;Hephasto the Armorer&lt;/a&gt;, who holds the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge%20Hammer\"&gt;Hellforge Hammer&lt;/a&gt; required to smash the Soulstone. During &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;, your hero completes a quest named &lt;a href=\"Mephisto%27s%20Soulstone%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Mephisto's Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, where he/she smashes Mephisto's soulstone using the Hellforge and the Hammer.\nHowever, you do not need to have Mephisto's soulstone in your personal inventory. Either this may be a bug, or somehow, &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;'s magic allows him to &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; the soulstone directly to the Hellforge when you are there and ready to use it. All you really need is to wield the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge%20Hammer\"&gt;Hellforge Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and whether it's on your inventory or in your &lt;a href=\"stash\"&gt;stash&lt;/a&gt;, you will still be able to complete the soulstone-smashing &lt;a href=\"quests\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; with it. Nevertheless, the soulstone is found to have vanished once you reopen your Stash.\nWhen the soulstone is destroyed it gives several perfect and flawless gems as well as a potentially high-level rune. It is common to offer the reward for characters' Hellforge quest in exchange for a &lt;a href=\"rush\"&gt;rush&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe possible runes vary by difficulty:\nNote that each possible rune has an equal chance to drop (1:11), meaning the odds you'll get a Gul in Hell difficulty are exactly the same as the odds you'll only get a Hel."}

This may indicate that the Dark Demons in the trailer were greatly powered down, or that the player character had already reached a level so high that the power of Dark Demons were insignificant before him. Exactly how difficult it would be to face a Dark Demon is currently unknown."}

{"id": "41150", "revid": "2011810", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=41150", "title": "Helliquary", "text": "Helliquary is a gameplay system of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\". It is intended for endgame play.\nLore.\nThe Helliquary is an ornate chest fashioned from precious metals, crystal, and gems. It was built to locate particularly destructive &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; and trap their &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; when they're slain. Once the demon is defeated, the Helliquary can turn their remains into power an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; can take advantage of. Though unstable, the Helliquary is capable of funneling the power of defeated demons to a sufficiently daring subject. The remains of the demon are sealed inside the Helliquary, containing the darkness, and the energy is channeled into the subject, without any noticeable corruption. However, the risks of this process remain unknown.\nAt least in theory, the Helliquary is capable of channeling the essence of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s as well.\nThe Helliquary was designed to be reinforced by &lt;a href=\"scoria\"&gt;scoria&lt;/a&gt;. The stronger it becomes, the stronger its user(s) become as well. The device is small enough and light enough to be lifted by an ordinary &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince it was upgraded by Rayek, multiple parts of a demon can be sealed in the Helliquary at a time.\nHistory.\nThe Helliquary was built by &lt;a href=\"Rayek\"&gt;Rayek&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt;. Rayek hoped to use his creation to stop demonic incursions before they happened, and prevent the doom that came to his &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;homeland&lt;/a&gt; from ruining other lands. After building the device, he detected dark energy coming from the &lt;a href=\"Einfrinn%20Tree\"&gt;Einfrinn Tree&lt;/a&gt;. Studying the tree, he discovered that the Helliquary had become entangled with energy leaking from the tree, and that the tree itself was holding back a powerful demon. He suggested using the Helliquary to lend power to the tree, as it was growing weaker by the minute.\nTo this end, he enlisted the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt;. After receiving a vision of the future from the tree, they retrieved the remains of &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Herald%20Pyl\"&gt;Chaos Herald Pyl&lt;/a&gt;, which were used by the device.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231272\"&gt;Two years later&lt;/a&gt;, Rayek was put in charge of &lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Workshop\"&gt;Cain's Workshop&lt;/a&gt; after Cain travelled. He built an alter in the backroom of the workshop that could boost the sensing range of the Helliquary. Unfortunately, an energy reading originating from &lt;a href=\"Bilefen\"&gt;Bilefen&lt;/a&gt; interfered with the altar. Rayek sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; to help him track the source of the energy. The interference originated from a &lt;a href=\"cracks\"&gt;fissure&lt;/a&gt; venting demonic energy which corrupted the surrounding &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt;. Using the energy as a reference, Rayek located similar fissures at &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Rayek asked the Shard-seeker to gather energy samples from the other fissures, but not before upgrading the Helliquary. By placing the improved Helliquary on the altar, and using the procured energy samples as a reference, Rayek scried a new set of demons \u2014 the third so far. He named them the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthrot\"&gt;Hearthrot&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGameplay.\nThe Helliquary becomes available once the player's character reaches &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 36. After this, players will reunite with &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Cain introduces the player to &lt;a href=\"Rayek\"&gt;Rayek&lt;/a&gt;, who's developed the Helliquary. This is part of the &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Helliquary\"&gt;Opening the Helliquary&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOverview.\nThe Helliquary is a powerful creation forged to defend against battle some of the most powerful demons from the Burning Hells.\nDemonic Remains.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Remains\"&gt;Demonic Remains&lt;/a&gt;\"\nOther Information.\nPlayers may solo the Helliquary, or do so as part of a group. The Helliquary allows up to 8 players at a time (this can be in a &lt;a href=\"warband\"&gt;warband&lt;/a&gt;) to locate and defeat &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es in order to not only power up their characters, but also to benchmark their power. If a player's character defeats a boss, they receive a power boost. Multiple difficulty levels are available for each boss; the difficulty of bosses increases with each subsequent &lt;a href=\"Hell%20%28difficulty%29\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt; difficulty. Some Hell difficulties can only be unlocked through defeating corresponding Helliquary bosses. Within the Helliquary &lt;a href=\"dungeon%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; itself, the difficulty scales to players' respective difficulties.\nEach player has one revive in the Helliquary. Otherwise, they need to rely on other players to revive them. When a player dies more than once during a raid, resurrecting them will incur an increasing cooldown.\nThe Helliquary has a leaderboard system, where warbands compete for the best positions. The top leaderboard team gains extra scoria. For a warband to take part in a Helliquary raid, at least four warband players must be present. The other four slots can be filled by other players. Completing the raid this way will still yield extra warband rewards for the warband members.\nSuccessfully completing a warband Helliquary raid for the first time will grant warband members an additional 400% drop rate increase for Sealed Warband Chests. This bonus resets every Monday and Thursday.\nObjectives are cycled weekly.\nIn a full (8-member) raid, the top 3 damage contributors earn a Chest of Glory containing 6 &lt;a href=\"Beguiling%20Dust\"&gt;Beguiling Dust&lt;/a&gt;. This chest opens automatically.\nList of Bosses.\nWrathborne.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wrathborne\"&gt;Wrathborne&lt;/a&gt; are the first set of Helliquary bosses. Their order of introduction is as follows:\nVoidwound.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Voidwound\"&gt;Voidwound&lt;/a&gt; are the second set of Helliquary bosses. They were all introduced to \"Immortal\" simultaniously as part of the &lt;a href=\"Terror%27s%20Tide\"&gt;Terror's Tide&lt;/a&gt; update. Their order of progression is as follows:\nHearthrot.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hearthrot\"&gt;Hearthrot&lt;/a&gt; are the third set of Helliquary bosses, released as part of the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Destruction's Wake&lt;/a&gt; update. Their order of progression are as follows:\nSoulhewn.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Soulhewn\"&gt;Soulhewn&lt;/a&gt; are the fourth set of Helliquary bosses, released as part of the &lt;a href=\"Splintered%20Souls\"&gt;Splintered Souls&lt;/a&gt; update. Their order of progression are as follows:\nStormspawn.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormspawn\"&gt;Stormspawn&lt;/a&gt; are the fifth set of Helliquary bosses, released as part of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Unmaking\"&gt;Age of Unmaking&lt;/a&gt; update. Their order of progression are as follows:\nDreadbirth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dreadbirth\"&gt;Dreadbirth&lt;/a&gt; are the sixth set of Helliquary bosses, released as part of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Shattered Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; update. Their order of progression are as follows:\nDemons by Difficulty.\nEach &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Difficulty&lt;/a&gt; offers a different set of demons to challenge. The last boss on each difficulty must be defeated to unlock the next difficulty, with the exception of Hell I, which is unlocked by defeating Lassal.\nHistory.\nThe Helliquary originally unlocked between levels 41\u201345. Originally, the Helliquary was said to have been developed by &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt;, while in the final version, its creation can better be attributed to Rayek.\nAt some point, the Helliquary became available when the player completed the &lt;a href=\"Bilefen\"&gt;Bilefen&lt;/a&gt; questline. In the final version, the player just needs to reach level 36.\nOriginally, the Helliquary could only be attemtped as part of a group. As of the &lt;a href=\"Terror%27s%20Tide\"&gt;Terror's Tide&lt;/a&gt; update, the Helliquary may be soloed.\nThe original Helliquary dropped &lt;a href=\"Scoria\"&gt;Scoria&lt;/a&gt;, which had to be taken to &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; to be refined into &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Scoria\"&gt;Hellfire Scoria&lt;/a&gt;; this was removed when the Voidwound bosses were added.\nOriginally 4 members of the same Warband had to participate in a Helliquary raid to earn Warband Points. This requirement was dropped in the September 21 2023 update.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Unending%20Storm\"&gt;Unending Storm&lt;/a&gt; update, the &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;difficulties&lt;/a&gt; were reworked, and as a result the bosses available to challenge were updated as well. The bosses for each difficulty before the update were as follows:\nBecause there was no room for them in the new system, Vitaath, Gorgothra, Izilech, the Twin Terrors and Vhansoon can no longer be challenged. Their &lt;a href=\"Trophies%20%28Diablo%20Immortal%29\"&gt;trophies&lt;/a&gt; were retired and moved into the Legacy category. Nevertheless, these bosses (except for the Twin Terrors, which didn't appear before) can still appear as echoes during a Helliquary Surge.\nIn the update, the quick matching feature was extended to work cross-server.\nOriginally the Heavy Austere Chests had to be opened by having four players activate the chest at the same time. In the update, this was changed such that the chests open automatically.\nIn the update, Vitaath, Gorgothra, Izilech, and the Twin Terrors were added back on Normal difficulty.\nOriginally the Chest of Glory for top damage contributors had to be opened manually. This was changed in the update to open automatically.\nThe update added a damage tracker showing the top 4 players, and a spectator mode for dead players to continue to watch the raid."}

The very ground of the mortal realm is morphed by the surge in demonic activity as the sky darkens, rivers run red, and meteors fall upon the mortal realm, as Sanctuary gives way to &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell's&lt;/a&gt; influence. Entire &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt;s can be caught in helltides, their inhabitants entranced into worshipping Hell.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; sought to rally forces against the demons who emerged in helltides, and salvaged demonic &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s left in a helltide's wake. After the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Harvest\"&gt;Blood Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, the legions of Hell regrouped to coordinate a display of force, resulting in a new form of Helltide.\nIt was later discovered that these new Helltides were a harbinger of things to come, as the legions of Hell mustered behind its &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Hell\"&gt;gates&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nHelltides are region-wide events that are available to players from World Tier I onwards. Overall monster density shifts with tier. &lt;a href=\"Town\"&gt;Town&lt;/a&gt;s can be temporarily consumed by a helltide, forcing their NPCs into worship.\nHelltides occur randomly in the open world, and last for about an hour. Helltides appear on the map as red zones. A Helltide lasts 55 minutes, with 5 minutes of downtime before the next one appears in a different area.\nDemons in an area are empowered, and their monster level is greater than the player level, but their loot drops correspond to the surge in difficulty. &lt;a href=\"Monster\"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;s killed in a Helltide potentially drop &lt;a href=\"cinder\"&gt;cinder&lt;/a&gt;s that can be spent to open Helltide Chests in the respective region. Some Helltide chests can drop &lt;a href=\"unique%20items\"&gt;unique items&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hellworm\"&gt;Hellworm&lt;/a&gt;s will sometimes rise from the ground, depositing more demons.\nSome crafting materials are only found in Helltides, such as the &lt;a href=\"Fiend%20Rose\"&gt;Fiend Rose&lt;/a&gt;.\nHellspires can be found within a helltide. When activated, the spire generates a wave of demons for the player to fight. Ravenous Soulspires drain a player's health.\nAs a player cleaves their way through a Helltide, they generate Threat. Threat is earned based on the difficulty of the monsters the player slays and how often they're opening Tortured Gifts within a Helltide. There are three Threat Levels in total, with each level increasing the danger and frequency of ambushes. Once a player hits Level 3, they will become Hell-Marked. When a player has been Hell-Marked, they'll be besieged by a frenzy of densely packed monsters. If they make it out alive, a &lt;a href=\"Hellborn\"&gt;Hellborn&lt;/a&gt; will come for them. The Threat level resets once the Hellborn ambush has been activated, or if the player is killed.\nDevelopment.\nHelltides were originally only available at World Tier Three."}

However, in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, unable to ignore the corruption that had gripped &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt;, he departed his homeland and come to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt; to commune with the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Inifuss\"&gt;Tree of Inifuss&lt;/a&gt;, and use its &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the corruption. On his way to the tree, he encountered a &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;group of cultists&lt;/a&gt; who were searching the woods for something. However, he was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; (a separate cultist group) who wanted him to use his Druid magic to spread their corruption through the woods. Hemlir refused, even as the Bloodsworn tortured him, almost killing him in the process. \nSalvation arrived as a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;hero/group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; entered the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn%20Den\"&gt;Bloodsworn Den&lt;/a&gt;, killing his captives and freeing him. &lt;a href=\"Kashya\"&gt;Kashya&lt;/a&gt; arrived, and noted that Hemlir had lost a lot of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. She took him back to her encampment. There, he met with the hero(es) who had rescued him, thanking them for their deeds. He told them about the ritual he had intended to conduct at the tree, but he lacked the strength to gather the resources himself. He gave them the list of ingredients he needed. The hero(es) returned, and Hemlir conducted the ritual. However, it failed, much to his dismay. He turned to &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; for advice, who intoned that it was &lt;a href=\"dark%20magic\"&gt;dark magic&lt;/a&gt; that had corrupted the Dark Wood, and as such, dark magic was needed to bind the ritual. He told the hero(es) of the cultist camp he'd encountered before being captured by the Bloodsworn; that if they were after dark magic, that was where they were going to find it. He told them to meet him at the Tree of Inifuss with all four components. He also told them to talk to &lt;a href=\"Hess\"&gt;Hess&lt;/a&gt;, who had made something for the hero(es) at his request.\nHemlir arrived at the tree, but was attacked by the Bloodsworn, injuring him. However, the hero(es) rescued him, handing him an ember of &lt;a href=\"dark%20magic\"&gt;dark magic&lt;/a&gt;. Using the four components, he conducted a ritual, connecting his conciousness to the tree, and indeed, the whole forest. The hero(es) protected him from attacking Bloodsworn. The use of dark magic disfigured his face, but the tree, guiding Hemlir's sight, showed him the darkness that was corrupting the land. He told the hero(es) that the power of the tree would aid them...for a price. Hemlir offered his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; to the tree in exchange for banishing the corruption. The tree instead extracted the corruption from within the Druid, coalescing into a &lt;a href=\"Hemlir%27s%20Shadow%20Clone\"&gt;shadowy being&lt;/a&gt; that Hemlir's companion(s) promptly slew. Hemlir revealed to them what he had seen through the tree\u2014that the vines spoke of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rose\"&gt;Blood Rose&lt;/a&gt;, which fed &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt;. A woman with a &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;red stone&lt;/a&gt; around her neck. He told them that as long as the Blood Rose continued to feed the Countess blood, she could not be slain. He told them that Inifuss could purge them of their own lingering corruption, before he disintegrated before their eyes.\nAkara heard of Hemlir's death, and declared that it wouldn't be in vain.\nIn-game.\nHemlir is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

He rose through the ranks of Hell to become a master armorer for the forces of darkness, serving as a minion of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. He toiled away in the &lt;a href=\"Hellforge\"&gt;Hellforge&lt;/a&gt;, molding incredible weapons for his comrades to use in battle. He would twist &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s to use as catalysts in the forge, and the remaining coals carried the mark of their torment. While his place at the fires of the Hellforge was coveted amongst jealous &lt;a href=\"Overlord\"&gt;Overlord&lt;/a&gt;s, none dared cross &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s with him lest he take the anguish of his lost glory out upon their bloated bodies.\nOne of Hephasto's creations was the &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Shard of Hate&lt;/a&gt;, which he delivered to Mephisto personally. \nHephasto was struck down by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; which had followed &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; into Hell during the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt;.

Years later, &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; reflected that it was possible that Hephasto could return, given that according to ancient &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; texts, demons have the potential to be reborn in Hell after their death.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nHephasto is found in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", located in the &lt;a href=\"River%20of%20Flame\"&gt;River of Flame&lt;/a&gt; zone.

As a minion of Baal, was driven to destroy everything he touched. Yet at the same time, he possessed the ability to create. Cain speculated that Hephasto managed to channel his destructive nature into the armaments he forged.

Once emerged, the arm starts pumping toxins, dealing Poison damage to everything within roughly 10 yards like a Plagued pool. This attack lasts at least 3 seconds, and Herald cannot do anything else while channeling it. Use it to your advantage to attack the Herald while he is helpless. Being &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt;ed or disabled with the hand in the ground will cause a Herald to stop channeling the attack.\nIn melee, they just deliver a close combat hit, also dealing a lot of Poison damage and inflicting\u00a0&lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverall, they are more of supporting fighters, as their ranged attack is easily avoidable, but multiple Heralds can infest a large area, blocking much of the path."}

Metus Ocultus) are a type of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic enemy encountered in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLore.\nHidden appear as sexless humanoids, sometimes glowing with infernal light. They dwell at the edge of the physical realm and the &lt;a href=\"Ether\"&gt;Ether&lt;/a&gt;, where they remain unseen by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; sight. They can quickly manifest and strike those that appear vulnerable. Hidden and others of their ilk feed upon the essence of fear. Entire groups of Hidden often delight in gathering invisibly in a particuarly good ambush site, only to waylay hapless mortals as they walk into their trap. Hidden become visible when they attack, but for many of their victims, by then, it is too late. When wounded, they will seek to retreat back into the Ether to heal themsleves. While invisible, Hidden exist partially within the physical realm, and can be affected by spells and weapons.\nHistory.\nThe Hidden were given the curse of invisibility by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; as a punishment for a simple crime. Only during conflict would the curse of their invisibility be broken, and so the Hidden seek it out whenever possible. Through the years, the Hidden learnt to use their curse as a weapon. The Hidden have made a mark on human culture, haunting human dreams, and living in the nightmares of children. Hidden were among the armies of &lt;a href=\"Bartuc\"&gt;Bartuc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Assur\"&gt;Assur&lt;/a&gt;, and were later sighted within the &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;Tristram Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; centuries later.\nIn-game.\nThe Hidden are most commonly found in the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs\"&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. They are most notable for being main enemies in the \"&lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20the%20Blind\"&gt;Halls of the Blind&lt;/a&gt;\" quest on &lt;a href=\"Level%207%20%28Diablo%20I%29\"&gt;Level 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs their name suggests, they are invisible; in terms of gameplay, it means that they only become visible when very close to the player (roughly 1-2 tiles), that is, at the distance where they can attack. In case of danger, they flee, becoming invisible again. However, while \"invisible\", they are not \"invulnerable, \"so a well-placed (or lucky) ranged attack can still kill them. The Hidden are somewhat dangerous in groups, as they can surround a hero before she/he is even aware of their presence.\u00a0Before they can attack, they have to materialize, however, and are vulnerable for a short period of time, allowing adventurers to attack the creatures before they have the chance to strike back.\nUnlike all other types of monsters, Hidden \"can\" spawn near the exit/entrance of the level, potentially ambushing the character (and perfectly fitting their intended role).\nUniques.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"The%20Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;The Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", Hidden are represented with &lt;a href=\"Accursed\"&gt;Accursed&lt;/a&gt; models."}

These events may be simple ambushes or may require players to examine an object to spawn monsters to kill or vice versa. Completing these events gives an additional reward.

The High Council was charged with overseeing Mephisto's containment. Over time however, Mephisto was able to corrupt the Council from within. This process took generations, and each generation of the High Council was more under Mephisto's sway than the one preceeding it. \nThe Council reached its nadir in the 13th century. Once faithful and generous leaders of their people, the ruling members of the High Council were twisted in form and spirit, and guided their followers down a darker path. Ruling from the shadows and speaking only through ensorcelled priests, these corrupted holy men abused their positions and misguide the faithful into attacking those who followed the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Their betrayal did not go unrewarded by Mephisto, who transformed them into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, granting them abilities far beyond their mortal followers. As demons, the Council members were zealous, and served their new master without question. However, the Council was defeated by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;, as they fought their way through Travincal.\nThis was not the end of the Council however.

Presided over by the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt;, it is a bastion of light and harmony.\nLore.\nThe concept of Heaven has been romanticized by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity over the ages, yet prior to &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;final assault&lt;/a&gt; on the realm, no mortal had ever set foot in the realm. But through observation, both direct and indirect, Heaven is a realm of clouds and light that seems to enjoy a perpetual dawn, stretching into infinity. However, despite these clouds, it never rains.\nIt is stated by the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the virtuous dwell in Heaven, but &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; noted that there appeared to be little hard evidence for this belief.\nThe glory of Heaven sometimes verges upon Sanctuary, turning hidden places of the mortal realm into hallowed ground.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; were spawned from &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;, Heaven came from &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;. After the final battle between the two deities and the birth of Creation, his spine spun out into the primordial darkness, where it slowed and cooled. Over countless ages it formed into the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;, around which the Heavens took shape and form. And thus, as the Hells gave rise to &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;kind, so too did the Arch give birth to angels. Two races who would war against one another for eons in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Conflict\"&gt;Great Conflict&lt;/a&gt; over the Worldstone. Heaven was besieged many times, yet over the conflict's history, no force ever succeeded in breaching the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Gates\"&gt;Diamond Gates&lt;/a&gt; and gaining access to the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd the Heavens Shall Tremble.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Days\"&gt;End of Days&lt;/a&gt;, Heaven had been in a state of decline for some time.\nHeaven's apparent impregnability came to an end at the hands of Diablo, the Lord of Terror having become a singular &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt;. The Diamond Gates were breached and for the first time in history, demons stepped foot inside the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt;. All hope seemed lost, and Diablo managed to reach the Crystal Arch itself. However, &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; were able to slay Diablo and prevent the Arch from becoming corrupted. As the arch shone once more, Diablo's corruption was cleansed from the realm. For a moment, it looked like both Heaven and the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;mortal realm&lt;/a&gt; could face a new dawn. Together.\nIt was a moment that did not last. Heaven continued to 'heal' after Diablo's assault, but the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; remained in the realm. After being recovered, it was guarded in the Silver City. However, its corruptive influence remained, and discord began to seep back into Heaven. Despite &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;'s protests, &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt; and the other Council members refused to move the artifact. With the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; he was able to retrieve it from Heaven, and the corruption lifted.\nReaper of Souls.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; assault on Sanctuary, the various factions of Heaven reacted differently. However, it was drawn into the conflict when the Reapers assaulted Heaven in order to prevent the Nephalem from pursuing &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; into the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt;. Malthael was subsequently defeated with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Imperius\"&gt;Imperius&lt;/a&gt;. However, this was not before the Reapers killed many angels, which prompted Heaven to shutter its gates to the realms beyond.\nThe Realms of Fate.\nAfter Malthael's defeat, the High Heavens were still recovering from Diablo's assault. To make matters worse, a new peril arose in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Realms%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Realms of Fate&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the Nephalem's battle with Diablo, &lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Fate\"&gt;Library of Fate&lt;/a&gt; were changing Heaven itself, transforming into small pockets reflecting the past, present, and potential futures, marring the skies of Heaven. Though none could make sense of why this has occurred, it still posed a threat to Sanctuary. Tyrael invited the Nephalem to investigate.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nHeaven is the focus of the &lt;a href=\"Act%20IV%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;fourth act&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDevelopment.\nDuring development of \"Diablo III\" (which was originally carried out by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20North\"&gt;Blizzard North&lt;/a&gt;), it was also intended that the game take place in Heaven. It featured a drawn out conflict between Heaven and Hell that players would interact with, in a situation similar to the Alliance vs. Horde paradigm from &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" series. After Blizzard North's version was canceled in 2005, and Blizzard Entertainment rebooted the project, Heaven remained in the game, but with an apparent artistic overhaul.\nThe version of Heaven that appears in the final version of \"Diablo III\" was developed by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Lee\"&gt;Peter Lee&lt;/a&gt;. He tried to give Heaven an uneasy feeling; filled with bright light, but the shape language is aggressive and spikey. This was done to keep with the overall theme of \"Diablo III\", that no one should feel comfortable in any location.\nKnown Locations.\nWhile Hell is divided into several realms whose borders constantly shift, the locations of Heaven remain static. Much of Heaven is concentrated within the Silver City, including its five notable domains (one for each member of the Angiris Council). Otherwise, the land outside the city is quite empty. The land itself is composed of light and sound. Every one of the domains can induce adverse psychological effects on humans, corresponding to the nature of the domain in question. These effects can be both positive and negative.\nUpon entering the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Pools of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Staalek\"&gt;Jacob Staalek&lt;/a&gt; found the air cold and devoid of moisture, which rapidly led to dehydration, as well as experiencing the \"not warm and friendly\" light there searing his eyes. This was likely due to the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; in the Heavens at the time, as well as &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt; and most of his angels having abandoned the realm for years.\nAt the borders of Heaven are portals that lead to other realms.\nExterior Locations.\nThe following are areas that exist outside the Silver City, but are still part of Heaven. This includes temporary fortifications of Hell."}

Rare items are denoted by a yellow-colored name.\nLike Magic Items, Rares have randomly selected magical attributes, but whereas Magic items generally have only one or two, Rare items have much more; up to 6 in some games. They are the highest tier where item attributes are completely randomized, even the name. Unlike Magic items, the name has no relationship to its attributes - the two words of the name instead come from a pool of possibilities determined by the item's type.\u00a0\nDiablo II.\nRares in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" can have 2 to 6 affixes. Affixes are selected by the game for Rare items in the same manner as Magic items. However, it randomly picks each one, with a 50/50 chance of it being a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"prefix\"&gt;prefix&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"suffix\"&gt;suffix&lt;/a&gt;. One Rare item can't have more than 3 prefixes or 3 suffixes. (&lt;a href=\"Jewels\"&gt;Jewels&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can only have two of each, instead of three). A single prefix or suffix can't be picked more than once. A Rare item cannot have more than one prefix or suffix from the same group (a set of prefixes or suffixes that have the same effect, in progressively larger amounts). This means you can't get two prefixes or two suffixes that do the same thing on one item. However, a prefix\u00a0\"and\"\u00a0a suffix with the same effect are possible.\nSome Rare items can also be found &lt;a href=\"socketed\"&gt;socketed&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0upon\u00a0&lt;a href=\"identify\"&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt;ing\u00a0them if they receive the &lt;a href=\"Mechanic%27s\"&gt;Mechanic's&lt;/a&gt; prefix.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Larzuk\"&gt;Larzuk&lt;/a&gt; can also add a socket to a Rare. By either means, each Rare item may only have a single socket.\nIn \"Diablo II\" Classic, rare items were potentially some of the best items in the game. They are often overshadowed in the expansion due to the variety of powerful &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Words\"&gt;Rune Words&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items\"&gt;Unique Items&lt;/a&gt;, but particularly good rares can often compete with the best Uniques.\u00a0\nDiablo III.\nRares in the &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;third game&lt;/a&gt; can have four to six magical properties (four primary and two secondary at maximum), except that the extra damage or attack speed bonus guaranteed on &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; items does not count against the total. Being &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;ed takes up one primary property, as with any other item quality in the game.

Rathma's parents were the ringleaders of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;'s creation, &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;; he balked against their different yet equally domineering ways from an early age.\nRathma was a key participant in the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, acting in the shadows alongside the mystical being &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt; to sabotage both his parent's causes and preserve the Balance by ensuring that neither his parents nor their respective races could dominate the future of the world. Subsequently, he was one of the few residents of Sanctuary able to recall the events of the war, which was assumed to be an allowance for the original nephalem due to their highly advanced ages by that time. He then established the Priests of Rathma along with founding necromancer &lt;a href=\"Mendeln%20ul-Diomed\"&gt;Kalan&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring the Balance would forevermore have its protectors even if the world could not remember the events that nearly destroyed it.\nBiography.\nBirth.\nThe first nephalem to come into being, Linarian was born to the &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, who, among their followers, had escaped the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Conflict\"&gt;Eternal Conflict&lt;/a&gt; of Heaven and Hell to create &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. \nEarly Life.\nLinarian was wise beyond his years, and among the nephalem, was the first to master &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. He made his home in &lt;a href=\"Kasama\"&gt;Kasama&lt;/a&gt;; a great underground city, where he was honored not dissimilarly from his parents. Linarian sought out the deep recesses of the world, and studied the cycle of life and death, teaching it to those willing to venture into his subterranean habitat. He spent years contemplating the mysteries of life and &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; alone, in the stifling quiet of a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Deathspeaker\"&gt;vacant temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his youth, Linarian had dreams of a world without &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt;. He realized that a descent into utter evil would mean terrible destruction for Sanctuary, whereas the complete absence of evil would result in stagnation and decay. He told his mother of his dreams, hoping that she would see the same truth that he did.\nThe Purge.\nThe renegade angels and demons, seeing that the nephalem were far more powerful than their parents, argued as to whether to kill or spare their new progeny. While Inarius weighed his options in solitude, Lilith lashed out and killed the remaining demons and angels to prevent them from harming the nephalem. Such was Lilith's savagery however, she did not discriminate between those she wished to eradicate, and those she wished to save, and as such, nephalem fell to her claws along with angels and demons. Among the nephalem slain was &lt;a href=\"Indira\"&gt;Indira&lt;/a&gt;; Linarian's closest friend and confidante. Linarian's tears turned &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;y over her body, and he spent Linarian spent days trying to resurrect her, before giving up. Tired and frustrated, Linarian abandoned the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, and retired to life a normal life as a farmer.\nHorrified, Inarius could still not bear to kill Lilith, and banished her into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. He then attuned the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; to cause the powers of the nephalem to diminish over time. Linarian later wondered if his informing his mother of his visions was what drove her to respond with such savagery. In the aftermath of Lilith's mass slaughter, Linarian Linarian tried to dwell in the present, the call of the Balance fading to whisper. He tried to find equilibrium in other pursuits. He found peace in the simplicity of the world around him.\nLegend of the Necromancer.\nThrough each subsequent nephalem generation, their powers diminished, effectively giving birth to the weaker, mortal race known as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. Living among the first generation of humanity, Linarian discovered a fundamental truth; that the forces of Light and Darkness would clash eternally, and that both were a threat to the world. During this time, Linarian met another woman named &lt;a href=\"Kessime\"&gt;Kessime&lt;/a&gt;. Centuries passed, and Kessime bore him many children, who in turn had children of their own. As the generations passed, Linarian's descendants became human. One branch formed formed the ul-Dyssian line. Kessime eventually passed away.\nCenturies after Lilith\u2019s banishment, Linarian had buried his lineage, denying his innate ability to control life and death. But when a ruthless queen shattered his peace and summoned him to the ruined &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Temple of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, Linarian had to take up the mantle to save Sanctuary from her twisted intentions. As his power grew, a familiar voice called to him from the darkness, showing him the potential of his talents and the perilous road he had to walk to understand them.\nThe Dragon.\nAt some point, Linarian was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a celestial being who was tied to Sanctuary. Aware of the threat that Heaven and Hell posed to Sanctuary, Trag'Oul, with some hesitation, took on Linarian as a student. He taught Linarian the concept of the &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the delicate interplay between the powers of order and chaos. Linarian eventually changed his name to \"Rathma\" (a name given to him by &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt;) which meant \"Keeper of the Balance,\" representing both his identity and his charge. Rathma proved himself an able student, and through Trag'Oul, received wisdom that angels and demons lacked. He began working to keep Sanctuary hidden from the High Heavens and limit the influence of the Burning Hells there. Rathma served Trag'Oul for centuries, and in doing so, kept the Balance within Sanctuary.\nThe Sin War.\nScales of the Serpent.\nRecruiting Mendeln.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, Rathma sensed the return of his mother Lilith, so he started searching for a way to stop her. Aware that Heaven had not discovered Sanctuary, he was willing to bide his time, and counter Lilith and Inarius as required.\nRathma and &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt; worked alone for some time until they knew about the young Ul-Diomed brothers (&lt;a href=\"Uldyssian%20ul-Diomed\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt;), both of whom distrusted Rathma and were very skeptical towards him. Nonetheless, after some time, Rathma decided to select Mendeln as his first disciple.\nHe talked to Mendeln through the reanimated body of &lt;a href=\"Achilios\"&gt;Achilios&lt;/a&gt;, before appearing to Mendeln directly. He was vague on the details, but gave his name as Rathma, before disappearing with Mendeln, leaving Achilios to shamble off. The two appeared in a realm of endless darkness. Ignoring Mendeln for a moment, Rathma conversed with Trag'Oul, discussing Lilith and Inarius, whom Rathma considered more likely to reduce him to dust than his mother. Mendeln, able to hear the conversation but not see Trag'Oul, demanded that the source of the second voice show itself. Rathma bid that the dragon show himself, reminding him that Mendeln was mortal, and that there couldn't be any explanation without Mendeln seeing the guardian.\nMendeln beheld Trag'Oul, and through him, realized that Rathma was Lilith's son. Rathma did not deny it, telling Mendeln that he was his distant ancestor, and through him, Inarius and Lilith were as well. Mendeln was taken aback at the revelation that all humans were descended of angels and demons, but Rathma assured him that neither he or Trag'Oul sought the son of Diomedes as their puppet. Rathma telepathically conversed with Trag'Oul, who relayed to Mendeln what the nephalem had told him. Hell was aware of Sanctuary's existence, and because of Lilith, it was only a matter of time until Heaven discovered the world as well. That even if Lilith was defeated and Inarius offered peace, Sanctuary would likely be destroyed by one faction or the other, since neither Heaven or Hell could abide the other side gaining control of the world. To avert this, they needed Mendeln's help.\nUldyssian and the Worldstone.\nRathma and Mendeln returned to Sanctuary, where they met with Uldyssian, who had been incapacitated by Lilith. Mendeln wanted to help from the outset, but Rathma held him at bay, telling him that Lilith would have slaughtered him if he tried to interfere directly. Uldyssian was taken into Trag'Oul's realm, who, like Mendeln, was aghast to learn that Rathma was Lilith's son, and demanded to know what Rathma was, if not a demon. Rathma explained that he was descended of Lilith and Inarius both, and that he was a nephalem. Uldyssian wanted to leave, and in a fit of anger, unleashed his powers. Rathma was aghast\u2014Trag'Oul had told him that they were too weak to do this. Trag'Oul responded that Uldyssian and \"the others\" were different, that they were neither nephalem or human, but something more. Uldyssian was cast out of the realm and found himself at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;. There, he met with &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, Rathma joined them and was disappointed to see how far gone Bul-Kathos was\u2014his original body had withered away, and only his spirit endured. Dirt and grass had formed around him, giving the semblance of a body. Regardless, Rathma informed Bul-Kathos that Lilith had returned to the world and that in such a situation, he could understand why he wished to show Uldyssian what lay inside the mountain. Bul-Kathos consented, and they entered the mountain via &lt;a href=\"teleportation\"&gt;teleportation&lt;/a&gt;, getting as close to the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; as possible before resorting to physical means. He told Uldyssian that Lilith had taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Serenthia\"&gt;Serenthia&lt;/a&gt;. Uldyssian was aggrieved, but Rathma told him that for now, they had to let Lilith play out the charade, as they had more important matters to deal with.\nRathma led Uldyssian into the Worldstone Chamber, where they were attacked by winged creatures. Uldyssian was able to dispatch them, once again catching Rathma off-guard as to just how powerful Uldyssian had become. He explained the nature of the Worldstone to Uldyssian, that it was not only because of the Worldstone that Sanctuary was hidden from Heaven and Hell but because of Inarius's tampering, every generation of nephalem had been weaker than the one before. Yet the latter clearly wasn't true, and Rathma realized that it was because of Lilith.\nHe and &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt; felt that &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; had great potential for helping them maintain the Balance, and he began to examine and watch Mendeln without Mendeln being aware. Rathma eventually confronted &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt; directly, and though the young man was doubtful at first, he joined forces with Rathma and &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the second necromancer in history. Even after Mendeln became his student, Uldyssian found it hard to befriend or even trust Rathma after what happened between him and Rathma's mother &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, humanity's nephalem birthright was returning. Uldyssian was merely the first.\nBut what to do next? Rathma admitted that he had considered altering the Worldstone to once again dampen humanity's powers, but left the choice to Uldyssian. Uldyssian settled on using the Worldstone to make humanity more powerful, given the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;. Uldyssian tried to alter the Worldstone's resonance, but instead altered the Worldstone itself, something that Rathma hadn't thought was possible. What this meant, however, Rathma couldn't say.\nThe Return.\nRathma and Uldyssian returned to Trag'Oul's realm, where they met with Mendeln. Uldyssian lost patience and demanded to know if his actions at the Worldstone had actually changed anything. Rathma said that they'd need time to observe, but Uldyssian had no patience for that. Trag'Oul interjected, stating that Inarius had become aware of the change in the Worldstone. Rathma sent Uldyssian back to Sanctuary, while he and Mendeln departed to meet with Inarius. They arrived somewhere in the region surrounding Arreat. There, they met with Inarius.\nThe reunion was strained, as was the manner of humanity and the nephalem. Inarius calmly stated that if necessary, mankind would be removed from the world, for it was only by his will they existed. Inarius, losing patience, entered Mount Arreat, and found the results of Uldyssian's handiwork. Rathma, enjoying his father's horror, declared that \"he has done the impossible,\" to which Inarius responded that \"he\" may have doomed them all, before disappearing in a flash of light. Rathma explained to Mendeln that only individuals like Inarius or Lilith should have been able to manipulate the Worldstone, but Uldyssian had changed it in a manner that the angel could not comprehend. Rathma warned, however, in regards to Inarius's parting threat, that the angel might seek to remake Sanctuary anew, rather than live in a world where there existed creatures he could not control. Which would mean the end of mankind if the angel went through with such an idea.\nIn the aftermath, Rathma and Trag'Oul sent Mendeln to Partha for what they called a \"final test.\" Mendeln completed it, but in the meantime, Trag'Oul lost all trace of Achilios. They realized that he must have been taken by an angel, and ergo, Heaven had discovered the existence of Sanctuary. Rathma fell into despair, believing all to be lost. He explained to Mendeln that against Lilith, against Hell, and even his father, he had been willing to play the long game, but with Heaven aware of the world's existence, oblivion was nigh.\nThe Veiled Prophet.\nA Time of Angels.\nThe Edyrem destroyed the Temple of the Triune. However, Rathma urged Mendeln to speak with Uldyssian, as he feared that his brother was growing arrogant as his powers continued to grow. Mendeln defended Uldyssian's actions in stamping out the remains of the Triune, but Rathma warned him that in doing so, Uldyssian was blind to Inarius's machinations. Mendeln assured him that Uldyssian was aware of Inarius, but the emotional wounds Lilith had made still lingered. In the meantime though, there was still the matter of Achilios. Neither Trag'Oul nor Rathma had been able to find him, and if an angel other than Inarius had indeed taken him, then the implications were dire. Rathma concluded that the angel who had abducted Achilios was &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had come to Sanctuary alone to judge Inarius for his crimes, along with the world of Sanctuary itself.\nFrom afar, Rathma watched as Uldyssian's army came under attack by a horde of mantises. They concluded that this was not the work of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;, and that someone was trying to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt; from reaching &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Rathma headed for the city himself. There, he met with Uldyssian, informing him that the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Council\"&gt;Mage Council&lt;/a&gt; and a number of guild leaders had been slaughtered, and their deaths pinned on the Edyrem. He also informed him that the link between Rathma and Mendeln had been cut. They were able to rescue Mendeln from the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Uldyssian wanted to go after &lt;a href=\"Malic\"&gt;Malic&lt;/a&gt;, but Rathma told him that the man was of no concern to them. The &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt; was approaching, with the intent of cleansing Sanctuary of the \"abominations\" that was the race of Man. Uldyssian declared that they would fight them, join forces with the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;, but Rathma said that they'd still likely lose. Thus, there was only one recourse left\u2014ally with Inarius.\nUldyssian was aghast at the suggestion. Mendeln too, suggesting that they ally with Tyrael. Rathma was aggrieved to hear confirmation that Tyrael had indeed come to Sanctuary, and told Mendeln not to trust him, warning him that regardless of whatever honeyed words the &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; of Justice had used, they could not trust him. Right now, Inarius was their only hope.\nThe Void.\nRathma entered the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, not materializing within Inarius's inner sanctum as a sign of respect. Meeting his father, however, the respect wasn't shown to him in return, with Inarius asking his son if he'd come to beg forgiveness for his sins. Not rising to the bait, Rathma laid out the looming disaster they faced, with the looming &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Host\"&gt;Heavenly Host&lt;/a&gt;. Inarius scoffed at the idea of an alliance, snidely asking who else they should add to the ranks. Rathma realized that his father had gone insane, outright refusing to believe that Tyrael had been on Sanctuary, and that even if a thousand Tyraels were on Sanctuary, they could not stand against him due to being tied to the Worldstone. As Inarius ranted, he let slip that Diablo had offered an alliance with him as well and that the slaughter in Kehjan was by his own machinations. Rathma still tried to reason with Inarius, but it was no use, as the angel cast him into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo save Rathma, Trag'Oul sent Mendeln into the Void. Mendeln was able to find Rathma in the darkness, surrounded in a sphere, but also had to contend with Lilith. However, Mendeln persevered, and managed to rescue Rathma, who was grateful for the rescue. However, it had come at a cost, as Trag'Oul revealed that by stretching out to find Rathma, he had slipped in his efforts to keep Sanctuary hidden. Thus, the Heavenly Host knew where to find the world.\nThe Battle of the Golden Path.\nRathma and Mendeln returned to the Edyrem, where Rathma told Uldyssian that Inarius intended to defeat Uldyssian personally as a display of his power, uncaring of the fact that any victory would last minutes before the Heavenly Host arrived. Indeed, they might arrive \"before\" the battle was finished. Uldyssian declared that whatever the outcome, they would die fighting, and led his army to Kehjan. Rathma advised him that Inarius would not attack during the night, that he wanted to slaughter the Edyrem during the light of day so that all of Sanctuary could behold it. He also advised Uldyssian not to move on the Cathedral at night, as he sensed that there was something \"out there.\" Uldyssian agreed. That night, as the Edyrem slept, Uldyssian conversed with Rathma once more. Rathma admitted that he could no longer sense his father's presence.\nMorning came early. Astoundingly early. They realized that Inarius had moved the sun itself, rising in the north, where the army had to march. Rathma advised that Inarius hadn't really moved the sun, but only altered the Edyrem's perception of it, but to Uldyssian, this was cold comfort. He was able to move the clouds themselves and negate the illusion.\nIn what would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Golden%20Path\"&gt;Battle of the Golden Path&lt;/a&gt;, the Edyrem did battle with the forces of the Cathedral of Light. The Edyrem succeeded, but with heavy cost, and Inarius himself remained to be dealt with. In the lull that followed, Rathma departed from the army, stating that he was going to find what help he could. A \"family gathering,\" as it were.\nRathma gathered the Ancients to his side, including Bul-Kathos. They charged into battle, one which had become a three-way fight between Heaven, Hell, and the Edyrem. The battle ended thanks to Uldyssian, who sacrificed himself to end the carnage. The Edyrem were frozen in place, with exceptions including Mendeln and Rathma. He revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; itself had come to Sanctuary, to determine the fate of the world and its peoples, along with Inarius. However, the location seemed to shift, and Rathma revealed to his companions that they were in Sanctuary, and in the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City\"&gt;Silver City&lt;/a&gt; at the same time.\nThe Council voted in favor of sparing Sanctuary and humanity, ironically thanks to Tyrael himself casting the deciding vote. Rathma and his companions watched as &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; himself presented himself before the Council, offering a truce. Hell would agree to stand aside from Sanctuary, just as Heaven would, to let humanity choose its own path towards light or dark. In return, Inarius would be handed over to Hell, as recompense for the loss of Lilith and &lt;a href=\"Lucion\"&gt;Lucion&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the memories of the Edyrem would be erased, and their abilities nullified, in order to let mankind begin again. Rathma and his fellow Ancients, however, would be allowed to retain their memories, for as Mephisto put it, \"they are few, and their day is already over.\"\nThe pact was made.\nThe Sin War was over.\nReunion.\nThe Edyrem had their memories altered, believing those to have died as having perished from plague. Mendeln was the exception, his memories retained due to his link with Trag'Oul. He left &lt;a href=\"Seram\"&gt;Seram&lt;/a&gt;, where he reunited with Rathma. Mendeln, desiring to separate himself from his old life, requested he receives a new name, similar to how Rathma had received his new name from Trag'Oul. Thus, Trag'Oul bequeathed the name of \"Kalan\" to him.\nRathma told Mendeln that they would head for Kehjan's jungles. Mendeln would bring some former Edyrem with him, where he would instruct them in the ways of the Balance. Rathma believed that one day, the Edyrem would return, and when that day came, they must not be an appendage to either Heaven or Hell. Preserving the Balance would help achieve that goal.\nThe Priests of Rathma.\nIn the years that followed, Mendeln founded the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;, known to many as the Necromancers. He began to teach others his skills and impart his understanding of the Balance. Rathma iwas venerated by the priesthood, who depicted him as a great writhing serpent. However, Rathma's ultimate fate remained a mystery. Those who achieved the rank of Master &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; within the priesthood were honored with a few bones from the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; minions that once served Rathma. These artifacts were generally used in the priest's gloves.\nDeath of the Necromancer.\nSometime during or before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;, Rathma was again tormented by the visions that had assaulted him before the Purge. This time, he codified his visions into written form, which took the form of &lt;a href=\"Rathma%27s%20Prophecy\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, who had returned to Sanctuary and re-founded the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, learnt of the prophecy and believed it pertained to him, seizing upon the line that referred to a spear piercing Hatred's heart. Rathma used a &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20Hell\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; to seal the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Hell\"&gt;Gates of Hell&lt;/a&gt;, but knew it was only a matter of time before Inarius came searching for him.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, Lilith returned to Sanctuary and started to search for a key able to open the gates to Hell. Rathma, being of possession of the key, locked himself in the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Necropolis of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, where Inarius found him. Rathma refused to give Inarius the key, having foreseen his death under Trag'Oul's eyes. Lilith later discovered Rathma's body pierced with his own staff, mourning for him as she would have saved a spot for him in the new world even if she didn't know whether he would choose to stand at her side or not. She took the key hidden inside his staff, vowing his sacrifice would not be in vain.\nLegacy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Animus%20Revenants\"&gt;Animus Revenants&lt;/a&gt; continued to worship Rathma after his death, while also pledging allegiance to Lilith. Their devotion to her deceased son met with her approval.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; lamented Inarius's murder of Rathma. He reflected that if Rathma had been alive, Lilith might have been stopped.\nWhen confronted by Inarius in Hell, Lilith questioned his actions of achieving redemption in the Heaven's eyes, including murdering their son. Inarius claimed he made it right to satisfy the High Heavens.\nIn-game.\nDiablo III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", there are multiple items from the &lt;a href=\"Bones%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Bones of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; set which are named after Rathma. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; class has a &lt;a href=\"Rathma%27s%20Shield\"&gt;passive skill&lt;/a&gt; that also bears his name.\nDiablo IV.\nAn apparition of Rathma and his corpse appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPersonality and Traits.\nWise beyond his years, Rathma was said to have inherited his &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;father's&lt;/a&gt; stoicism, and &lt;a href=\"Bul-Kathos\"&gt;Bul-Kathos&lt;/a&gt; regarded him as being without humor (not entirely true, as Rathma showed himself to be capable of dry humor at times), though the two had respect for each other. By his own admission, Rathma was a \"stubborn fool.\" He was a brooding and solitary individual, speaking in a \"bland\" tone most of the time, and valued the Balance of light and dark above any other consideration, believing it to be the best and only choice for Sanctuary. He resented both his parents, believing that Lilith sought to save the nephalem not out of any love, but to make them her own. He likewise considered his father to be capable of actions just as heinous. Rathma remained in the shadow of his parents until he became Trag'Oul's student, and in so doing, felt that he was no longer defined by them.\nRathma was tall and had very pale skin. His face resembled that of a normal human, but Mendeln noted that his features were angular and \"far too perfect.\" Uldyssian further noted the \"great age\" that he could see within Rathma's eyes. During the Sin War, he wore a dark cloak, and carried a dagger made out of bone. His hair was exceptionally dark, though after Uldyssian's sacrifice, streaks of gray appeared upon it.\nAbilities.\nRathma had the innate ability to control life and death. He was capable of shifting between Sanctuary and Trag'Oul's realm at will, and could &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; within Sanctuary. He could also pass through solid objects. He demonstrated an ability akin to telepathy, but it was not reading thoughts, but rather, the sensations behind them. In Rathma's view, this was far more accurate, as thoughts could be filled with lies."}

It came to Rathma in dreams; shattered images of the end of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, carried to him by the scales of &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt;. The thoughts of Rathma and Trag'Oul met, and they were able to piece together the elements of the prophecy. Rathma put it down in order.\nThe prophecy was believed to foretell the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt;, the return of &lt;a href=\"Lilith\"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, and the doom of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Rathma was again tormented by his visions sometime during or before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Enmity\"&gt;Great Enmity&lt;/a&gt;. This time, Rathma codified the prophecy into written form.\nInarius became aware of the prophecy sometime after forming the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. The \"light piercing hatred's heart\" line was seized upon by Inarius, who claimed that it was proof he was fated to kill Lilith. The Cathedral's priests went on about the prophecy \"ad nauseum\", and it was claimed that by this act, Inarius would be given the means to ascend to &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, and bring the faithful with him. Rathma used the &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20Hell\"&gt;Key to Hell&lt;/a&gt; to seal the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20to%20Hell\"&gt;Gates to Hell&lt;/a&gt;, but knew it was only a matter of time before Inarius came to him, demanding the key.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231336\"&gt;1336&lt;/a&gt;, Inarius journeyed into the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20of%20the%20Firstborn\"&gt;Necropolis of the Firstborn&lt;/a&gt; to confront Rathma; a confrontation that resulted in Rathma's &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of his father. Inarius returned to the surface and placed the prophecy in the Cathedral's gospel, and made it seem like he was the hero to save &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. \nTranscript.\nBurned Parchment.\nAnother fragment of the prophecy, known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Burned%20Parchment\"&gt;Burned Parchment&lt;/a&gt;\", can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Ruins\"&gt;Tormented Ruins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;:\nPossible Interpretations.\nI saw my corpse, and from my mouth crawled Hatred \n\"A father burned his children on a pyre,\"\nand a mother molded a new age from the ashes,\nI saw the weak made strong,\na pack of lambs feasting on wolves,\nTears of blood rained on a desert jewel, \nand the way to Hell was torn asunder, \nThen came a spear of light, piercing Hatred's heart,\nAnd he who was bound in chains was set free\nI saw a serpent coiling in the fires of the Eternal Conflict\na wise man with seven arms\nI saw a child give birth to a mother, \n...as Hatred\u2019s sun set and that of Terror and Destruction dawned.

They poke out the eyes of a demon or beast opposing the Druid. \"\nGeneral Information.\nSynergies.\nNote that this skill takes only base skill levels for other Summon skills not including all skill mods from eq, cries etc. into account; this is how most synergies work, since usually just blvl i.e. the raw skill points placed, without any mods, are used - but that's completely opposite to how Summon Spirit Wolf/Dire Wolf/Grizzly synergize between themselves.\nRavens can serve as scouts for players and are very useful in multiplayer. Each Raven has a chance to &lt;a href=\"blind\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt; an enemy it attacks (except &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt;s, and other players), allowing players to easily kill an enemy. The blind chance depends on \"player\" level, skill level, monster level, and on difficulty (the harder Difficulty, the shorter duration), up to the point where Slvl 16 Ravens have a 100% chance to blind foes of equal to, or lower, level than the Druid. Visually, Blinded foes show a curse like &lt;a href=\"Dim%20Vision\"&gt;Dim Vision&lt;/a&gt;, which impairs the normal application of other &lt;a href=\"Curses\"&gt;Curses&lt;/a&gt; and similar debuffs.\nRavens can be summoned in groups, allowing them to make rapid attacks as a swarm. Blizzard Q&amp;A has described the Raven skill as 'Attacks waiting to happen'; what they mean is that the Ravens fly too high to be harmed, and continue attacking until their number of strikes have been spent.\nFor each level, the Druid gains 1 additional Raven (to a maximum of five), and each Raven gains an additional attack and increased damage. Initially there was no limit to the amount of ravens summoned, but like &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Skeleton\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, they were capped.\nThe number of hits listed is per Raven. At level 1 the total number of hits you can get is 12 (1 x 12), at level 20 you get 155 (5 x 31). Once all hits are spent, Ravens must be summoned anew."}

A prodigy, Rayek witnessed the horrifying destruction wrought by &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;. Rayek survived the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent devastation of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;Northern Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. He determined that no other people should suffer the way the Barbarians had, and devised a way to prevent &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic invasions of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;1270&lt;/a&gt;, Rayek was in &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, where he met &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Charsi\"&gt;Charsi&lt;/a&gt;'s help, he created the Helliquary; a wondrous device built to locate particuarly destructive demons and trap their &lt;a href=\"essence\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; when they were slain. Rayek hoped to use his creation to stop demonic incursions before they happened, and prevent the doom that came to his &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Steppes\"&gt;homeland&lt;/a&gt; from ruining other lands.\nPer his construction of the Helliquary, Rayek detected a dark energy emanating from the &lt;a href=\"Einfrinn%20Tree\"&gt;Einfrinn Tree&lt;/a&gt;. While legend held that the tree was planted by King &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt;, Rayek believed that the tree was as old as &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; itself. Studying the tree, he discovered that the Helliquary had become entangled with the energy leaking from the tree, confirming what he had suspected; that the tree was demonic in nature. More specifically, the tree was holding back a powerful demon, but was growing weaker by the moment. \nRight on time, Rayek met with the hero(es) that Cain had sent his way. Rejecting their suggestion that the tree be destroyed, he suggested that they use the Helliquary on the tree, as it was a conduit of energy. He asked the hero(es) to use their strength, and focus their energy on the tree. The hero(es) passed out, and when they awoke, told Rayek that they'd seen a vision of Westmarch being destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Wrathborne\"&gt;Wrathborne&lt;/a&gt;. Rayek explained that the tree had given them a vision of the future. To avert it, he suggested that they use the Helliquary. If they added power to it, it would strengthen their connection to the Einfrinn Tree, and with enough power, they could use it as a gateway, taking the fight to the Wrathborne before they were ready. Bidding them to take the Helliquary again, he told them to focus on one of the demons they saw in their vision. The hero(es) obliged, and saw the location of &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Herald%20Pyl\"&gt;Chaos Herald Pyl&lt;/a&gt;. Rayek told them to go slay the demon, and bring him its remains. They obliged, and Rayek suggested that they channel the demonic energies into them. The process worked, and he led the hero(es) to Charsi to obtain &lt;a href=\"scoria\"&gt;scoria&lt;/a&gt; to reinforce the device. He told them that they would need to continue to reinforce the Helliquary as such in order to be powerful enough to access the gateway within the tree. He told them to go tell Cain about their vision, while he returned to the tree.\nThe Crimson Slag.\nSome time after &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Nightmares\"&gt;the mists spread on Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Slag\"&gt;Crimson Slag&lt;/a&gt; fell from the sky at the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Gate\"&gt;Wolf Gate&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Rayek sent a letter to the Shard-seeker, imploring them to investigate it.\nNew Threats.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; went on a journey, he handed his &lt;a href=\"Cain%27s%20Workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; over to Rayek to look after until he returned. Rayek built an altar in the secret room in the workshop, that would boost the detection ability of the &lt;a href=\"Helliquary\"&gt;Helliquary&lt;/a&gt;. When he tested it, an interference from &lt;a href=\"Bilefen\"&gt;Bilefen&lt;/a&gt; reduced its performance. He then called &lt;a href=\"the%20Shard-seeker\"&gt;the Shard-seeker&lt;/a&gt; to help him investigate the interference, and get a sample of it. The Shard-seeker returned with news that the interference originated from a &lt;a href=\"cracks\"&gt;fissure&lt;/a&gt; that was releasing demonic energy.\nWhen Rayek used the Helliquary to scry the source of the energy, it showed the visage of &lt;a href=\"Saarodan%2C%20Sky-Sunderer\"&gt;a demon&lt;/a&gt;. It also revealed similar fissures located at &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashwold%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ashwold Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Zavain\"&gt;Mount Zavain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Tundra\"&gt;Frozen Tundra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shassar%20Sea\"&gt;Shassar Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The other fissures were found to also be emitting demonic energy. Rayek used the Helliquary to scry energy samples from all the fissures, and it revealed in a vision that the six demons responsible for the fissures were in coalition with each other. He decided to name them &lt;a href=\"Hearthrot\"&gt;Hearthrot&lt;/a&gt;, and implored the Shard-seeker to seal them.\nPrecipice of Horror.\nC. &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231273\"&gt;1273&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Rift\"&gt;Terror Rift&lt;/a&gt;s began appearing at random over Sanctuary. Rayek explored one of these rifts and extracted a &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Essence\"&gt;sticky substance&lt;/a&gt; from it. When he touched it, he saw a vision of a &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Pillar\"&gt;pillar&lt;/a&gt; that acted as a beacon for the rift.\nAge of Unmaking.\nLater, Rayek was plagued with nightmares. He would see different locations twisted and burning red, like they were being swallowed by the Hells. On one such dream,he found himself in a warped &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt;. He sent a letter to summon the Shard-seeker, while he went to Wortham to investigate.\nAt Wortham,he found a breach in space, similar to what he saw in his dream. While studying it, the Shard-seeker arrived. They volunteered to enter the breach and put an end to whatever evil laid within. The Shard-seeker was successful and returned with a solid shard of the breach. Rayek took the Terrorwrought Shard, and after studying it, designed a device to access the verge. He gave the blueprint of the device to Charsi to help him build it.\nIn-game.\nRayek is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

However, given the close proximity of the two, this is a small difference, if at all.\nIn early material, the Helliquary was stated to have been built by Charsi.

Doubting his faith, he decided to put an end to sacrifices.\nAt one point, unable to bring himself to kill a girl named &lt;a href=\"Sara\"&gt;Sara&lt;/a&gt; in the name of Nereza, Rayeld murdered his father, fled with the girl (other cultists, shocked by the incident, did not even try to interfere), rushed to the top of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Tower\"&gt;Ancient Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and plunged his sacrificial dagger into Nereza's chest. Before she died, he saw the inhuman gaze of her eyes, and realized that Nereza was no goddess, but a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, and the evil the sacrifices were to prevent was not from the outside world, but from herself.\nThe dying demon killed Sara with her last breath, and her essence went through Rayeld into the island itself, cursing the land and the priest, condemning him to eternal torment for his sacrilege. Rayeld was welcomed as a hero by his people when they found out what he did, yet he realized that the corruption from Nereza's evil would eventually ravage the island. It indeed happened, the land becoming uninhabitable: any human stepping on its shores would be driven insane, if not killed earlier by the unseen evil force.\nRayeld attempted to contain the evil, not allowing it to expand to other lands. To do so, he erected magical wards and kept Nereza's spirit pacified by rituals and sacrifices (ironically, doing exactly what he was raised for, with the same purpose he once believed to be his path). Losing his sanity, he became known as The Crazed Man, living as a hermit on the island, only rarely to be seen by travelers and sailors coming to the shore (mostly from shipwrecks).\nUsing his knowledge of the binding rituals, Rayeld &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;ally enslaved majority of the creatures on the island, either by prayers, sacrifices, or simply by carving the warding runes into their skin. Though he himself eventually forgot how and why did he do this, he deeply regretted that he was forced to bind living beings to his will. &lt;a href=\"Sasquatch\"&gt;Sasquatch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Breaker\"&gt;Bone Breaker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wildwood%20Bulwark\"&gt;Wildwood Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Shipwrecked%20Soul\"&gt;Shipwrecked Soul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Specter\"&gt;Wood Specter&lt;/a&gt;s and (probably) more creatures of the island were all controlled by him. Rayeld even remarks in his records that he cannot remember if Sasquatches were humans turned feral by evil of the island, or he himself turned them into beasts to protect them from Nereza's corruption. &lt;a href=\"Abyssal\"&gt;Abyssal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Amputator\"&gt;Amputator&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Harvester\"&gt;Flesh Harvester&lt;/a&gt;s, who Rayeld could not control, he battled until forcing them to remain in their &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20Cave\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt;, though he soon learned that as long as the sea people's idols are not disturbed, they would not be aggressive in the first place.\nNereza's curse effectively made Rayeld immortal (of which he was perfectly aware), bringing him back from the dead should he be killed, to ensure his eternal torture. The only way to ensure his release would be to cleanse his spirit at the site of Nereza's death.\nIn-game.\nThe Crazed Man is a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Unique\"&gt;Super Unique&lt;/a&gt; foe found on the Greyhollow Island in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", in &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Mode\"&gt;Adventure Mode&lt;/a&gt; only. He can be found at one of two possible locations: either amidst the bone totems, or in front of the sacrificial altar.\nIn either case, he will not be hostile to the player, and in fact, will not even acknowledge their presence, being busy tending to the binding rituals. If talked to, or if his ritual is interfered with, he will turn hostile.\nIn either case, he will attack by hurling darkfire bolts that deal tremendous damage from afar. He has no other abilities. However, other monsters in the area will protect him, depending on the event.\nHe can also be encountered during the unmarked event atop the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Repose\"&gt;Forsaken Repose&lt;/a&gt;, if player touches any of his satchels (of &lt;a href=\"Testament%20of%20My%20Failure\"&gt;Testament of My Failure&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tome\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt;) after they collect both tomes. This opens a purple portal to the top of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Tower\"&gt;Ancient Tower&lt;/a&gt;, at the very site where Rayeld killed Nereza. He can then be talked to, and will tell that he waited for a long time for &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; to come to this place since their last visit.\nHe will then ask the Nephalem to cleanse his spirit. The player must first destroy his mortal form at the tower. This will be complicated due to Crazed Man gaining an extra ability to summon a slowly moving broad wall of darkfire, which, if touched by player, will deal significant damage over time. Moreover, he will now hurl darkfire bolts in clusters of three, being hit by all three is enough to kill an adequately geared hero outright.\nIf defeated, his ghost is released, continuing to fight on its own. In spirit form, he gains Illusionist affix, his darkfire bolts are replaced with equally powerful spirit bolts, and instead of the wave of flame, he will launch homing black gouts of spirit fire, which expire after short time.\nKilling him in his spirit form will lift the curse, supposedly liberating his soul, and opening the portal back to the island."}

However, there is evidence that the groundwork for the realm was laid long before, as references have been made to Skarn claiming parts of Hell for himself during the civil war that followed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce Skarn was defeated, Diablo's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was free to return from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Abyss\"&gt;Black Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.

A &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; in a Realms of Fate zone is typically to complete a randomized event (such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20King%27s%20Legacy\"&gt;The Black King's Legacy&lt;/a&gt;), cleanse a &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Chest\"&gt;Cursed Chest&lt;/a&gt;, or slay a Unique monster."}

The force was primarily led by &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;s, with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and other thralls serving under them. Information on the Reapers is scarce as most who encountered them perished. The &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lorath%20Nahr\"&gt;Lorath Nahr&lt;/a&gt; was an exception, and he took notes of the Reapers he encountered where no one else could.\nReapers of angelic origin are quite different from their relatives of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. Many Reapers show pale, tangible skin, and some (like &lt;a href=\"Anarch\"&gt;Anarch&lt;/a&gt;s) even have faces, although those appear like eyeless masks with disfigured facial features and a menacing grin. Others, like &lt;a href=\"Death%20Maiden\"&gt;Death Maiden&lt;/a&gt;s, are translucent and composed of ethereal streams. Tangible Reapers also have dark red blood (as opposed to the glowing blood that angels usually possess). Many of the angels in Reaper ranks are very similar to regular angels, but some (like &lt;a href=\"Ghastly%20Seraph\"&gt;Ghastly Seraph&lt;/a&gt;s) are changed beyond reason. The majority of angelic Reapers either lose their wings, or display the skeletal and gray remnants of them.\nHistory.\nMalthael departed Heaven after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;. Those of his servants who found him in &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium\"&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/a&gt; never returned to Heaven, and gathered to his side.\nThe Reapers were active on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; within two months of &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s abducted &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s in the night, as part of a process of gauging Sanctuary's defenses. &lt;a href=\"Soul\"&gt;Soul&lt;/a&gt;s of humans were researched and weaponized to augment the &lt;a href=\"Angelic%20Host\"&gt;Angelic Host&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Malthael's forces struck, they attacked all of Sanctuary, including &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. At Ivgorod, four of the &lt;a href=\"Patriarchs\"&gt;Patriarchs&lt;/a&gt; were killed, while at the Necropolis, many of the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; were slain, including their &lt;a href=\"Jurdann\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;. What transpired at Caldeum is unclear, but the Nephalem and &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; believed that the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolves\"&gt;Iron Wolves&lt;/a&gt; would be able to defend the city, just as they had done so against &lt;a href=\"Belial\"&gt;Belial&lt;/a&gt;. At Westmarch, an army of Reapers was raised from the city's slain defenders. At Westmarch at least however, the Reapers were defeated, and Malthael himself fell in the &lt;a href=\"Pandemonium%20Fortress\"&gt;Pandemonium Fortress&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nephalem\"&gt;the Nephalem&lt;/a&gt;. However, by the time of his defeat, the Reapers and/or the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soulstone\"&gt;Black Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; had ravaged cities and decimated entire populations, erradicating 90% of humanity. Misery followed for mankind as religious schisms, war, and famine ravaged Sanctuary.\nIn-game.\nThe Reapers are not seen until the player reaches &lt;a href=\"Act%20V%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Act V&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Many of the Reapers deal &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt; damage, so encounters can be made easier by stacking Cold resistance, or by making use of the &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20of%20Aranoch\"&gt;Talisman of Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;. Exceptions include &lt;a href=\"Urzael\"&gt;Urzael&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Maiden\"&gt;Fire Maiden&lt;/a&gt;s, who deal &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage instead. Champion, Rare and Unique Reapers will also also have their respective elemental affixes.\nAll Reapers, even those that are presumed to be &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, have their own unit type (\"Reaper\"). This means that bonus damage against undead, &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; etc. will have no effect on Reapers, and no items with bonus against Reapers exist in-game.\nAt many occasions, blue spirits can be seen possessing the still-living &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20Soldier\"&gt;soldiers of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, turning them into &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20Archer\"&gt;Revenants&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Revenants are slain, these spirits are released."}

It can only be used on three characters per season. A confirmation box explains the process before completing the rebirth. The player may select \"normal\" Seasonal mode or &lt;a href=\"Solo%20Self%20Found\"&gt;Solo Self Found&lt;/a&gt; mode. Upon accepting, the character will be marked as Seasonal, and all forms of character progress will be reset:\nOnly their choice of name, class, gender, and &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; status is preserved. In almost every way it is as if the original character had been deleted, and a new Seasonal one was created with the same character creation choices, with the exception of mailing the previous items.\nNote that many forms of progression are actually stored \"per account\" rather than \"per character\" - or more accurately, per &lt;a href=\"game%20mode\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt; on the account.

{"id": "50142", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki?curid=50142", "title": "Recovery", "text": "Recovery is an estimate of how quickly a character regains \"effective hit points\" (EHP) \"during combat\" in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\", and was formerly called Healing. It is one of the three \"effectiveness statistics\" estimated on the main &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; output, and &lt;a href=\"Toughness\"&gt;Toughness&lt;/a&gt; which is also measured in EHP. It predicts the number of EHP recovered per second while fighting, which can be compared to the maximum EHP (Toughness) to understand how quickly the character may return to full health after taking a large hit. Overall, these effectiveness statistics are designed to give players a quick way to judge the effects of changing items and skills; the percentage change to each of them that would occur is shown whenever a potential new item is hovered on in the &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\nContributing stats.\nAs with Toughness, \"effective\" hit points means Recovery is measured against the damage output of enemy attacks, not the raw amount of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; a character has. If attacks do less damage, then each Life point gained by healing is harder to lose again, and therefore more effective toward overall Recovery. So, Recovery is a combination of:\nRecovery is an approximate characteristic, arguably the most unreliable compared to Damage and Toughness. Direct healing from &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Active Skills&lt;/a&gt; are not included at all since they are unpredictable in their use. Increased effect from &lt;a href=\"Health%20Globe\"&gt;Health Globe&lt;/a&gt;s is included, but the spawn rate of Globes themselves varies. &lt;a href=\"Life%20on%20Hit\"&gt;Life on Hit&lt;/a&gt; and Life per Kill are included, but depend on the player's attack pattern - the Recovery stat assumes attacking constantly. (For this reason, &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; also contributes to Recovery.) &lt;a href=\"Life%20Regeneration\"&gt;Life Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; per second is the only truly constant healing effect, but often Life on Hit is a larger contributor.\nOn the other hand, stats that reduce damage are much more predictable, and they affect Toughness and Recovery by the same amount: &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, all &lt;a href=\"resistances\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s and powers, &lt;a href=\"Dodge%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Dodge chance&lt;/a&gt;, and a few others. The resistances are averaged, and not all attacks may be dodged, so actual regained Life may have different effectiveness depending on the attack being faced. As with Toughness, reduced damage from &lt;a href=\"elites\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt; or the guaranteed 30% damage reduction for &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Monks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20%28Diablo%20III%29\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; is not included.\nImpact.\nRecovery is measured in &lt;a href=\"Toughness\"&gt;Toughness&lt;/a&gt; units/Effective HP per second. Theoretically, dividing Toughness by Recovery gives the number of seconds a character would take to return to full health from near death - \"if\" they continued hitting enemies while taking no further damage. Due to these strict assumptions, it's often easier to focus on relative differences in Recovery than exact numbers. Furthermore, since Life per Hit is a large factor in Recovery, its value is not accurate outside of combat.\nVery low Recovery relative to Toughness may require frequent use of &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potions\"&gt;Healing Potions&lt;/a&gt; or even trips back to town to recuperate from fights. Very low Toughness relative to Recovery leads to dangerous rapid swings between low and high health during combat, while very low &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; output compared to the defensive stats leads to long fights and slow progress. Generally, Recovery should be kept high enough that healing from a large hit doesn't require pulling away from combat. The more hits can be avoided while maintaining high damage, the less Recovery is required.\nIn the endgame, using multiple percentage-based &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; powers is an especially effective way to increase both Toughness and Recovery. They apply multiplicatively with each other and do not suffer from the diminishing returns that would be encountered by stacking even more Armor or Resistance."}

With this aura, the Paladin shares the glory of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; with his vanquished enemies. With each administration of these final rites, the Paladin is redeemed physically as well as spiritually.\"\nGeneral Information.\nRedemption converts enemy corpses into &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0for the user. The amount converted is usually superfluous, even on very low levels. Corpses are converted regardless of whether the user delivered the killing blow themself.\nThis is a useful aura to use after (or even during) a pitched battle, where lots of minor monsters die, but it is conversely nearly useless in &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; battles. Getting rid of the corpses also prevents them from being &lt;a href=\"revive\"&gt;revive&lt;/a&gt;d or used for &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt;. However, Redemption is also problematic for the same reasons: other classes may need corpses too, and using Redemption restricts teammates\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s. Communication with other party members is useful when using this skill.\nRedemption does not restore Mana or Life to other party members, &lt;a href=\"Pets\"&gt;Minions&lt;/a&gt;, monsters that have been &lt;a href=\"Conversion\"&gt;converted&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Hirelings\"&gt;Hirelings&lt;/a&gt;. It also has no effect on corpses that &lt;a href=\"Slain%20Monsters%20Rest%20in%20Peace\"&gt;rest in peace&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Redemption is active, each corpse in range will have a \"chance\" to be redeemed per tick (that is, every second). As more points are put into Redemption, the chance to redeem increases, allowing the aura to work much faster. However, unlike most Auras, Redemption does not grow in range as it is leveled.\nThere is also an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; that gives this Aura: the &lt;a href=\"runeword\"&gt;runeword&lt;/a&gt; .\nSkill Progression.\nRadius: 10.7 yards"}

However, even the most adept of &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s often find themselves in great physical danger while exploring savage places searching for arcane knowledge. To compensate for this vulnerability, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; developed a form of telekinetic magic that bends the force of a physical attack back onto the attackers. Aided by this reflective spell, even the meager melee combat skills of a mage can prove to be quite effective. An aggressive creature becomes the victim of not only the mage's blows, but also of its own.\""}

Lots of treasure hunters passed through their doors. Another group that passed their doors were a group of guards who spent their time in the common room drinking cheap swill. Reiter enjoyed their company. One of them, took it upon himself to teach Reiter \"the ways of the world.\" Most of the conversation focused on how to get \"any little pretty\" to agree to a night of companionship.\nThe First Meeting.\nOne month later, a &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; came into the inn, accompanied by a much younger apprentice. The Crusader, whose name was &lt;a href=\"Anajinn\"&gt;Anajinn&lt;/a&gt;, was female, and he noticed that the girl she'd brought with her was about his own age. He found himself attracted to her. The elder Crusader asked whether Reiter's father leant out &lt;a href=\"tomes\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; to his patrons, which was true. Reiter was dumbfounded that these two would have trudged through a sandstorm simply looking for books. At his father's orders, Reiter fetched the newcomers water, and noticed (at least in his own mind) that the Crusader's apprentice appeared to like him as well. Anajinn went with Reiter's father to the inn's library (she wanted books pertaining to &lt;a href=\"Ureh\"&gt;Ureh&lt;/a&gt;), while Reiter stayed with her apprentice as she cleaned her armor.\nReiter noticed that the symbols on her armor looked like &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; markings, which the girl confirmed they were. However, despite Reiter's first conclusions, she told him that she wasn't a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, and nor was her master. Reiter pressed on, trying to flirt with the girl, but didn't have much luck\u2014the advice the guard had given him a month prior wasn't paying off. Choking on his own words, he began scrubbing the girl's armor himself, which caused not only the bowl of water used for cleaning and its table to flip, but caused smoke smelling of &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; and sulphur to fill the air. Reiter screamed while the girl took the armor and threw it outside, where a green flame consumed the armor in a flash. Reiter's father and Anajinn came upstairs, wanting to know what had happened.\nThe apprentice burst out laughing, explaining that Reiter had put water on dry &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;'s blood. Anajinn explained that they'd cleared out a nest of demons that had plauged &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;'s caravans for the last few years, and that the creatures had an adverse reaction to water. Anajinn and her apprentice engaged in banter and jokes, at Reiter's expense. Humiliated, he fled the room, making it personal mission to avoid the two women for as long as they remained in the inn (about a week). In that, he was mostly successful, though the apprentice did find him to appologize for her remarks. Reiter barely listened, thinking that the pair seemed crazy anyway, what with all this talk of demon blood. When it came time to leave, Reiter and his father watched him go, as his father told him about what he knew of Anajinn. That he should have asked about it. Reiter murmured unenthusiastic agreement.\nThe Second Meeting.\nThe years went on. Reiter married &lt;a href=\"Bea\"&gt;Bea&lt;/a&gt; (a girl he knew from the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; he lived in) and took over running the inn as his father began to sucumb to age, which took its toll on both his body and mind. His marriage with Bea wasn't perfect either, as he noticed that she often made him \"feel low for no reason.\" One day, he received a visitor. Anajinn, whom he hadn't seen for about eight or nine years. He noticed that she actually seemed younger, and she told him that she had not yet found an apprentice. Puzzled (hadn't she had one before?), he led her up to a room. After that, he led her to the library. It was here that he noticed something\u2014the Anajinn he'd seen nearly a decade ago had brown hair, but this one had blonde hair. Just like the apprentice. It \"was\" the apprentice.\nNot knowing of the Crusaders' conventions of apprentices taking the names of their masters, Reiter was dumbfounded by the girl's insistence that her name was Anajinn, and accused her of trying to trick him. To embarass him like she had all those years ago. She imparted that she took up her master's name and shield for herself, leaving the implication hanging in the air that her master was dead. Now, she was no longer seeking Ureh, but rather the lost memoirs of &lt;a href=\"Tal%20Rasha\"&gt;Tal Rasha&lt;/a&gt;. Reiter, still skeptical (and wondering if the girl was insane), left her to it, thinking it might be better to just sell the inn's books off.\nBack in the common room, one of the patrons (a man with similar Zakarum symbols on his armor) asked Reiter about the woman he had shown to the library. He told him of the girl, how he had seen her all those years ago. Reiter felt ill at ease with the man's questions, and even more so when he accused him of sheltering a heretic. He called himself a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;Hand of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, and that the woman was not filled with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, but something else. If Reiter was loyal to the faith, he could not shelter such a person in his inn. He babbled, mentioning that the woman called herself a Crusader, which caught the Paladin's attention. He ordered Reiter to have the woman meet him outside the inn, so that he might examine her. The Paladin headed upstairs, and Reiter could hear him putting on his armor. \nReiter went to the library to tell Anajinn of this, but she appeared unfazed by the Paladin's threats. Losing patience, he demanded to know why a book would be more important than a man threatening to kill her, and why she'd come back to the inn. She told Reiter that she was looking for something to save the Zakarum faith. That the existence of the Crusade was kept secret from all but the most senior members of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;Hand of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;. Acknowledging that Reiter felt threatened, she stated that she would leave immediately. However, she asked if she could buy the book she was currently reading.\nFrom the safety of the inn, Reiter and Bea watched Anajinn and the Paladin duel in the street. It didn't last long, as Anajinn called upon the powers of the Light and reduced the Paladin to his separate body parts. The couple watched as Anajinn headed off down the street.\nIntervening Years.\nIn the intervening years, Bea gave birth to their daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lilsa\"&gt;Lilsa&lt;/a&gt;. When bandits attacked Caldeum's Rest, they managed to hide from them by using the inn's storeroom.\nThe Third Meeting.\nYears after Anajinn's confrontation with the Paladin, Reiter was again confronted by &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s of the Zakarum faith\u2014three of them. They tortured him for information concerning the death of their fellow Paladin, and Reiter told them all he knew. He gave them the name \"Anajinn,\" which was more than they had before. The Paladins eventually relented, but told him that if the Crusader ever entered his inn again, he must tell them immediately. These were terms that Reiter hastily agreed to, and the Paladins departed, leaving him a sobbing wreck. He was approached by his Lilsa who didn't buy her father's explanation that the \"nice men\" had found somewhere else to stay in Caldeum's Rest. When he asked about Bea, Lilsa said that she was \"out back with the nice ladies wearing the shiny metal.\"\nIt didn't take Reiter long to realize who Lilsa was talking about. It only took him slightly longer to head outside and find his wife treating a pair of Crusaders. One of them was Anajinn, the other a young girl. Anajinn had been injured by a demon's &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt;, and Bea was treating her wound. Reiter was furious at first, but softened his demenor after he heard what had happened. However, the Paladins' visit fresh in his mind, he still demanded that they leave. Bea objected, but he held firm\u2014he had a daughter, a pregnant wife, and an inn to protect. To his surprise, Anajinn agreed, but Bea interjected, stating that the Crusaders could stay in the inn. They could stay in the storeroom, and as they'd not used the desert road, no-one would know they'd arrived. Anajinn explained that due to the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, the Paladins would be in a vengeful mood, and might take out their anger on the town. As such, everyone in Caldeum's Rest was potentially in danger.\nBea let them stay in the storerooms while she had words with her husband. The two disagreed on the right course of action, and in the process, Bea brought up Reiter's now-deceased father, claiming that he would have been ashamed of his son. The words cut deep, and Reiter was left alone to consider the situation. He thought back to when Anajinn had defeated the Paladin all those years ago, but not only was she outnumbered this time, but she was wounded. If just one Paladin survived a battle with her, that could mean disastrous consequences for her family. With some amount of rationalization, he set off to find the Paladins, to inform them of Anajinn's presence.\nReiter found the &lt;a href=\"Cennis\"&gt;lead Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, currently in the midst of torturing a blacksmith for information. The Paladin was acting irrationally by now, and bound Reiter with bands of Light, along with blinding him, his eyes turning pure white. He was marched through the streets, and could only silently pray for the Paladins to spare his family. He heard Anajinn emerge to face the Paladins, stating that she would do what was necessary to spare his family. He noticed that her voice was laced not with incrimination, but with sadness. Anajinn engaged in battle with the Paladins while her apprentice led Reiter away. While he couldn't see the fight, he could hear it, and could hear his inn taking a lot of collateral damage. The apprentice led him down an alley to Bea, who told her to go help Anajinn.\nAnajinn, wounded, returned to the pair while her apprentice continued to fight. She told them to hide, that if the Paladins found them, they would not be merciful. Bea ran off to get Lilsa. They returned and moved with Reiter, but one of the Paladins caught up with them, taking Bea and Lilsa hostage. The Paladin demanded that Anajinn cast her weapons and armor aside, or he would kill them. Reiter begged for mercy, but the Paladin wasn't listening. Anajinn thus caved in to his demands. After that, the Paladin killed her. However, Anajinn's apprentice avenged her moments later. The apprentice, who immediately took the name of her deceased master, used the powers of the Light to restore Reiter's sight, leaving his vision blurry, but functional. Reiter could only make out her armor, and said that Anajinn sounded different, not realizing that the former apprentice's master was dead.\nRebuilding.\nNot long after the battle, Reiter's inn was rebuilt. He had to sell half his land to procure the required funds, and the structure's walls were less sturdy than before.\nThe Fourth Meeting.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231285\"&gt;Nearly twenty years&lt;/a&gt; after the battle with the Paladins, Reiter, now an older man, with creaking joints and gnarled hands, was visited by Anajinn again. Lilsa was pleased to see her and they spent days in conversation. Finally, the point came where Lilsa asked to join (or was asked by Anajinn to join) the ranks of the Crusaders as her apprentice. Reiter listened in, aggrieved at the thought of his daughter leaving him. Anajinn told Lilsa of her plans to head to &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; in light of a &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;falling star&lt;/a&gt; seen in the skies. The Crusader and her new apprentice entered the library to tell Reiter, who tried to make it look like he hadn't been evesdropping. A thousand words fluttered through his thoughts, forming admonitions, warnings, refusals, ultimatums. Anything that would make Lilsa change her mind, make her see reason. None of which, he knew, he would ever have the courage to say.\nLilsa spoke first. She had something to tell him..."}

Some are various interpretations of a single philosophy, while others subscribe to their own pantheon of gods and goddesses. Spirituality is unique to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity.\nOrigins.\n&lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; is the first being of existence and the origin of pure good. The dark being of &lt;a href=\"Tathamet\"&gt;Tathamet&lt;/a&gt;, a seven headed dragon, was created when Anu shed all evil from his form which later manifested into being. It is said that the world began when these beings destroyed each other after a great battle. The &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt; is thought to be Anu's eye, while the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Arch\"&gt;Crystal Arch&lt;/a&gt; seems to be his spine and the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. The five archangels of the &lt;a href=\"Angiris%20Council\"&gt;Angiris Council&lt;/a&gt; were created out of Anu's five virtues, while the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Evils\"&gt;Great Evils&lt;/a&gt; were spawned from Tathamet's seven heads.\nReligions of Light.\nThe most common religious philosophy among men is that of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, a reverence for the primal force of justice and goodness in the world. The angels of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt; are the foremost powers regarding the Light, and dedicate their existence to fighting evil, primarily that of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkatsim.\nKnown as the \"Old Religion\", &lt;a href=\"Skatsim\"&gt;Skatsim&lt;/a&gt; was the most common faith of The Light in Kehjistan before the rise of Zakarum. Few adhere to Skatsim any more, though the Taan Mage Clan (of which &lt;a href=\"Ormus\"&gt;Ormus&lt;/a&gt; is the only known member) is well versed in Skatsimi magic, which was used to protect the docks of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt; from the forces of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; in 1264.\nCathedral of Light.\nFounded in direct opposition to the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; was created by &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt;, a renegade angel who disguised himself as a man named &lt;a href=\"The%20Veiled%20Prophet\"&gt;The Veiled Prophet&lt;/a&gt;. Both faiths founded their temple in the city of &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;. The highest rank of the church was the &lt;a href=\"Procurator%20General\"&gt;Procurator General&lt;/a&gt;, with the rank of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Inquisitor\"&gt;Master Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; being the middle priest rank. &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s acted as the basic infantry of the church.\nZakarum.\nMany ages ago, a man name &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt; believed he was visited by the &lt;a href=\"Archangel\"&gt;Archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yaerius\"&gt;Yaerius&lt;/a&gt;, who instructed him to found a new faith of The Light. Although Akarat began his teaching in the west, it is in the east where his teachings became the most widely followed. The holy city of &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt; was founded in Kurast, and it became the residence of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Zakarum faith is very structured and has a complex hierarchy, with the &lt;a href=\"Que-Hegan\"&gt;Que-Hegan&lt;/a&gt; acting as the highest church official and leader of the High Council. The next named rank of the church is archbishop, with &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; being the only named member of this rank. Other ranks of priests are &lt;a href=\"Heirophant\"&gt;Heirophant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cantor\"&gt;Cantor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sexton\"&gt;Sexton&lt;/a&gt;. It can be assumed that members of the High Council hold these priestly titles, though it is possible that &lt;a href=\"Council%20Member\"&gt;Council Member&lt;/a&gt; is a rank in of itself, only second to the Que-Hegan.\nThroughout its history, Zakarum has maintained a powerful standing army called the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;Hand of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; to protect its adherents from demonic corruption. Members of the order are paladins, divine knights entrusted with holy powers to further the goals of The Light. The base rank is &lt;a href=\"Zakarumite\"&gt;Zakarumite&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Faithful\"&gt;Faithful&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zealot\"&gt;Zealot&lt;/a&gt; being the titles for more experienced members.\nSometime before the events of &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;, Mephisto began to corrupt the High Council until it was completely under his control. On his way to defeat Mephisto, the hero of &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt; must confront legions of Zakarumites who have been convinced that the world has fallen to evil, and that all of its corrupt people must be destroyed, when it is in fact them who have fallen to the dark.\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;, a man named &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Malachi%20the%20Healer\"&gt;Brother Malachi the Healer&lt;/a&gt; is seen in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the Zakarum faith has fallen from sanctity, showing that Zakarum is either still corrupted by darkness, or that the damage inflicted upon the church was enough to make it collapse after the demonic corrupters were defeated.\nKnights of Westmarch.\nMany Zakarumites were displeased with the levels of fanaticism and brutality exhibited by their brothers in arms against those who did not worship the \"correct\" way, and so they left to form a new knightly order. The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Knights of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; were founded to focus their efforts on combating demonic darkness. They fought and defeated the army of &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"King%20Leoric\"&gt;King Leoric&lt;/a&gt; during the events of Diablo I.\nReligions of Darkness.\nDue to the nature of their faith, followers of darkness do not belong into any large, organized institutions. Rather, the followers of demonic teachings usually join small cults or covens led by some sort of dark mage, lesser demon or corrupted priest and practice their profane rituals in secret. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Cultist\"&gt;Dark Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s spend much of their worship summoning demons from hell and raising undead for their own ends, particularly Dark Hellions. Some cultists turn themselves into &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Vessels\"&gt;Dark Vessels&lt;/a&gt;, carrying the spirit of a demon inside them. When the time is right, they allow the demon to take over their bodies, and they become a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Thrall\"&gt;Dark Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. During times of high demon activity on Sanctuary, cultist numbers swell and people become much more aware of their presence.\nThe Triune.\nEarly on in the world of Sanctuary, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; attempted a discrete approach of converting the populace to their demonic ways. By adopting alter egos, the demons were able to gain followers under the guise of a religion of Light they named the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;. It was led by a high priest called the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, with two lieutenant High Priests as his seconds in command. The &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Warder\"&gt;Peace Warder&lt;/a&gt;s were the uniformed priests and soldiers of the church. Members of the Cathedral of Light brought an end to the Triune, but some followers considered to worship in secret, even in the days of Diablo III.\nKhazra Traditions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Khazra\"&gt;Khazra&lt;/a&gt; are savage goatmen who inhabit the wilds of Sanctuary. They were once men, though dark magics twisted their form until they became what they currently are. The Khazra worship the dark powers of the Burning Hells, and evil altars are a common sight around their settlements. Many Khazra reside in the Burning Hells itself, and most settlements have the means to open portals that summon their brethren back to Sanctuary when their settlements are in danger.\nOther Religions.\nThe Priests of Rathma.\nAlso known as the &lt;a href=\"Necromancers\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt; dedicate themselves to a notion called the &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;Great Cycle of Being&lt;/a&gt;, a philosophy that places balance above all else. The priests practice their faith in the swamplands of the far east.\n&lt;a href=\"Rathma\"&gt;Rathma&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Nephalem\"&gt;Nephalem&lt;/a&gt; who encountered &lt;a href=\"Trag%27Oul\"&gt;Trag'Oul&lt;/a&gt;, a great dragon that was the guardian of Sanctuary. He was instructed by Trag'Oul in the ways of balance, and his first disciple, &lt;a href=\"Mendeln\"&gt;Mendeln&lt;/a&gt;, was taught how to speak to the dead. They learned how the greatest balance of all was between life and death, darkness and light, and thus necromancy became a central tenet of the priests' faith.\nThe Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisterhood&lt;/a&gt; is located between &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, operating out of a large &lt;a href=\"monastery\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt;. They are descendent from the Amazons of the &lt;a href=\"Skovos%20Isles\"&gt;Skovos Isles&lt;/a&gt; and place a high regard on the spiritual awareness of &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sight\"&gt;Inner Sight&lt;/a&gt;. They consider themselves allies of heaven and goodness. The &lt;a href=\"Rogues\"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt; are the warriors of this order, and they are led by a priestess. &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt; holds this title during the events if Diablo II.\nThe Pantheon of the Askari.\nThe Skovos Isles are home to the &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt; people, notable for their order of women warriors called &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;s They follow a polytheistic religion that holds order in the highest regard. &lt;a href=\"Athulua\"&gt;Athulua&lt;/a&gt; is their prime deity, who rules over the weather and seasons with her consort &lt;a href=\"Kethryes\"&gt;Kethryes&lt;/a&gt;. Under these goddesses are various other deities, such as &lt;a href=\"Karcheus\"&gt;Karcheus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zerae\"&gt;Zerae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hefaetrus\"&gt;Hefaetrus&lt;/a&gt;, each responsible for a facet of Amazon life. The Amazons believe that they will play some great role in defeating the Prime Evils of the Burning Hells.\nNephalemic Worship.\nThe s of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mt. Arreat&lt;/a&gt; revere the \"&lt;a href=\"Ancients\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt; \", the spirits of three legendary warriors chosen to protect the Worldstone located within mountain. Their names are &lt;a href=\"Korlic\"&gt;Korlic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madawc\"&gt;Madawc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talic\"&gt;Talic&lt;/a&gt; and the three are in fact Nephalem. The spirits wield considerable power, enough to destroy most things that would threaten the Worldstone. It is unclear what happened to them after the destruction of the Worldstone.\nMbwiru Eirkura.\nRoughly translated as \"The Unformed Land\", this is the faith of the &lt;a href=\"Umbaru\"&gt;Umbaru&lt;/a&gt; people of the Torajan jungles. This philosophy states that sacred reality, the realm of the gods, is hidden behind the physical world, and that mana is the essence of the gods that seeps into the physical realm. In order to ensure this all-important life energy continues to flow into the world, the Umbaru believe they must partake in ritual human sacrifice.\n&lt;a href=\"Giyua\"&gt;Giyua&lt;/a&gt; is a mythological figure who is said to be the guardian of the Unformed Land and greets mortal souls of the deceased upon their arrival.\n&lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s are the spiritual leaders of Umbaru tribes and administer all magic rituals and spiritual activities in the tribe. The faith of the Umbaru stresses non-individuality and sacrifice for the greater good.\nShaptev.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s of the monastic city of &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; are an intensely spiritual people that believe divinity manifests itself everything, from elements and seasons to behaviors and actions. They refer to this aspect of infinite divinity as the 1001 gods. They worship gods of order and chaos, and strive for perfect internal balance, and align themselves with the forces of good.\nOne of the gods is &lt;a href=\"Ytar\"&gt;Ytar&lt;/a&gt;, whose name is exclaimed when a monk executes a particularly powerful attack. Ytar is the god of fire, and is one of the gods of order. &lt;a href=\"Inna\"&gt;Inna&lt;/a&gt; is known as the goddess of the sky, known for her immense beauty. The monk character and the Templar sometimes argue about the sense behind having 1001 gods.\nThe 59 Gods of Xiansai.\nThe people of the island of &lt;a href=\"Xiansai\"&gt;Xiansai&lt;/a&gt; revere a number of gods that total 59. The most well known, if not revered is Zei, the god of thieves. It is said that he often disguises himself as a mortal and searches the world for rare jewels.\nNature Worship.\nThe &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Scosglen\"&gt;Scosglen&lt;/a&gt; worship the four primal energies of the world - fire, earth, air and water - as well as the various nature spirits of plants and animals. The druids shun the traditional use of magic that uses &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; or \"Dubhdroiacht\" as they call it, in order to maintain a closer bond with the powers of nature they revere.\nVecin Religion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vecin\"&gt;Vecin&lt;/a&gt; travelers of &lt;a href=\"Kehjistan\"&gt;Kehjistan&lt;/a&gt; put their faith behind the Allmother, the patron deity of the matriarchal society. They believe that the Allmother gifts some followers with The Sight, a \"sixth sense\" that manifests itself more strongly in women. It is possible that this power is related to the Inner Sight wielded by the Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye."}

The demons won the battle, and Renit was the sole survivor. Surrounded by the bodies of the fallen, he swore an oath that the demons would not win the war.\nSetting out on horseback, he heard a woman scream from inside a ruined fortress. Concluding that the demons were near, he rode up and burst in, saving the woman from &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s. He was irritated that there were no demons present, but was calmed down by the woman. She explained that her name was &lt;a href=\"Cairo\"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, and that the demons had slaughtered her breathren. Among them was her master, and being a Necromancer apprentice, she had not the power to avenge them. However, she told Renit of an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Naz\"&gt;Hand of Naz&lt;/a&gt;, which could summon a spectral army to do the wielder's bidding. With that army to command, they could destroy their common enemy.\nRenit agreed to work with her, and they travelled to the castle of &lt;a href=\"Kanemith\"&gt;Kanemith&lt;/a&gt;; supposedly the last resting place of the gauntlet in a tomb beneath the castle. They found it on the hand of a buried king in a sarcophagus, but when Renit took it, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; burst out of the ground. Renit fled with the gauntlet, leaving Cairo to die.\nShortly afterwards, Renit faced the demons who'd killed his comrades. Using the gauntlet's power, he summonsed the spectral army, which easily dispatced them. However, the ghost of the king in the tomb did not return to the gauntlet, despite Renit's orders, and killed him. However, he was revived by Cairo via a &lt;a href=\"resurrection\"&gt;resurrection&lt;/a&gt; spell, who explained that she was no mere apprentice, but rather a master Necromancer. That her brethren were slain by demons when she was a little girl, and that she'd played the helpless victim in the fortress to lure Renit in. Suspecting that there was a price to use the gauntlet, she'd let Renit use the gauntlet as a patsy to destroy the demons, and had let him pay the price, as whoever used the gauntlet was fated to be added to the army's ranks.\nCairo destroyed the gauntlet but took the real prize; the &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20of%20Naz\"&gt;Jewel of Naz&lt;/a&gt;. She then rode off, telling Renit that they would not meet again."}

If these requirements are not met, the item cannot be equipped and used. Generally, the more powerful an item is, the higher are its requirements; in addition, some items' requirements are adjusted to reflect general progression of a specific class (such as caster items requiring high &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28attribute%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, but low &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;).\nDiablo I-II.\nStrength requirements are the most common, but &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; is also seen on items like &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and other ranged weapons, and big weapons like &lt;a href=\"polearms\"&gt;polearms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubtracting or adding requirements is an attribute which can be found on any piece of item, including &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis attribute can either deduct or increase the amount of requirements needed to equip an item by a percentage. The Required Level to use the item, however, can't be reduced.\nExample: a chest piece that requires 50 &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and has one &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;.

A minimum of prisoners need to be rescued alive, but most people should be able to rescue all of them. Once the player meets the quotum, the quest notification should pop up and the player character can be heard saying \"Follow me\".

The Barbarian has the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Trees\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Natural%20Resistance\"&gt;Natural Resistance&lt;/a&gt; to increase his own elemental resistances permanently.\nElemental resistances can also be permanently increased by a &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Resistance\"&gt;Scroll of Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which is created by powerful healers like &lt;a href=\"Malah\"&gt;Malah&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Harrogath\"&gt;Harrogath&lt;/a&gt;. It increases all resistances by 10\u00a0in \"Diablo II: Lord of Destruction\" (for a total of 30, after it has been used on all difficulties).\nMinimum Resistances.\nThe lowest value of all resistances is -100. Having a negative resistance value naturally \"increases\" the amount of damage a character or creature takes.\nA character's base elemental resistances vary with each difficulty:\nFor &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;:\nFor , the penalty was increased:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Conviction\"&gt;Conviction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aura\"&gt;Aura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Amplify%20Damage\"&gt;Amplify Damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Decrepify\"&gt;Decrepify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resist\"&gt;Lower Resist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Curses\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Ward\"&gt;Grim Ward&lt;/a&gt; (synergized by &lt;a href=\"Find%20Potion\"&gt;Find Potion&lt;/a&gt;) can lower enemies' resistances even if the enemy is immune to given element (but in case of immune monsters, they work at 1/5 effectiveness only). &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Mastery\"&gt;Cold Mastery&lt;/a&gt; and -enemy resistance affixes from items work only if the enemy is \"not\" immune to given element.\nMaximum Resistances.\nA character's and hireling's default maximum resistance value is ', although certain items and the Paladin's Resistance Aura synergies can raise that number as high as ', the cap for elemental resistances. Therefore, a character or a hireling can never become totally &lt;a href=\"Immunity\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to elemental attacks with resistance alone. However, with the help of integer absorb effects (not percentage absorb effects), a character can reduce low enough amounts of &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;Elemental Damage&lt;/a&gt; that would be inflicted to zero, or even &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; from it.\nMonsters' and summons' resistances are not capped and they can become immune to a given element with resistance \u2265 100.\nElemental Resistances.\nThere are 4 types of Elemental\u00a0Resistances that a player can acquire:\nOther Resistances.\nThere are 2 uncommon types of Resistances that a player or a hireling can acquire, and these ones are unaffected by difficulty penalties:\nAbsorption.\n&lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;Absorption&lt;/a&gt; is a special modifier that is closely related to resistances, and can greatly enhance them as well. See its article for more information.\nSunder.\n&lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; is a special modifier found only on 6 charms, one for each element, reducing immune monsters' resistance to 95 (and allowing it to be further lowered by items and skills). See its article for more information.\nDiablo III.\nResistances were heavily reworked in the third game. The penalties for progressing in harder difficulty levels were removed, and the summed percentage calculation was replaced with a rating system with diminishing returns, similar to &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Defense&lt;/a&gt;/Armor rating. The damage reduction from resistance stacks multiplicatively with that from armor and other forms of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; to form the character's &lt;a href=\"toughness\"&gt;toughness&lt;/a&gt;. The number of resisted &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; types was expanded to cover \"all\" attacks, even non-magical ones: &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cold\"&gt;Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt;. Holy damage is subject to Arcane resistance; on the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt; these are listed together, but on most items only Arcane is named explicitly, since Holy damage is almost never encountered from monsters.\nResistances are subject to diminishing returns: the more you get, the less effective each next point becomes. There is no maximum cap for resistances, but it is impossible to raise protection to 100% through resistance alone. It \"is\" possible to become immune to one or two damage types at a time, since for each one except Physical, there is a &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amulet\"&gt;Amulet&lt;/a&gt; that makes a character immune to it.\nResistances are less effective against &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s of higher level than the player. This does not occur in solo play due to level scaling (after the \"&lt;a href=\"Reaper%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reaper of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" patch), but if a low level character joins the game of a higher level character, the lower level one will not receive as much of a percentage reduction from their resistance rating as they normally would."}

In the first two games, all characters used &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; as their primary resource, but \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\" diversified the concept by giving each &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; its own resource(s) to use, each with different quantities and regeneration rates. Primary resources are shown in orbs in the game's main user interface, the counterpart to &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, together being the two quantities characters must keep a close eye on during gameplay. Resource costs and &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;s are the primary way skills are balanced, so that powerful skills cannot be over-used and remove the challenge of gameplay.\nDepending on classes and skills, other game elements may function as secondary resources in addition to the primary ones, such as charges or stacks of a skill-specific effect, or &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s. Some character &lt;a href=\"build\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;s tend not to go through too many resources, or even any at all, while others may go through cycles of heavy resource use followed by the need to regenerate them. &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; itself is sometimes considered the game's foremost resource, as it keeps the player alive but may be sacrificed for the sake of fighting enemies, but in most circumstances it is desirable to keep Life as high as possible at all times, unlike resources designed to be spent.\nMaximum resource limits, &lt;a href=\"Resource%20Cost%20Reduction\"&gt;Resource Cost Reduction&lt;/a&gt;, and rate of regeneration of resources are all important character stats in various games, with numerous effects that modify them.\n&lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; and other items are the resources for the economy aspect of the game, while &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Rift%20Keystone\"&gt;Greater Rift Keystone&lt;/a&gt;s and similar tokens are resources for accessing different gameplay elements. However, these are generally known as \"&lt;a href=\"currency\"&gt;currency&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; materials\", or simply referred to by name, whereas referring to \"resources\" usually means the combat-oriented gameplay mechanics.\nEarly games.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20%28Game%29\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", all classes use &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; as their primary resource. Mana is gained by leveling and further fueled by the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Attribute%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"character%20attribute\"&gt;character attribute&lt;/a&gt;s. Spellcaster classes and builds tend to care more about mana, and have more of it, compared to &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; users. In addition to natural regeneration, plentiful use of &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; can keep characters supplied with mana.\n\"Diablo II\" introduced &lt;a href=\"Stamina\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; as a minor resource.\nDiablo Immortal.\nThe resource system is largely absent in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;.\" The only resources that appear are \nDiablo III.\nThe third game designed different resources for each &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;. The design of the game's active &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s tends to follow a pattern where Primary skills are either free or actually generate resources, while other skills consume them.\nNumerous effects, &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Runes\"&gt;Skill Runes&lt;/a&gt; change the dynamics of how resources are obtained and used. Of special note is the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Items\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; armor, which grants 50% &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Reduction&lt;/a&gt; as long as the character's current resource supply is above 90%-95% of its maximum."}

Neither are included on the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Screen\"&gt;Character Screen&lt;/a&gt;'s estimate of &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; output or comparison of items, because of the wide variety of ways in which these stats can affect Skill use.\nBoth Resource Cost Reduction and Cooldown Reduction are multiplicative, so for example two effects that reduce costs by 20% result in an overall reduction of 64%, not 60% - the \"second reduction\" only applies to the part of the cost that remains after the first reduction is applied. Resource Cost Reduction can never reduce the cost to use a skill below 1 resource point."}

He was gray-eyed, with short gray hair, and wore &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; made of bone and metal that gave him a bit of a reptilian look. He was well versed in &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, particularly adept in the &lt;a href=\"life%20tap\"&gt;life tap&lt;/a&gt; technique, and always planned out his options in advance.\nBiography.\nEarly Service.\nKarybdus was highly regarded by the &lt;a href=\"Priests%20of%20Rathma\"&gt;Priests of Rathma&lt;/a&gt;. His deeds were regarded as examples of the ultimate dedication to the &lt;a href=\"Balance%20%28Philosophy%29\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt;. Over his years, his foes included tyrants, spellcasters, and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, all of which he triumphed against. This included the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei\"&gt;Vizjerei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Armin%20Ra\"&gt;Armin Ra&lt;/a&gt;. It was in preparation for this battle that Karybdus fashioned his armor. It was also a battle that he won. Within his order, he perfected many of the spells the priests used. He had some respect for &lt;a href=\"Zayl\"&gt;Zayl&lt;/a&gt;, whose parents he had fought beside before he was even born, and whom he briefly resurrected after Zayl had accidentally killed them. By the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231265\"&gt;1265&lt;/a&gt;, Karybdus was over 100 years old, his stamina and drive fueled by his desire to see &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in perfect balance. Over the years, he lost bits and pieces of his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, but was able to replenish it from \"those who no longer needed it.\"\nStill, Karybdus was disturbed. The Priests of Rathma had fought the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; for centuries in their bid to maintain the Balance. He believed that the priesthood's actions had pushed the Balance too far to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and that a dark act had to be carried out to set the Balance right.\nMoon of the Spider.\nNot long after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Worldstone\"&gt;Worldstone&lt;/a&gt;, Karybdus resurrected King &lt;a href=\"Cornelius\"&gt;Cornelius&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for getting his son, &lt;a href=\"Justinian%20IV\"&gt;Justinian IV&lt;/a&gt;, under his control, or at least, cooperating with his plan. Karybdus also worked with &lt;a href=\"Aldric%20Jitan\"&gt;Aldric Jitan&lt;/a&gt;, a noble who hoped to rule &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20of%20the%20Spider%20%28item%29\"&gt;Moon of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;. He was put off by the noble, especially after he'd destroyed several manuscripts from his own library, but accepted that Jitan was necessary for the completion of his plans. He knew that Jitan would get nowhere with the artifact, but leading him on, performed a ritual, releasing some of the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Astrogha\"&gt;Children of Astrogha&lt;/a&gt; from the object, which killed Jitan's men-at-arms who were standing nearby. All Jitan had to do was master the relic before the time of convergence with the moon. He also told him of an enemy, informing him that he could be a threat to Jitan's plans. \nThe attack failed, but Karybdus at least learned that his foe was Zayl, much to his aggravation. He considered bringing Zayl into the fold, but decided against it, reasoning that Zayl was too loyal to the concept of the Balance the Priests preached to join him. Likewise, he had to deal with Jitan as well, who was pressing him on the issue of both the relic, and of Zayl himself. Karybdus soothed the noble's concerns on both issues. He abducted &lt;a href=\"Salane%20Nasardo\"&gt;Salane Nasardo&lt;/a&gt;, a noble whom Zayl had been protecting, in order for the ritual to be conducted. He gave her half-hearted apologies for his actions, stating that the Balance had to be maintained. He took Salane to a hill overlooking &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, where the ritual would be conducted. Zayl and &lt;a href=\"Sardak%20Nasardo\"&gt;Sardak Nasardo&lt;/a&gt; were able to save her, albeit at the cost of Sardak's life. It wasn't really a loss for Zayl however, for as Salane's brother, Sardak's &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; would do just as well. Furthermore, the Children of Astrogha were able to capture Zayl and bring him to Karybdus. Zayl demanded to know what could have caused Karybdus to forsake the Balance, but as Karybdus explained, he was still dedicated to it, explaining his view on how his acts at Westmarch would correct the Balance.\nThe ritual was conducted, and &lt;a href=\"Astrogha\"&gt;Astrogha&lt;/a&gt; himself was summoned into Sanctuary, killing Jitan, and using his body as a host. Karybdus offered to kill Zayl, but Astrogha wanted him preserved, and directed his minions against &lt;a href=\"Westmarch%20%28City%29\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Karybdus planned to eventually betray Astrogha, but not after his minions had done their work. However, his plans went awry, as Astrogha decided to take Zayl as his host, for after all, a Necromancer in the thrall of a demon would be a powerful host indeed. Karybdus bided his time, realizing that he had underestimated Astrogha's influence within Sanctuary. Still, he'd let him take Zayl as a host for now. He secretly cast life tap\u2014Astrogha could take Zayl's body, but he'd be a far weaker host than the demon had anticipated. Once the Balance was corrected, he'd send Astrogha right back to &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Hell&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was interrupted by Salane, who arrived to save Zayl, but Karybdus easily incapacitated her. However, she was able to return Zayl's dagger to him, which gave him the power he needed to resist Astrogha's attempts at possession. He turned the specter of a &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt; on him, which ripped out some of Karybdus's soul. Karybdus was harmed, but not slain; after all, this was not the first time his soul had been damaged. However, Salane plunged Karybdus's own dagger into the back of his neck. Karybdus clawed at the gaping wound, while Salane and Zayl were able to banish Astrogha. Karybdus cried out, in rage, claiming that the Balance may never be set right. Equally enraged, Zayl stabbed Karybdus with his own dagger, this time through the heart. He shoved his body into the portal that had banished Astrogha from Sanctuary."}

When she was young, Akara told her tales of the &lt;a href=\"Amazon\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;s' fearlessness in battle and of their skills with the &lt;a href=\"spears\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Moreina\"&gt;Moreina&lt;/a&gt; was her closest friend.\nThe Maiden of Anguish.\n&lt;a href=\"Andariel\"&gt;Andariel&lt;/a&gt; drove the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s from their &lt;a href=\"Eastgate%20Keep\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Moor\"&gt;Blood Moor&lt;/a&gt;, prompting them to set up an &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Encampment\"&gt;encampment&lt;/a&gt;. Kashya was aggrieved to share the camp with \"common traders\" and farm animals, and doubted that Akara had the steel to retake the monastery by force. When she was approached by a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of adventurers&lt;/a&gt;, she dispatched them to the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Evil\"&gt;Den of Evil&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0asked them to clear it out. They succeeded where her Rogues had failed. She next bid that they slay Moreina, who had been resurrected as Blood Raven. Once again, the heroes succeeded, and while they were once\u00a0friends, Kashya prayed that Moreina's\u00a0&lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; may never return to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed and grateful, she granted several of her Rogues at the heroes' disposal.\nThe heroes went on to slay Andariel herself. Kashya admitted that she may have misjudged them, and bid them farewell.\nThe Bloodsworn.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline%231270\"&gt;Six years later&lt;/a&gt;, Kashya led a group of Rogues through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;, a group of traitor Rogues, were in the area, and had comitted numerous attrocities. She intended on striking down their leader, &lt;a href=\"Lakrii\"&gt;Lakrii&lt;/a&gt;. By chance, she and the Rogues encountered a group on the edge of &lt;a href=\"Blackstone%20Village\"&gt;Blackstone Village&lt;/a&gt; under attack by the Bloodsworn. She and her Rogues intervened, repelling the cultists. Kashya stayed with the survivors, while she sent her Rogues in pursuit. Of the group, she recognized &lt;a href=\"Alyssa\"&gt;Alyssa&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Lucian\"&gt;Lucian&lt;/a&gt;, now dead on the ground before her. She deduced that Lucian was dead as well, which begged the question as to who the girl's &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;companion(s)&lt;/a&gt; were.\nThe hero(es) gave Kashya a &lt;a href=\"Lucian%27s%20Letter\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; that Lucian had written. Reading it, Kashya mused that Lucian was right to have been afraid. Blackstone was completely destroyed, but they could avenge the fallen. She asked the hero(es) to join her band in their attack on Lakrii. However, circumstances changed when &lt;a href=\"Flavie\"&gt;Flavie&lt;/a&gt; returned, informing her that the Rogues she'd sent in pursuit had been ambushed by the Bloodsworn. She ordered Flavie to take the injured back to their &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Battlecamp\"&gt;battle camp&lt;/a&gt;, while requesting that the hero(es) deal with Lakrii. She would catch up with them later.\nKashya entered the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn%20Den\"&gt;Bloodsworn Den&lt;/a&gt;, and found the hero(es) with &lt;a href=\"Hemlir\"&gt;Hemlir&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; they'd rescued. However, he was bleeding heavily. The hero(es) went to deal with Lakrii, while Kashya took Hemlir back to the camp. The camp later came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Fallen\"&gt;Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, but the attack was repelled through the aid of Kashya's ally/allies, who spoke to her afterwards. They informed her that they had driven the Bloodsworn from Blackstone, but that Lakrii had escaped. Kashya wasn't perturbed, reasoning that it wasn't their fight anyway. She instructed them to see Akara, and show all proper respect.\nKashya later led a party of Rogues against the Bloodsworn in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Tower\"&gt;Forgotten Tower&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Bloodsworn fought back ferociously, and Kashya sent Flavie to Akara to request aid. Kashya was captured, but the Countess was slain by the hero(es), and Kashya saved. Outside, she admitted that she had misjudged them (&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;not for the first time&lt;/a&gt;), and admitted that she needed to work on that. The hero(es) confirmed that a shard of the Worldstone had resurrected the Countess, and Kashya asked that they take it to Cain. She told the hero(es) to send the Sisterhood's regards to Cain and Charsi, and that the Rogues would remain in the Dark Wood to ensure that the Bloodsworn did not return. However, if they needed the Sisterhood's help, all they had to do was ask.\nLater, Kashya requested aid from &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; to deal with &lt;a href=\"Night%20Howler\"&gt;Night Howler&lt;/a&gt;s in the southern part of the Dark Wood.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nKashya is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in of \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", located in the Rogue Encampment.\nShe is cynical and distrusting to\u00a0the player character, with the exception of the\u00a0Amazon class. She also dislikes &lt;a href=\"Gheed\"&gt;Gheed&lt;/a&gt; (as does most of the camp). Kashya is wary of outsiders and a battle hardened veteran. She is wary of &lt;a href=\"Warriv\"&gt;Warriv&lt;/a&gt; and the hero's arrival in camp.\nAfter the hero proves him/herself, Kashya grants a &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Archer\"&gt;Rogue Archer&lt;/a&gt; to accompany the hero in battle. The completion of the quest also earns her trust, but she only shows full respect after the player has killed Andariel.\nDialogue.\nGossip about Kashya.\nSome of the other locals give their thoughts concerning Kashya.\nDiablo Immortal.\nKashya appears as an NPC in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\".

She is a bit impatient and curt with those who have yet to gain her trust. By her own admission, she is naturally suspicious of outsiders, and there are few \"outlanders\" that she trusts. She possesses great expertise in strategic and tactical matters. Kashya has a high regard for the Amazons, and likes to think that the Rogues have much in common with them. She holds great respect for &lt;a href=\"Akara\"&gt;Akara&lt;/a&gt;, but also something beyond that, commenting that the high priestess \"is like a mother to me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Deckard%20Cain\"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; had a high opinion of Kashya, regarding her as one of the finest archers the Sisterhood had ever produced. Kashya had a less charitable view on Cain however, wondering how a man of such supposed great wisdom could become wise if he'd never learnt how to wage battle himself."}

Once a bastion of civilization, Kehjistan now lies in ruins.\nIt is the homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Kehjistani\"&gt;Kehjistani&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nKehjistan (or at least &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;) has laws against witch burning.\nGeography.\nKehjistan encompassed almost one-third of Sanctuary's eastern hemisphere, and its terrain changed very little over the millennia. The land is renowned for its strange mirages. In the current era, the borders of the empire have regressed to the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Town\"&gt;Town&lt;/a&gt;s and cities in Kehjistan tended to be large. Even the largest of cities in &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt; could be dwarfed by a town in Kehjistan. It appears that unlike Entsteig, towns in Kehjistan were planned carefully to make them easier to navigate. A trip by sea from &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt; to Kehjistan takes weeks.\nThe South.\nTo Kehjistan's south lie emerald rainforests, and with an average of over 400 inches per year, Kehjistan had the largest rainforests in the known world. This huge expanse of jungle feeds the &lt;a href=\"Argentek%20River\"&gt;Argentek River&lt;/a&gt;, which is the longest, widest river in Sanctuary. Hundreds of smaller rivers and tributaries twist and turn their way through the lush tropical forests until they finally unite with the mighty Argentek. Herbalists and alchemists revere the rainforest environment for its ecological diversity. Until around the &lt;a href=\"Darkening%20of%20Tristram\"&gt;Darkening of Tristram&lt;/a&gt;, these sages would come from far and wide to study and collect the rare plants and animals that make their homes here. The wet, humid atmosphere of these rainforests is an environment perfect for fly and mosquito larvae. Pools of stagnant water gather after the frequent rain storms, providing excellent spots for the adults of these species to lay their eggs. Because of the use of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, some flora and fauna of the jungles grew to massive sizes due to the adverse effects of magical energy. Trees and vines would grow to unusual size, rivers and swamps would appear overnight, and once innocuous creatures would gain dangerous abilities with an appetite to match.\nCurrently, Kehistan, as an entity (such as it is), has no control over its former southern territories.\nThe North.\nKehjistan's north is dominated by desert. It is here that the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt; denote its northern border with the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Steppes\"&gt;Dry Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. To the west, Kehjistan is bordered by the Twin Seas, while swamplands lie at its eastern edges. Few try to cross the desert without a fully supplied caravan, and the desert is filled with the &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s of those who braved the open sands. The harsh climate of Kehjistan makes life difficult for all, save those who are stout and savvy in the ways of the desert.\nHistory.\nAncient History.\nSeveral thousand years ago, hunter-gatherers found themselves drawn to the lush, fertile rain forests and bountiful game inhabiting southern Kehjistan. But there was something else; Kehjistan's geography was rife with nodes of magical energies, and eventually those with innate, arcane abilities began to sense and recognize these forces, gathering in groups to settle these special areas. Recovered artifacts indicate that by the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23c.-2300\"&gt;-2300&lt;/a&gt;, writing, art, and science had become an integral part of human culture\u2014a period of human history which saw the formation of &lt;a href=\"Kehjan\"&gt;Kehjan&lt;/a&gt;, humanity's first great civilization.\nThe cultures of Kehjistan formalized the study of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt;, the original groups being founded in the jungles of the land, where the nodes of magic had originally been discovered. The growing power of the clans led to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Al%27Raquish\"&gt;Al'Raquish&lt;/a&gt;, which ruled Kehjan alongside the land's monarchy and trade guilds.\nBecause of the actions of &lt;a href=\"Jere%20Harash\"&gt;Jere Harash&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hells\"&gt;Burning Hells&lt;/a&gt; were made aware of the existence of Sanctuary. The &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evils\"&gt;Prime Evils&lt;/a&gt; made plans to enslave &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity by forming the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Triune\"&gt;Temple of the Triune&lt;/a&gt;, a seemingly benevolent religion that would act as their front in the mortal realm. In time, the religion's numbers swelled. In order to combat the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"archangel\"&gt;archangel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Inarius\"&gt;Inarius&lt;/a&gt; formed the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to stymie the Prime Evils' influence. Both religions grew in power, and achieved immense influence over the people of Kehjan. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"Sin%20War%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Sin War&lt;/a&gt;, as Inarius and the Prime Evils waged a secret war for the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of mankind. The Cathedral signed an agreement with Kehjan that gave them authority over various matters within the empire. This included authority over &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; guards.\nThe Sin War ended with the coming of &lt;a href=\"Uldyssian\"&gt;Uldyssian&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Edyrem\"&gt;Edyrem&lt;/a&gt;. With Uldyssian's sacrifice, Hell and &lt;a href=\"Heaven\"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; let Sanctuary be, and hid the truth of what had really occurred.\nThe Age of Magic.\nBelieving the Sin War to be nothing more than a clash of faiths, the people of Kehjan turned away from religion. They went so far as to rename their land as \"Kehjistan,\" and began to look to the Mage Clans for guidance. Kehjistani culture became the culture of the empire in of itself. A golden age of magic and enlightenment began. Those few in the empire who knew the truth of what had happened in the Sin War forbid the practice of demonology. In this time, the &lt;a href=\"Vizjerei%20Clan\"&gt;Vizjerei Clan&lt;/a&gt; served as the Empire's backbone. &lt;a href=\"Viz-jun\"&gt;Viz-jun&lt;/a&gt; served as the Empire's capital.\nAt the height of the Age of Magic, the arcane arts were celebrated openly in Kehjistan; performed on stage and public square in dazzling displays.\nAt some point, the Eastern Empire established a colony in the east of &lt;a href=\"Aranoch\"&gt;Aranoch&lt;/a&gt;, located across the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Seas\"&gt;Twin Seas&lt;/a&gt;. However, by the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clan%20Wars\"&gt;Mage Clan Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the empire had begun pulling back from the region, as maintaining a physical presence was costing them too much.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23-210\"&gt;-210&lt;/a&gt;, the Mage Clan Wars erupted, lasting seven years. Kehjistan became a battlefield and Viz-jun itself was destroyed by the war's end. Kehjistan never regained the glory it had possessed prior to the conflict, and much of the realm was bristling with untamed magical energies. While much of this dissipated over time, some had effects upon the landscape and creatures of the jungle.\nThe death and suffering of the Mage Clan Wars pushed mankind away from the arcane sciences. Over the centuries, the people of Kehjistan began to once again see faith and religion as a source of meaning and purpose. A number of religious figures arose within this period, most notably, &lt;a href=\"Akarat\"&gt;Akarat&lt;/a&gt;. It was in this time that the ascetic formed the beginnings of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; faith.\nThe Rise of Zakarum.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%23964\"&gt;10th century&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Evils were banished to Sanctuary by the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Evils\"&gt;Lesser Evils&lt;/a&gt; in an event that would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Exile\"&gt;Dark Exile&lt;/a&gt;. With the Three Brothers let loose upon the mortal world, Kehjistan suffered, as the Primes fermented unrest within the empire. The &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; eventually bound all three &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, but &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231042\"&gt;nearly a century&lt;/a&gt; after the Primes first arrived in Sanctuary, Kehjistani society remained in a dire state, plagued by famine and disease. Commoners increasingly viewed the ruling elite as the source of their woes, and rebellion was poised to tear the empire apart.\nIn this critical juncture, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tassara\"&gt;Tassara&lt;/a&gt; converted to the increasingly popular Zakarum faith. In doing so, he gained the adoration of the people, and solidified his hold over the empire. Zakarum became the empire's dominant religion, and the capital was moved from Viz-jun to &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. Tassara worked to codify the Zakarum faith, and so began the actual Zakarum church. Tassara dispatched his general &lt;a href=\"Rakkis\"&gt;Rakkis&lt;/a&gt; to bring the light of Zakarum to the West, thus ridding him of a potential rival in the process. Zakarum would grow in influence, but would also grow increasingly despotic, as the church fell under the sway of &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;. This would culminate in the heinous &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Inquisition\"&gt;Zakarum Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; before Mephisto was finally defeated by a &lt;a href=\"classes%23Diablo%20II\"&gt;group of heroes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231264\"&gt;1264&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmpire's Decline.\nAfter the defeat of Mephisto and the other Primes, the capital of Kehjistan shifted from Kurast to &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt;, as nobles fled the city due to the effects of Mephisto's corruption. &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20I\"&gt;Hakan I&lt;/a&gt; joined them, making Caldeum the new capital. After his death, through a series of elaborate rituals, &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; priests found an infant they declared to be Hakan's spiritual successor and made him the new emperor, declaring him &lt;a href=\"Hakan%20II\"&gt;Hakan II&lt;/a&gt;. Early in his reign, Kehjistan began to suffer from drought, as even into winter, the heat of summer remained within its north. His more superstitous subjects claimed that this was an omen for his reign. Great sandstorms ravaged the desert, as moving dunes created an ever shifting landscape. The desert swallowed villages whole, leaving bare stone foundations or a handful of mud bricks where homes had once\nstood. A year on, and the drought remained. The Empire began to wither, and the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Clans\"&gt;Mage Clans&lt;/a&gt; could provide no answers.\nHakan II withdrew support for outlying regions around the capital, leaving them to fend for themselves.\nEmpire's Collapse.\nAt some point after &lt;a href=\"Malthael\"&gt;Malthael&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Kehjistan collapsed. Countless wars and demonic invasions left the once mighty empire in ruins, and its territory shrunk to only the &lt;a href=\"Borderlands\"&gt;Borderlands&lt;/a&gt;. The people who lived in the empire, once living in comfort, were left to live in fear. Evil stirred beneath the sands, and cultists worked in the shadows to unearth ancient evils, while &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s roamed the sands. &lt;a href=\"Khamsin%20Edge%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Khamsin Edge&lt;/a&gt;, a group of tribal &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, supported safe travel across the sands, but their numbers diminished over time, and eventually, they could only support safe travel between &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dahlgur%20Oasis\"&gt;Dahlgur Oasis&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, the &lt;a href=\"Barren%20Lords\"&gt;Barren Lords&lt;/a&gt; aided people in navigating Kehjistan's desert.\nKehjistan remained as the last bastion of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; within Sanctuary, but the church lost the hearts and minds of the people, and failed to regain them. The people lost all hope of salvation, and a sense of paranoia ran throughout the populace, as any smiling face could hide a servant of the &lt;a href=\"Triune\"&gt;Triune&lt;/a&gt;. To make matters worse, a plague swept across the land, resulting in &lt;a href=\"Caldeum\"&gt;Caldeum&lt;/a&gt; being sealed.\nIn-game.\nDiablo II.\nKehjistan appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\", specifically its southern jungle region.

His body is muscular and scarred. He is fluent in the trading languages of &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skovos\"&gt;Skovos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Therat\"&gt;Therat&lt;/a&gt;. He wields a greatsword named &lt;a href=\"Scorn\"&gt;Scorn&lt;/a&gt; and wears a bearskin cloak, while his legs are girded with piecemeal plate and mail armor. He wears oxhide boots.\nBiography.\nKehr was a member of the Stag Tribe. While they warred with the reavers of &lt;a href=\"Entsteig\"&gt;Entsteig&lt;/a&gt;, he abandoned his duty to pursue the daughter of a passing merchant. As such, he was absent when &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, and with it, the Stag Tribe.\nKehr became a sellsword, serving sultans, warlords, and merchant princes throughout the &lt;a href=\"Skovos%20Isles\"&gt;Skovos Isles&lt;/a&gt;. He adopted the &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt; practice of removing hair from his face and head with a sharp blade. This made him seem like less of an outsider on the &lt;a href=\"Skovos%20Isles\"&gt;Skovos Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nWayfarer.\nReturn Home.\nKehr left the isles to travel to the valley of his tribe, in order to find them. However, the tribe had been wiped out, and he was confronted by the ghost of his sister. No matter how far he travelled, Faen always appeared to him at sundown, and always with the same words. \u201cKehr Oldwyll. Traitor. Traitor!\u201d Kehr marked himself with the sign of a traitor, but still, his sister continued to torment him.\nThe Iron Path.\nDeciding to leave, Kehr planned to head to the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Westmarch\"&gt;Gulf of Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, from which he could find passage around the peninsula on a trading barge. After that, he could sail from &lt;a href=\"Westmarch\"&gt;Westmarch&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Kingsport\"&gt;Kingsport&lt;/a&gt;, and finally, back to Skovos. He headed for the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Path\"&gt;Iron Path&lt;/a&gt;, and walked for ten days. Every sunset, the ghost of his sister appeared before him, condemning him each time. He feared that she might pursue him all the way to &lt;a href=\"Philios\"&gt;Philios&lt;/a&gt;, and considered striking her down. However, he stayed his blade, believing that he had earned her ire.\nAt the Iron Path, he encountered a group of refugees under attack by &lt;a href=\"kharza\"&gt;kharza&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his unease, he stayed clear, knowing that he owed these peasants nothing. This changed, when he saw a &lt;a href=\"Aron\"&gt;woodcutter&lt;/a&gt; fighting off kharza, holding a girl\u2019s arm. He intervened, killing the kharza, though the girl was killed. He praised the boy for his bravery, and sneered at the refugees who had fled earlier.\nThe refugees pleaded for Kehr\u2019s protection, offering him food and &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; in exchange. Kehr took their payment and agreed to escort them, content in the knowledge that they would either die soon, or would die as soon as their paths diverged. He spent the first sunset alone\u2014if Faen was going to appear, he didn\u2019t want to frighten them.\nAron approached him, thanking him for his help, but Kehr wasn\u2019t interested in conversation. Still, Aron impressed him, given how he had defended a stranger\u2019s child, and had expressed gratitude while others cowered. Aron explained that these days, the kharza were everywhere, from the peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Kohl%20Mountains\"&gt;Kohl Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the foothills. Furthermore, they were getting organized. Aron explained that the column was a vanguard for the people of &lt;a href=\"Dunsmott\"&gt;Dunsmott&lt;/a&gt;.\nKehr was unmoved, telling Aron that nothing would be done about the kharza, as no king ruled in these lands. It was best for them to get across the Kohl and stay there. Kehr told him that he was the last of the Stag Tribe, but refused to explain how he had survived.\nFaen appeared as she always did, and her words remained the same. He had hoped that protecting the woodsmen would have redeemed him in Faen\u2019s eyes, but that clearly wasn\u2019t the case.\nThe next morning, the kharza attacked twice, and three more refugees died. The refugees closed ranks, and no more attacks occurred. Late in the day, Kehr had them erect a defensible camp, and then, despite their protests, he left them, claiming that he wished to survey the area. \nOver the next eight days, the attacks were fewer. Over the week, Kehr\u2019s demenor began to thaw; he became more accepting of conversation, as long as it was brief, and questions few. Kehr and Aron shared tales of their upbringings.\nThey reached the point where only two days on the Iron Road remained. However, the refugees were getting aggravated with the lack of food. Kehr remained unmoved, but flinched at the use of the word \u201cduty.\u201d He responded by pointing out that he had served as a sellsword for multiple employers, and had never barred steel for so little. Aron begged for his forgiveness, but Kehr told him that he\u2019d live if he left the refugees behind. If he stayed with them, he\u2019d die.\nAron stayed put. Kehr didn\u2019t, as he walked into the shadows. He called out to his sister to appear to him. She didn\u2019t appear, but kharza did, attacking him. He was bound and brought before a kharza twice as large as the others; the matriarch of the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Clan\"&gt;Bone Clan&lt;/a&gt;. He was forced to watch as the refugees were marched before him. The queen revealed that the attacks hadn\u2019t been intended to slay the refugees, but drive them to her. The queen claimed that Kehr was her servant, and Aron believed her. He demanded that he be allowd to kill Kehr. Amused, the queen let him have his axe.\nBefore they fought, Kehr told Aron the truth about his past. Aron revealed that he\u2019d known the truth of Kehr\u2019s mark the moment he\u2019d seen it, and used his axe to carve a new scar over it. Now, the mark said \u201cbrother.\u201d Aron was killed, but gaining power from his sacrifice, Kehr killed the matriarch and her followers. He went to the refugees and told them to gather their belongings. That their destination was two days\u2019 distant.\nKehr escorted the refugees to Westmarch, then headed back up the Iron Path, knowing that more refugees would be headed south. The Bone Clan had dwindled, but worse things than kharza dwelt within the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlands\"&gt;Dreadlands&lt;/a&gt;. Tales spread from Ivgorod to Westmarch of the Iron Wayfarer; the guardian of the path. "}

The quest is completed when players transmute Khalim's lost relics into &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Will%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Khalim's Will&lt;/a&gt; and use it to smash the &lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Orb\"&gt;Compelling Orb&lt;/a&gt; in the Temple of Light in &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;, opening the way to &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s lair: the &lt;a href=\"Durance%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Durance of Hate&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe ancient &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Hatred, beneath the Guardian Tower in the temple city of &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; soon started corrupting the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;, the spiritual rulers of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20priesthood\"&gt;Zakarum priesthood&lt;/a&gt; religion and assigned jailors of the Lord of Hatred. As more and more of the priesthood turned to serve &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; gained control over the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;'s holy warriors and soon the entire Church was bent on carrying out the Lord of Hatred's orders. One by one the priests fell under &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;'s malevelont sway. All but one. The &lt;a href=\"Que-Hegan\"&gt;Que-Hegan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be incorruptible. Enraged, &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; ordered the &lt;a href=\"High%20Council%20of%20Zakarum\"&gt;High Council of Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; to slaughter the priest and scatter his remains throughout the region. &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; then proceeded with shielding of his lair by using an artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Orb\"&gt;Compelling Orb&lt;/a&gt;, which he also used to control the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20priesthood\"&gt;Zakarum priesthood&lt;/a&gt; and their followers.\n&lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit never died, however; it lingered within his remaining relics: his Eye, Heart, Brain and Flail. And &lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit was still fixed on bringing the Lord of Hatred down, ending the corruption that defiled the &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt;. If heroes manage to reunite &lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim&lt;/a&gt;'s lost relics and carry out his Will, the Lord of Hatred will become vulnerable at last.\nFurther information and tips.\n&lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim's&lt;/a&gt; relics are scattered throughout the wilderness, but luckily the quest log provides some directions. The first relic, the &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Khalim's Eye&lt;/a&gt;, is hidden within a golden chest in the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Cavern\"&gt;Spider Cavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Forest\"&gt;Spider Forest&lt;/a&gt;. There is another more or less identical cave in the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Forest\"&gt;Spider Forest&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Arachnid%20Lair\"&gt;Arachnid Lair&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't find the Eye inside the golden chest you may want to check if you're in the right spider-infested cave. The Eye is guarded by a Unique Spider boss called &lt;a href=\"Sszark%20The%20Burning\"&gt;Sszark The Burning&lt;/a&gt;; a nasty spider with lots of minions.\nThe next relic is located in the &lt;a href=\"Flayer%20Dungeon\"&gt;Flayer Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Flayer%20Jungle\"&gt;Flayer Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance looks like a staircase and is usually hidden within a small &lt;a href=\"Fetish\"&gt;Flayer&lt;/a&gt; village (occasionally, the very same one where &lt;a href=\"The%20Gidbinn%20%28Diablo%20II%29\"&gt;the Gidbinn&lt;/a&gt; was found). The Dungeon has several levels filled with annoying packs of &lt;a href=\"Fetish\"&gt;Flayer&lt;/a&gt; monsters, their shamans and undead flayers. &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Brain\"&gt;Khalim's Brain&lt;/a&gt; is hidden in a golden chest on level three. The third level is a maze of small corridors and dead ends, the chest itself is guarded by a Flayer Shaman boss, &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Endugu\"&gt;Witch Doctor Endugu&lt;/a&gt;. His flame breath is especially deadly, but having a decent amount of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; should limit the damage done.\nIt might take a while before you reach the location of the third relic, the &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Khalim's Heart&lt;/a&gt;. The Heart is hidden within the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Act%20III%29\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kurast\"&gt;Kurast&lt;/a&gt;; entrances to the sewers can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Bazaar\"&gt;Kurast Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Kurast\"&gt;Upper Kurast&lt;/a&gt;. The first level of the sewers is huge, be prepared to battle your way through legions of undead and packs of &lt;a href=\"Gloombat\"&gt;Gloombat&lt;/a&gt;s. This time the entrance to the second level is hidden; you have to search for a special lever that will lower a staircase to the second level. The sewer lever is guarded by a Unique bat boss called &lt;a href=\"Icehawk%20Riftwing\"&gt;Icehawk Riftwing&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his special status, Riftwing has relatively little health and should go down quickly. Lower the staircase and enter the second level; this small room is filled with gold and a golden chest containing the Heart. There are a few &lt;a href=\"Tentacle%20Beast\"&gt;Tentacle Beast&lt;/a&gt;s lurking in the pool in the centre of the room, but they shouldn't pose a serious threat. Now you have all of &lt;a href=\"Khalim\"&gt;Khalim&lt;/a&gt;'s remains; only his Flail remains.\n&lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Flail\"&gt;Khalim's Flail&lt;/a&gt; can be found within &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt;. This part of the quest is usually combined with the &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Temple%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Blackened Temple&lt;/a&gt; quest, as the flail is held by one of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20Member\"&gt;Council Member&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Travincal\"&gt;Travincal&lt;/a&gt; can be reached by passing through &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Kurast\"&gt;Upper Kurast&lt;/a&gt; and over the &lt;a href=\"Kurast%20Causeway\"&gt;Kurast Causeway&lt;/a&gt;. The Temple City is filled with &lt;a href=\"Zakarum%20Zealots\"&gt;Zakarum Zealots&lt;/a&gt;, priests and &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s; a waypoint is hidden within an empty temple to the left. When you approach the Guardian Tower a quest log should pop up and the Council Members should appear. The Flail is dropped by Vilehand.\nNow it's time for the final part. Put all the relics into the &lt;a href=\"Horadric%20Cube\"&gt;Horadric Cube&lt;/a&gt; together with the flail and transmute them. Now you have the unique flail &lt;a href=\"Khalim%27s%20Will%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Khalim's Will&lt;/a&gt;. The Guardian Tower should be cleared by now; if not, kill the remaining Council Members or Vampires (some Council Members especially tend to get stuck within the Guardian Tower). To the left you should see a red glowing orb; the infamous &lt;a href=\"Compelling%20Orb\"&gt;Compelling Orb&lt;/a&gt; Cain told you about. Equip Khalim's Will and attack the Orb, it might take a few swings before you finally shatter it. Red mist clouds should spread through the temple and swirl towards the blood-stained staircase, which opens and reveals the passage to the &lt;a href=\"Durance%20of%20Hate\"&gt;Durance of Hate&lt;/a&gt;. The quest is complete, and its time to face &lt;a href=\"Mephisto\"&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;...\nAfter completing this quest, minions of &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; will flee from player and don't attack unless player attacks them, as their hatred has cooled somewhat without the Compelling Orb."}

Khanduras is best known for the events surrounding &lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;'s return and the darkening of &lt;a href=\"Tristram\"&gt;Tristram&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to Westmarch, Khanduras has always been poorer than its neighbor, which has long been a point of resentment.\nThe north of Khanduras is a land of swamps and fens. There were once many castles in the land, but over time, they fell into ruin, absorbed by trees and the earth itself (the family of &lt;a href=\"the%20Countess\"&gt;the Countess&lt;/a&gt; was the last noble family left in the region, before their fall). The crofters who remained lived in poverty, getting very little out of the north\u2019s sticky, muddy, icy soil. Most made charcoal, selling it to places as far abroad as &lt;a href=\"Ivgorod\"&gt;Ivgorod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lut%20Gholein\"&gt;Lut Gholein&lt;/a&gt;, though were paid little for it. &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20oil\"&gt;Swamp oil&lt;/a&gt; was another resource which was sold abroad. Some gained coin by leading travelers through the bogs and dangers.\nDespite the poverty of the marsh, the northerners were proud that they could live in their own fashion, where the people of the south of Khanduras feared to tread.\n&lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Hallow's Wake&lt;/a&gt; is celebrated in Khanduras.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThere is circumstantial evidence that Khanduras was populated by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s by the 7th century.\nYears after the last of the &lt;a href=\"Horadrim\"&gt;Horadrim&lt;/a&gt; had died, a great and prosperous society grew in the lands of the West. As time wore on, many Eastern pilgrims settled in the lands surrounding Khanduras and soon established small, self-contained kingdoms. A few of these kingdoms bickered with Khanduras over holdings of property or routes of trade. These squabbles did little to upset the lasting peace of the West, and the kingdom of Westmarch proved to be a strong ally of Khanduras as the two lands steadily engaged in ventures of barter and commerce. However, relations were strained, as Westmarch was much wealthier than Khanduras. Many bandits operating from Khanduras raided Westmarch, and &lt;a href=\"Torion\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; suspected that some of their ill-gotten gains ended up in Khanduras's coffers. However, this was never proven.\nDuring Khanduras's long range of peace, most towns and cities agreed upon a standard &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; coin to use in trade. The garb of those who rule in Khanduras grew more ornate with each generation.\nDuring this time, a bold, new religion of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Zakarum\"&gt;Zakarum&lt;/a&gt; began to spread throughout the kingdom of Westmarch and into many of its northern principalities. Zakarum, founded in the Far East, implored followers to enter into the Light and forsake the darkness that lurked within their souls. The people of Westmarch adopted the statutes of Zakarum as their sacred mission in the world. Westmarch began to turn towards its neighbors, expecting them to embrace this new beginning as well. Tensions rose between the kingdoms of Westmarch and Khanduras as the priests of Zakarum began to preach their foreign dogma whether they were welcomed or not.\nIt was in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%231258\"&gt;1258&lt;/a&gt; then that &lt;a href=\"Leoric\"&gt;Leoric&lt;/a&gt; came unto the lands of Khanduras and, in the name of Zakarum, declared himself king. Leoric was a deeply religious man and had brought many knights and priests with him that comprised his &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Order of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. Leoric and his trusted advisor, the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Lazarus\"&gt;Archbishop Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;, made their way to the city of Tristram. Leoric appropriated the ancient, decrepit &lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Cathedral\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of the town for his seat of power and renovated it to match its time-lost glory. Although the free people of Khanduras were not pleased with being placed under the sudden rule of a foreign King, Leoric served them with justice and might. Eventually, the people of Khanduras grew to respect the kind Leoric, sensing that he sought only to guide and protect them against the oppression of darkness.\nThe Awakening.\nWhat Leoric didn't know was that his throne of power was right above where Diablo, Lord of Terror, had been sealed by the Horadrim centuries ago. After being freed by Lazarus, the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; chose Leoric as his mortal host. Leoric kept this a secret, convinced that his piety would allow him to overcome the ordeal, but nonetheless, Diablo was able to influence the king's behavior. His rule became increasingly tyrannical, and the people took to calling him \"the Black King.\" Lazarus, who was secretly in league with Diablo, attempted to remove Leoric's closest allies by convincing the king that Westmarch was plotting against him. The paranoid monarch thus ordered that his armies march on Westmarch and his advisors be sent as \"emissaries.\" It was a war that no-one in Khanduras wanted, but nonetheless, his armies were bound to serve their king and marched to battle.\nThe outcome was a boon for the demon lord. Khanduras's army was torn apart by Westmarch's superior numbers and defensive positions. In Tristram, Leoric was left with no-one, his &lt;a href=\"Asylla\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; dead by his own deranged orders, his &lt;a href=\"Aidan\"&gt;elder son&lt;/a&gt; gone with the army, and his &lt;a href=\"Albrecht\"&gt;younger son&lt;/a&gt; now Diablo's host. The knight &lt;a href=\"Lachdanan\"&gt;Lachdanan&lt;/a&gt;, having returned from the disastorous war, confronted his king. Beyond salvation, Leoric fell to Lachdanan's blade.\nThus, Khanduras was left without a ruler. Darkness came to Tristram and the surrounding countryside, with Diablo unleashing his demons upon the land. Eventually, Diablo was defeated, by a returned Aidan, along with two &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Raven\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Summoner\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the cost included Albrecht's life, and after attempting to bind the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Evil\"&gt;Prime Evil&lt;/a&gt; within himself, Aidan's soul.\nReturning Light, Returning Darkness.\nDiablo's acts had a foul legacy on Khanduras\u2014his journey to the east left Tristram destroyed in his wake, the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20the%20Sightless%20Eye\"&gt;Sisters of the Sightless Eye&lt;/a&gt; temporarily lost their &lt;a href=\"Eastgate\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt;, and demons and &lt;a href=\"khazra\"&gt;khazra&lt;/a&gt; roamed the countryside. Yet in the years following the defeat of the Prime Evils, merchants slowly began to return to the region, looking to profit from adventurers who plumbed the depths of the Tristram Cathedral. The town of &lt;a href=\"New%20Tristram\"&gt;New Tristram&lt;/a&gt; arose, but fell into decline.\nTwenty years after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Baal\"&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Arreat\"&gt;Mount Arreat&lt;/a&gt;, evil once again touched Khanduras. The &lt;a href=\"Coven\"&gt;Coven&lt;/a&gt; had infiltrated the region, and with the fall of &lt;a href=\"Tyrael\"&gt;Tyrael&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"High%20Heavens\"&gt;High Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; themselves rose to attack the living. Ultimately, New Tristram and the surrounding countryside were saved, but not without cost to its people. Months afterwards, roving packs of demons can be found roaming Khanduras.\nCowpocalypse.\nAround this time, rumors spread through &lt;a href=\"Khanduras\"&gt;Khanduras&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Bovine\"&gt;bipedal bovines&lt;/a&gt; overruning various townships throughout the country. Artistic renderings of these creatures were placed in various inns. One terrified farmer even referred to this surge of sightings as the \"Cowpocalypse.\" The sightings were decried as a hoax, but citizens were issued an advisory to stay clear of the wilds, and not enter any strange portals that may or may not lead to &lt;a href=\"Not%20the%20Cow%20Level\"&gt;alternate planes of existence&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game.\nKhanduras has featured in almost every \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20series\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" game. In \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20I\"&gt;Diablo I&lt;/a&gt;\", the player is confined to Tristram, while it forms the basis of the first &lt;a href=\"act\"&gt;act&lt;/a&gt; of both \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20II\"&gt;Diablo II&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;III&lt;/a&gt;\". In \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Immortal\"&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/a&gt;\", Khanduras is explored in the &lt;a href=\"Wortham\"&gt;Wortham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood\"&gt;Dark Wood&lt;/a&gt; zones. \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20IV\"&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/a&gt;\" will be the first game where Khanduras is not explorable."}

Due to the road to &lt;a href=\"Alcarnus\"&gt;Alcarnus&lt;/a&gt; being blocked, The Nephalem had to divert to the outpost on their journey.
