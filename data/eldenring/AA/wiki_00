Dual-Wielding.\nPaired weapons differ from dual-wielding in a few distinct ways:\nAlthough two-handing paired weapons have these advantages, dual-wielding can potentially inflict more damage with dual attacks (L1 on consoles), and can potentially apply more status effects by applying different affinities/buffs to either weapon."}

There is also a small number of reusable &lt;a href=\"Tools\"&gt;Tools&lt;/a&gt; that can deflect specific attacks, although this is not strictly a \"parry\".\nMost &lt;a href=\"Enemies\"&gt;Enemies&lt;/a&gt; in the game have some number of attacks that can be deflected via parry, including many of the &lt;a href=\"Bosses\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt;, but there is no visual queue or sound effect that makes it obvious whether or not an attack can be parried.\nThe parry mechanic can be broken down into three parts: startup, active and recovery. During the startup animation, the character will prepare to deflect an attack and is still vulnerable. Then the parry becomes active for a certain number of time, in which an incoming attack will be deflected. Afterwards follows the recovery time of the move, in which the user is vulnerable again. When hit during the startup or recovery frames of a parry, the attack will deal stamina damage similar to blocking.\nStartup, active and recovery times are measured in frames, with one frame being equal to 0.01667 seconds at 60 FPS.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

However, during the Shattering they became active combatants, using their apothecarial skills to produce poisons and elixirs. The art of perfuming, once jealously guarded within the capital, became widespread as the war raged on.\nAmong the perfumers were those who travelled the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; in search of new aromatics that could be used to treat those seen as impure, such as Misbegotten and Omen. One such perfumer, Tricia, dedicated her efforts to treating the impure, going as far as to watch over them as they died to ensure that they passed peacefully.\n&lt;a href=\"Omenkiller%20Rollo\"&gt;Rollo&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Omenkiller\"&gt;Omenkiller&lt;/a&gt;, was once a famous perfumer who imbibed a physick to rid himself of emotion, allowing him to hunt Omen.&lt;tabber&gt;\nPerfumer=\nVariant Description.\nWhite-robed perfumers of the Erdtree Capital, sporting aprons embroidered with depictions of the Erdtree.

A single depraved perfumer is amongst those who slaughtered the inhabitants of the Village of the Albinaurics.\nAttacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Spark%20Aromatic\"&gt;Spark Aromatic&lt;/a&gt;: Comes in two variations, either long or wide. The long variant can be sidestepped while the wide variant can be jumped over, but can be used quickly twice in a row. The wide variant is their most common attack, while the long variant is uncommon. &lt;br&gt;\nStab: A lunge leading into a simple forward stab, used at close range. Parriable. &lt;br&gt;\nAttack Chain: A slash followed by a stab. Sometimes used at melee range. Parriable. &lt;br&gt;\nBlock: A passive blocking stance, used when all targets are beyond the range of their Spark Aromatic. &lt;br&gt;\nDisengage: Jumps backwards while throwing out a Spark Aromatic, used to gain some distance if an enemy remains at melee range. &lt;br&gt;\nHealing Flask: Takes a quick chug to recover half their health. Has limited uses (about 2 per Depraved Perfumer) and cannot be blocked by &lt;a href=\"Albinauric%20Pot\"&gt;Albinauric Pot&lt;/a&gt;s or other such items. Only used when below half health and similar in animation to the Bloodboil Aromatic. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bloodboil%20Aromatic\"&gt;Bloodboil Aromatic&lt;/a&gt;: Chugs a flask to power up, gaining a weak, red effect around its body and increasing damage dealt while also increasing damage taken. Rarely used and similar to the Healing Flask. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20Spraymist\"&gt;Poison Spraymist&lt;/a&gt;: Throws out a cloud of &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;-causing mist, causing a moderate amount of build-up. &lt;br&gt;\nDodge: Dashes to the side to try and get away. \nDrops.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nBosses.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nPerfumer Tricia=\nBackground.\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Misbegotten%20Warrior%23Unsightly%20Catacombs\"&gt;Misbegotten Warrior#Unsightly Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;\"&lt;br&gt;\nA perfumer who dedicated her efforts to treating Misbegotten, Omen, and all those seen as impure. She remained with them as they died, ensuring that they passed peacefully and without pain, not unlike the origins of the deathbed companions.\nTricia is fought alongside a Misbegotten Warrior, which she provides support for. \n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The player's resistance to this status ailment is determined by their &lt;a href=\"Stats%20and%20Attributes%23Resistance\"&gt;Immunity&lt;/a&gt; stat, which is increased by the Vigor stat.\nMechanics.\nPoison accumulates gradually and comes into effect once the threshold is reached. The higher the player's Immunity stat, the longer it will take for Poison to become effective. Immunity can be increased by increasing the Vigor stat. Once effective, the player will receive continual damage over time until the effect wears off.\nTypes of Poison.\nThe damage received from poison can vary greatly depending on the source and the target inflicted. In general, poison is split up into two categories: Normal and Deadly.\nNormal poison is generally the most common and is automatically granted to any weapon that has it's affinity changed to Poison with one exception. \nDeadly poison is innate to the weapons that already come with it and damages it's targets at a faster rate than normal poison. However, it does not last as long and the total damage received from a single proc of Deadly Poison is ultimately lower than Normal Poison. \nFighting against Poison.\n&lt;Tabber&gt;\n&lt;/Tabber&gt;\nFighting with Poison.\n&lt;Tabber&gt;\n has a unique property that allows it to inflict burst-damage through an un-named &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Loss\"&gt;Blood Loss&lt;/a&gt;-like status effect on targets that are already poisoned. Damage received is mostly based on a percentage of the Target's total HP pool. Triggering this effect will instantly cure the target's poison ailment making it most efficient when applied just before their affliction is about to wear off. This is a downside particularly in Online-PvP, as the effect can trigger while the target is in i-frames, allowing them to take no damage from the proc while at the same time be cured of their poison status. However this property can also be taken advantage of, as this allows the player to constantly re-trigger the &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20of%20Rot%27s%20Exultation\"&gt;Kindred of Rot's Exultation&lt;/a&gt; buff from continuously poisoning the same target multiple times in quick succession.\nThere are certain equipment that gives the player buffs when poison has been inflicted in the general vicinity, they do not discriminate between what has been poisoned in order to activate, it can be friend, foe and even oneself and generally lasts for around 20 seconds since the last poison infliction.\n&lt;/Tabber&gt;\nEnvironment.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nPoison swamps can be found in several locations throughout the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey generally comprise of bodies of filthy sludge that continuously build up Poison as the player is standing in them. Rolling around in said sludge will also cover the player-character's body with the fluids, which will slowly yet consistently build up poison even if the player is no longer directly standing in the liquid itself or even tries to cure their poison ailment with boluses. While these stains will gradually wear off over time, they can be removed immediately if it's raining, the player rolls around in clean water or uses &lt;a href=\"Soap\"&gt;Soap&lt;/a&gt;.\nPoison traps are environmental hazards that are deployed by &lt;a href=\"Vulgar%20Militia\"&gt;Vulgar Militia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey come in the form of a cluster of small spiked balls on the floor. Coming into contact with these will make them explode, releasing a poisonous gas that obscures the players vision, while also making any Vulgar Militiamen hiding in the general vicinity spring forth and ambush the player in the ensuing smokescreen.\nPoison traps can be found in a few areas of the game:\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEnemies capable of inflicting Poison.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nNPCs capable of inflicting Poison include:\nBosses capable of inflicting Poison include:\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEnemy resistances against Poison.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

He was also familiar with &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20Sellen\"&gt;Sellen&lt;/a&gt;, a sorceress who owes him a favour for assisting her when she was expelled from the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeluvis is a collector of \"puppets\"; living beings transformed into thralls through the administration of a special &lt;a href=\"Seluvis%27s%20Potion\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; brewed using &lt;a href=\"Starlight%20Shards\"&gt;Starlight Shards&lt;/a&gt;.

If Nepheli drinks the potion, she will fall into a deep slumber and become a &lt;a href=\"Nepheli%20Loux%20Puppet\"&gt;puppet&lt;/a&gt;, with her body residing in Seluvis' basement. Alternatively, if the Tarnished shows the potion to Gideon, he will dispose of it himself and suggest that the Tarnished tell Seluvis that they gave Nepheli the potion. The potion can also be fed to the &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Eater\"&gt;Dung Eater&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in him becoming a &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Eater%20Puppet\"&gt;Dung Eater Puppet&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nWhen the Tarnished confronts Seluvis about his collection of puppets, he offers to brew them their own puppet in exchange for Starlight Shards. If they accept, Seluvis will later task them with retrieving an &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Starlight\"&gt;Amber Starlight&lt;/a&gt;, with which he brews an &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Draught\"&gt;Amber Draught&lt;/a&gt; intended to turn Ranni into his puppet.

It is described as a torrent of &lt;a href=\"glintstone\"&gt;glintstone&lt;/a&gt; flowing from a distant star cluster, often likened to a celestial procession of stars.\nHowever, those who gaze into the current are bewitched by its cosmic mysteries, often driven to the brink of despair.\nBackground.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt; triggered a great rupture in the &lt;a href=\"One%20Great\"&gt;One Great&lt;/a&gt;, scattering the ancient life of the stars across the cosmos. This celestial event is seen as the primordial &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20Causality\"&gt;causality&lt;/a&gt; that led to fractures, births, and &lt;a href=\"Spirits\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn ancient &lt;a href=\"astrologer\"&gt;astrologer&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; perceived the primeval current, giving it form and bringing its &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Starlight\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt; raining down upon the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. These celestial phenomena introduced &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Sorcery\"&gt;glintstone sorcery&lt;/a&gt; and its cosmic vitality into the world.\nMany of these shooting stars became meteors that struck the Lands Between, giving rise to the &lt;a href=\"Alabaster%20Lord\"&gt;Alabaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onyx%20Lord\"&gt;Onyx Lord&lt;/a&gt;s and lifting &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt; into the sky. The first star to arrive carried &lt;a href=\"Metyr%2C%20Mother%20of%20Fingers\"&gt;Metyr, Mother of Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the Greater Will. Later, a golden star descended, bearing the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt;, which would become the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Black%20Moon\"&gt;Black Moon&lt;/a&gt; once hung over &lt;a href=\"Nokstella%2C%20Eternal%20City\"&gt;Nokstella&lt;/a&gt;, guiding countless stars. However, it was lost when the &lt;a href=\"Nox\"&gt;Nox&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Fingerslayer%20Blade\"&gt;Fingerslayer Blade&lt;/a&gt; against Metyr, enraging the Greater Will. In response, the Greater Will sent &lt;a href=\"Astel%2C%20Naturalborn%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Astel, Naturalborn of the Void&lt;/a&gt;, to assault the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Cities\"&gt;Eternal Cities&lt;/a&gt;. Astel unleashed a hail of &lt;a href=\"Meteorite%20of%20Astel\"&gt;meteorites&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Eternal%20City\"&gt;Nameless Eternal City&lt;/a&gt; and stealing its night sky, an act that banished the Eternal Cities underground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt; was later founded by two &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Sorcerers\"&gt;glintstone sorcerers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Sorcerer%20Azur\"&gt;Azur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Sorcerer%20Lusat\"&gt;Lusat&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to uncover the secrets of glintstone and the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Crystalian\"&gt;Crystalian&lt;/a&gt;s. Both peered beyond the \"wisdom of stone\" into the primeval current and were irrevocably changed by what they saw. Azur was left bewitched and haunted by the &lt;a href=\"abyss\"&gt;abyss&lt;/a&gt;, while Lusat was shattered after witnessing the dying &lt;a href=\"Starlight%20Shards\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; of a star cluster.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Carians&lt;/a&gt;, worshippers of the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; and allies of the crystalians, gained control of the academy, they suppressed the study of the primeval current. However, &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20Sellen\"&gt;Sorceress Sellen&lt;/a&gt; defied this ban, obsessively pursuing its secrets. Operating under the alias of the Graven Witch, she transformed her fellow sorcerers into &lt;a href=\"Graven%20Mass\"&gt;Graven Mass&lt;/a&gt;es\u2014the seeds of stars. For her treachery, she was expelled from the academy.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, a young &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;General Radahn&lt;/a&gt; applied the &lt;a href=\"Gravity%20Sorcery\"&gt;Gravity Sorcery&lt;/a&gt; he had learned from an Alabaster Lord in &lt;a href=\"Sellia%2C%20Town%20of%20Sorcery\"&gt;Sellia, Town of Sorcery&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Conflict\"&gt;Starscourge Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, Radahn stood alone against the stars and triumphed.\nHis victory halted the movement of the stars, thereby forestalling the fate of his sister, &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni&lt;/a&gt;."}

She is the most influential &lt;a href=\"characters\"&gt;figure&lt;/a&gt; in the world of . \nOverview.\nEarly Life.\nMarika was a &lt;a href=\"Numen\"&gt;Numen&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20Village\"&gt;Shaman Village&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterland\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hornsent%20%28people%29\"&gt;Hornsent&lt;/a&gt; considered the flesh of Shamans to meld harmoniously with others, and utilised this property in the jar rituals conducted on persecuted criminals, who were sliced up and stuffed into the jars to be reborn as saints instead. The people of Marika's village were stolen away from their home to be used for this purpose.\nMarika was at some point recognised as an &lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt; and gifted a &lt;a href=\"Shadowbound%20Beast\"&gt;Shadowbound Beast&lt;/a&gt;: her half-brother &lt;a href=\"Maliketh\"&gt;Maliketh&lt;/a&gt;. She later ascended to godhood at the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;Gate of Divinity&lt;/a&gt; atop the tower of &lt;a href=\"Enir-Ilim\"&gt;Enir-Ilim&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the vessel for the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;. This affair led to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scadutree\"&gt;Scadutree&lt;/a&gt;, and was considered a betrayal by the Hornsent.\nPrior to or following her ascension, Marika came into conflict with another Empyrean known as the &lt;a href=\"Gloam-Eyed%20Queen\"&gt;Gloam-Eyed Queen&lt;/a&gt;. After emerging victorious, and desiring a world free of &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Destined Death&lt;/a&gt;, she removed the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; from the Elden Ring, using Maliketh as a vessel to lock it away, thus establishing the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point during this period, Marika took the warrior &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%2C%20First%20Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; as her consort, who became both the first demigod and first Elden Lord.\nEventually, Marika returned to the abandoned Shaman Village for the last time. After cutting off a braid of her hair and leaving it as an offering to the &lt;a href=\"Grandmother\"&gt;Grandmother&lt;/a&gt;, she bathed her home in the healing light of gold, knowing full well that there was no one to heal, and would never return.\nAge of the Erdtree.\nIn the early days, everything was in opposition to the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. With Godfrey\u2019s aid, Marika waged a &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Giants\"&gt;War Against the Giants&lt;/a&gt; atop the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;frigid northern mountains&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Ruin\"&gt;Flame of Ruin&lt;/a&gt; was capable of burning the Erdtree. Ultimately victorious, Marika was believed to have slain the &lt;a href=\"Fell%20God\"&gt;Fell God&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giants\"&gt;Fire Giants&lt;/a&gt;. Upon learning that the Flame of Ruin would never die, however, she cursed the last of the giants to tend to it for eternity. Marika declared the path the mountains as &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Lands\"&gt;Forbidden Lands&lt;/a&gt; and excised details of the war from history.\nMarika and Godfrey would rule together and have at least three children: &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt; and the twins &lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg&lt;/a&gt;. The twins were both born as accursed &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt; and were hidden in the depths below the &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, Godfrey and his &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lineage\"&gt;Golden Lineage&lt;/a&gt; would be counted as the first of the demigods. Godfrey went on to conquer many lands for the Erdtree.\nLiurnian Wars.\nQueen Marika desired to conquer &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, the land of the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Carian Royal Family&lt;/a&gt;. She declared war on the glintstone sorcerers and sent a golden host led by her secret other half: a red-haired champion named &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt;. The champions of the moon, led by &lt;a href=\"Rennala\"&gt;Rennala&lt;/a&gt;, repelled the glorious warriors of the Erdtree for a time but it ended in a draw. In the second Liurnian War, Radagon invades again but this time, he uses the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Dew\"&gt;Celestial Dew&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Church of Vows&lt;/a&gt; in a ritual to recant his aggressions and seek absolution. The Carian Queen accepted and their wrongdoings were washed away. The two were wed and produced three children: &lt;a href=\"Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rykard\"&gt;Rykard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ranni\"&gt;Ranni&lt;/a&gt;.\nGodfrey's banishment.\nWith her rule secure, Marika announced her intention to search the depths of the Golden Order, declaring the early days of blind belief a thing long past. When Godfrey's last foe fell it was said the hue of his eyes had faded. Marika banished him and his kinfolk from the Lands Between, robbing them of their &lt;a href=\"grace\"&gt;grace&lt;/a&gt;, thus creating the first &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, all in the hope that they would grow stronger by waging war in lands outside her rule, dying, and then eventually being revived with their guidance of grace returned. \nMarika sent her son &lt;a href=\"Messmer%20the%20Impaler\"&gt;Messmer&lt;/a&gt; away on a &lt;a href=\"crusade\"&gt;crusade&lt;/a&gt; into the lands of the Hornsent. Despite her precautions, her fear of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Serpent\"&gt;Abyssal Serpent&lt;/a&gt; sealed within him led her to trap him within the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, where he would wage war to exterminate the Hornsent and devastate their lands. No matter how many of her enemies burned in his &lt;a href=\"Messmerfire\"&gt;flame&lt;/a&gt;, however, Messmer received no sign from Marika to end his crusade. To hide away these actions and the true nature of her godhood, Marika hid the Realm of Shadow behind a magical veil to obscure it from public knowledge.\nKing Consort Radagon.\nAfter Godfrey's banishment from the Lands Between, Marika took &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt; as second husband and King Consort, elevating him to become the second Elden Lord. Radagon already had three children with &lt;a href=\"Rennala%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Full%20Moon\"&gt;Queen Rennala&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Carian Royal Family&lt;/a&gt;, and after his union with Marika, she would raise her new step-children, &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rykard%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blasphemy\"&gt;Rykard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni&lt;/a&gt;, to demigod status.\nMarika and Radagon would go on to have two more children of their own, the twins &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20the%20Kind\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt;, who like Marika herself and Radagon's daughter Ranni, were Empyreans, and were thus potential successors to Marika. However, Radagon and Marika were in truth the same. Radagon was described as Marika's male \"other self\". Thus the twins were the children of a single god, and they were both born afflicted: Malenia with &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;rotting sickness&lt;/a&gt; and Miquella with eternal childhood.\nNight of Black Knives.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh. For a long time it was not known who was behind the plot, but it is finally revealed it was in fact Ranni who stole the fragment of the rune to forge god-slaying &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife\"&gt;black knives&lt;/a&gt; through a fearsome rite. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Assassin\"&gt;Black Knife Assassins&lt;/a&gt;, Numen women purported to have close ties to Marika herself, used these knives to slay Godwyn the Golden, the first recorded death of a demigod in all history. Queen Marika is said to have been driven to the brink by this event, and some time later she shattered the Elden Ring using her &lt;a href=\"Marika%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt;. She had already instructed her demigod children to fight for the positions of Elden Lord and that of godhood.\nThe Shattering.\nFragments of the ring splintered into Great Runes and spread across the Lands Between, starting a &lt;a href=\"The%20Shattering\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; between her demigod children. War after war was fought, but there was no victor. For her part, Marika would be imprisoned inside the Erdtree, possibly by the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt; itself. \nTrue to her promise to Godfrey and his warriors, grace was restored to the banished Tarnished. They would rise from their graves, and journey to the Lands Between to once again brandish the Elden Ring. The Tarnished formed the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where they worked to realize the goal given to them by Marika. They would be served by a &lt;a href=\"Misbegotten\"&gt;Misbegotten&lt;/a&gt; blacksmith named &lt;a href=\"Hewg\"&gt;Hewg&lt;/a&gt;, whom Marika herself had charged with smithing a \"god-slaying weapon\" before his imprisonment in the Hold.\nEndings.\nEventually, a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt; manages to fight their way into the Erdtree, where the shattered Marika lay imprisoned. Marika is suddenly released from her bonds, with Radagon asserting control of their shared body and confronting the Tarnished. After defeating Radagon and the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt; itself, the Tarnished may choose what to do with the fractured body of Marika. Marika's head is restored to her frame if the Elden Ring is mended, either by itself or with a Mending Rune. If Ranni is summoned, she picks up Marika's head gently, peacefully dissipating along with the rest of her body. If the Tarnished is the Lord of Frenzied Flame, Marika's head breaks apart and crumbles into ash. \nBy choosing to go down the Elden Lord path, whether the regular one or using any of the three Mending Runes to fix the Elden Ring within Marika, the Tarnished champion ushers in a new age. They become the third Elden Lord and effectively Marika's new consort in every one of them, except in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Age of the Stars&lt;/a&gt; (where they become consort to Ranni) and in the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Frenzied%20Flame%20%28ending%29\"&gt;Lord of Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt; ending (where they make the whole world burn). However, Queen Marika remains shattered and unresponsive, with only the Elden Ring itself shining brightly within her body.\nEchoes of Marika.\nAt certain &lt;a href=\"Sites%20of%20Grace\"&gt;Sites of Grace&lt;/a&gt;, the very words of Queen Marika yet linger. &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt; offers to share them with &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;the Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; if she is traveling with them. The seven Echoes of Marika are as follows:\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

He is encountered inside the Erdtree in &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Ashen%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Ashen Capital&lt;/a&gt;, and is the first half of the final boss fight, with &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt; as the second half.\nOverview.\nLiurnian Wars and Marriage to Queen Rennala.\nRadagon first rose to prominence during the Liurnian Wars, when he joined the heroes' ranks. A great champion with flowing red locks, he arrived in &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia&lt;/a&gt; at the head of a golden host, where he met &lt;a href=\"Rennala%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Full%20Moon\"&gt;Queen Rennala&lt;/a&gt; in battle. Although two wars would be fought between them, the First Liurnian War, and the Second, no victor would emerge from either. Radagon eventually repented his territorial aggressions by cleansing himself with &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Dew\"&gt;Celestial Dew&lt;/a&gt;, and swore his love to Rennala. He became husband to the Carian Queen, wedding her at the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Church of Vows&lt;/a&gt;. Rennala bequeathed him a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, bestowed by a Carian queen upon her spouse to honor long-standing tradition. After entering into marriage with Rennala and joining the Carian line, he ordered the Carian magic preceptors to don masks of confidence, to make it clear that all of their matters were to be kept strictly private.\nRadagon and Rennala had three children: &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Praetor%20Rykard\"&gt;Rykard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Princess%20Ranni\"&gt;Ranni&lt;/a&gt;. While husband to Rennala, Radagon studied glintstone sorcery taught at the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey, the First Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt; was stripped of grace and hounded from the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;, Radagon returned to the capital where he went on to marry Queen Marika and become her King Consort and second Elden Lord. Before leaving Rennala, Radagon gifted her &lt;a href=\"Great%20Rune%20of%20The%20Unborn\"&gt;an amber egg&lt;/a&gt;. His departure left her heartbroken, and eventually led to her being deposed by the academy and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Raya%20Lucaria%20Grand%20Library\"&gt;Grand Library&lt;/a&gt;. His three children from the previous marriage would be raised to demigod status as stepchildren of Queen Marika. \nMarriage to Queen Marika.\nA sculptor from Leyndell was commissioned to create a statue of Radagon. In doing so, he discovered a secret - that Radagon is Marika. This secret was hidden within the statue, and is revealed by casting &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20Regression\"&gt;Law of Regression&lt;/a&gt; in front of it, causing the statue's form to change from Radagon to Marika. \nRadagon and Marika had a twin daughter and son: &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt;. As they were born of a single god, they were both &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyreans&lt;/a&gt;, but were born afflicted: Malenia with &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;rotting sickness&lt;/a&gt; and Miquella with eternal childhood. \nWhile married to Marika, Radagon studied incantations. He is heavily associated with Golden Order Fundamentalism, a branch of the Golden Order said to be scholarship in all but name, which incorporates incantations that rely on a combination of faith and intelligence. His son Miquella followed in his fundamentalist footsteps, and created several incantations as gifts for his father. Radagon would return the favor with his own gift of gratitude to young Miquella, however Miquella later abandoned Fundamentalism, realising that it could do nothing to treat Malenia's Rot. \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Shattering\"&gt;The Shattering&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;, Marika shattered the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;, breaking the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;. Radagon, on the other hand, remained loyal to the Golden Order, and attempted to repair the Elden Ring with the same &lt;a href=\"Marika%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt; used to shatter it. As punishment, Marika was imprisoned inside the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. While Radagon had opposed Marika's treachery, he would share Marika's sentence, as the two were now bound in a single body. \nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; sets fire to the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; in order to burn away the wall of thorns denying their entry, they encounter the imprisoned Marika. Suddenly released from her bonds, her hair immediately turns red as Radagon assumes control of their shared body and wields Marika's hammer to fight the Tarnished. However, Radagon is unable to defeat them and falls at their hands, with his body being subsumed by the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt; to transform into &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Relic%20Sword\"&gt;a large sword&lt;/a&gt;, as it emerges to be the Tarnished champion's final challenge. \nBoss Fight.\nRadagon is the first of two enemies that compose the final boss fight of , with the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt; being the second. Players will have to fight Radagon again if they die to the Elden Beast.\nPhase 1.\nRadagon relies on very fast hammer swings, and some of his attacks will generate shockwaves. These shockwaves will either be immediate, or will occur after a brief delay- for the latter, golden cracks will appear in the ground moments before the explosion.\nAt range, Radagon can throw golden spears at the player. He will either leap into the air and throw a single, giant spear, or quickly hurl five spears in a loose fan. These spears will remain in the ground for a second before exploding. He also has a grab attack which he may perform at close- or mid-range. During the grab, his left arm will glow gold and he will wind it back behind him before lunging. The shockwave generated by the grab may still cause damage even if the grab itself misses. \nAll of his gold attacks will inflict &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nPhase 2.\nAfter his health has been lowered somewhat, he will leap into the air and perform a Gold Breaker attack, creating a large area of effect shockwave. During this phase, Radagon will sometimes teleport, generating an explosion when he reappears. In addition to the golden spear attacks used in the previous phase, he may now jump up and throw a volley of spears. His stomp will also now create a shockwave that deals Holy damage.\nPhase 3.\nOnce his health is below half, Radagon will teleport into the middle of the arena and perform three rapid hammer strikes on the ground, each producing a large shockwave. He will now teleport much more often, and can perform two shockwave-inducing hammer strikes in quick succession.\nEnvironment.\nThe arena is a featureless, oval platform with no obstacles. It is not possible to fall of the edges."}

She is one of the &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigods&lt;/a&gt;, and the focus of one of the game's most elaborate questlines.\nBackground.\nOriginally known as Lunar Princess Ranni, she was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt;, a champion of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Rennala\"&gt;Queen Rennala&lt;/a&gt;, head of both the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Carian Royal Family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt;. She had two older brothers, &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Praetor%20Rykard\"&gt;Rykard&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanni was also an &lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt;, meaning she had the potential to one day succeed &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika&lt;/a&gt; as the divine ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt; chose her as a potential successor and granted her a &lt;a href=\"Shadowbound%20Beast\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Blaidd\"&gt;Blaidd&lt;/a&gt; to be her vassal. He was approved of by Rennala, and was raised as her foster brother. Ranni grew up playing with Blaidd, and they were often accompanied by &lt;a href=\"War%20Counselor%20Iji\"&gt;Iji&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; blacksmith who served the Carian royals. \nLed by the hand of her mother Rennala, young Ranni would encounter her &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon\"&gt;Dark Moon&lt;/a&gt;. What she beheld was cold, dark and veiled in occult mystery. Deep in the woods, she would also encounter a &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Crone\"&gt;snowy crone&lt;/a&gt; who would go on to become her secret mentor. She was an old witch well versed in &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Sorceries\"&gt;cold-based sorceries&lt;/a&gt;, and she taught Ranni to fear the Dark Moon as she imparted her magic. The full Dark Moon, cold and leaden, would become Ranni's sigil and symbol of her power and authority. \nAt some point, Ranni's father would abandon her mother in order to marry Queen Marika and assume the title of second &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Ranni and her siblings were thus raised to Demigod status by their new stepmother. \nThe Night of Black Knives.\nAlthough the Two Fingers had chosen her as Marika's successor, Ranni did not wish to be a puppet for the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt; and resented her Empyrean fate. In order to escape it, Ranni stole a fragment of the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%2C%20the%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;Maliketh, the Black Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and through fearsome rite, imbued it into the blades of &lt;a href=\"Numen\"&gt;Numen&lt;/a&gt; assassins close to Queen Marika herself. She also gave &lt;a href=\"Blasphemous%20Claw\"&gt;a fragment&lt;/a&gt; to her brother &lt;a href=\"Praetor%20Rykard\"&gt;Rykard&lt;/a&gt; as a last resort, so he could kill Maliketh if necessary. Ranni plotted for the assassins to kill another individual while she simultaneously killed herself, slaying her own body while the other person died in spirit, thus freeing herself from being an Empyrean. \nIn what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;, the assassins murdered &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt;, killing him in spirit, while Ranni killed herself in body, transferring her spirit into a doll said to be modeled after the image of her mentor, the Snow Witch. This marked the step-siblings as the first demigod casualties in history. Ranni's fate and her involvement in the plot remained largely unknown by the denizens of the Lands Between. \nThe Shattering.\nAt some point after the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;shattered&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Ranni claimed a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Rune\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt;, but appears to have discarded it, and largely remained outside of &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;the conflict&lt;/a&gt; that followed. As a consequence of her doll body, Ranni required extended periods of hibernation and withdrew from the world, hiding in the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Manor\"&gt;Carian Manor&lt;/a&gt; while her agents worked to bring about her plan of ridding the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; of the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt;, allowing her to pursue her divine ascension on her own terms.\nLong after the Shattering, when the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; return to the Lands Between, Ranni hears of a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt; hurtling about on a &lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;spectral steed&lt;/a&gt; gifted to them by &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt;. Ranni approaches them at a site of grace, asking if they indeed have the spectral steed. She'll then give the Tarnished the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Calling%20Bell\"&gt;Spirit Calling Bell&lt;/a&gt;, noting Torrent's former master had entrusted her with giving it to the next owner.\nThe Tarnished champion, for their own purposes, makes their way into the Carian Manor and comes face to face with Ranni once again. Ranni accepts the Tarnished into her service and bids them to find a way into &lt;a href=\"Nokron%2C%20Eternal%20City\"&gt;Nokron&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to claim its treasure; &lt;a href=\"Fingerslayer%20Blade\"&gt;a weapon&lt;/a&gt; with which she could kill the Two Fingers who had chosen her as an Empyrean. The champion manages find their way into Nokron and secures the city's treasure for Ranni, whereupon she departs to &lt;a href=\"Nokstella%2C%20Eternal%20City\"&gt;Nokstella&lt;/a&gt;. The champion finds her there and she compels the champion to rid her of the Shadows sent by the Two Fingers to kill her. With the last Shadow defeated, Ranni rewards her champion with the keys to a chest containing &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Ring\"&gt;a ring&lt;/a&gt; intended to be bestowed to her future consort, and achieves her goal of slaying the Two Fingers. \nShould the Tarnished champion find the ring and give it to Ranni, she will take the champion as her new consort, and grant them a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt; as a symbol of their union. She will reveal to them the full extent of her plan: to succeed Queen Marika as god and usher in her \"&lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Age of the Stars&lt;/a&gt;\", removing herself far from the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; to journey out into the cosmos, allowing its inhabitants to have free will over their own choices and live their lives without the interference of the Greater Will. After defeating the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt;, the Tarnished is able to summon Ranni and usher in her age if they so choose. \nQuestline Progression.\nCompleting Ranni's questline will unlock the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Age of the Stars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ending\"&gt;ending&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;, wherein he became the Lord of Blasphemy. Amoung those that remained alive, their only loyalty to Rykard, if any, was to put their suffering lord to rest.\nOverview.\nThe Shattering.\nThe original Recusants were formed sometime after the Shattering, based in the &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor\"&gt;Volcano Manor&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rykard%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blasphemy\"&gt;Praetor Rykard&lt;/a&gt;, alongside his younger sister, &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Lunar Princess Ranni&lt;/a&gt;, played leading roles in the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt; plot that would ignite the war. Rykard was well aware the fallout would grant him an opportunity to upend the Golden Order which he despised. After making his heretical ambitions clear, many like-minded warriors flocked to his cause, and became the Recusants. A singular &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20Knight\"&gt;Crucible Knight&lt;/a&gt;, who would remain by &lt;a href=\"Tanith%2C%20Volcano%20Manor%20Proprietress\"&gt;Lady Tanith's&lt;/a&gt; side even after Rykard's death, may have served within or alongside the Recusants as early as this.\nThe original Recusants fought for Praetor Rykard against the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"Leyndell\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt;, who were commanded by &lt;a href=\"Morgott\"&gt;Morgott, the Grace Given&lt;/a&gt;. Their conflict would become the most appalling battle of the Shattering, a wretched, unending war with no glory. While not as severe as their Leyndell adversaries, some Recusants resorted to cannibalism to survive during the fighting, and others became inflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt; sickness.\nSometime during the conflict, Rykard fed himself to the &lt;a href=\"God-Devouring%20Serpent\"&gt;God-Devouring Serpent&lt;/a&gt; which lurked within Mt. Gelmir, becoming the Lord of Blasphemy. Praetor Rykard's once somewhat noble ambitions were twisted into nothing more than gluttonous depravity. The Lord of Blasphemy began to feed upon the Recusants's greatest warriors, attempting to absorb their strength into himself. At this point, their war against the Golden Order was pathed with mountains of corpses, and many Recusants were loosing the will to continue. With Rykard's transformations, even the most loyal amoung them could no longer abide anymore. From their perspective, it was Rykard who deserted them, but regardless, these Recusants served Rykard no more. Though most of Rykard's remaining Recusants dissipated, others actively attempted to slay him by searching for a mighty weapon capable of such a task, which they found in the &lt;a href=\"Serpent-Hunter\"&gt;Serpent-Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. This ancient enchanted spear had been crafted to hunt an immortal serpent in the distant past. Despite their efforts, no Recusant was able to kill Rykard, and the spear would come to reside in Rykard's chambers. The &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor%20Apparition\"&gt;ghost of a Recusant&lt;/a&gt; remains at the Volcano Manor to tell of the spear's existence, appearing to worthy champions who he believes may be able to spare his once-noble lord from further dishonor.\nRykard's consort, Tanith, excluding the possibility of her Crucible Knight bodygaurd, was the only known human to remain loyal to him after he became the Lord of Blasphemy. Utterly entralled by his new form, she dedicated herself to gathering a new force of Recusants to oppose the Golden Order. In reality, this new generation of Recusants was nothing more than a way to gather worthy sacrifices for lord Rykard to absorb into himself.\nThis group of Tarnished is similar in practice to &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Lord Mohg's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Finger%20%28Invader%29\"&gt;Bloody Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, in that they seek out and kill other Tarnished throughout the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. However, they seem to differ in long-term goals as well as rites of induction. The steps of becoming one of these invaders is far less ritualistic and complicated than entering the &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Fingers\"&gt;Bloody Fingers&lt;/a&gt;: the process and its end goal, however, are no less brutal. \nTo become a Recusant, one must simply venture to the Volcano Manor and speak to its proprietress: &lt;a href=\"Tanith%2C%20Volcano%20Manor%20Proprietress\"&gt;Tanith&lt;/a&gt;. If she extends an &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor%20Invitation\"&gt;Volcano Manor Invitation&lt;/a&gt; and one accepts, the inductee is greeted cordially and allowed to shelter at the Manor. From there, the inductee is given a letter detailing a target that needs killing: a fellow Tarnished. While staying at the Manor, it is also possible to take up contracts from fellow Recusants or aid them in accomplishing their own hits, as well as targeting and invading Tarnished of your choosing. However, unlike in the Bloody Fingers, simply attempting to kill Tarnished is not enough, nor is picking one's own targets: the assigned targets must die. Success is rewarded not only with another contract, but pieces of &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nOnce three assigned contracts are fulfilled, Tanith will offer the Recusant a chance to gain an audience with the true leader of the covenant: Lord Rykard himself. However, the Recusant may discover too late that the purpose of the contracts is to gauge and increase a Tarnished's strength, only to be fed to the Lord of Blasphemy. As their strength is absorbed into the abomination, the hope is that one day Rykard will become strong enough to devour the very &lt;a href=\"gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; themselves.\nLikely due to its inherently heretical standing, some prospective members of the covenant have refused their invitations, unwilling to become the covenant's champions.\nShould Rykard ultimately be killed, with no lord left to serve, Tanith will permit the current Recusant's dispersal. If &lt;a href=\"Rya%20the%20Scout\"&gt;Rya&lt;/a&gt;, the man-serpent daughter of Rykard, remained alive without the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Tonic%20of%20Forgetfulness\"&gt;Tonic of Forgetfulness&lt;/a&gt;, she leaves the Manor to embark on a journey. No less ignorant than those she recruited of the true sacrificial purpose of the current Recusants, Rya &lt;a href=\"Zorayas%27s%20Letter\"&gt;hoped to continue&lt;/a&gt; her adoptive mother's mission of opposing the Golden Order by gathering another force of effective Recusants elsewhere."}

Azur, along with &lt;a href=\"Lusat\"&gt;Lusat&lt;/a&gt;, was banished from the academy due to their study of the primeval current, a study Sellen wished to pursue. However, following accusations of unspeakable treatment of her fellow scholars under the name of the Graven Witch, Sellen too was expelled from the academy. Sellen had sought to restore the Primeval Current, desiring glintstone sorceries unbound by terrestrial taboos and the pedantry of the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Carian Royal Family&lt;/a&gt;.\nSellen was also an acquaintance of &lt;a href=\"Preceptor%20Seluvis\"&gt;Preceptor Seluvis&lt;/a&gt;, and a frequent visitor to his underground cellar, where he kept his collection of puppets. When Sellen was expelled, Seluvis helped her in some capacity, for which she owes him. \nAt some point following her banishment, Sellen was imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Witchbane%20Ruins\"&gt;Witchbane Ruins&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Peninsula\"&gt;Weeping Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, bound by the Academy's shackles. She managed to manifest a projection of herself in the &lt;a href=\"Waypoint%20Ruins\"&gt;Waypoint Ruins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that she meets the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, who becomes her apprentice, learning glintstone sorceries from her. When she learns that the Tarnished has found Master Azur on &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;, she requests that they seek out Master Lusat, speculating that he returned to his home of &lt;a href=\"Sellia%2C%20Town%20of%20Sorcery\"&gt;Sellia, Town of Sorcery&lt;/a&gt;. The Tarnished discovers Lusat, in a near-inorganic state much like Azur, in &lt;a href=\"Sellia%20Hideaway\"&gt;Sellia Hideaway&lt;/a&gt;, and reports back to Sellen.\nFreeing Sellen.\nMuch like &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt;, Sellen's fate is tied to the stars, and with the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;Starscourge Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, Sellen becomes dispossessed of her immortality. This makes her a target of &lt;a href=\"Castellan%20Jerren\"&gt;Jerren&lt;/a&gt;, a friend of the Carian Royal Family who once made a promise to exterminate the witch. Sellen reveals to the Tarnished that the form they have been speaking to is a projection, and that her true body resides in Witchbane Ruins. The Tarnished meets with Sellen's true body, shackled in the ruin's cellar, and she asks them to remove her &lt;a href=\"Sellen%27s%20Primal%20Glintstone\"&gt;Primal Glintstone&lt;/a&gt;, beseeching them to look after it. Jerren arrives to find Sellen's previous body already perished. The Tarnished later places Sellen's Primal Glintstone into a puppet in Seluvis's basement, which bears a striking resemblance to Sellen's old body.\nSellen, now in her new, more youthful body, returns to the Academy and displaces &lt;a href=\"Rennala%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Full%20Moon\"&gt;Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon&lt;/a&gt;. She has the bodies of Azur and Lusat moved back to the Academy, so that she can finally hone the Primeval Current. She offers her support to the Tarnished in their mission to become &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, and requests that when the time comes, they illuminate her about the secrets of life which course the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt; Before long, however, Jerren finally catches up to her. Should the Tarnished aid her in beating back Jerren, she will continue her research.

He is regarded as the mightiest hero of the demigods, and was feared as the strongest demigod of the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-Shattering.\nRadahn was born the son of &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt;, a champion of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Rennala\"&gt;Queen Rennala&lt;/a&gt;, head of both the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Carian Royal Family&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt;. He had two siblings, &lt;a href=\"Praetor%20Rykard\"&gt;Rykard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Princess%20Ranni\"&gt;Ranni&lt;/a&gt;. Radahn inherited his father's flaming red hair, and was fond of its heroic implications. From a young age, he was enamored with the Elden Lord &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;. Attempting to emulate his idol, Radahn adorned his armor with lions, the symbol of Godfrey. \nAt some point, the first &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, Godfrey, was robbed of grace and hounded from the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. Radahn's father, Radagon, left Rennala to become &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika's&lt;/a&gt; new consort and the second Elden Lord. Radahn and his siblings were thus raised to demigod status by their new step-mother, Marika. \nNot wanting to abandon his scrawny but beloved steed, &lt;a href=\"Leonard\"&gt;Leonard&lt;/a&gt;, Radahn studied gravitational magic in &lt;a href=\"Sellia%2C%20Town%20of%20Sorcery\"&gt;Sellia&lt;/a&gt; under a master who was an &lt;a href=\"Alabaster%20Lord\"&gt;Alabaster Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Radahn befriend the &lt;a href=\"Albinauric\"&gt;Albinauric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gaius\"&gt;Gaius&lt;/a&gt;, a senior disciple of his teacher, and the two formed a competitive yet friendly rivalry. Radahn's step-brother &lt;a href=\"Messmer%20the%20Impaler\"&gt;Messmer the Impaler&lt;/a&gt; was also friends with Gaius and the two became as elder brothers to Radahn.\nMastering gravitational magic allowed Radahn to manipulate the forces of gravity, and to challenge the very stars themselves. Radahn conquered the stars, saving Sellia in the process, using his vast gravitational powers to 'shatter' the stars and arrest their cycles, earning him the moniker of \"Starscourge.\" During this time, he engraved the gravity crest upon his blades.\nRadahn's soldiers were known as the &lt;a href=\"Redmane\"&gt;Redmanes&lt;/a&gt; for the red-maned lion raising a sword in the image of Radahn on their surcoats. The longest serving of the Redmane Knights was &lt;a href=\"Redmane%20Knight%20Ogha\"&gt;Ogha&lt;/a&gt;, who studied gravitational techniques alongside Radahn in Sellia. It was popularly said that the Redmanes knew no weakness. At an unknown period in time, &lt;a href=\"Castellan%20Jerren\"&gt;Jerren&lt;/a&gt;, a guest of the Carian royals, became a guest commander for Radahn's armies, and they swore a mutual oath of honorable death. \nWhen Radahn's half-brother &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt; ascended closer to godhood as an &lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt;, he would soon desire to take Radahn as a consort. Radahn was deeply admired by Miquella for his kindness and strength, seeing qualities of a &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;lord&lt;/a&gt; in Radahn since childhood. He made a vow with Radahn, where Radahn would become his consort, and in return, Miquella would have to uphold some unspecified part of the vow.\nThe Shattering.\nAt some point following the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Marika shattered the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and her offspring acquired the Great Runes. The maddening taint of their newfound strength led to the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, a war between Marika's demigod descendants, each seeking to become the new ruler of the Lands Between.\nFrom his stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Redmane%20Castle\"&gt;Redmane Castle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, Radahn led his armies against the forces of the other demigods. Radahn tried to challenge &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the Grafted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;, but the latter hid in &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle&lt;/a&gt;. \nBy the end of the Shattering, only Radahn and his half-sister &lt;a href=\"Malenia%20the%20Severed\"&gt;Malenia, Blade of Miquella&lt;/a&gt; were left standing. The two fought to a stalemate in the Battle of Aeonia, their duel ending inconclusively when Malenia unleashed her &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;Scarlet Rot&lt;/a&gt;. As the flower blossomed, Malenia whispered in Radahn's ear \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"\nThe Scarlet Rot ravaged Caelid, and consumed Radahn from the inside, eating away at his psyche but failing to kill him. Following the Battle of Aeonia, Radahn roams the Wailing Dunes as a mindless beast who devours the flesh of friend and foe alike, howling at the sky. Without their commander, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve to not return home, and to serve as a bulwark against the spread of the rot in Caelid using fire.\nIn spite of his madness, Radahn continues to ride his scrawny steed, as well as halt the motions of the stars. The Radahn Festival has been organized by his men in Castle Redmane to celebrate his last battle. It is a gathering of mighty warriors who might finally put the General out of his misery, and claim his Great Rune for themselves. The festival serves as Jerren's way of fulfilling his oath of honorable death to Radahn.\nUpon the participation of a &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished Champion&lt;/a&gt;, the festival is a success, and Radahn is freed from his tortured existence. His death causes the stars to resume their cycles, some of which come crashing down upon the Lands Between. One such falling star lands in Limgrave, opening the path to &lt;a href=\"Nokron%2C%20Eternal%20City\"&gt;Nokron, Eternal City&lt;/a&gt;, and allowing the fate of Ranni the Witch to progress.\nShadow of the Erdtree.\nFollowing Radahn's defeat, his soul met its end. However, Miquella sought to revive it, still desiring for Radahn to be his lord consort. Miquella was successful in reviving Radahn, placing his soul into a vessel made from the remains of &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, another Demigod slain by the same Tarnished who had defeated Radahn. The Tarnished encounters the newly-resurrected Radahn at the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;Gate of Divinity&lt;/a&gt; at the top of &lt;a href=\"Enir-Ilim\"&gt;Enir-Ilim&lt;/a&gt;. Radahn stands guard as Miquella completes his ascension to godhood and battles the Tarnished once more. During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort and fights the Tarnished with Radahn. The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.\nFirst Encounter (Starscourge Radahn).\nThe fight against Starscourge Radahn only becomes available when the Radahn Festival commences. This requires the player to either activate a Site of Grace in &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, talk to &lt;a href=\"Blaidd%20the%20Half-Wolf\"&gt;Blaidd the Half-Wolf&lt;/a&gt; about Radahn in &lt;a href=\"Siofra%20River\"&gt;Siofra River&lt;/a&gt;, or talk to &lt;a href=\"War%20Counselor%20Iji\"&gt;War Counselor Iji&lt;/a&gt; about Jerren.\n&lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;Torrent&lt;/a&gt; can be called during this fight and is useful for closing distance and evading Radahn's ranged attacks.\nMultiple NPCs are available to be summoned during the fight, and their summons can be located throughout the arena. Six can be summoned at a time, and once a summon sign is used it will vanish, however each NPC has multiple summon signs that can be used.\nThe list of available summons is:\nPhase 1.\nThe player will spawn some distance away from Radahn, with the boss visible at the top of a dune in the distance. Immediately, Radahn will begin firing volleys of arrows which rain down from above, homing in on the player, as well as gravity arrows. The latter can be avoided by hiding behind the clusters of weapons dug into the ground, however the weapons will break when struck. Riding Torrent will make it easier to avoid the volleys. Summon signs can be found in clusters all around the arena, and can be used to summon NPCs to assist in the fight.\nOnce the player is close enough, Radahn will begin attacking using his swords. He is very mobile, using his horse to cover distance easily. He also uses a number of gravity-based attacks, such as Cragblade, gravity waves, and Collapsing Stars.\nPhase 2.\nOnce his health is below 50%, Radahn will launch himself into the sky, disappearing for several seconds. He will then come crashing down in a ball of fire, dealing devastating damage to anyone caught in the impact. Radahn now gains the ability to raise four floating rocks, which will hover beside him and then launch at the player or their summons. He also gains the ability to float into the air and spin rapidly while charging.\nEnvironment.\nThe Wailing Dunes is a very large arena consisting of many tall dunes, with Radahn initially standing at the top of the largest dune close to the centre of the area. Clusters of weapons can be found stuck in the sand, and can be used to hide from Radahn's arrows. Summon signs can be found throughout the arena, often in clusters of two or three.\nSecond Encounter (Promised Consort Radahn).\nThe Second battle against Radahn serves as the final boss of the \"\" expansion.\nPhase 1.\nJust like in the base game, players will spawn a distance away from Radahn. While retaining his gravity magic, and as his soul now possessed Mohg's remains, Radahn now employs Bloodflame, and seamlessly switches between the two elemental magics while in combat. To defeat him, it is always important to time your attacks in between Radahn's string of attacks or pull off counters at the very end of a combo. Because of his recovery time, this makes his boss battle complicated, as he can launch other attacks almost instantly after finishing a heavy attack. As a result, it is important to note that patience and appropriate timing are the keys to defeating Radahn. The optimal moment to attack is when he finished his basic sword combos, and would take a brief pause to recover. \nAt the start of his boss battle, he will nearly always use a gravity attack to prevent players from summoning or buffs upon entry into the boss battle. Because of this, players are recommended to use buffs before accessing the boss and cast summons right after dodging the initial attack. During his first phase, Radahn will use a flurry of combos aside from special abilities such as a Bloodflame Slash and his Gravity attacks. After being reduced to 65% of his health, this will trigger a cutscene leading to Phase 2.\nPhase 2.\nIn this phase, Radahn's previous attacks are improved and he gains new powerful abilities. Most of them are Holy-powered and have a wider AoE. Overall, while his attacks become more lethal, Radahn is now faster in speed, now capable of creating mirror images to attack and using strong Holy-based abilities, making the boss battle more difficult and challenging. However, despite gaining immense power, Radahn's health has already been reduced to 75%, allowing players to gain a slight edge. It is important to capitalize on the pauses of Radahn's combo attacks, as there are opportunities to strike. Constantly taking advantage of them can deplete his health and because Radahn's attacks can be very punishing if caught off-guard, you have to be prepared to switch between offensive and defensive at times.\nWhile Radahn can still perform similar combos from Phase 1, they have an additional Holy damage explosion at the end. As Miquella is now mounted on his back, he can do a grab attack where he will glow and jump at the player in order to grab them. If successful, Radahn will bring them close to Miquella, who will then place the player under a charm. While this doesn't deal any damage, if Radahn successfully grabs the player a second time while they are charmed, this will ultimately result in instant death. Using &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Great%20Rune\"&gt;Miquella's Great Rune&lt;/a&gt; will undo the charm. \nEnvironment.\nThe arena consists of a very wide area, with a rough white surface filled with gray-white decomposed corpses, which can be found sticking from the ground. At the other end of the arena, stands the Gate of Divinity itself, where Miquella will step out in divine aspect in the second phase."}

Known for the development of their unique storm-based &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;battle arts&lt;/a&gt;, channeling the power of the ceaseless winds that encircled their home. \nBack in the day when Stormveil's winds raged like no other, they would trap, train and breed wild raptors into mighty &lt;a href=\"Stormhawk\"&gt;Stormhawks&lt;/a&gt;.

The cries of their mightiest hawks would embolden their fellows in battle, and the tempestuous winds that encircle them could shred through foes. \nThey were ruled over by an individual, now only known as &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Lord\"&gt;\"The Storm Lord\"&lt;/a&gt;, along a particularly massive and &lt;a href=\"The%20Stormhawk%20King\"&gt;proud stormhawk&lt;/a&gt; whom all the other birds would likewise, revere as sovereign. \nThe lord would eventually meet his fate at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;King Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, whom faced him in battle alone, becoming yet another conquest in the Elden Lord's campaign.\nTheir castle would then be appropriated for use by the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; whom would eventually turn the stronghold into a penal colony for their exiled &lt;a href=\"Exile%20Soldier\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banished%20Knight\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt;. These undesirables would in some way take over and continue the practices once held by the castle's previous owners, although their proficiency with these skills being notably reduced in comparison to its former practitioners, leaving the trained hawks and even the very winds surrounding the castle itself, greatly diminished. Their inability to teach the hawks storm arts and turn them into warriors comparable to their previous generations would eventually lead them to try and compensate, by grafting razor sharp blades and other weapons onto the birds themselves, an operation that many hawks would not survive. \nThe state and pride of the castle would degrade even further when it is eventually occupied by &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the Grafted&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelevant Items.\nItems related to or referencing Stormveil"}

Following the breaking of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the Tarnished were beckoned by lost grace, fragmentary divine light from the Erdtree, to return.\nBackground.\nThe Long March.\nIn the early &lt;a href=\"age%20of%20the%20Erdtree\"&gt;age of the Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%2C%20First%20Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, fought many battles throughout the Lands Between. He led the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Giants\"&gt;War Against the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Lord\"&gt;Storm Lord&lt;/a&gt;. When his last enemy fell, it is said that the hue of his eyes faded. Queen Marika addressed Godfrey and his warriors as she divested them of their &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Grace&lt;/a&gt;, commanding them to leave the Lands Between and travel to a &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;faraway land&lt;/a&gt;, where they would wage war and die. Before they departed, she promised them that after their deaths their Grace would be given back, and that they would return to the Lands Between once again, to wage war and brandish the Elden Ring.\nGodfrey led his kinfolk away from the Lands Between on an exodus referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Long%20March\"&gt;Long March&lt;/a&gt;. They left their home on boats, although one was said to have been left behind. The warriors who accompanied Godfrey honored him by wielding &lt;a href=\"axes\"&gt;axes&lt;/a&gt;, although Godfrey's own &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Godfrey\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; was broken in battle during the course of the march. When the Long March came to an end, Godfrey divested himself of kingship and became a simple warrior once more. As Hoarah Loux, he became a chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, revered by its bravest warriors.\nThe Tarnished settled in lands outside the Lands Between, and bore descendants who were also Tarnished. As Queen Marika had commanded them, the Tarnished lived and died in these distant lands.\nReturn to the Lands Between.\nA long time after the Tarnished left the Lands Between, the Elden Ring was shattered and Queen Marika disappeared. Marika's offspring, the &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigods&lt;/a&gt;, claimed &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;shards&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Tainted by their newfound strength, the Demigods warred in the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, causing the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt; to abandon them. With the war yielding no victor, the Guidance of Grace was extended to the Tarnished, who returned from the dead and went back to the Lands Between, guided by Grace. Upon setting foot in the Lands Between once more, the Tarnished received the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, who bid them to seek the Great Runes possessed by the Demigods so as to restore the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; and become &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;. The Tarnished, given life by Grace, gained a form of immortality, allowing them to return from the dead over and over on their quest to become Elden Lord.\nThe Guidance of Grace brought together the Tarnished and their &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Maidens\"&gt;Finger Maidens&lt;/a&gt;, women in the service of the Two Fingers who were tasked with serving their appointed Tarnished. The Finger Maidens would offer guidance and aid to the Tarnished, as well as turning the &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt; they gathered into strength. &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt; became a gathering place for the Tarnished, and was where they sought audience with the Two Fingers. Among the first Tarnished to visit Roundtable Hold were &lt;a href=\"Vargram%20the%20Raging%20Wolf\"&gt;Vargram the Raging Wolf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Errant%20Sorcerer%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vyke\"&gt;Vyke&lt;/a&gt;, a knight of the Roundtable Hold, came closer than any other Tarnished to becoming Elden Lord. However, without announcement, he disappeared below &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt; and was scorched by the &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, the &lt;a href=\"Cursemark%20of%20Death\"&gt;Cursemark of Death&lt;/a&gt; was recovered from the body of &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt; and taken the Roundtable. &lt;a href=\"Fia%2C%20Deathbed%20Companion\"&gt;Fia, the Deathbed Companion&lt;/a&gt; came to the Roundtable in opposition where she siphoned the &lt;a href=\"vigor\"&gt;vigor&lt;/a&gt; of champions and developed &lt;a href=\"Fia%27s%20Mist\"&gt;Fia's Mist&lt;/a&gt;, a spell that only works against the Tarnished.\nAlthough the Tarnished had once again been given Grace, some lost sight of it once more. At least one Tarnished, &lt;a href=\"Roderika%2C%20Spirit%20Tuner\"&gt;Roderika&lt;/a&gt;, never once saw the Guidance of Grace. With many Tarnished seemingly abandoned by Grace, an Elden Lord would not arise for a long time. Roundtable Hold, once the home of venerated warriors, stopped receiving visitors. This would change when a &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished of no renown&lt;/a&gt; crossed the fog and made their way to the Lands Between. This Tarnished would not meet a Finger Maiden to guide them, but would instead be found by &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious woman bound to Grace who offered to play the role of maiden for them: turning Runes into strength, granting them the means to summon a spectral steed named &lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;Torrent&lt;/a&gt;, and extending them an invite to Roundtable Hold. This Tarnished would gain audience with the Two Fingers, claim the Great Runes, and make the journey towards the Erdtree in order to become Elden Lord."}

Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;. His increasingly heretic tendencies led him to assist his sister &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated.\nDuring the Shattering, he became strongly disillusioned with the Erdtree and the Golden Order, finding that the Gods demanding the demigods to fight over the Great Runes (whom he refers to as \"miserly scraps of power\") as nothing but debasing. Thus, he launched a blasphemous campaign against the Golden Order, establishing the rule of taking by force and the belief that the Gods are no different. \nDespite his heresy, many &lt;a href=\"Recusants\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; were drawn by his ambition, as they also became disillusioned with the Golden Order, and they came to see Rykard's intentions as noble. They then waged war against the armies of Leyndell in Rykard's name, though the results were costly and appalling.\nPraetor Rykard eventually lost his sanity and fed himself to the Blasphemous/God-devouring serpent, merging himself with the creature. With his ambition descending into gluttonous depravity, the now-monstrous Rykard began engaging in cannibalism, where he would devour his greatest champions, thus making them a part of his \"family\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott, the Omen King&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBorn an Omen, Morgott came to renounce his accursed blood and would seal it away within a blade, which was then concealed within his wooden staff. Following Queen Marika's shattering of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;, Morgott secured power over &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt; and devoted himself to protecting the capital and the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; from his other siblings, as he considers them traitors to the Golden Order for going against it in favor of their own ambitions. \nDespite his deeds, unfortunately, they weren't recognized by many even the Golden Order, who reviled as an accursed fiend. Despite this, Morgott remained steadfastly loyal, as he considers loyalty to be a reward in its own right, and despite knowing that the Erdtree wouldn't admit anyone, not even himself, to claim the title of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;. However, his devotion and loyalty towards the Golden Order proved to be his downfall as he met defeat at the hands of a &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished of no renown&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLike his brother Morgott, Mohg was accursed at birth. Unlike the former, who renounced his Omen blood, Mohg came to embrace it. After an encounter with an &lt;a href=\"Outer%20God\"&gt;Outer God&lt;/a&gt; known as the Formless Mother, he established a cult, where he and his followers would perform blood-associated rituals as her servants. Seeking to become Elden Lord, and while recruiting and kidnapping many followers to his cause, Mohg plots to overthrow the Golden Order in favor of his own dynasty, which he calls the &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mohgwyn Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs he has a strong obsession of his half-brother &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt;, Mohg believes the young &lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; has the potential of ascending to Godhood, he plans to make him his puppet and rule alongside him as his consort. And so he abducts Miquella from the &lt;a href=\"Haligtree\"&gt;Haligtree&lt;/a&gt; to have him facilitated with blood for his awakening. However, no matter how hard Mohg tried to interact with him, the slumbering Miquella never responded."}

These knives were used by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Assassin\"&gt;Black Knife Assassins&lt;/a&gt; who, one night, entered &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt; and assassinated &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt;. As the assassins fled the capital, an assassin named &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Tiche\"&gt;Tiche&lt;/a&gt; was killed protecting her mother &lt;a href=\"Alecto%2C%20Black%20Knife%20Ringleader\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the assassins. \nRanni killed herself at the moment of Godwyn's death, causing the &lt;a href=\"Cursemark%20of%20Death\"&gt;Cursemark&lt;/a&gt; to break into two half-wheels rather than form a circle. While Ranni died in the flesh, Godwyn's soul alone perished, sentencing him to live in death. His body was interred in the Erdtree's roots beneath Leyndell, where it mutated and warped. Later, the Rune of Death began to spread through the roots in the form of &lt;a href=\"Deathroot\"&gt;Deathroot&lt;/a&gt;, giving rise to &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn preparation for the fallout of the Night of Black Knives, earlier that same night, Ranni met with her elder brother and co-conspirator, &lt;a href=\"Rykard%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blasphemy\"&gt;Praetor Rykard&lt;/a&gt;. She gifted him a &lt;a href=\"Blasphemous%20Claw\"&gt;slab of rock&lt;/a&gt; inscribed with traces of the Rune of Death, which was to serve as a last-resort foil to &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%2C%20the%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;Maliketh, the Black Blade&lt;/a&gt;, in case a battle between Rykard and Maliketh came to pass. \nThe Shattering of the Elden Ring.\nThe Night of Black Knives became the catalyst for the Shattering. In response to Godwyn's death, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; used her &lt;a href=\"Marika%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt; to shatter the Elden Ring. Elden Lord &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt;, her alter ego, attempted in vain to repair the Elden Ring. As punishment for her offense, the goddess Marika was imprisoned within the Erdtree.\nConsequently, the shattering of the Elden Ring corrupted the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, and lead to a Shattering War that would leave the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; in ruin.\nThe Shardbearers.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;Shardbearers&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe shards of the Elden Ring, known as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Runes&lt;/a&gt;, were inherited by Marika's &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigod&lt;/a&gt; offspring. Tainted by the strength of the Great Runes, the Demigods warred, with the conflict becoming known as the Shattering.\n&lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott&lt;/a&gt;, a Demigod of the Golden Lineage who was born as a graceless &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;, inherited a Great Rune known as the anchor ring which houses the base, proving his pedigree as a member of the Golden Lineage and as the Lord of Leyndell. Taking on the moniker of the \"veiled lord\", Morgott ruled over Leyndell, slaughtering countless champions in defence of the Erdtree under the guise of &lt;a href=\"Margit%2C%20the%20Fell%20Omen\"&gt;Margit, the Fell Omen&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Praetor%20Rykard\"&gt;Praetor Rykard&lt;/a&gt;, whose noble ambitions had turned to gluttonous depravity, fed himself to the blasphemous serpent after obtaining his Great Rune. His consort, &lt;a href=\"Tanith\"&gt;Tanith&lt;/a&gt;, established the recusants of &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor\"&gt;Volcano Manor&lt;/a&gt;, waging a war against the Erdtree in his stead.\n&lt;a href=\"Godrick\"&gt;Godrick&lt;/a&gt;, a distant relation of Marika whose blood was sorely diluted, escaped the capital by hiding amongst the womenfolk, bringing with him a multitude of treasures including the &lt;a href=\"Mimic%27s%20Veil\"&gt;Mimic's Veil&lt;/a&gt;. He hid from &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;General Radahn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle&lt;/a&gt;, and later insulted Malenia, only to grovel for mercy after he himself was defeated at her hands. He turned to the act of grafting in order to attain power, so that one day he could return to the capital.\nGeneral Radahn, famed as the scourge of the stars, led the Redmane Knights during the Shattering. They were met in battle by &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia, Blade of Miquella&lt;/a&gt;, and her undefeated army of &lt;a href=\"Cleanrot%20Knight\"&gt;Cleanrot Knights&lt;/a&gt;. They fought to a standstill, until Malenia unleashed her &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;Scarlet Rot&lt;/a&gt;, ending the duel inconclusively. Radahn was driven mad by the rot and was forced to wander the battlefield as a mindless beast, devouring the corpses of those who died during the conflict, whether they be a friend or foe. Malenia, who became comatose, was carried back to the &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Haligtree\"&gt;Haligtree&lt;/a&gt; of her brother &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Cleanrot%20Knight%20Finlay\"&gt;Cleanrot Knight Finlay&lt;/a&gt;, one of the few survivors of the battle.\nRanni, the instigator of the Night of Black Knives, is said to have cast aside her Great Rune, and its present whereabouts are unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Mohg\"&gt;Mohg&lt;/a&gt;, known only as the Lord of Blood, began building his &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Dynasty\"&gt;dynasty&lt;/a&gt; underground in secret. To this end he abducted Miquella from his resting place in the Haligtree, wishing to raise the Empyrean to full godhood and become his consort.However, Miquella never responded to Mohg, no matter how hard the omen tried, and continued to remain asleep in his cocoon.\nConflicts.\nThe First Defense of Leyndell.\nThe First Defense of Leyndell was precipitated by the deterioration of a sovereign alliance. &lt;a href=\"Godefroy%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godefroy the Grafted&lt;/a&gt; was captured by &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon%20Knight%20Kristoff%20Ashes\"&gt;Ancient Dragon Knight Kristoff&lt;/a&gt; during this conflict, earning the latter the honor of Erdtree Burial. The belligerents of this conflict are not confirmed, however Godefroy's involvement may suggest that the remnants of the Golden Lineage were the attackers.\nThe Second Defense of Leyndell.\nDuring the Second Defense of Leyndell, Morgott, in the guise of Margit the Fell Omen, slaughtered many heroes in his defense of the Erdtree and got into conflict with Radahn, presumably defeating him.\nThe Assault on Volcano Manor.\nSaid to have been the most appalling battle in the Shattering, the conflict took place on &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly between Praetor Rykard's army and the forces of Leyndell. The squalid, the sick, and the blasphemous are said to have participated in this battle, which went on without end. The attackers brought the &lt;a href=\"Jar%20Cannon\"&gt;Jar Cannon&lt;/a&gt; to the assault, however it was discovered that nobody knew how to use it. Remnants of Leyndell's army can be found at campsites around the volcano, with most of the soldiers afflicted by Frenzy and many seemingly consuming the dead. Rykard's own men deserted him following this conflict, no longer able to abide the consequences of his blasphemy.\nGodrick vs Malenia.\nScarcely deserving of being considered a balanced conflict, on her journey to face Radahn in the Battle of Aeonia, Malenia and her Cleanrot Knights marched passed &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the&lt;/a&gt; and his own forces had being cowering from Radahn. Apparently, Godrick said something to insult Melania, which led to a battle between the pair. Godrick was defeated, and rather than dying in battle, he begged Malenia for mercy. Godrick was spared, and Melina pressed on to meet Radahn.\nThe Battle of Aeonia.\nThe last battle between General Radahn and Malenia, Blade of Miquella. This conflict took place in the area south of &lt;a href=\"Sellia%2C%20Town%20of%20Sorcery\"&gt;Sellia, Town of Sorcery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt;, in the region now known as the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Aeonia\"&gt;Swamp of Aeonia&lt;/a&gt;. Malenia and her army of Cleanrot Knights marched southward before arriving in Caelid, where they met Radahn's Redmane Knights in battle. The battle ended in a stalemate after Malenia unleashed her scarlet rot, driving the Redmane Knights to defeat while their leader was infected with the rot, which drove Radahn into becoming a mindless beast.\nAftermath.\nUltimately, none of the Demigods succeeded in becoming Elden Lord, and they were abandoned by the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Grace&lt;/a&gt; was extended to the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, who were called to the Lands Between to claim the Great Runes, become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."}

Their origins are unknown, as are their accomplishments prior to their arrival in the Lands Between. \nThe Tarnished begins their journey in the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Anticipation\"&gt;Chapel of Anticipation&lt;/a&gt;, off the western coast of &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;, where they find only the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Maidens\"&gt;Finger Maiden&lt;/a&gt; slumped against a wall. After a brief encounter with a &lt;a href=\"Grafted%20Scion\"&gt;Grafted Scion&lt;/a&gt;, the Tarnished falls from the precipice and washes up in the &lt;a href=\"Stranded%20Graveyard\"&gt;Stranded Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. Although death seems inevitable, they are found by a mysterious woman riding a spectral steed. The woman grants the Tarnished two flasks: one of &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Crimson%20Tears\"&gt;crimson tears&lt;/a&gt; and the other of &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Cerulean%20Tears\"&gt;cerulean tears&lt;/a&gt;. With these blessings, the Tarnished emerges from the damp cavern into the grasslands of &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tarnished is reunited with the woman once more, and she introduces herself to them as &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing that the Tarnished is maidenless, she offers to play the role of a Finger Maiden, allowing the Tarnished to convert the Runes they collect from their enemies into strength. In return, she requests that the Tarnished bring her with them to the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. To aid them further, Melina grants the Tarnished a &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Steed%20Whistle\"&gt;whistle&lt;/a&gt; which will allow them to call upon her spectral steed, who's name she reveals to be &lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;Torrent&lt;/a&gt;. Melina further explains to the Tarnished that she is searching for a purpose given to her by her mother inside the Erdtree long ago, and the reason she lives, despite her burnt and spectral state. She advises the Tarnished to seek the Great Runes: shards of the shattered Elden Ring currently held by the &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigods&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly in their shared journey, Melina extends the Tarnished an invitation to &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the gathering place of Tarnished champions. Here, the Tarnished meets several of their fellow Tarnished, as well as Roundtable Hold's leader, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Gideon%20Ofnir%2C%20the%20All-Knowing\"&gt;Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tarnished claims a Great Rune from one of the &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;Shardbearers&lt;/a&gt; scattered throughout the Lands Between, and is permitted audience with the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;; envoys of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Reader%20Enia\"&gt;Finger Reader Enia&lt;/a&gt;. Interpreting the words of the Fingers, Enia explains to the Tarnished that the shattering of the Elden Ring has left the land in ruins, and instructs the Tarnished to hunt down the Demigods, who have been renounced by the Greater Will. Gideon offers the Tarnished further advice, imparting his knowledge of the five Shardbearers known to Roundtable Hold.\nOn their journey, the Tarnished may encounter &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt;, a Demigod and the perpetrator of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;. The Tarnished may choose to enter her service, aiding her as she treads the dark path of the &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; and attempts to establish her Order upon the world.\nAfter claiming two Great Runes, the Tarnished makes their way to &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;, the home of &lt;a href=\"Morgott\"&gt;Morgott&lt;/a&gt; the Grace-Given. Melina regains the ability to govern her own movement and bids the Tarnished farewell, leaving them with Torrent and the ability to convert Runes into strength. The Tarnished proceeds to the Elden Throne and defeats Morgott, claiming his Great Rune, but when they attempt to pass through the door in the Erdtree's trunk they find the way obscured by impenetrable thorns. Melina appears before the Tarnished once more, and reveals that it is her purpose to help the Tarnished become Elden Lord. In order to do so, however, the Erdtree must be burned to remove the thorns. And so, the Tarnished begins a new journey with Melina, to the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, upon which rests the giant's forge, and a flame which may burn the Erdtree.\nThe Tarnished may encounter a being named &lt;a href=\"Shabriri\"&gt;Shabriri&lt;/a&gt;, who reveals to the Tarnished that Melina must offer herself as kindling so that the Erdtree can burn. Shabriri offers an alternative: the tarnished may take Melina's place as kindling and singe their own flesh instead. To this end, they must descend below the Royal Capital and meet with the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Fingers\"&gt;Three Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, setting themselves upon the path to becoming the Lord of Chaos. Should the Tarnished accept this offer, they will make an enemy of Melina, who vows to hunt them down and kill them if they rise as Lord of Chaos.\nWhether through Melina's sacrifice or the power of the Frenzied Flame, the Erdtree is set aflame, and the Tarnished is transported to &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Crumbling Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt;; an ancient temple in the sky said to have been crumbling since time immemorial. In Farum Azula, the Tarnished encounters and kills &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%2C%20the%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;Maliketh, the Black Blade&lt;/a&gt;, releasing the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; upon the Lands Between. \nThe Tarnished returns to Leyndell to find it coated in ash, the Erdtree glowing red above. The Tarnished makes their way through the ruined city, but their path is blocked by Gideon, who attempts to stop them from becoming Elden Lord. The Tarnished kills Gideon, who asserts with his dying breath his belief that a Tarnished cannot become a Lord, for a man cannot kill a god.\nThe Tarnished once again finds themselves at the Elden Throne. This time they find &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, the First Elden Lord and former leader of the Tarnished. Godfrey reveals that he has come to once more be granted audience with Queen Marika, the goddess of the Lands Between The two Tarnished duel, and Godfrey is forced to tear the beast Serosh from his back and assume the role of Hoarah Loux. Nevertheless, the Tarnished defeats Godfrey and approaches the Erdtree.\nInside the Erdtree, the Tarnished find Marika hanging from a Rune, her body seemingly made of stone. Marika falls from the Rune and her body begins to warp as she assumes the form of &lt;a href=\"Radagon%20of%20the%20Golden%20Order\"&gt;Radagon of the Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, the second Elden Lord. Radagon fights to protect the Golden Order from the Tarnished, but is bested. From his body emerges the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt;, a vassal of the Greater Will and embodiment of Order that became the Elden Ring long ago. Despite its status as a god, the Tarnished fells the Elden Beast, and finally stands before the broken body of Queen Marika. Depending on the decisions they made on their journey, the Tarnished may now decide the fate of the Lands Between. They may repair the Elden Ring and rise as Elden Lord, go with Ranni on her thousand year voyage into the chill night, or become the Lord of Frenzied Flame and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes."}

This can be prevented by killing them with certain sources of holy damage, or by attacking their bones before they resurrect. They are commonly found in catacombs, graveyards, and around &lt;a href=\"Deathroot\"&gt;Deathroot&lt;/a&gt;. Those Who Live in Death are a product of the spread of Deathroot following the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt; and the death of &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt;, and fall outside the principles of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;. It is for this reason that Golden Order fundamentalists known as hunters are tasked with exterminating them, down to the last.\nThose Who Live in Death are extremely weak to &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;holy damage&lt;/a&gt;. They can be summoned by and occasionally found alongside &lt;a href=\"Tibia%20Mariner\"&gt;Tibia Mariner&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBackground.\nOn the Night of Black Knives, a stolen fragment of the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; enabled the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Assassins\"&gt;Black Knife Assassins&lt;/a&gt; to murder Godwyn the Golden, which marked the first death of a &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; in history. However, &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt;, a co-conspirator of the assassins, perished at the same moment by carving the &lt;a href=\"Cursemark%20of%20Death\"&gt;cursemark of Destined Death&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the mark of the centipede, into her flesh. This resulted in the cursemark, which should have taken the shape of a circle, splitting into two half-wheel wounds, in turn allowing Ranni's body to perish, while Godwyn died in soul alone. Ranni lingered on as a spirit, while Godwyn was unable to die a true death, and instead continued to live within death, without a soul, becoming known as the Prince of Death.\nAs the first dead of the demigods, Godwyn was buried under &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;the capital&lt;/a&gt;, at the Erdtree's roots. After the night of the dire plot, the Rune of Death spread across the Lands Between through the underground great tree roots, sprouting in the form of Deathroot, a source that causes those who come into contact with it to become Those Who Live in Death. Those Who Live in Death have refused the call to return to the Erdtree, and trespass beyond life's bounds. It is for this reason that they exist outside the principles of the Golden Order, and hunters among the Golden Order fundamentalists arose to exterminate defiled reason\u2014all for the perfection of the Order. In turn, &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%2C%20the%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;Maliketh, the Black Blade&lt;/a&gt;, from whom the fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen, took on the guise of Gurranq, the Beast Clergyman, and consumed Deathroot gathered for him by hunters in order to sate his appetite.\nDespite the distaste for Those Who Live in Death, some of the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; sympathized with them upon their return to the Lands Between, including &lt;a href=\"Fia%2C%20Deathbed%20Companion\"&gt;Fia, Deathbed Companion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lionel%20the%20Lionhearted\"&gt;Lionel the Lionhearted&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Rogier\"&gt;Sorcerer Rogier&lt;/a&gt;. According to Rogier, Those Who Live in Death have committed no offense, have every right to life, and have simply touched upon a flaw in the Order.\nDuring the time of &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;The Tarnished (Protagonist)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D%2C%20Hunter%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;D, Hunter of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; discovered the mark of the centipede in &lt;a href=\"Summonwater%20Village\"&gt;Summonwater Village&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;, and brought it back to the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;. He was later murdered by Fia, who wished to return the cursemark, also known as the hallowbrand, to Godwyn. When tracked down to the &lt;a href=\"Deeproot%20Depths\"&gt;Deeproot Depths&lt;/a&gt;, Fia reveals that she was the companion of Godwyn, the Prince of Death, and wished to be a mother and guardian to Those Who Live in Death. \nUpon giving her the Cursemark of Death obtained from Ranni's corpse, Fia claims it will allow Godwyn to claim a second illustrious life and take his rightful place as the First of the Dead. She will lay with Godwyn in order to conceive a child that will serve as the new life of Godwyn, that will take the form of the &lt;a href=\"Mending%20Rune%20of%20the%20Death-Prince\"&gt;rune of Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;. Fia asks The Tarnished (Protagonist) to brandish her child and become their Elden Lord by staying the persecution of Those Who Live in Death.

{"id": "1227", "revid": "55650282", "url": "https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1227", "title": "Tibia Mariner", "text": "Tibia Mariners are optional &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; in . \nMariners are grave keepers who ferry lost souls across a sea in the &lt;a href=\"spirit%20world\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;. They navigate their spectral vessels through ghostly waters with that, when blown, summon &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;. Their movement is not restricted to water when they appear in the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Tibia Mariners were the first of all grave keepers in the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. They beckon &lt;a href=\"Those%20Lost%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Lost in Death&lt;/a&gt; by blowing into their hollow oars. They have guided the dead to the &lt;a href=\"Gravesite%20Plain\"&gt;Gravesite Plain&lt;/a&gt; for an eternity, unbothered by their bones having long since crumbled to dust.\nThe ancient mariners themselves were laid to rest amongst the crimson fields of &lt;a href=\"Charo%27s%20Hidden%20Grave\"&gt;Charo's Hidden Grave&lt;/a&gt;. Their secrets were inherited by future generations of &lt;a href=\"Gravebird\"&gt;grave keepers&lt;/a&gt;, who used their &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Keeper%27s%20Brainpan\"&gt;skulls&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"catalysts\"&gt;catalysts&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"summoning\"&gt;summoning&lt;/a&gt; wandering &lt;a href=\"spirits\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt;. Their boats, or recreations of them, were prominently displayed in the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Keep\"&gt;Shadow Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Church%20District\"&gt;Church District&lt;/a&gt;. The importance of the oarsmen was recognized even amongst the living.\nThe Golden Order.\nThe Tibia Mariners were suppressed when the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; was removed from the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;. In their absence, those without &lt;a href=\"Marika\"&gt;Marika&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Grace&lt;/a&gt; who met a glorious end in battle were left to wander. The heroes of her &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; received &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Burial\"&gt;Erdtree Burial&lt;/a&gt;, and had no need for the archaic ferrymen.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt; was buried at the base of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, he soon transformed into the piscine &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Death\"&gt;Prince of Death&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Death%20Blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; leaked from his body and infected the great tree roots, and manifested itself as &lt;a href=\"Deathroot\"&gt;Deathroot&lt;/a&gt; throughout the Lands Between. The Tibia Mariners slowly resurfaced, and &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt; answered their call.\n&lt;a href=\"Gurranq\"&gt;Gurranq&lt;/a&gt; the Beast Clergyman charges &lt;a href=\"D%2C%20Hunter%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;D, Hunter of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down the Tibia Mariners and reap their Deathroot. He believes he can restore the sanctity of the Golden Order by absorbing the residual fragments of &lt;a href=\"Destined%20Death\"&gt;Destined Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nEncounters.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSummonwater Village.\nA Tibia Mariner encountered in Summonwater Village in north-eastern &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"D%2C%20Hunter%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;D, Hunter of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, can be found nearby to offer a warning about the mariner in the village, and is also available as a summonable co-operator for the fight. The mariner will summon &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s regularly throughout the fight.\nLiurnia of the Lakes.\nA Tibia Mariner encountered on the eastern plateau of &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, in a graveyard near the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Study%20Hall\"&gt;Carian Study Hall&lt;/a&gt; and south-east of the &lt;a href=\"Artist%27s%20Shack%20%28Liurnia%29\"&gt;Artist's Shack (Liurnia)&lt;/a&gt;. This Mariner can summon &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Militiamen\"&gt;Skeletal Militiamen&lt;/a&gt;.\nWyndham Ruins.\nA Tibia Mariner encountered in Wyndham Ruins in &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. It is surrounded by many skeletons, and can summon &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Skeleton\"&gt;giant skeletons&lt;/a&gt; during combat. The giant skeletons are able to fire death beams from their eye sockets.\nMountaintops of the Giants.\nA Tibia Mariner encountered on a cliff face overlooking &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Sol\"&gt;Castle Sol&lt;/a&gt; upon the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other Tibia Mariners, this one does not have a health bar. He may be fought at the same time as the nearby &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rite%20Bird\"&gt;Death Rite Bird&lt;/a&gt; during the night. Similarly, this mariner is able to detect and aggro the player from a vast distance away. The path to him through the graveyard is treacherous as he can summon the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Skeleton\"&gt;giant skeletons&lt;/a&gt; that fire death beams from their eye sockets. \nCharo's Hidden Grave.\nA Tibia Mariner at &lt;a href=\"Charo%27s%20Hidden%20Grave\"&gt;Charo's Hidden Grave&lt;/a&gt; solemnly patrols a quiet river flanked by fields of iridescent crimson lilies. When frightened, he teleports up a small waterfall and summons a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Revenant\"&gt;Royal Revenant&lt;/a&gt;. If pushed further, he eventually retreats behind a large aggregation of gravestones where several strong &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s await his call.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAppearance.\nThe seated Tibia Mariner uses an to paddle his incorporeal rowboat across ethereal, violet waters. His body is skeletonized, save for the wizened beard that clings to his slack mandible. A floral pattern decorates the white-laced chapel veil that rests upon his head and drapes over his bony frame. Attached to the veil are wide, golden hoops, each adorned with three large golden flower emblems inlaid with rubies. The mariner's forearms are wrapped in cloth, and several gold bracelets hang from his wrists. He wears the tattered remains of robes sewn from purple thread.\nThe mariner's transparent wooden rowboat shimmers with a faint purple hue. A chair is built into its deck, with a semi-circle cut into the backrest to create a depression at the top. Spiral patterns ascend its stile and backpost before transitioning into straight lines beaming upward. The backpost extends several feet higher than the chair and terminates in an upward concave arch reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Marika%27s%20Rune\"&gt;Marika's Rune&lt;/a&gt;. Hanging ventrally from it is a small lantern alight with a purple &lt;a href=\"ghostflame\"&gt;ghostflame&lt;/a&gt;. The boat's exterior hull is highly decorated with intricate relief carvings. Two adjacent floral embellishments are encircled by spiral-containing rings and bound together with a sturdy knot. The gunwale trim above features a wavelength weaving over and under stars, possibly symbolic of the &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Current\"&gt;Primeval Current&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mariner will sometimes whip up a great torrent of water that carries his boat high into the air. When it reaches it apex, he extends his arm, and a bright red light emanates from a jewel in his palm. This light is said to beckon the lost &lt;a href=\"spirits\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of those slain in battle.\nThe dry and metallic moans of the mariner eerily echo upon themselves as if uttered from deep within a dungeon. When he sounds his lengthy brass horn, a single clang of metal deeply reverberates like a tolling bell. When cast, his ancient Death magic produces a haunting noise like the crashing of cymbals."}

Martin", "text": "George Raymond Richard Martin also known as GRRM is a American best-selling author and television producer. One of his most popular works is the book series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", which has been adapted into television in the hit HBO series \"Game of Thrones\". Martin says that he always loved writing stories, and wrote many unfinished ones.\nElden Ring.\nGame director &lt;a href=\"Hidetaka%20Miyazaki\"&gt;Hidetaka Miyazaki&lt;/a&gt; has explained how the collaboration with Martin came to be: \n \"I loved \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" as well as the \"Tuf Voyaging\" series, however if I had to pick a favorite I would probably say \"Fevre Dream\". I personally see \"Fevre Dream\" as a masterpiece among vampire fantasy and had even previously recommended it to all new employees. Me being such a known fan of Mr. Martin caused our executive business director Eiichi Nakajima to reach out to him with the expectation that we would get turned down.\"\nAs George Martin recants:\n A few years back, Hidetaka Miyazaki and his incredible team of game designers, the creators of the DARK SOULS videogame series, reached out from Japan to ask me to help them create the backstory and history for a new game they were working on. Now, video games are not really my thing [...] but this offer was too exciting to refuse. Miyazaki and his team from FromSoftware were doing groundbreaking stuff with gorgeous art...\nMiyazaki:\n [...] we were then given the rare opportunity to talk one-on-one with Mr. Martin which was an incredibly fun and stimulating experience. It was then that I strongly felt that I wanted to work with Mr. Martin.\n I am still unable to put into words how grateful I am to Mr. Martin for agreeing to our offer.\n Mr. Martin respected the fact that we didn't want him to write the game's story or the in-game text. Because we felt that would actually limit his creative output, [...] and then it would limit the inspirations we could possibly get from him. \n So we established very early that he would be writing that foundation, that historical element to the game, something that took place long before the events of the game itself. \nGMMR:\n What they wanted from me was just a bit of worldbuilding: a deep, dark, resonant world to serve as a foundation for the game they planned to create. And as it happens, I love creating worlds and writing imaginary history.\nMiyazaki:\n The actual collaboration itself begun with Mr. Martin ever so politely confirming what sorts of themes, ideas as well as many game-related aspects I had envisioned for the game.\n We started off by giving him these very vague and broad themes and ideas for the mythos that I had swimming around in my head. [...] Then he would come back to us with a lot of ideas: how about this, this, and this?\n This allowed us to have many free and creative conversations regarding the game, in which Mr. Martin later used as a base to write the overarching mythos for the game world itself.\nGMMR:\n So I did my bit, and handed off to my new friends in Japan, and they took it from there. \nMiyazaki:\n [The mythos I received] was nothing visual - they were all text. Rather than being a short story, it was something that depicted the setting or set the scene for the game and for the world, detailing the flow of history and the figures who appeared throughout it. \n These dramatic and heroic characters weren't really in our previous titles, so this was something that was really appealing to me - how he would depict the mystique and heroic qualities of those characters.\n There was, of course a story that came with this as a sort of backbone, but it played as more of an introduction to that world and a natural course of events for these characters to follow. [...] And then we were able to interpret this in our own way and provide visual to go along with that.\nIn response to questions about the project, Martin said, \u201cBuilding the world of Elden Ring with Miyazaki-san and his team was a treat! The graphics, mythos, and action-RPG gameplay will deliver an unforgettable experience. I can\u2019t wait for people to see what Elden Ring has in store for them.\u201d \nAfter the game's release Martin blogged: \n \" Take a look at a few of the reviews:\n \n \u201cOnce in a generation\u2026 masterpiece\u2026 beautiful and brutal\u2026 a sumptuous open world\u2026 \u201d\n Music to the ears.\n Of course, almost all the credit should go to Hidetaka Miyazaki and his astonishing team of games designers who have been laboring on this game for half a decade or more, determined to create the best videogame ever. I am honored to have met them and worked with them, and to have have played a part, however small, in creating this fantastic world and making ELDEN RING the landmark megahit that it is. "}

There are 47 gestures in total, 12 of them are automatically received on the start of every new character and 35 are obtainable throughout the journey, however many of them are missable and can be left unobtainable until the next playthrough.\nGesture Types.\nThere are overall three different kinds of gestures in , they are defined by how they influence the player's movement.\nSome gestures my also hide the player's equipped weapons until the animation is complete while others won't.\nMotion Controlled Gesturing.\nOn the Playstation versions of the game, players can perform gestures without opening up the menu through the use of motion controls, by simply holding the \"Triangle\" button and physically moving the controller in the designated directions. Which gestures are performed are dependent on which slot the players have put their gestures in.\nThis feature can be a double-edged sword though as players may accidentally trigger a gesture at inconvenient times due them trying to adjust their sitting position while at the same time trying to interact with the environment like doors and ladders, or if they want to use items equipped in their Pouch at potentially dire times like &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Crimson%20Tears\"&gt;Flask of Crimson Tears&lt;/a&gt;. To avoid this problem players can simply unequip the gestures in the slots that are tied to the most common forms of movements."}

It is housed in the cauldron-shaped &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;.The red-haired &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giants\"&gt;Fire Giants&lt;/a&gt; were its servants, and its power is wielded as &lt;a href=\"Giants%27%20Flame%20Incantations\"&gt;Giants' Flame incantations&lt;/a&gt; by both the Fire Giants and the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Monk\"&gt;Fire Monks&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar Against the Giants.\nThe flame of ruin posed a dire threat to the sanctity of the impending &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20the%20Erdtree\"&gt;Age of the Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, and so &lt;a href=\"Marika\"&gt;Marika&lt;/a&gt; commanded her &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Lord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, and the champions of the Erdtree to slay the giants and confine the flame upon the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Peak\"&gt;Flame Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their opposition to the Giants' Flame, they used its power in the form of a protective incantation during the war. According to legend, it was Marika herself who vanquished the fell god.\nAfter the Fire Giants' defeat, Marika found that the flames of the forge could never be fully extinguished, and so she struck the last remaining Fire Giant with a curse, condemning him to tend the flame for eternity. The &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Monks\"&gt;Fire Monks&lt;/a&gt; were appointed as the Flame's guardians, and the path to the mountaintops was marked as the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Lands\"&gt;Forbidden Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAge of the Erdtree.\nThe fell god's Flame remained anathema to the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Worship\"&gt;Erdtree faith&lt;/a&gt;, and was a forbidden subject during Queen Marika's reign. &lt;a href=\"Prophets\"&gt;Prophets&lt;/a&gt; who caught glimpses of the fated burning of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; were declared to be heretics and banished. However, the flame of ruin continued to smolder within the forge on the northern mountaintops, guarded by the Fire Monks and their &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Prelates\"&gt;Prelates&lt;/a&gt;. These stewards, entrusted with the Giantsflame, eventually succumbed to its allure, becoming its worshippers out of reverence and fear.\nThe secrets of the Giants' Flame were documented in a &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Prayerbook\"&gt;Giant's Prayerbook&lt;/a&gt; and kept hidden by the Prelates. Later, &lt;a href=\"Adan%2C%20Thief%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Adan&lt;/a&gt; stole the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20the%20Fell%20God\"&gt;Flame of the Fell God&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Guardian%20Arghanthy\"&gt;Chief Guardian Arghanthy&lt;/a&gt;, and Fire Monks crusaded as far as &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim it.\nIn time, the &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt;, or a potential &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Lord of Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt;, reached the forge atop Flame Peak.

It is said that glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and that it contains the vitality of the stars. Glintstones have a wide variety of applications: they can be embedded in staffs used to cast sorceries, and the stone crowns worn by followers of the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria%20Conspectuses\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria Conspectuses&lt;/a&gt;; used as ornamentation in various weapons; or used as a receptacle for a sorcerer's soul after removal using a &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Glintstone%20Blade\"&gt;Primal Glintstone Blade&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, many glintstone sorceries conjure projectiles made of glintstone, which can be launched at enemies.\nGlintstone typically has a crystalline appearance, and many varieties exist. The glintstone embedded in the staffs of the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt;'s sorcerers is a turquoise colour, a colour shared by many of the fundamental glintstone sorceries, while glintstone used by the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Carian Royal Family&lt;/a&gt; is typically blue.\nRed glintstone is said to be formed from the blood of sacrifices, and enhances the power of thorn sorceries. Red glintstone is also used in the staves wielded by &lt;a href=\"Gelmir%20Man-Serpent\"&gt;Gelmir Man-Serpent&lt;/a&gt;s, which can enhance the effect of lava sorceries. This glintstone has an apparent connection to the blood star.\nRarer forms of glintstone include dark purple crystals which can enhance gravity sorceries, and sullied glintstone which enhances death sorceries and is considered heretical by the academy.\nRelevant Items.\nItems related to or referencing Glintstone"}

Consoles don\u2019t have this issue, so players have been left to believe it has to do with the \u201cEasy Anti-Cheat (EAC)\u201d software that was added to \"Elden Ring\". Two minutes after establishing a multiplayer connection, players appear to be disconnected for failing to be validated by Easy Anti-Cheat\u2019s services. However, this is obviously not working correctly as it happens at random for everyone who\u2019s playing the game, the only consistent factor is that it happens at the two-minute mark.\nThe video goes into further technical detail.\nControl Glitches.\nInput Drops.\nThere are various animation interactions within \"Elden Ring\" which have been found to have clearly unintended behavior, such as consistently not taking player inputs at points which are intended. This results in combat feeling clunky and unfair, as players doubt and question if the game is even responding to their inputs when it\u2019s supposed to. These are similar to exploits and passive glitches, which tend to affect the game as a whole negatively for all players, but in a way that is difficult for most to pin down. The following are input drop issues that players have been able to identify:\nBlock-Sprint Input Drop.\nWhen stopping a sprint and lowering your guard around the same time, any action the player inputs will be dropped (e.g. rolling, attacking).\n \u25ba 0:29 \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad Block-sprint input drop \nTwo-Hand-Jumping-Input-Drop.\nWhen continuing to sprint after a jump, the player cannot queue a light attack action for a significant amount of time after landing, while any other input works including guarding. This does not occur when 1-handing weapons.\nAt the below timestamp, you can see the keyboard \u201cLight Attack\u201d input being repeatedly dropped, only while 2-handing and after landing from a sprinting jump.\n \u25ba 2:38 \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad Two-hand jumping input drop \nDamage Occurrence Input Drop.\nWhen the player receives damage that does not stun them, certain actions seem to be cleared from the input queue such as roll dodging, which causes players to be hit again as they expected the game to not clear their input. This has been confirmed to be a result of the damage occurrence and not any misconceptions with queue timing. \nMoving Toggle Input Drop.\nWhile moving during a toggle (weapon swap/2-handing) animation, it is impossible to buffer another action out of the animation until it finishes. Despite this, you are still able to buffer actions when toggling while standing still.\nAt the timestamp below, you can see the keyboard \u201cHeavy Attack\u201d input being dropped only while doing a moving toggle.\n \u25ba 1:59 \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad Moving toggle input drop \n Explanation video by Amir\nAim Punch.\nWhen a character in the middle of an attack animation is hit by an attack and is not interrupted out of it (either due to poise, or the attack not having any hitstun), the character still animates a bit in reaction to the damage. This animation is so strong, that it can frequently cause attacks to miss even if they would have certainly hit normally. \nPerpetual Casting.\nBy generating an absurd amount of bullets, players can glitch their character to fire them off indefinitely.\nThe following video showcases this exploit and explains its mechanics and cause in detail:\nCrouch Run Stamina Exploit.\nEntering or exiting crouch while running does not restrict stamina regeneration, nor consume stamina during those animations. This is clearly unintentional, as the regular running animation does consume stamina. The consequence of this glitch is that it allows players to continue running while in combat without breaks for stamina regeneration, as they lose minimal speed from entering and exiting crouch.\nThe following video showcases and explains additional details on the impact of this exploit:\nRapid Item Swap Glitches.\nBlessed Dew Talisman Regen Glitch.\nRapidly equipping and unequipping the Blessed Dew Talisman allows the user to restore HP far faster than intended.\nThe following video showcases this glitch:\nInfinite Health Helmet Swap Glitch.\nBy swapping between the Karolos Glintstone Crown and some other Glintstone Crowns, players can restore their entire health bar in a matter of seconds at no cost. This allows players to regenerate hundreds of health points per second, due to an issue with the status and attribute altering effects of the crowns.\nGlitched Chain Casting.\nWe are not certain how much of chaining casts between spells is intentional, but there are certain chain cast interactions that are clearly not intended. When queuing a spell out of a different spell that can chain cast such as Bestial Sling, it may attempt to play the third cast animation of the queued spell. However, not all spells that have the ability to chain cast also have a third casting animation. If the spell is prompted to play the third casting animation and does not have one, it appears to default to the Glintstone Pebble spell\u2019s third cast animation. This causes many strange interactions.\n\"Update: As of patch 1.05, several forms of chain casting including ones that play a clearly incorrect animation have been patched out. However, there are still methods of chain casting in the game. Cross-spell chain casting can still be achieved by queuing the spell out of a jump cast of another spell. Additionally, spells that utilize the same animation set can chain cast between each other as they would with themselves.\"\nMove-Swaps.\nBolus Swap.\nSimilar to the patched sprint pivot swap glitch, this glitch allows you to use a weapon skill on any other weapon, by way of a very tightly timed inventory unequip at the end of a quick consumable animation (such as Preserving Boluses). The capabilities of this glitch include putting any skill buffs on weapons that cannot be buffed using spells or consumables, or the use of weapon skills on unintended armaments such as the Bloodboon Ritual skill on Vyke\u2019s War Spear.\nThe steps to execute this glitch are as follows:\nHere is a video showcasing the glitch and how to execute it:\nOff-Hand Stance Swap.\nThis bug allows the player to use weapon skills with a glitched lower-body state, which allows them to walk or run during skills that would normally prevent player-controlled movement.\nNotes &amp; References.\nFor preservation purposes: this page currently uses the information and wording offered by the community-made, yet currently expired (as during the writing of this page) Elden Ring PvP website."}

It must be defeated to advance &lt;a href=\"Tanith%2C%20Volcano%20Manor%20Proprietress\"&gt;Tanith&lt;/a&gt;'s questline.\nBackground.\nThe great serpent is an immortal terror that seeks to one day consume the world. It has an affinity for lava and &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, and is known for its tremendous gluttony. The elder serpent of Mt. Gelmir has been repelled by the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent-Hunter\"&gt;Serpent-Hunter&lt;/a&gt; since ancient times.\nLong before &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika&lt;/a&gt; took power, a cult on Mt. Gelmir practiced &lt;a href=\"hexes\"&gt;hexes&lt;/a&gt; and performed human sacrifices in reverence to a heretical &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20God\"&gt;serpent god&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, these practices ceased, and their &lt;a href=\"Gelmir%20Sorcery\"&gt;Gelmir Sorcery&lt;/a&gt; was lost\u2014until it was rediscovered by the &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rykard%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blasphemy\"&gt;Rykard&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Praetor Rykard willingly allowed the great serpent to devour him. Although his &lt;a href=\"Gelmir%20Knight\"&gt;Gelmir Knight&lt;/a&gt;s obtained the legendary Serpent-Hunter weapon, they failed to defeat their former lord.\nNow, the great serpent and Rykard share a single body as the Lord of Blasphemy, engaging in an appalling birthing ritual that spawned the &lt;a href=\"Man-Serpent\"&gt;Man-Serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. They devour countless champions with the ultimate goal of consuming the &lt;a href=\"gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; and the world itself."}

Later, he became Godfrey when he took the &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Serosh\"&gt;Serosh&lt;/a&gt; upon his back. The Lord of &lt;a href=\"Beasts\"&gt;Beasts&lt;/a&gt; suppressed his rage, allowing him to conduct himself as Marika's first Elden Lord.\nAge of the Erdtree.\nBefore it came to be an embodiment of &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt;, everything was in opposition to the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. Godfrey led Marika's golden armies in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Giants\"&gt;War Against the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, a decisive conflict thay ended with the &lt;a href=\"Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;' defeat and the confinement of the &lt;a href=\"Fell%20God\"&gt;Fell God&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Ruin\"&gt;Flame of Ruin&lt;/a&gt;. This war heralded the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, and the beginning of an age of Order ruled over by Marika and her Elden Lord.\nThe age of the Erdtree began amidst conflict, and Godfrey was regarded as the \"Lord of the Battlefield.\" He fought the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Lord\"&gt;Storm Lord&lt;/a&gt; alone and emerged the new lord of &lt;a href=\"Stormveil\"&gt;Stormveil&lt;/a&gt;. Later, during the siege of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Morne\"&gt;Castle Morne&lt;/a&gt;, Godfrey bested a lone hero who wielded a &lt;a href=\"Grafted%20Blade%20Greatsword\"&gt;grafted blade&lt;/a&gt; and fought for vengeance. Godfrey was commander of the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20Knights\"&gt;Crucible Knights&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20Knight%20Ordovis\"&gt;Ordovis&lt;/a&gt; and his men wore the crest of the axe.\nGodfrey and his offspring with Queen Marika were the first &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigods&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lineage\"&gt;Golden Lineage&lt;/a&gt;. His bond with Serosh became an emblem of this lineage, guiding them as they conquered the Lands Between. Godfrey's &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Godfrey\"&gt;double-headed axe&lt;/a&gt; symbolized his warrior's vow of conduct and would later become a symbol of the Golden Lineage.\nThe Long March.\nAt the end of his campaign, Lord Godfrey's golden armies remained unvanquished and unbowed. When his last enemy fell, it was said that the golden hue of Godfrey's eyes faded. He found his &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Grace&lt;/a&gt; lost, tattered, and faded.\nGodfrey and his warriors were then informed by Queen Marika that she had divested them of their Grace. She drove them from the Lands Between to wage war in a distant land, where they would live and die. Marika promised Godfrey and his men that after their deaths, they would regain what she had taken from them. They would return to the Lands Between with the strength required to brandish the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nThus, Godfrey and his kinfolk became the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;. They left the Lands Between together on a pilgrimage known as the &lt;a href=\"Long%20March\"&gt;Long March&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of which Godfrey divested himself of kingship and became a simple warrior once more.\nGodfrey became a chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; under the name of Hoarah Loux. The head of his axe had been broken in a battle fought during the Long March. His loyal warriors honored him by wielding axes of their own, and they became the weapon of choice for Badlands chieftains.\nReturn to the Lands Between.\nAt some point, Hoarah Loux died. However, when the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt; was shattered following the death of his son &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt;, the Tarnished who had died outside the Lands Between were returned to life by the call of their long-lost Grace. The Tarnished, who had grown strong in the face of death, crossed the fog and returned to the Lands Between, to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord. Godfrey was among those who made their way back to the Lands Between. \nThe Ashen Capital.\nAfter a &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt; has claimed the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Runes&lt;/a&gt;, burned the Erdtree, and unbound the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt;, they return to the city of &lt;a href=\"Leyndell\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt; and approach the Erdtree. At the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Throne\"&gt;Elden Throne&lt;/a&gt;, they find Godfrey, Serosh on his back, mourning the death of &lt;a href=\"Morgott\"&gt;Morgott&lt;/a&gt;, whom the Tarnished had previously slain. \nGodfrey rises to his feet and addresses the Tarnished. He acknowledges their effort, however he declares his intention to once again be granted audience. The two Tarnished do battle, and Godfrey finds himself overpowered. The former Elden Lord grabs the head of Serosh, thanks him for his service, and then tears him from his back. Drenched in the blood of his loyal regent, Godfrey resumes the fight, now as Hoarah Loux. \nNevertheless, the Tarnished defeats Godfrey, who declares that their strength befits a crown. With Godfrey dead, the Tarnished finally gains entry to the Erdtree, to seek audience with Queen Marika.\nBoss fights.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMoveset.\nThis is a boss fight against a golden, spectral version of Godfrey. He is fought within the Erdtree Sanctuary, accessed by climbing up a large root south of the West Capital Rampart Site of Grace. This battle is not optional as he must be defeated to progress Leyndell further and continue the story. Compared to the later encounter, this version of Godfrey has a greatly reduced moveset, mainly consisting of close-range axe swings. He can create areas of effect by stomping or smashing his axe into the ground, and he may also throw his axe at the player from a distance.\nEnvironment.\nGodfrey is fought in a long, fairly spacious room. There is a narrower, lower section to the left of the entrance, as well as various pillars which may restrict movement or allow one to gain distance from the boss.\n&lt;a href=\"Nepheli%20Loux%2C%20Warrior\"&gt;Nepheli Loux, Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shabriri\"&gt;Shabriri&lt;/a&gt; are both available as summons for this fight, provided their questlines have been completed. Like the first battle, this fight is not optional and must be defeated to reach the final bosses of the game.\nPhase 1 - Godfrey, First Elden Lord.\nGodfrey will usually initiate the fight by throwing his axe at the player and then dashing after it. \nGodfrey has a stomp attack similar to that of the Crucible Knights, causing spikes to come out of the ground that are easier to dodge by jumping than to i-frame with a roll. He will generally follow up on the spike stomp with a series of axe swings, but can do a second stomp at any time, even repeatedly.\nGodfrey's primary offense will be axe swing combos. They can be dodge rolled safely and involve enough delays for the player to sneak in a hit before having to dodge again.\nHe retains his moves from the earlier fight, with the addition of more close-range axe attacks and some abilities that generate earthquakes.\nPhase 2 - Hoarah Loux, Warrior.\nAfter his health drops below 50%, a cutscene plays and phase 2 begins. Godfrey no longer has Serosh or his axe, and has an almost entirely new, grappling-based fighting style.\nPhase 2 always starts with him rushing towards the player with a delayed command grab. He will always briefly go into slow-motion mid-jump, which can roll-catch. He will attempt to grab the player like this multiple times over the course of phase 2. Properly rolling out of the way of it gives you one of the largest time windows to attack him out of his entire phase 2.\nHe will do many other grab attacks, ground-slams, leap attacks, delayed kicks and delayed stomp attacks. Panic-rolling and blocking is not recommended.\nWhen he begins to crack the ground after a leap attack by smashing his hands into the ground, the player must run away from him as far as they can, otherwise they will get blown up by an explosion that is very difficult to roll through. He often announces this attack by knocking the player away from him with a roar.\nEnvironment.\nThe arena is a wide, circular platform with no obstacles. It is the same arena where &lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott, the Omen King&lt;/a&gt; was fought previously.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

He is a &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigod&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;Shardbearer&lt;/a&gt; who is encountered in &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nGodrick is a descendant of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lineage\"&gt;Golden Lineage&lt;/a&gt;, the bloodline which began with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; and her first consort &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;. Only a distant relation of Marika's line, his divine blood was sorely diluted, and he was viewed as the runt of the litter.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt; was shattered, Godrick inherited the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt; from the centre of the Elden Ring, referred to as the anchor ring. During &lt;a href=\"The%20Shattering\"&gt;The Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Godrick was hounded from the &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed a multitude of treasures, including the &lt;a href=\"Mimic%27s%20Veil\"&gt;Mimic's Veil&lt;/a&gt;, and then hid amongst the womenfolk to flee the city. \nGodrick made his way south, settling in &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt; with an army made up of soldiers who had fled Leyndell. He took up residence in Stormveil Castle, using it as a refuge to hide from &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;General Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, and as a place to practice grafting; a grotesque act which involves attaching parts of other living beings to oneself to gain power. When the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; returned to the Lands Between, Godrick sent his soldiers on Tarnished hunts, seeking new subjects to graft. As well as performing the act upon himself, Godrick also produced the &lt;a href=\"Grafted%20Scion\"&gt;Grafted Scion&lt;/a&gt;s; abhorrent beings comprised of many different limbs, seemingly grafted onto children.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt; marched southward, Godrick insulted her, leading to a confrontation which left Godrick beaten and humiliated, forced to grovel for mercy.\nGodrick idolised Godfrey, desiring for his ancestor to witness his feats. He wielded an axe emblazoned with the figure of a lion, a symbol of Godfrey, and furnished his army with emblems of the Golden Lineage such as axes, and depictions of Serosh the Beast Regent. Although he styled himself as the \"lord of all that is golden\", he was popularly referred to as \"Godrick the Grafted\", commanding far less respect than his forebear. He was even despised by his servants, whom he looked down on and pushed around.\nThe &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; journeys to Stormveil Castle in search of Godrick's Great Rune, on the advice of &lt;a href=\"White%20Mask%20Varr%C3%A9\"&gt;White Mask Varr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt; In the castle, they encounter many examples of Godrick's grafting: severed limbs hanging from the ceiling in the dining hall; a dismembered &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; hanging over a courtyard; and a pile of dismembered corpses, among whom are the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Roderika%2C%20Spirit%20Tuner\"&gt;Roderika's&lt;/a&gt; companions. Eventually they find Godrick in a graveyard, speaking to a dead dragon impaled on a statue. Upon noticing the Tarnished, Godrick chides them for opposing him and engages them in battle. To gain an advantage, Godrick cuts off his own hand and grafts the dragon's head to the stump, gaining the ability to spew flames. Despite this display of power, Godrick is defeated, and the Tarnished claims his Great Rune.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Nepheli%20Loux%2C%20Warrior\"&gt;Nepheli Loux&lt;/a&gt; becomes lord of Limgrave at the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Haight\"&gt;Kenneth Haight&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoss Fight.\n&lt;a href=\"Nepheli%20Loux%2C%20Warrior\"&gt;Nepheli Loux, Warrior&lt;/a&gt; is available as a summon for this fight, as long as the player has spoken to her in Stormveil Castle. Her summon sign can be found just outside the arena.\nPhase 1.\nThe fight begins following a cutscene. Godrick will primarily use his axe and his large left arm to deal damage, and can generate cyclones and earthquakes for area-of-effect damage. He can roll to cover ground quickly, and has a wind-based ranged homing attack.\nPhase 2.\nOnce Godrick's health reaches 60%, he will stop attacking the player and chop off his own arm. This is followed by a cutscene, which transitions into phase 2. Godrick can now spew fire from the dragon's head grafted to his left arm, providing him with more ranged and area-of-effect attacks.\nEnvironment.\nThe arena mainly consists of a narrow, paved area without any obstacles, lined on both sides by graveyards. There is a wider section at the arena's entrance, around the steps. It is possible to move between the gravestones, however doing so may reduce the player's ability to avoid Godrick's attacks.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

However, she managed to suppress it with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Swordsman\"&gt;Blind Swordsman&lt;/a&gt; and Miquella's &lt;a href=\"Unalloyed%20Gold%20Needle\"&gt;Unalloyed Gold Needle&lt;/a&gt;. During her legendary duel with &lt;a href=\"Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, she reluctantly unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Aeonia\"&gt;Scarlet Aeonia&lt;/a&gt;. Following this bloom, the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Aeonia\"&gt;Swamp of Aeonia&lt;/a&gt; manifested in &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt;, producing the &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20of%20Rot\"&gt;Kindred of Rot&lt;/a&gt;.

Her third and final bloom is prophesied to complete her transformation into a true Goddess of Rot. Unlike her twin, Malenia has no interest in establishing her own &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Rot\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nFell God.\nThe red-haired, one-eyed &lt;a href=\"Fell%20God\"&gt;Fell God&lt;/a&gt; of fire is an ancient deity worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giant\"&gt;Fire Giant&lt;/a&gt;s, whom it eternally cursed to tend the &lt;a href=\"Giants%27%20Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt;. It is regarded as an malevolent entity that opposes and threatens the Erdtree and the Golden Order. Queen Marika allegedly slew the Fell God during the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Giants\"&gt;War Against the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, however, it still lingers within the giants.\nSimilar entites.\nOuter Gods.\n&lt;a href=\"Outer%20Gods\"&gt;Outer Gods&lt;/a&gt; are extremely powerful entities that are unseen or exist outside of the Lands Between. Examples of outer gods are the &lt;a href=\"Formless%20Mother\"&gt;Formless Mother&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Outer%20God%20of%20Rot\"&gt;God of Rot&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Twinbird\"&gt;Twinbird&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;, and the Outer God of the &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemigods.\n&lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigods&lt;/a&gt; are powerful beings with the divine blood or power but without possessing true godhood. In the Lands Between most demigods are children or step-children of Queen Marika and the Elden Lords. After Marika shattered the Elden Ring, many demigods acquired &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Runes&lt;/a&gt; and became &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;Shardbearers&lt;/a&gt;. The Tarnished are guided by Grace to challenge the demigods and claim their Great Runes.\nEmpyreans.\n&lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyreans&lt;/a&gt; are beings capable of becoming gods. During the Age of the Erdtree, Empyreans were chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;. Examples of Empyreans are Marika, Miquella, &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gloam-Eyed%20Queen\"&gt;Gloam-Eyed Queen&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreater Will.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt; is a mysterious entity or force known for fracturing the &lt;a href=\"One%20Great\"&gt;One Great&lt;/a&gt;. It once sent the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt; to the Lands Between, which would eventually become the Elden Ring itself. The Greater Will also had other vassals like &lt;a href=\"Metyr%2C%20Mother%20of%20Fingers\"&gt;Metyr&lt;/a&gt; and her children, the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, who selected Empyreans to become gods. The Greater Will is speculated to have imprisoned Queen Marika after she shattered the Elden Ring. Due to the Greater Will's power to rupture the &lt;a href=\"One%20Great\"&gt;One Great&lt;/a&gt;, create and imprison gods, it can effectively be seen as the supreme being of the \"Elden Ring\" world."}

Godwyn was a scion of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lineage\"&gt;Golden Lineage&lt;/a&gt;, of which &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the Grafted&lt;/a&gt; was a final descendant. \nLong ago, during the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20the%20Erdtree\"&gt;Age of the Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt; was assaulted by the &lt;a href=\"ancient%20dragon\"&gt;ancient dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gransax\"&gt;Gransax&lt;/a&gt;. This was the only time the walls of the royal capital had been breached, marking the beginning of the terrible &lt;a href=\"Routing%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Dragons\"&gt;War of the Ancient Dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Godwyn was triumphant in a battle against the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Fortissax\"&gt;Fortissax&lt;/a&gt; and earned the mighty dragon's friendship in the process. Their alliance ended the war and led to the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Ancient Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cult worshiped the dragons and studied their &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult%20Incantations\"&gt;lightning incantations&lt;/a&gt;. Their practices were permitted by the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Gravel%20Stone%20Seal\"&gt;gravel stone&lt;/a&gt;, and lightning itself, were both imbued with gold. The red-hued incantations were also taught in secret. The ancient dragon &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon%20Lansseax\"&gt;Lansseax&lt;/a&gt;, sister of Fortissax, took a human form to commune with the knights as a priestess.\nDeath.\nGodwyn would eventually meet his end during the Night of Black Knives. Seeking to be free from her &lt;a href=\"empyrean\"&gt;fate&lt;/a&gt; as a pawn of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt;, Godwyn's stepsister, &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Princess%20Ranni\"&gt;Lunar Princess Ranni&lt;/a&gt;, stole a fragment of the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Maliketh\"&gt;Maliketh&lt;/a&gt;. She imbued ritual daggers with the power of Death and gave them to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Asssassins\"&gt;Black Knife Asssassins&lt;/a&gt;. The assassins slipped into the royal capital and carved the &lt;a href=\"Cursemark%20of%20Death\"&gt;half-wheel centipede&lt;/a&gt; into Godwyn's flesh as its counterpart was etched into Ranni. Both demigods died simultaneously but in opposite ways. Ranni perished in body but not spirit and Godwyn's soul died while his body survived.\nErdtree Burial.\nGodwyn the Golden was &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Burial\"&gt;buried&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the Erdtree's roots in the &lt;a href=\"Deeproot%20Depths\"&gt;Deeproot Depths&lt;/a&gt;, below &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt;, but as he was lacking a soul, his body was unable to die a true death. The influence of the Rune of Death seeped through the roots and sprouted &lt;a href=\"Deathroot\"&gt;Deathroot&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;, and gave rise to &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nFortissax entered Godwyn's death dream to fight against the Death within Godwyn, but was ultimately corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt;. As the Deathroot spread, the roots of the Erdtree were disconnected from those below.\nThe knights of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Sol\"&gt;Castle Sol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miquella\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt; worked toward achieving an eclipse they believed would restore Godwyn's soul. Former members of the Dragon Cult embraced Godwyn's death and became the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights\"&gt;Death Knights&lt;/a&gt;.

It refers to the removal of the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt; and the historic reign of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;. Its greatest symbols are the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Grace of Gold&lt;/a&gt;. It is the dominant set of beliefs in the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Golden Order was established by Queen Marika following &lt;a href=\"Maliketh\"&gt;Maliketh&lt;/a&gt;'s triumph over the &lt;a href=\"Gloam-Eyed%20Queen\"&gt;Gloam-Eyed Queen&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Godskin%20Apostles\"&gt;Godskin Apostles&lt;/a&gt;. She extracted the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring and sealed it inside her &lt;a href=\"Shadowbound%20Beast\"&gt;shadowbound beast&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, she suppressed the power of her &lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; rival and granted immortality to herself and her &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; offspring, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lineage\"&gt;Golden Lineage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Golden Order was a governing principle, a religion, and a philosophy. It was founded on the principle that Marika was the one true god, and was propagated by the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;. It replaced the concept of &lt;a href=\"Destined%20Death\"&gt;Destined Death&lt;/a&gt; with that of &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Burial\"&gt;Erdtree Burial&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Golden Order was capable of integrating conflicting ideologies and practices. The &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;dragon cult&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;royal capital&lt;/a&gt; was compatible because the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragons\"&gt;ancient dragons'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; was imbued with gold. Later, the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; faith absorbed the practice of &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Sorcery\"&gt;glintstone sorcery&lt;/a&gt;. Concepts that threatened to shatter the Order entirely, such as &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;life in death&lt;/a&gt;, were labeled as heresy and violently persecuted by the Golden Order.\nGolden Order Fundamentalism.\nGolden Order Fundamentalism was a scholarly pursuit that combined both intelligence and faith. It attempted to interpret the fundamentals of the Golden Order. Fundamentalism was based on two concepts: the &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20Regression\"&gt;Law of Regression&lt;/a&gt;, the pull of meaning and the yearning to converge; and the &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20Causality\"&gt;Law of Causality&lt;/a&gt;, the pull between meanings which links all things in a chain of relation.\nAmong the Golden Order Fundamentalists were the hunters of &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;, who abandoned learning in search of an absolute evil to contend with. &lt;a href=\"Miquella\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt;, who once created Fundamentalist incantations to give to his father &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt;, abandoned Fundamentalism as it could not treat &lt;a href=\"Malenia%20the%20Severed\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt;'s rot. Other notable followers of Golden Order Fundamentalism included &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Corhyn\"&gt;Brother Corhyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldmask\"&gt;Goldmask&lt;/a&gt;, and the twins &lt;a href=\"D%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;D.

He predicted the guidance of Grace, and upon being beckoned by it he came to the Lands Between to contemplate the Golden Order.\nAlthough a Golden Order fundamentalist himself, Goldmask was critical of the hunters of Those Who Live in Death, lamenting that their learnedness had been reduced to fanatical raving and an obsession with finding a great evil to contend with, a concept which he did not believe existed within the Golden Order.\nWhile contemplating the Erdtree in the &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt; Goldmask is approached by &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Corhyn\"&gt;Brother Corhyn&lt;/a&gt;, a man of the cloth who wished to travel alongside him as a scholar.

With the help of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;The Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, Goldmask learns that Radagon is Marika.\nGoldmask and Corhyn then travel to the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, where Corhyn becomes aware of Goldmask's suspicions regarding the holism of the Golden Order. Corhyn begins to doubt Goldmask's faith, questioning his decision to travel to the Mountaintops. \nGoldmask had come to the revelation that the imperfection of the Golden Order and the instability of ideology was due to the fickleness of the gods. After the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; burns, Goldmask returns to Leyndell and dies on the hill near the Erdtree Sanctuary, leaving behind the &lt;a href=\"Mending%20Rune%20of%20Perfect%20Order\"&gt;Mending Rune of Perfect Order&lt;/a&gt;, which would allow the Golden Order to be perfected. \nCharacter Information.\nBasic Info.\nGoldmask cannot be made hostile, and will disappear if attacked, giving no Runes or item drops.

This blessing is represented by a golden light in the eyes of the inhabitants of the Lands Between. Those who had grace bestowed on them, but later lost it, are known as &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nGrace.\nThe Lands Between are blessed by the presence of the Elden Ring and by the Erdtree, which symbolizes its presence, and this has given grace or blessing to the people throughout the land, great and small.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; took away Grace from &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%2C%20First%20Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Godfrey, First Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt; and his kinfolk, turning them into Tarnished. They then left the Lands Between in an event called the Long March of the Tarnished. Long afterwards, Grace would be returned to them, or their descendants, and they would be called back to the Lands Between. \nAt the time of the game, when given back, Grace itself is what gives the Tarnished their life.\nThe Guidance of Grace.\nSometimes, the Tarnished can see golden rays of Grace that point in a particular direction, called the Guidance of Grace. It exists to guide the Tarnished and lead them along the proper path. It was also said that the guidance of grace would ensure that a &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Maiden\"&gt;Finger Maiden&lt;/a&gt; be brought to her chosen Tarnished. Or at least, such was the promise long ago.\nEven now, some sites of grace retain that power, and their golden rays can guide the Tarnished along the way.\nIt is said that true guidance awaits those with iron wills and unwavering faith, although it can be lost. In fact, most Tarnished don't even see it nowadays. \nThose in distant lands who saw the guidance of grace were usually seen as undesirables, and were usually expatriated, after which they set to journey to the Lands Between. Similarly, the churches outside the Lands Between, dedicated to the teachings of the Two Fingers, sent &lt;a href=\"confessor\"&gt;confessors&lt;/a&gt; out to follow the guidance of grace."}

Later, when the Tarnished enters into an accord with Melina, she grants them the &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Steed%20Whistle\"&gt;Spectral Steed Whistle&lt;/a&gt; which allows them to call upon Torrent, revealing that Torrent has chosen them.\nTorrent has a taste for &lt;a href=\"Rowa%20Raisin\"&gt;Rowa Raisin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Raisin\"&gt;Sweet Raisin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Raisin\"&gt;Frozen Raisin&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be used to restore his health.

This allows one to easily jump down from heights that'd normally kill the player as long as they're mounted on Torrent. That said, Torrent isn't immune to dying from jumping from too high of a height: even if a double jump is used to get to a lower level, if the starting point is too high up, Torrent will dissipate on landing and the player will die from the impact. \nJumping again while in mid-air will cause Torrent to perform a second jump. This can only be done once until he touches the ground again and can be used to change direction at the moment of the second jump. \nPlayers can also fight from horseback against enemies, such as shooting arrows or casting spells. However, only one of the player's weapons can be used at a time as the left hand is constantly occupied holding Torrent's reigns, it is still possible to switch between the right-hand and left-hand armament while riding by using the same input the player uses to two-hand their weapons. \nNote that it is not possible to change from wielding a weapon one-handed to two-handed while mounted. It is however possible to get the bonuses of two-handing by performing the action before mounting up.\nSpirit springs can be used by jumping while riding Torrent to reach higher altitudes. Landing on or close to a spirit spring will completely negate fall damage.\nTorrent's HP can be restored by consuming &lt;a href=\"Rowa%20Raisin\"&gt;Rowa Raisins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Raisin\"&gt;Sweet Raisins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Raisin\"&gt;Frozen Raisins&lt;/a&gt;. Using a &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Crimson%20Tears\"&gt;Flask of Crimson Tears&lt;/a&gt; will also restore his health on top of the player's own, however only while the player is riding him. If Torrent is killed, using the Spectral Steed Whistle will bring up a prompt to expend a single charge of the Flask of Crimson Tears to revive him. "}

They serve as vassals to the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nAppearance.\nTwo Fingers have an appearance resembling part of a giant hand, with a slight indentation in the \u201cpalm\u201d, and two finger-like appendages on the top, hence their name.\nBackground.\nThe Two Fingers are the children of &lt;a href=\"Metyr%2C%20Mother%20of%20Fingers\"&gt;Metyr, Mother of Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, and serve as divine envoys of the Greater Will. They are responsible for selecting &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyreans&lt;/a&gt;, granting them &lt;a href=\"Shadowbound%20Beast\"&gt;shadowbound beasts&lt;/a&gt;, and guiding their path toward inheriting the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;.

They were said to communicate using a language of light, composed of intangible symbols that appeared to hang in the air. These inscriptions could be fashioned into weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Cipher%20Pata\"&gt;Cipher Pata&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Coded%20Sword\"&gt;Coded Sword&lt;/a&gt;. The Two Fingers are also the source of &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers%20Incantations\"&gt;Two Fingers Incantations&lt;/a&gt; and possess the ability to restore the blessings of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Runes&lt;/a&gt; atop the ancient &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Towers\"&gt;Divine Towers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fingers are attended by &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Readers\"&gt;Finger Readers&lt;/a&gt;, who interpret their wisdom for the Tarnished, those to whom &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Grace&lt;/a&gt; has returned. Churches dedicated to the Two Fingers exist beyond the Lands Between, served by &lt;a href=\"confessors\"&gt;confessors&lt;/a&gt; who hunt down their enemies. While some Tarnished remain faithful, the Fingers are now believed to be corrupted and senile, having been broken along with the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; long ago.\nLocations.\nOne living Two Fingers can be found in Roundtable Hold, behind a set of doors that remain closed until the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt; acquires their first Great Rune. They will be at the back of the chamber with &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Reader%20Enia\"&gt;Finger Reader Enia&lt;/a&gt; sitting close by. The Two Fingers here appears to be in a state of decay, missing patches of skin with exposed flesh on its body and \u201cfingers\u201d. \nThere are several Two Fingers that can be found throughout the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. They can be found at the top of the Divine Towers littered about the world, however, they appear to have long since died through unknown means.\nDialogue.\nAlthough the Two Fingers do not speak directly, their words are relayed by &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Reader%20Enia\"&gt;Finger Reader Enia&lt;/a&gt; at certain points in the game.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Rosus is a mysterious figure depicted across all of the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; attributed with guiding the dead. Statues in his likeness can be found throughout the overworld, and inside certain catacombs. It is unknown if Rosus is a real person or just a part of the Lands Between's religious iconography.\nOverview.\nUsher of Death, Rosus is depicted as a hunched over, long-necked, and eyeless figure with a wrinkled face, dressed in a robe with drooping sleeves, and root or branch-like protrusions growing from his head that are reminiscent of a crown. He has five fingers, but only three toes, all of which appear to be clawed. \nIn his overworld statues, he holds a small dish in his right hand with a black material inside which functions as a candle when interacted with, creating a trail of light reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"guidance%20of%20grace\"&gt;guidance of grace&lt;/a&gt; which points the player to a nearby catacomb. In the version of his statues found in dungeons, he instead holds a torch in his right hand which shines a light on the ground, forming the sigil of &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; incantations.\nRosus is the guide and gatekeeper for those returning to the roots, indicating that he is a protector of Erdtree Burial. He shows the path to the catacombs throughout the Lands Between, for the dead easily lose their way, and have always been in sore need of a guiding hand. As such, Rosus' Axe's unique skill, Rosus's Summons, summons &lt;a href=\"Those%20Lost%20in%20Death\"&gt;those lost in death&lt;/a&gt;.\nCertain tombs contain shades which are untouchable until they are given form by Rosus' light.\nGame Mechanics.\nInteracting with his statues in the overworld will create a trail of light that leads the player to one nearby catacombs, which serves as a way to discover new dungeons and loot. If the dungeon has never been visited, an icon of the Rosus Statue will appear in the game's map with a blue arrow-like shape indicating the direction of the undiscovered dungeon.\nA limited number of dungeons contain \"shades\": shadowy versions of enemies that can't be hurt at all until they are touched by Rosus' light, which looks like a golden Erdtree symbol on the ground. Sometimes you need to find and activate the statues for the light to appear. \nStatues of Rosus that emit light can be found in the following catacombs:"}

The easiest way to correct this is to remove either the Halberd they are carrying (for a Longsword-focused build) or the Helmet they are wearing (if wishing to carry both weapons) or the Longsword and the Gauntlets (for a Halberd-focused build). Alternatively, increasing &lt;a href=\"Endurance\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; to 15 will also get them down to Medium Load, letting them roll normally. \nStarting equipment.\nArmaments\nSpells\nGear\nMisc. \nBuild Optimization.\nFor people who wish to select an origin that will have the most optimal stat distribution for a build with the fewest stat points wasted, Vagabond is the most effective choice for several build types. Note that these builds are not necessarily \"good\", they are just what this origin is better at than any other.\nStrength + Dexterity.\nThe primary benefit of Vagabond is that it saves a total of 5 levels when compared to &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretch&lt;/a&gt; across its Intelligence, Faith and Arcane stats. Builds that require at least 14 Strength and at least 13 Dexterity while also not investing in the other three stats will find Vagabond to be the most optimal origin. For builds that also wish to minimize the Mind stat, the Hero origin is able to tie with Vagabond in efficiency, but the Hero is not able to outclass Vagabond outright for a build that only increases Strength and Dexterity out of the five damage-increasing stats.\nIf a build requires fewer points in Strength than 13, &lt;a href=\"Samurai\"&gt;Samurai&lt;/a&gt; becomes the most efficient option. If a build requires fewer points in Dexterity than 13, &lt;a href=\"Hero\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; becomes the most efficient option.\nStrength + Intelligence.\nFor a build that focuses exclusively on Strength and Intelligence as its damage-increasing stats, &lt;a href=\"Astrologer\"&gt;Astrologer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hero\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; are tied for being the most optimal starting origin to choose. However, Vagabond will share a tie with Astrologer if the build also requires at least 13 Dexterity, with 4 fewer stat points wasted compared to &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretch&lt;/a&gt;. This makes Vagabond an optimal choice for Strength + Intelligence builds that use weapons with high Dexterity requirements such as:\nStrength + Faith.\nSimilarly to Strength + Intelligence, &lt;a href=\"Prophet\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hero\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; are tied by default for the most efficient starting class for a build exclusively utilizing Strength and Faith investment to increase damage. However, Vagabond is the most efficient option for a build that also requires at least 13 Dexterity, wasting 4 fewer stat points compared to &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretch&lt;/a&gt;. This makes Vagabond the optimal choice for Strength + Faith builds that use weapons with high Dexterity requirements such as:\nDexterity + Faith.\nBy default, &lt;a href=\"Prophet\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt; is the most efficient starting origin for a build that exclusively invests in Dexterity and Faith to increase damage output. However, if the build also requires 14 or more Strength, Vagabond becomes more efficient, wasting 4 fewer points compared to &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretch&lt;/a&gt;. This makes Vagabond the optimal choice for Dexterity + Faith builds that use weapons with high Strength requirements such as:"}

They all fight with two weapons, one for quick, close-ranged combat and the other for slower, but more far-reaching, engagements. Some of their attacks are enhanced by techniques similar to the Storm Arts of Stormveil. Like themselves, the weapons have also been mended with corpse wax. Despite showing great discipline with their arsenal, they will use the to destroy those who would run away from them. \n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVariant Description.\nA Valiant Gargoyle wielding a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Gargoyle's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%27s%20Halberd\"&gt;Gargoyle's Halberd&lt;/a&gt;. With their greatsword in hand, they are capable of performing the skill from a far distance. When using their halberd, they can perform a variant of the skill.\nA single one appears near the West Capital Rampart Site of Grace, praying in front of an Erdtree sapling alongside three other &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Envoy\"&gt;Oracle Envoy&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVariant Description.\nA Valiant Gargoyle wielding a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%27s%20Great%20Axe\"&gt;Gargoyle's Great Axe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%27s%20Twinblade\"&gt;Gargoyle's Twinblade&lt;/a&gt;. With their Great Axe in hand, they can perform the skill and become capable of performing more devastating attacks. When using their twinblade, they can perform a variant of the skill.\nOne will descend upon the player as they move north from the Outer Wall Phantom Tree Site of Grace in the Capital Outskirts of Altus Plateau. Another can be found roaming the entrance to the Fortified Manor in Leyndell, Ashen Capital. \nMoveset.\nCan include a separate table for a specific instance of this variant's moveset.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nBosses.\nBackground.\nA sickly pair of Valiant Gargoyles, one wielding a Greatsword and Halberd whilst the other wields a Great Axe and Twinblade. The latter will emerge from the waterfall when the former falls below half its health. They are unable to perform , instead coughing out a poisonous mist out of their bodies. This pair guard one of the entrances to &lt;a href=\"Deeproot%20Depths\"&gt;Deeproot Depths&lt;/a&gt;. \nStrategy.\nSince the second one only drops in from the cliffs above once the second gets low on health, it is best to draw the first Gargoyle to the entrance so that it takes a few seconds longer for them to gang up on you. \nThe poison breath is very hard to see and also quickly causes &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage, but it is only affect a conal area in front of the gargoyle so it can be avoided by quickly heading behind it running away a bit if close enough. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Putrid%20Corpse%20Ashes\"&gt;Putrid Corpse Ashes&lt;/a&gt; are very useful for this fight, as even upgraded to just +4 they will keep the attention of the second gargoyle provided that they are summoned around at around 60% health of the first gargoyle. They are quite tanky, draw aggro very well, and will be summoned at the summoning monument instead of at your side, meaning they will be in the perfect spot to distract #2. \nBe wary that the summoning zone doesn't quite cover the entire arena, and as such standing too close to the entrance of the arena may cause any summoned &lt;a href=\"Ashes\"&gt;Ashes&lt;/a&gt; to disappear.

It is a &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Dungeon\"&gt;legacy dungeon&lt;/a&gt; located on &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nThe Volcano Manor is home to the recusants of &lt;a href=\"Praetor%20Rykard\"&gt;Praetor Rykard&lt;/a&gt;, fierce warriors who wage war against the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable&lt;/a&gt;. The recusants are led by Rykard's consort, &lt;a href=\"Tanith\"&gt;Lady Tanith&lt;/a&gt;. Powerful &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; are extended invitations to join the Volcano Manor and are given contracts to hunt other Tarnished in service of the Roundtable. Tarnished who prove themselves are offered an audience with Praetor Rykard himself, which will inevitably end with the serpentine demigod devouring them, making them forever a part of his \"family\". \nThe Volcano Manor is besieged by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;the Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;. \nWalkthrough.\nThe Volcano Manor is one of the game's most complex locations. It can be reached in multiple ways and you can progress through from different directions.\nThe fastest, but most gimmicky way to reach it is by letting the &lt;a href=\"Abductor%20Virgin\"&gt;Abductor Virgin&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the Raya Lucaria Academy grapple you to death. You will still drop your runes, but be respawned right within the Volcano Manor area. From here there are two paths that are each a point of no return. One leading to the rest of the manor, the other brings you to the &lt;a href=\"Abductor%20Virgin\"&gt;Abductor Virgin&lt;/a&gt; duo bossfight and back to the &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. For the Abductor Virgin boss, search for the cave with multiple drop-down platforms. To progress deeper into the manor, jump down the lava waterfall. If you die here before reaching a grace, you will be respawned where the Abductor Virgin dropped you within Volcano Manor. From here you can explore the area, defeat the &lt;a href=\"Godskin%20Noble\"&gt;Godskin Noble&lt;/a&gt; and either make it back to the manor entrance with &lt;a href=\"Tanith\"&gt;Lady Tanith&lt;/a&gt; and the other npcs, or skip their quests and head straight to the gateway portal leading to &lt;a href=\"Praetor%20Rykard\"&gt;Praetor Rykard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe regular paths to enter the manor are either on foot/horseback across &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;, or to be teleported right to the Volcano Manor entrance grace by &lt;a href=\"Rya\"&gt;Rya&lt;/a&gt; once reaching the &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. You won't be able to reach the bosses or explore the rest of the area from here unless you accept Lady Tanith's offer to get the &lt;a href=\"Drawing-Room%20Key\"&gt;Drawing-Room Key&lt;/a&gt;. If you join the manor, a list of NPCs become available there: &lt;a href=\"Bernahl\"&gt;Bernahl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rya\"&gt;Rya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diallos%20Hoslow\"&gt;Diallos Hoslow&lt;/a&gt;. To get all the content out of the manor, you have to wait with fighting Rykard until reaching the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, so that you can do all of the following NPC invasions for the manor: &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight%20Istvan\"&gt;Old Knight Istvan&lt;/a&gt;, Rileigh the Idle, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Horned%20Tragoth\"&gt;Great Horned Tragoth&lt;/a&gt;, Vargram the Raging Wolf + Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm, &lt;a href=\"Juno%20Hoslow%2C%20Knight%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating Juno Hoslow, &lt;a href=\"Tanith\"&gt;Tanith&lt;/a&gt; offers to send you to Rykard, where you can then start the boss fight. Remember to complete &lt;a href=\"Rya\"&gt;Rya&lt;/a&gt;'s quest before defeating &lt;a href=\"Juno%20Hoslow%2C%20Knight%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise you'll be locked out of &lt;a href=\"Tanith\"&gt;Tanith&lt;/a&gt;'s dialogue regarding Rya."}

They take the form of large buildings mounted atop four legs, which wander around set areas throughout the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. Some Mausoleums have massive bells hanging from the undersides of their structures which can be heard from afar, ringing to constantly mourn its soulless demigods. Most have skull-like formations in their feet which disappear and release a small amount of &lt;a href=\"ghostflame\"&gt;ghostflame&lt;/a&gt; when hit.\nThey are often guarded by &lt;a href=\"Mausoleum%20Knight\"&gt;Mausoleum Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mausoleum%20Soldier\"&gt;Mausoleum Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s, who beheaded themselves in order to follow their masters into death, a self-inflicted curse that ties their spirits to the land. Their armor depicts the mausoleum bell, and the knights don wing-shaped ornamentations that evoke the &lt;a href=\"Deathbird\"&gt;Deathbird&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe shields of the Mausoleum Knights is emblazoned with the eclipsed sun, which is a symbol of the Mausoleums. The eclipse is the protective star of the soulless demigods and aids the Mausoleum Knights in keeping Destined Death at bay.\nMechanics.\nTo use mausoleums and do the process of Remembrance duplication, the player needs to enter a Wandering Mausoleum and interact with the headless corpse on the altar inside. Duplication can only be performed once per mausoleum. Remembrances belonging to &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;Shardbearers&lt;/a&gt; may only be duplicated at Wandering Mausoleums with bells, while all other Remembrances can be duplicated at any Wandering Mausoleum (as shown on the table below). Remembrances can be duplicated even after they have already been used. \nTypically, access to Wandering Mausoleums is granted by hitting the white skull-shaped forms found on the structure's feet, causing the Mausoleum to lower itself to a height where the player can climb onto them. In most cases, &lt;a href=\"Mausoleum%20Knight\"&gt;Mausoleum Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mausoleum%20Soldier\"&gt;Mausoleum Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Mausoleum%20Footsoldier\"&gt;Mausoleum Footsoldier&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn near the Wandering Mausoleums, serving as an additional obstacle to the player's access to the structures.\nLocations.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nWeeping Peninsula=\nWeeping Peninsula.\nA Wandering Mausoleum can be found on the western side of &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Peninsula\"&gt;Weeping Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, south-east of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Church%20of%20Marika\"&gt;Fourth Church of Marika&lt;/a&gt;. To gain entry, attack the skull-like deposits on its legs until they disappear, while avoiding its footfalls. Once enough have been destroyed, the Wandering Mausoleum will lower itself to the ground.\nLiurnia of the Lakes=\nLiurnia of the Lakes.\nFound to the north-east of the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt;, guarded by several groups of Mausoleum Soldiers and Knights. Since the skull deposits are located on the rocky plateau around the Mausoleum itself, the player must make use of a spirit spring to get on top of the Mausoleum in order to destroy them.\nLiurnia of the Lakes (Uld Palace Ruins)=\nLiurnia of the Lakes (Uld Palace Ruins).\nTwo Wandering Mausoleums can be found in the Uld Palace Ruins region in the east of Liurnia of the Lakes. Unlike every other Wandering Mausoleum, these two lack bells, and no Mausoleum Knights or Soldiers are found nearby. These are also the only Wandering Mausoleums where Remembrances which come from Shardbearer bosses cannot be duplicated. In addition to stomping, these Mausoleums can jump up in the air, creating a shockwave when they land which can damage the player.\nDeeproot Depths=\nDeeproot Depths.\nA single Wandering Mausoleum can be found in the north-western section of &lt;a href=\"Deeproot%20Depths\"&gt;Deeproot Depths&lt;/a&gt;, guarded by many Mausoleum Knights and Soldiers. The skull-like growths are all on the upper part of the structure, so the player must jump onto it from the large roots found nearby. \nMountaintops of the Giants =\nMountaintops of the Giants.\nA Wandering Mausoleum can be found outside &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Sol\"&gt;Castle Sol&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;. This Mausoleum is not guarded by Mausoleum Knights or Soldiers and the growths are all found on its legs, making it relatively easy to gain access to.\n Consecrated Snowfield =\nConsecrated Snowfield.\nA Wandering Mausoleum near the north-western tip of &lt;a href=\"Consecrated%20Snowfield\"&gt;Consecrated Snowfield&lt;/a&gt;, just south of the &lt;a href=\"Apostate%20Derelict\"&gt;Apostate Derelict&lt;/a&gt;.

The Fire Giants were considered neighbors by the astrologers who had also established themselves on the mountaintops.\nThe Giants borrowed a destructive, fiery power from a fell god, whose one-eyed visage manifested upon their chests, however the cost for this was eternal servitude as keepers of the flame of ruin, which resided within the forge of the Giants.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; vessel of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;, had begun to establish her reign over the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. The flame of ruin posed a threat to the burgeoning Erdtree, being capable of burning it, and thus needed to be neutralized. And so, Queen Marika and her consort &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%2C%20First%20Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Godfrey, First Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, marched upon the Mountaintops of the Giants\nThe War Against the Giants.\nThe war against the Giants, fought at the birth of the Erdtree, was led by Godfrey. They marched through the western Mountaintops, carving winding paths to the summit. Upon arriving in the Mountaintops, Queen Marika issued a proclamation to Godfrey and his warriors, commanding them to put the Giants to the sword and confine their flame, so that the Age of the Erdtree could begin. \nThe heroes of the Erdtree were accompanied by the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Monk\"&gt;Fire Monk&lt;/a&gt;s, who devised an &lt;a href=\"Flame%2C%20Protect%20Me\"&gt;incantation&lt;/a&gt; which could protect them from the Giants' flame. They were also joined by the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Hero%20of%20Zamor\"&gt;Knights of Zamor&lt;/a&gt;, who had been mortal enemies of the Fire Giants since time immemorial, having challenged them many times in the past. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s, who were descendants of the Giants, betrayed their ancestors and fought on behalf of the Erdtree. They were furnished with gilded swords to commemorate their fealty. \nThe Giants retaliated, using their bellowing roars to trigger avalanches and whip up storms of flame. Facing a Fire Giant was seen as a horror, thanks in part to their dreadful visages and the flames they wielded. Enormous, crushing weapons were deployed to counter their onslaught, and the heroes of the Erdtree strengthened their arms using semi-vitrified smithing stones found in the cold, northern regions.\nQueen Marika herself did battle with the one-eyed fell god, and it is believed to have been slain by her. In truth, the fell god continued to lurk within the Fire Giants themselves. Despite the odds, the champions of the Erdtree prevailed over the Fire Giants, leaving the battlefield littered with their corpses.\nAftermath.\nAlthough the Giants had been defeated, it became apparent that the flame of ruin would never die. Seeing this, Queen Marika marked a lone surviving &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giant\"&gt;Fire Giant&lt;/a&gt; with a curse, compelling him to tend to the flame for eternity. With the flame sealed away, the Fire Monks and &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Guardian\"&gt;Flame Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s were appointed to watch over it. They would later succumb to the allure of the flame, emblazoning their chestplates with depictions of the fell god.\nThe Knights of Zamor earned great renown for their actions during the war, and were hailed as heroes. They can be found in Hero's Graves, seemingly serving as guardians. The Trolls, despite their own efforts in the war, did not receive such recognition, and can often be found performing menial labour, working in mines or dragging carriages. \nThe end of the war marked the dawn of the era of the Erdtree, presided over by Queen Marika and Godfrey. The Erdtree itself would go on to become the embodiment of Order, its blessed sap dripping from its boughs. The age of plenty which ensued ended swiftly, however, and the Erdtree became more an object of faith.\nAlthough the flame of ruin was sealed, the burning of the Erdtree was considered to be the first cardinal sin. Prophets would occasionally glimpse the flame of ruin in their faith, envisioning the ruin that it would bring. Prophets who had such visions would be banished, forced to wear shackles around their necks to warn passersby against listening to them.\nSome time after &lt;a href=\"The%20Shattering\"&gt;The Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; would arrive in the Lands Between and meet &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious woman who would guide them along the path to become Elden Lord. Finding that the entrance to the Erdtree was obstructed by thorns, Melina advises the Tarnished that the only way to gain entry was to set the Erdtree aflame. The pair journey to the giant's forge, where the Tarnished fights and defeats the Fire Giant whom Marika had left to tend the Flame. Melina offers herself as kindling, and sets fire to the Erdtree using the fire that had long been sealed away."}

The dragon wrecked havoc upon the city and it was the first time the walls of Leyndell had fallen, marking the beginning of the War against the Ancient Dragons. \nBecause of Gransax's assault on the capital, this caused the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Sentinel\"&gt;Tree Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, the guardians of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, to have an epiphany; The only way to protect the Erdtree was to become &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s themselves. Thus, some of the Sentinels began to emulate the Ancient Dragons in order to provide proper protection for the Erdtree. They began wielding weapons and shields whittled from dragon claws and imbued with red &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;. From then on, these Tree Sentinels are referred to as &lt;a href=\"Draconic%20Tree%20Sentinel\"&gt;Draconic Tree Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s. \nWhile no other details of the war were revealed and disclosed, &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Queen Marika and Lord Godfrey, engaged in battle against &lt;a href=\"Lichdragon%20Fortissax\"&gt;Ancient Dragon Fortissax&lt;/a&gt;, who was known as the \"mightiest boulderstone\" for its usage of &lt;a href=\"Fortissax%27s%20Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;twin red lightning stakes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nFighting until the end, Godwyn triumphed over Fortissax before eventually befriending him. Gransax was killed during the war and his massive body lay in the Leyndell, with the capital becoming his final resting place. The fall of Gransax brought the conflict to an end while the Ancient Dragons were accepted into the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;. Through his friendship with Fortissax, Godwyn gained the ability to wield golden lightning. \nThe bond between Godwyn and Fortissax gave rise to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Ancient Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; in Leyndell. This was permitted by the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Gravel%20Stone\"&gt;Gravel Stone&lt;/a&gt; and lightning itself were imbued with gold. The &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon%20Lansseax\"&gt;Ancient Dragon Lansseax&lt;/a&gt;, the sister of Fortissax, was said to have assumed a human form as a priestess. The cultists devotedly worshipped the Ancient Dragons and studied their golden lightning incantations, although the red-hued incantations were taught in secrecy. Only those loved by the dragons could survive their lightning, &lt;a href=\"Vyke%20the%20Dragonspear\"&gt;Vyke the Dragonspear&lt;/a&gt; was most favored by Lansseax."}

{"id": "5420", "revid": "26479939", "url": "https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5420", "title": "Weapon Scaling", "text": "Scaling is a mechanic in Elden Ring. Most weapons possess scaling values, which cause the weapon's effectiveness to increase in accordance with an associated stat. Weapons can scale with Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Faith or Arcane. Scaling affinity with each stat is signified by a letter icon on the weapon's information.\nAttribute scaling impacts:\nScaling doesn't affect poise damage or stamina damage.\nScaling Values.\nThe letter grades that are used to represent a weapon's scaling affinity is only a rough guide of a weapon's potential. These grades are derived from a scaling value, which is an invisible number that determines the exact amount of damage you receive from scaling. The scaling values that each letter can represent are:\nThe formula for calculating a weapon's scaling damage is:\nformula_1\n\"Base damage\" is the damage of the weapon before any scaling is applied, and \"stat scaling\" is a value that is gained by increasing the relevant attribute. Increasing both of these values will also increase the bonus damage received from scaling, which means that a weapon with lower base damage but a higher scaling value will not necessarily gain more scaling. \nAttribute Requirements.\nMost weapons have a minimum requirement for each attribute they scale with. If that requirement is not met, anything that scales with that attribute receives no scaling, and instead takes a -40% penalty.\nFor example, the &lt;a href=\"Club\"&gt;Club&lt;/a&gt; has 103 base &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; Attack Power, and &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; scaling with a requirement of 10. A character with only 9 Strength would have 61 Physical Attack Power (103 - 42).\nStat Scaling.\nThis value increases as the associated stat increases, varying somewhat depending on if the used affinity is physical (Standard, Heavy, Keen, Quality, or Occult) or non-physical (Fire, Flame Art, Lightning, Sacred, Magic, Cold, Blood, or Poison). \nAs can be seen, for physical affinities the biggest increase is from increasing a stat from 10 to 20, before falling of bit-by-bit from 20 to 40, then 40 to 50, and then 50 to 80, until it finally slows down to a crawl from 80 to 99. \nFor non-physical affinities, however, the increase is more steady. It still falls of heavily after the 10 to 20 stretch but after that remains steady with the scaling (most notably reaching the same amount of scaling by 50 as physical affinities don't get until almost reaching 70) until reaching 50, where after the scaling slows down to less than half until the stat reaches 80 and halves against for the final stretch to reach 99. \nSpell tools (&lt;a href=\"Staves\"&gt;Staves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Seals\"&gt;Sacred Seals&lt;/a&gt;) uses one of three different scaling rates depending on whether or not they scale with only one stat, scales with more than one stat, or if it's the &lt;a href=\"Demi-Human%20Queen%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Demi-Human Queen's Staff&lt;/a&gt;. The exception to this is the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Death%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Prince of Death's Staff&lt;/a&gt; (PDS) which despite being a Staff that scales with more than one stat uses the more backloaded \"one stat\" scaling, making it require a large amount of both &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; to attain good results. \nMore specifically, those that scales with one stat (and the PDS) start strong and gain stronger scaling after reaching 25 in the stat and then again after reaching 60, until finally dropping off hard upon eventually reaching 80 in that stat. \nScaling with more than one stat initially scales rather poorly before skyrocketing to being much, much stronger in scaling for a stat upon getting to 15 in that stat until 30, were after it falls to more normal, \"one stat\" levels of scaling and then increases become insignificant after reaching 45 in that stat. \nThe Demi-Human Queen's Staff is effectively the inverse of regular \"one stat\" scaling with exceptional scaling prior to reaching 20 in &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and then being weaker until it reaches 40 and after that it becomes even weaker. \nIncreasing Scaling Values.\nAll weapons increase their scaling values by being upgraded. All weapons upgraded with &lt;a href=\"Somber%20Smithing%20Stones\"&gt;Somber Smithing Stones&lt;/a&gt; gain an extra 8% of their base scaling per upgrade level, while other weapons gain 2% by default.\nWeapons that can be infused with ashes of war can gain affinities which alter both the base damage and the scaling values, affecting how different stats increase scaling damage. There is no universal formula for how infusion changes the values of a weapon and different weapons are changed by an infusion in different, seemingly arbitrary ways."}

When &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;a Tarnished Champion&lt;/a&gt; happened upon the divine beast's resting place, Grandam assumed them to be one of Messmer's prodigies and ordered the divine beast to slay the Tarnished. It failed to do so, however, and was slain. The Tarnished can also encounter and slay the other divine beast while exploring Rauh, putting an end to the divine beasts.\nBoss Fight.\nPhase 1.\nThe Divine Beast will fight normally in it's first phase.\nPhase 2.\nAround 70% health, it will switch between three elements on a timed basis: Lightning, Ice, and Wind.

This method will also effectively give another 20,000 runes, making this an excellent place to use a &lt;a href=\"Gold-Pickled%20Fowl%20Foot\"&gt;Gold-Pickled Fowl Foot&lt;/a&gt; for more runes early on. \nMoveset.\nDecaying Ekzykes=\nBackground.\nA Dragon plagued by &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;scarlet rot&lt;/a&gt;, encountered north-west of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Dragon%20Communion\"&gt;Cathedral of Dragon Communion&lt;/a&gt;.

It involves the hunting of &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt;, the descendants of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, in pursuit of their &lt;a href=\"Gravel%20Stone\"&gt;gravel stone-covered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Heart\"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecifically, \"Dragon Communion\" is the act of consuming dragon hearts in order to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Communion%20Incantations\"&gt;draconic powers&lt;/a&gt; within. The hearts are consumed at a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Communion%20Altar\"&gt;Dragon Communion Altar&lt;/a&gt; which is usually in the presence of a fallen dragon.\nHistory.\nIn the distant past, the lord of the &lt;a href=\"ancient%20dragons\"&gt;ancient dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Placidusax\"&gt;Placidusax&lt;/a&gt;, was attacked by the great drake, &lt;a href=\"Bayle%20the%20Dread\"&gt;Bayle the Dread&lt;/a&gt;. Their clash ended in a stalemate and left both gravely injured, with Bayle fleeing the field of battle. As vengeance for Bayle's transgression, Placidusax had some of his followers take mortal forms as humanoid priestesses and travel to the lands of men, where they would beckon human warriors to their cause. They established the practice of dragon communion in order to hunt down and punish Bayle and his descendants, the drakes. The human warriors were lured to this cause with the promise of great power which could only be acquired by consuming the heart of a drake.\nAs time passed, the practice would continue without influence from the priestesses, however many practitioners would forget the original purpose of these hunts and would simply carry on consuming hearts in pursuit of personal gain. Some drakes have become aware of this practice, such as &lt;a href=\"Decaying%20Ekzykes\"&gt;Ekzykes the Decaying&lt;/a&gt;, who even after succumbing to &lt;a href=\"Malenia\"&gt;Malenia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;rot&lt;/a&gt; would never forget his hatred and thus keeps himself stationed at the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Dragon%20Communion\"&gt;Cathedral of Dragon Communion&lt;/a&gt;, so that he may kill or deter any would-be practitioners before they can reach the altar.\nMany practicioners develop a hunger for the hearts as they hunt, which becomes gradually intensifies the more hearts they devour. This leads many to commune without restraint, an act that has dire consequences for their humanity, as their bodies and minds gradually become more and more draconic. The end-result is transformation into &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Wyrm\"&gt;Magma Wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s, dragon-like creatures with pitifully small wings, incapable of flight and cursed to crawl the earth on their bellies until the end of their days. Ironically, this end often comes at the hands of their fellow communers as their own hearts are now a sufficient target for dragon communion as well.\nKnown Practitioners.\nThose who do not partake.\nThese are people who find satisfaction in the thrill hunting dragons, but abstain from consuming their hearts to avoid the risk of losing themselves.\nRelevant Items.\nItems related to or referencing Dragon Communion\nReferences.\n[[Category:Concepts]]\n[[Category:Dragon Communion| ]]\n[[Category:Lore]]"}

Above them all was Placidusax, a many-headed Ancient Dragon who ruled as &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt; from the royal city of Farum Azula.\nAt some point, Placiudsax was betrayed by one of his own; &lt;a href=\"Bayle%20the%20Dread\"&gt;Bayle the Dread&lt;/a&gt;. Bayle inflicted a grievous wound upon the Dragonlord before fleeing, eventually coming to reside in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. Placidusax had his servants shephard the humans into hunting Bayle and his brood, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt;, laying the foundations of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Communion\"&gt;Dragon Communion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Placidusax's god fled, the Dragonlord resolved to await its return, withdrawing to his seat at the heart of the storm beyond time. Farum Azula became a mausoleum enshrining Placidusax, guarded by chosen &lt;a href=\"Beastman%20of%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Beastmen&lt;/a&gt;. In his absence, the age of the Erdtree began under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;descendants&lt;/a&gt; of the Ancient Dragons became enfeebled, weak to the primeval lightning wielded by their forebears. Placidusax's Gravel Stone Scales were disseminated throughout the world, used as smithing stones said to allow for the creation of god-slaying weapons by lightly twisting time.\nDespite his stasis, Placidusax continued to grant blessings to his followers.\nA &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; eventually finds their way into Placidusax's seat at the heart of the storm while exploring Farum Azula in search of the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt;. They approach Placidusax, who attempts to ward off the intruder. Placidusax ultimately falls to the Tarnished interloper, dying without ever being reunited with their missing god.\nBoss Fight.\nPhase 1.\nPlacidusax will begin the fight by summoning a storm of red lightning bolts which rain down on the arena for a few seconds. During his first phase, he will primarily use lightning claw attacks if the player is in front, a slam attack with his wings if they are to either side, and a tail sweep if they get behind him. He also has fire breath attacks which cover a large area in front of or around him. He has an area of effect attack which involves summoning a large lightning bolt and thrusting it into the ground, creating a massive explosion after a short delay. When he performs this attack, the music will briefly get quieter and red waves will emanate from where the lightning bolt hits, providing an indicator for the range of the explosion.\nPhase 2.\nPlacidusax now gains the ability to disappear in a cloud of fog. If he floats into the air before doing so, he will reappear in a stationary or moving thundercloud above the arena, before emerging and diving down at the player. He also gains the ability to disappear and reappear in quick succession, unleashing attacks with his lightning claws in between. \nEnvironment.\nThe arena is a large, circular platform with pillars dotted around the outside. These can be destroyed by Placidusax's attacks. The size of the arena gives ample room to avoid his area of effect or dodge his divebomb attacks."}

His vision is of a curse he calls the \"pox upon life itself\" or the \"reviled blessing\", with everyone sustaining it in despair and their souls not being able to return to the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. He decided to wear a disfigured armor, resembling the &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;, representing the vision of the landscape of his mind, and his appearance as he wished to see it. He donned his armor with a heavy sun-shaped medallion to represent both the guidance and the ring he once saw.\nHe assumed he would personally curse all life himself, so he started indiscriminately killing people and defiling their corpses to nourish the pox. In each defilement, the Dung Eater cultivates a &lt;a href=\"Seedbed%20Curse\"&gt;Seedbed Curse&lt;/a&gt; on a corpse that prevents the dead soul to go to the Erdtree, leaving it forever cursed.\nHe was eventually captured and publicly hanged in front of an angry crowd, who strongly despise him for his vile crimes. However, killing the Dung Eater only resulted in his revival by grace as a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, so he was perpetually jailed in the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Depths\"&gt;Forsaken Depths&lt;/a&gt; below &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, the Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;.\nGame Events.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;The Tarnished (Protagonist)&lt;/a&gt; travels to the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;, an apparition of the Dung Eater is discovered within, resting and with his bloodlust quenched by his abidance of the pact of non-aggression; but should he feel the presence of his &lt;a href=\"Seedbed%20Curse\"&gt;Seedbed Curse&lt;/a&gt; within the player, he'll instruct to set his body free from the jail hidden away in the sewer below the capital, with the intention of fully cursing The Tarnished.\nIf The Dung Eater is released, he will attack and defile &lt;a href=\"Blackguard%20Big%20Boggart\"&gt;Blackguard Big Boggart&lt;/a&gt;, and will invade the player when they arrive at the scene. When defeated, Dung Eater will claim something unexpected happened, his blessing was warded off by the protagonist, despite the curse stirring within, a feat no one had succeeded in before. At which point he has a revelation: he was not the one who could curse the world as in his vision, that's The Tarnished. And the Dung Eater is just a means to get there, and should be doing what his moniker implies \u2014 his flesh is the one that must receive the blessing. And so, he tasks his flesh to be defiled with the seedbed curse again and again until &lt;a href=\"Mending%20Rune%20of%20the%20Fell%20Curse\"&gt;the ring he once saw&lt;/a&gt; coalesces and is able to defile Order itself, an act that would cost his life but that he would be proud of.\nThe player can choose to follow the Dung Eater's will, defiling his body unto a Mending Rune is created, and using it to bring a new age of despair in the &lt;a href=\"Endings\"&gt;end&lt;/a&gt;. The Tarnished may also choose to put a stop to his trail of blood by simply killing him in his jail, or to reduce the Dung Eater to a &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Eater%20Puppet\"&gt;mindless puppet&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Seluvis%27%20Potion\"&gt;Seluvis' Potion&lt;/a&gt;.

It was the vassal beast of the Greater Will and the living incarnation of the concept of Order. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Marika&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Numen\"&gt;Numen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt;, would became a goddess and the vessel of the Elden Ring and would establish the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; and rule over the Lands Between as the one true god. However, Marika would eventually shatter the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;, leading to her imprisonment inside the Erdtree. \nAfter untold hardships, a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt; fights their way into the Erdtree where they find the shackled Marika, and face &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt;, Marika's male \"other self\" and the reigning &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, the two of them sharing the same body. After his defeat, the Elden Beast emerges from Radagon, transforming Radagon's defeated body into a &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Relic%20Sword\"&gt;large sword&lt;/a&gt;, and faces the Tarnished.\nThe Tarnished manages to triumph, and with the Elden Beast defeated, they were free to usher in &lt;a href=\"Endings\"&gt;a new age of their choosing&lt;/a&gt;. \nBoss Fight.\nElden Beast is the second half of the final boss fight, with &lt;a href=\"Radagon%20of%20the%20Golden%20Order\"&gt;Radagon of the Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; as the first half. Unlike the former fight, it is possible to summon &lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;Torrent&lt;/a&gt; for this fight. \nMoveset.\nThe Elden Beast uses a combination of physical sword attacks and golden &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; attacks. It will regularly swim away from the player, or disappear underwater before emerging, meaning that the fight often requires one to chase after the Elden Beast. \nWhen its health reaches around 80% it will fly up into the air and create a golden ring which closes in on the player before exploding. This can be avoided by jumping over the ring as it closes in. It will also begin to use additional attacks, such as Elden Stars or Spear Showers.\nAt around 30% health, it will perform the Golden Ring attack again, but this time it will generate three rings that each close in on the player.\nStrategy.\nIts normal sword attacks are fairly easy to dodge, with perhaps the repeating stabs being an exception. \nThe Golden Rings can be jumped over to preserve your momentum and get out of them quicker, while the Spear Showers can be avoid by running while zig-zagging. \nElden Stars, if it cannot be interrupted by a stagger, is quite dangerous due to the consistent damage over time it can inflict and because it will gain speed to chase if allowed to travel with minimal turning. A way to fairly easily dodge it is to circle the Elden Beast counter-clockwise (that is, heading around it to your right before circling left to run out the duration. \nEnvironment.\nThe arena is a large, flat body of shallow water. Although it appears endless, the arena does have invisible walls surrounding it."}

It refers to individuals with great power who have stood before the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nThe title of Elden Lord was given to the consorts of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;. What power and authority the Elden Lord wields is unclear, as is the nature of the relationship between an Elden Lord and their deity. In the case of the consorts of Queen Marika, they appear to have been able to wield the power of the Elden Ring to an unknown extent.\nThe most ancient known holder of the title is &lt;a href=\"Dragonlord%20Placidusax\"&gt;Dragonlord Placidusax&lt;/a&gt;, said to have been Elden Lord in the time before the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%2C%20First%20Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; is referred to as the first Elden Lord, being the first consort of Queen Marika. After Godfrey was banished from the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;, King Consort &lt;a href=\"Radagon%20of%20the%20Golden%20Order\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt; left his wife &lt;a href=\"Rennala%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Full%20Moon\"&gt;Rennala&lt;/a&gt; and returned to &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt;, becoming Marika's second husband and taking the title of second Elden Lord.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of the Elden Ring, Marika and Radagon were both imprisoned within the Erdtree. The &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigods&lt;/a&gt;, tainted by the strength of their &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Runes&lt;/a&gt;, went to war over the title of Elden Lord, but none succeeded. Subsequently, the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; were called back to the Lands Between, guided by &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Grace&lt;/a&gt;, to seek the shards of the Elden Ring and claim the title of Elden Lord. \nIf &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;the Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; succeeds in accessing the Erdtree and opts to repair the Elden Ring, they will become Elden Lord, joining Marika as her consort. However, Marika is found in a shattered and unresponsive state, seemingly merely a shell containing the Elden Ring. The Tarnished may choose to imperfectly restore the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; and rule over an &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fracture\"&gt;Age of Fracture&lt;/a&gt;, or add one of three &lt;a href=\"Mending%20Runes\"&gt;Mending Runes&lt;/a&gt; to establish a &lt;a href=\"Endings\"&gt;new Age&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar Titles.\nCertain characters hold titles reminiscent of Elden Lord, often in the service of other powerful entities."}

It is the source of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, and its various interlocking runes are a representation of the law of the world. The most recent incarnation of the law it represents in the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, founded by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;. In its shattered state, many of its shards, known as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Rune\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt;s, are in the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; offspring of Queen Marika.\nOverview.\nThe Elden Ring is a mysterious concept that represents the law of the world. Long ago, the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt; sent a golden star to the Lands Between bearing an &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt;, which later became the Elden Ring. This beast was the vassal beast of the Greater Will, and the living embodiment of the concept of Order.\nThe appearance of the Elden Ring is made up of various interlocking shapes, known as \"&lt;a href=\"runes\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt;\", which have power over particular fundamental concepts that dictate reality in the Lands Between, such as \"Death.\" Under the Golden Order, the runes represent the concepts of order and discipline that the demigods enforced on the physical world. However, the Elden Ring has taken different appearances in the past in accordance with the laws of previous ages. One such depiction of the Elden Ring can be found in &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Crumbling Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt;. \nSpecial beings known as &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyreans&lt;/a&gt; are able to become the vessel of the Elden Ring, allowing them to become &lt;a href=\"gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;. At an unknown period in history, the Empyrean Marika became the vessel of the Elden Ring, becoming a god and establishing the Golden Order by confining the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt;, and began the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20the%20Erdtree\"&gt;Age of the Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. At some point after the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;, Marika shattered the Elden Ring, and its shards were claimed by her offspring, the Demigods. The current vessel of the Elden Ring is Queen Marika the Eternal.\nThe consort of an Empyrean takes the title of lord, the consorts of the vessel of the Elden Ring are known as &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;s. The first Elden Lord during the reign of Queen Marika was &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%2C%20First%20Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, who was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Radagon%20of%20the%20Golden%20Order\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt; following his &lt;a href=\"Long%20March\"&gt;banishment&lt;/a&gt; from the Lands Between. &lt;a href=\"Dragonlord%20Placidusax\"&gt;Dragonlord Placidusax&lt;/a&gt; was known to be Elden Lord in the age before the Erdtree.\nFor reasons unknown, Queen Marika used her &lt;a href=\"Marika%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Numen hammer&lt;/a&gt; to shatter the Elden Ring. Despite Radagon's attempts to repair it, the Demigods warred over the Elden Ring's shards in the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; war.\nTypes of Runes.\nSeveral of the runes that make up the Elden Ring have particular names.

The Tarnished earns an audience with the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, whose speaker, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Reader%20Enia\"&gt;Finger Reader Enia&lt;/a&gt;, informs the Tarnished that to access &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;, where the Erdtree is, they must hunt the &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigods&lt;/a&gt; for their &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Runes&lt;/a&gt;,\nAided by Gideon's knowledge, the Tarnished travels throughout the Lands Between to hunt the Demigods. These include the insane &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the Grafted&lt;/a&gt;, who rules over Limgrave in &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;his castle&lt;/a&gt; and is protected by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Margit%2C%20the%20Fell%20Omen\"&gt;Margit, the Fell Omen&lt;/a&gt;; the mentally broken &lt;a href=\"Rennala%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Full%20Moon\"&gt;Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon&lt;/a&gt;, who is locked inside the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;Starscourge Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, who was left feral and mindless after a battle with &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia, Blade of Miquella&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Rykard%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blasphemy\"&gt;Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy&lt;/a&gt;, who rules over &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor\"&gt;Volcano Manor&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, who has secretly kidnapped Malenia's brother, &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt;, and resides in &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Palace\"&gt;his hidden palace&lt;/a&gt;. \nAmong the allies that the Tarnished can make throughout their journey include &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt;, an outcast Demigod who wishes to overthrow the Golden Order and offers the Tarnished the option of serving her, &lt;a href=\"Nepheli%20Loux%2C%20Warrior\"&gt;Nepheli Loux&lt;/a&gt;, who can replace Godrick as Limgrave's ruler depending on the Tarnished's actions; &lt;a href=\"Millicent\"&gt;Millicent&lt;/a&gt;, a girl with a mysterious connection to Malenia, and &lt;a href=\"Fia%2C%20Deathbed%20Companion\"&gt;Fia&lt;/a&gt;, a servant of the deceased &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt; who seeks to enshroud the lands in Death. After gathering at least two Great Runes, the Tarnished is able to enter Leyndell with Melina, and makes their way to &lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott, the Omen King&lt;/a&gt;, the demigod guarding the entrance to the Erdtree and Margit's true identity. After besting a shade of Morgott's father, &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%2C%20First%20Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Godfrey, First Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, the Tarnished reaches Morgott and defeats him. As he dies, Morgott reveals that the Erdtree itself wards off all who approach with impentrable thorns, making the Elden Ring's repair impossible. \nHowever, Melina knows of a way to burn the thorns: using the legendary Flame of Ruin, which is held deep inside the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; and guarded by the endling &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giant\"&gt;Fire Giant&lt;/a&gt;. The Tarnished also has the option of harnessing the equally powerful but extremely dangerous Frenzied Flame, hidden deep with Leyndell's sewers, an option that Melina firmly and repeatedly warns against. En route to the Fire Giant, the Tarnished can assemble a &lt;a href=\"Haligtree%20Secret%20Medallion%20%28Right%29\"&gt;secret&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Haligtree%20Secret%20Medallion%20%28Left%29\"&gt;medallion&lt;/a&gt; that will lead them to &lt;a href=\"Consecrated%20Snowfield\"&gt;Consecrated Snowfield&lt;/a&gt;, where they can gain access to &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella's Haligtree&lt;/a&gt; and slay Malenia within.\nUpon defeating the Fire Giant, if the Tarnished did not obtain the Frenzied Flame, Melina will use the Flame of Ruin to sacrifice herself to set the Erdtree on fire. If the Tarnished did obtain the Frenzied Flame, Melina will abandon the Tarnished, forcing them to use the Frenzied Flame to set the Erdtree on fire. Regardless of the method, the fire is not enough to burn away the thorns; for commiting the \"cardinal sin\" of burning the Erdtree, however, the Tarnished is transported to &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Crumbling Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt;. Inside is the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"Destined Death\", which the Tarnished can use to fuel the fire. The Tarnished eventually locates the Rune of Death's keeper, &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%2C%20the%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;Maliketh, the Black Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and slays him in battle for the rune. \nThe fire is enough to both burn away the thorns and destroy the entire capital of Leyndell. The Tarnished returns to the Erdtree, where they are confronted by a traitorious Gideon, who believes that is &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;'s will that nobody should claim the Elden Thone, and then the real Godfrey, who seeks vengeance against his son's killer. After defeating Gideon and Godfrey, the Tarnished is finally able to enter the Erdtree, where they are challenged by first &lt;a href=\"Radagon%20of%20the%20Golden%20Order\"&gt;Radagon of the Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, Marika's consort co-inhabitating their body, and then by the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt;, the Elden Ring's guardian. After both are vanquished, the Tarnished finds the remnants of the Elden Ring on Radagon's corpse. Depending on the Tarnished's actions throughout the game, six different endings can then be achieved. These include the Tarnished becoming Elden Lord, the Elden Ring being destroyed by Ranni, or the Tarnished becoming Lord of the Frenzied Flame and destroying the Lands Between. In the latter scenario, if Melina survived, she will vow to bring \"Destined Death\" to them.\nShadow of the Erdtree.\nAfter defeating Mohg in his palace, the Tarnished finds a comatose Miquella in a cocoon. Touching his hand, the Tarnished is transported into the &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Land of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, where they set out to hunt Miquella and claim his Great Rune. &lt;a href=\"Needle%20Knight%20Leda\"&gt;Needle Knight Leda&lt;/a&gt;, leader of a band of Miquella's followers, assumes that the Tarnished has come to serve Miquella and explains that the Land of Shadow, where Marika first ascended to godhood, has been devastated by the forces of demigod &lt;a href=\"Messmer%20the%20Impaler\"&gt;Messmer the Impaler&lt;/a&gt; under Marika's orders. The Tarnished also learns that Miquella shredded his body to enter the Land of Shadow, resulting in Miquella discarding both his &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Great%20Rune\"&gt;his Great Rune&lt;/a&gt; (which the Tarnished can retrieve from the monstrous &lt;a href=\"Scadutree%20Avatar\"&gt;Scadutree Avatar&lt;/a&gt;) and his emotions. The forsaking of his Great Rune breaks a spell over Miquella's followers, who were in fact brainwashed by Miquella to serve him.\nInvestigating the Land of Shadow, the Tarnished can journey into a deep fissure and find Miquella's discarded half, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Trina\"&gt;St. Trina&lt;/a&gt;, who reveals Miquella's plan to ascend into Godhood and urges the Tarnished to kill the corrupted demigod. The Tarnished can also help the scavenger &lt;a href=\"Igon\"&gt;Igon&lt;/a&gt; take revenge against &lt;a href=\"Bayle%20the%20Dread\"&gt;Bayle the Dread&lt;/a&gt;, a dragon who had mortally wounded him; put down &lt;a href=\"Midra%2C%20Lord%20of%20Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Midra&lt;/a&gt;, a failed candidate for Lord of the Frenzied Flame who endures perpetual suffering to keep the Flame at bay; slay Messmer's lieutenants, including &lt;a href=\"Rellana%2C%20Twin%20Moon%20Knight\"&gt;Rellana, Twin Moon Knight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gaius\"&gt;Commander Gaius&lt;/a&gt;; and help &lt;a href=\"Count%20Ymir\"&gt;Count Ymir&lt;/a&gt; uncover the mysteries of the Two Fingers. Eventually, the Tarnished storms Messmer's stronghold, the Shadow Keep, and successfully slays the demigod in combat. While preparing to use Messmer's kindling to set the &lt;a href=\"sealing%20tree\"&gt;sealing tree&lt;/a&gt; on fire and pave the way to Miquella's location, the Tarnished learns that Miquella had, in fact, bewitched Mohg into kidnapping him and plans to use Mohg's corpse as a vessel for his \"consort\"\nAfter setting the &lt;a href=\"sealing%20tree\"&gt;sealing tree&lt;/a&gt; on fire, the Tarnished is confronted by Leda, who has deduced the Tarnished's true intentions and remains a loyal follower to Miquella. After killing Leda and her allies, the Tarnished reaches the top of Miquella's stronghold, Enir-Ilim, where they find his consort, Radahn. Having sent Malenia to kill Radahn, whom he had considered a worthy consort, Miquella waited until Radahn's soul traveled to the Land of Shadows after his death, then inserted Radahn's soul into Mohg's corpse and revived the Starscourge in his prime physical state. Confronting Radahn and Miquella, the Tarnished engages them in a brutal battle that ends with the two demigods slain, preventing Miquella's \"Age of Compassion\" from coming to pass.\nGameplay.\nThe player's character is made from scratch. Players can level up at checkpoints using obtained currency.\nSummoning &lt;a href=\"spirits\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; is a core component to the gameplay. The spirits can be acquired, leveled up, and upgraded in different ways. The spirits can take on a variety of forms.\nThe game is open-world, but features six critical \"legacy dungeons\" that feature &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;, fog gates, and various secrets. These areas are gated-off from the open world. The dungeons can be completed in any order for the most part, but they cannot head directly to the final dungeon.\nIn the open world itself, the player can ride their &lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;spirit steed&lt;/a&gt;, and teleport to obtained &lt;a href=\"Sites%20of%20Grace\"&gt;checkpoints&lt;/a&gt;, along with discovering mini-dungeons and field bosses.\nCo-op play is available.\nDevelopment.\nAs a fan of George R.R. Martin's work, Hidetaka Miyazaki contacted him with an offer to work together on a project. Martin was given full creative freedom to write the backstory and foundation for the game's universe. Elden Ring began development in 2017 after the release of the final DLC for Dark Souls III. Elden Ring was announced at E3 2019. The soundtrack was composed by Yuka Kitamura, who has composed songs for other FromSoftware games."}

It will not dictate equipment or quest choices, only highlight the options. It will also not specifically mention every item or other minor details.\nStep 1: &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Anticipation\"&gt;Chapel of Anticipation&lt;/a&gt;.\nSelect whatever starting class and item you want. For more character statistics details, see &lt;a href=\"Stats%20and%20Attributes\"&gt;Stats and Attributes&lt;/a&gt;.\nExit the chapel and head downstairs to the open plaza with a large statue. You will be attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Grafted%20Scion\"&gt;Grafted Scion&lt;/a&gt;. You likely can't beat this boss yet and even if you do, you will just fall off a cliff shortly thereafter.\nStep 2: &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou wake up in the Stranded Graveyard. The game automatically hands you the flasks for HP and FP restoration.\nIn front of the spirit on a chair is a cave that you can jump down to. That's the tutorial area. Once you complete it, you will end up back at the spirit on the chair. Now head upstairs and ascend with the elevator, then go outside.\nYou'll be greeted by &lt;a href=\"White-Faced%20Varr%C3%A9\"&gt;White-Faced Varr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. You can talk to him for some exposition or just ignore him. Activate the Site of Grace, then sneak past the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Sentinel\"&gt;Tree Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; knight uphill to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Elleh\"&gt;Church of Elleh&lt;/a&gt;, where you will find the merchant &lt;a href=\"Kal%C3%A9\"&gt;Kal\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and another grace. If you can, buy the crafting kit from Kal\u00e9.\nNext travel through the forest to the north-west. You'll arrive at a soldier camp. Clear it or skip it, then pick up the Limgrave Map at the street and activate the nearby Gatefront Ruins grace. &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt; will show up. Simply accept her accord, you can't beat the game without it anyway. Melina will give you the Spectral Steed Whistle for &lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;Torrent&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse Torrent to travel south-east along the road up until you hear an npc speak. That npc is &lt;a href=\"Boc\"&gt;Boc&lt;/a&gt; and he is camouflaged as a bush. Attack or roll into the bush and talk to Boc. He'll tell you about a cave at the shore south-west of the church where you met Kale. We'll go there soon.\nFor now we want to go further east, across the bridge that is going to be occupied by a &lt;a href=\"Night%27s%20Cavalry\"&gt;Night's Cavalry&lt;/a&gt;. Either wait until morning at a grace or sneak past it, because it is unlikely that you can defeat it yet.\nFollow the road down up until you see a bunch of ruins on a hill to the north-east. Make your way past the giant plants and down into the cellar, where there is a &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Pumpkin%20Head\"&gt;Mad Pumpkin Head&lt;/a&gt; miniboss. Defeat it and activate the grace. In the room at the end of the cellar is &lt;a href=\"Sellen\"&gt;Sellen&lt;/a&gt;. You can buy some sorcery &lt;a href=\"Spells\"&gt;Spells&lt;/a&gt; from her should you need any, but it is preferable to spend your &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt; on leveling up.\nProceed further down the road to the southern end of the lake. There will be the Agheel Lake South Site of Grace at the foot of the hill, not far from where there is a &lt;a href=\"Teardrop%20Scarab\"&gt;Teardrop Scarab&lt;/a&gt; with the in the lake. Travel west to the large ruin. Beneath it is &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Finger%20Hunter%20Yura\"&gt;Bloody Finger Hunter Yura&lt;/a&gt;. Relevant for casters: east of the Agheel Lake site of grace is an enemy camp with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20House%20Scroll\"&gt;Royal House Scroll&lt;/a&gt;.\nYura will warn you of a dragon in the lake. We will cross the lake regardless, but avoid the dragon for now by sticking to the cliff on the west end of the lake. Travel all the way north-west in the lake to the mining cave. Skip the crab enemies, none of them are worth fighting.\nClear the entire mining cave. The yellow stones on the walls are free Smithing Stones, pick them up. At the end of the cave is a &lt;a href=\"Stonedigger%20Troll\"&gt;Stonedigger Troll&lt;/a&gt; miniboss. Defeat it.\nNow warp back to the Church of Elleh and use the anvil there to upgrade your weapon to +3. Should you have missed some Smithing Stone 1s in the cave, you can buy a few more from the merchant at the shore south-west. Buy the crafting kit if you haven't already. Use any remaining Runes to level up. \nNow travel to the north-west. There is a dungeon inside of the cliff with a watchdog miniboss at the end. Clear it and use the runes to level up.\nNext go down to the shore mentioned earlier and visit Boc in the Demi-human cave, not far from where the merchant is. Talk to Boc, then defeat the miniboss in the cave to reclaim his sewing needle and give it to him. You can also proceed past the miniboss arena to the small island in the south, where there is a grace in front of the Church of Dragon Communication.\nRelevant for melee users: it is now worth picking up &lt;a href=\"Armorer%27s%20Cookbook%201\"&gt;Armorer's Cookbook 1&lt;/a&gt; from a small enemy camp north-east of the Gatefront Ruins, west of the bridge. It can be used to craft &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Grease\"&gt;Fire Grease&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarp to the Waypoint Ruins with Sellen, but now travel north instead of south and follow the road to the north-east. There will be the Mistwood Outskirts grace on the right-hand side. On top of another large ruin similar to the one you found Yura beneath will be &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Haight\"&gt;Kenneth Haight&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to him, then follow the road again until you reach the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Church%20of%20Marika\"&gt;Third Church of Marika&lt;/a&gt;. Here you'll find your &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Wondrous%20Physick\"&gt;Flask of Wondrous Physick&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Tear\"&gt;Sacred Tear&lt;/a&gt; to upgrade your regular flasks at the grace. Melina will also offer some lore when talked to at the grace here.\nFollow the path again up until you see the Minor Erdtree. Kill the &lt;a href=\"Teardrop%20Scarab\"&gt;Teardrop Scarab&lt;/a&gt; on the way up for the and pick up the Crystal Tears from a bowl behind the Minor Erdtree. Then return to the path and keep riding south until you reach &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Haight\"&gt;Fort Haight&lt;/a&gt;. Activate the grace at the foot of the hill called Fort Haight West, then clear the entire fort. Relevant for melee users: you'll find the &lt;a href=\"Nomadic%20Warrior%27s%20Cookbook%206\"&gt;Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook 6&lt;/a&gt; here, which lets you craft &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Grease\"&gt;Blood Grease&lt;/a&gt;. Fort Haight is also a good spot to farm Blood Roses for it. Once you have beaten the knight that drops and picked up one half of the Dectus Medallion from the tower, return to &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Haight\"&gt;Kenneth Haight&lt;/a&gt; and report your victory.\nReturn to &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Elleh\"&gt;Church of Elleh&lt;/a&gt; and talk to &lt;a href=\"Kal%C3%A9\"&gt;Kal\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. He'll tell you about &lt;a href=\"Blaidd\"&gt;Blaidd&lt;/a&gt; and give you the Fingersnap &lt;a href=\"Gestures\"&gt;Gesture&lt;/a&gt;. Return to the Mistwood Ruins and use it there, at the ruin with the large &lt;a href=\"Runebear\"&gt;Runebear&lt;/a&gt; inside. Talk to Blaidd, then warp to the Agheel Lake South grace. Travel uphill to the Forlorn Hound Evergaol and defeat &lt;a href=\"Bloodhound%20Knight%20Darriwil\"&gt;Bloodhound Knight Darriwil&lt;/a&gt;. You can summon Blaidd here if you so choose.\nLevel up again and travel all the way north through the lake, to the river beneath the bridge where the Night's Cavalry patrols. You will be invaded by an NPC here and Yura will come to your aid. Defeat the invader, then go all the way north to find Yura beneath the rock formation. Talk to him there, then go back south a little and enter the Murkwater Cave in the cliff to the east. Here you'll find &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt;. \nNow warp back to the Gatefront Ruins.\nStep 3: &lt;a href=\"Stormhill\"&gt;Stormhill&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollow the path to the north-west up until you arrive at the Stormhill Shack. Pick up the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Seed\"&gt;Golden Seed&lt;/a&gt;, unlock the grace and upgrade your flask. Then talk to &lt;a href=\"Roderika\"&gt;Roderika&lt;/a&gt; in the Shack. Now travel all the way east to the &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%27s%20Shack\"&gt;Warmaster's Shack&lt;/a&gt;. Here you'll meet &lt;a href=\"Bernahl\"&gt;Bernahl&lt;/a&gt;. You can also farm infinite &lt;a href=\"Root%20Resin\"&gt;Root Resin&lt;/a&gt; here for Blood/Fire Grease.\nContinue further east until you can climb uphill to the &lt;a href=\"Deathtouched%20Catacombs\"&gt;Deathtouched Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. You'll meet &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Fist%20Alexander\"&gt;Iron Fist Alexander&lt;/a&gt; on the way there. Clear the catacombs, return to the road and travel further east to &lt;a href=\"Summonwater%20Village\"&gt;Summonwater Village&lt;/a&gt;. You'll meet &lt;a href=\"D%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;D (NPC)&lt;/a&gt; on the way. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Tibia%20Mariner\"&gt;Tibia Mariner&lt;/a&gt; and talk to D in the village. You can pick up the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Turtle%20Talisman\"&gt;Green Turtle Talisman&lt;/a&gt; here from an underground room. Level up, then warp to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Church%20of%20Marika\"&gt;Third Church of Marika&lt;/a&gt; and use the hidden gateway portal north of it in the lake. D should have made a marker for it on your map. It will warp you all the way to &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt;. Don't bother with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20Kindred\"&gt;Black Blade Kindred&lt;/a&gt;, it will oneshot you since you are severely underleveled for this area. Simply enter the &lt;a href=\"Bestial%20Sanctum\"&gt;Bestial Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; and talk to the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Clergyman\"&gt;Beast Clergyman&lt;/a&gt;. If you so choose, you can also travel south from here to pick up another Golden Seed and farm the &lt;a href=\"Vulgar%20Militia\"&gt;Vulgar Militia&lt;/a&gt; enemies for Runes, they are relatively weak and drop around 1000 each. This is the best spot for Rune farming early game.\nWarp back to the Stormveil Shack in &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;, then follow the road north. Kill the Teardrop Scarab for on the way. Run past the enemies, unlock the Castleward Tunnel grace and talk to Melina. You can attempt to fight the boss here, but are unlikely to be able to defeat it yet unless you farmed the Vulgar Militia enemies.\nFirst warp back to the Warmaster's Shack and ride up the hill to the north, then all the way to the cliff in the east to pick up the &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Talisman\"&gt;Lance Talisman&lt;/a&gt;. It will help you a lot when fighting large enemies on horseback. Now return to the Agheel Lake grace and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Dragon%20Agheel\"&gt;Flying Dragon Agheel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, level up and travel south from the lake through the ravine and over the bridge.\nStep 4: &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Peninsula\"&gt;Weeping Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nRun past the enemies on the Bridge of Sacrifice, then unlock the grace with the same name to your right. A little further south beneath a bridge is &lt;a href=\"Irina\"&gt;Irina&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to her and accept her request to deliver a letter to her father, &lt;a href=\"Edgar\"&gt;Edgar&lt;/a&gt;. Continue further south until you find a merchant next to the Castle Morne Rampart grace. Head a little further south to where a giant will shoot arrows at you. Don't approach him yet, simply pick up the Golden Seed on the hill and travel back to the north-west until you arrive at the South of the Lookout Tower grace. Ride west through the Demi-human Forest until you cross a bridge, then travel north to the Church of Pilgrimage. Pick up another &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Tear\"&gt;Sacred Tear&lt;/a&gt; for your flask, then ride south to the Minor Erdtree and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Avatar\"&gt;Erdtree Avatar&lt;/a&gt; there.\nAfterwards, keep traveling south-west until you see the &lt;a href=\"Walking%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Walking Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;. Ride towards it and then uphill to the west until you arrive at the Fourth Church of Marika. You can talk to Melina again here and pick up another Sacred Tear. Near the church to the north is an Evergaol miniboss and a poison filled cave. Clear them if you want, otherwise just travel south past the Witchbane Ruins until you arrive at the Isolated Merchant's Shack. The merchant here sells a couple relevant items, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Lantern\"&gt;Lantern&lt;/a&gt;. If you are short on runes, simply warp to Caelid, kill two Vulgar Militiamen and warp back.\nNow warp to the Castle Morne Rampart grace with the merchant again and ride south towards the giant that fired arrows at you earlier. Defeat him and continue into Castle Morne. Activate the grace, then go up the elevator. You can pick up some items here or just run past all the enemies to the ladder in the back. Explore the area until you find &lt;a href=\"Edgar\"&gt;Edgar&lt;/a&gt;. Give him Irina's letter, then explore the southern end of the Castle, unlock the grace there and jump down several platforms until you arrive at the shore and activate the grace here as well. \nAt the shore is a boss fog with the &lt;a href=\"Leonine%20Misbegotten\"&gt;Leonine Misbegotten&lt;/a&gt;. The key to defeating this enemy is figuring out how you can stun it, since it will be attacking non-stop otherwise and hits relatively hard. For most melee weapons, that means having to wait for an opening to use heavy attacks. It drops the &lt;a href=\"Grafted%20Blade%20Greatsword\"&gt;Grafted Blade Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; when defeated, which is the legendary weapon that Edgar was talking about. Report back to Edgar and visit Irina at the Bridge of Sacrifice.\nClear up the remaining optional bosses. Return to Limgrave and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Sentinel\"&gt;Tree Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, then also the &lt;a href=\"Night%27s%20Cavalry\"&gt;Night's Cavalry&lt;/a&gt; on the bridge, as well as the Night's Cavalry near the merchant in the central Weeping Peninsula.\nStep 5: &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpend all your remaining Runes to buy &lt;a href=\"Margit%27s%20Shackle\"&gt;Margit's Shackle&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt; (or just farm Militiamen for it), then warp to the Castleward Tunnel grace. It is time to fight &lt;a href=\"Margit%20the%20Fell%20Omen\"&gt;Margit the Fell Omen&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegardless of whether or not you beat Margit on your first try, Melina will now warp you to the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt; the next time you sit at a grace, if she hasn't done so already. Speak to every npc there, but don't hold on to Fia's &lt;a href=\"Baldachin%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Baldachin's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;. Now wait until night-time and warp to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Elleh\"&gt;Church of Elleh&lt;/a&gt;, where you will meet &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Princess%20Ranni\"&gt;Lunar Princess Ranni&lt;/a&gt;. She gives you the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Calling%20Bell\"&gt;Spirit Calling Bell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lone%20Wolf%20Ashes\"&gt;Lone Wolf Ashes&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you still can't seem to defeat Margit, you can skip ahead to Step 6 and return to Stormveil Castle a little later.\nAfter defeating Margit, you will arrive at the Stormveil Main Gate and meet &lt;a href=\"Gostoc\"&gt;Gostoc&lt;/a&gt; the Gatekeeper. Have him open the main gate for you, then proceed past the hole in the wall next to Gostoc regardless. You can backtrack at specific points to confront Gostoc about stalking you. If you don't do this twice, he will keep stealing a portion of your dropped Runes every time you die within &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Gostoc will also lock you in a room with a &lt;a href=\"Banished%20Knight\"&gt;Banished Knight&lt;/a&gt;, where the Rusty Key is. After acquiring the Rusty Key, you can talk to Gostoc again at the main gate and buy items from him. If you enjoy &lt;a href=\"Parrying\"&gt;Parrying&lt;/a&gt; enemies early game, it is highly recommended to buy the &lt;a href=\"Buckler\"&gt;Buckler&lt;/a&gt; from him. Do not kill Gostoc.\nExplore all of Stormveil Castle until you have met both &lt;a href=\"Rogier\"&gt;Rogier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nepheli%20Loux\"&gt;Nepheli Loux&lt;/a&gt;. There is going to be another &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Seed\"&gt;Golden Seed&lt;/a&gt; not far from where you find Nepheli. You can also fight an optional &lt;a href=\"Ulcerated%20Tree%20Spirit\"&gt;Ulcerated Tree Spirit&lt;/a&gt; miniboss, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Grafted%20Scion\"&gt;Grafted Scion&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20Knight\"&gt;Crucible Knight&lt;/a&gt; in the castle. Once done with everything, it is time to fight &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the Grafted&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter defeating Godrick, pick up the &lt;a href=\"Shabriri%20Grape\"&gt;Shabriri Grape&lt;/a&gt; from the room beneath the Stormveil Castle throne room and exit the castle to the north.\nStep 6: &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;.\nTouch the Lake-Facing Cliffs grace and talk to both &lt;a href=\"Hyetta\"&gt;Hyetta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boc\"&gt;Boc&lt;/a&gt; there. Give Hyetta the Shabriri Grape you just picked up. Then meet &lt;a href=\"Thops\"&gt;Thops&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Irith\"&gt;Church of Irith&lt;/a&gt;. Travel down into the lake and touch the Liurnia Lake Shore grace next to the merchant. He sells more Smithing Stones, should you need any. \nImmediately north-west of the merchant is the Malefactor's Evergaol that you can jump up to with a Spiritspring Jump on horseback from the lake. Defeat &lt;a href=\"Adan%20Thief%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Adan Thief of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and travel further north into the lake. Touch the Laskyar Ruins grace and rest, then travel straight east to the Purified Ruins where Hyetta is standing at the shore. You probably don't have another Shabriri Grape for her yet, so just travel north-east from there and touch the Liurnia Highway North grace. You can travel south-east from here to the Cliffbottom Catacombs, but it is not important.\nFirst go back into the lake and travel north from the Laskyar Ruins to where you can pick up them map. You can find &lt;a href=\"Rya\"&gt;Rya&lt;/a&gt; nearby at a pavilion. Accept her request to retrieve her necklace, then travel west to the Scenic Isle, where you'll run into &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt; again. He isn't the guy who stole her necklace however. Travel directly north from where you met Patches to the Boilprawn Shack where &lt;a href=\"Blackguard%20Big%20Boggart\"&gt;Blackguard Big Boggart&lt;/a&gt; resides. He has her necklace, but won't give it to you unless you give him 1000 Runes. He has his own little quest, so killing him is not recommended. Rather just unlock the Boilprawn Shack grace and fast travel to the Dragonbarrow again to kill a Vulgar Militia, then buy it from him.\nRide north to the Academy Gate Town and unlock the grace there, then continue further north to meet &lt;a href=\"Diallos%20Hoslow\"&gt;Diallos Hoslow&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to him and ride far into the west until you arrive at either the Rose Church or the Temple Quarter. &lt;a href=\"White-Faced%20Varr%C3%A9\"&gt;White-Faced Varr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; will be at the Rose Church and hand you some &lt;a href=\"Festering%20Bloody%20Finger\"&gt;Festering Bloody Finger&lt;/a&gt;s for PvP invasions. You have to use them to continue his quest, although the only thing you get for doing it are PvP items and &lt;a href=\"Varr%C3%A9%27s%20Bouquet\"&gt;Varr\u00e9's Bouquet&lt;/a&gt; very late into the game. If you have found enough &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20Stone%202\"&gt;Smithing Stone 2&lt;/a&gt;s to upgrade your weapons again, now is the time.\nRide further west from there and go back on land, then find the &lt;a href=\"Revenger%27s%20Shack\"&gt;Revenger's Shack&lt;/a&gt; Site of Grace, south of the Cuckoo's Evergaol. Defeat &lt;a href=\"Edgar\"&gt;Edgar&lt;/a&gt;, then bring his &lt;a href=\"Shabriri%20Grape\"&gt;Shabriri Grape&lt;/a&gt; to Hyetta at the Purified Ruins. You can also pick up the third Shabriri Grape from the ruins further uphill.\nWarp back to the Revenger's Shack and then travel south to the Minor Erdtree to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Avatar\"&gt;Erdtree Avatar&lt;/a&gt; there and north to defeat &lt;a href=\"Bols%2C%20Carian%20Knight\"&gt;Bols, Carian Knight&lt;/a&gt; at the Evergaol, in whatever order you want. Warp to the Boilprawn Shack and ride south-west to the poison-swamp part of the lake. Meet &lt;a href=\"Nepheli%20Loux\"&gt;Nepheli Loux&lt;/a&gt; at the village and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Omenkiller\"&gt;Omenkiller&lt;/a&gt; with or without her.\nLevel up and ride north-east from the Cuckoo's Evergaol. Defeat &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Dragon%20Smarag\"&gt;Glintstone Dragon Smarag&lt;/a&gt; and pick up the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Glintstone%20Key\"&gt;Academy Glintstone Key&lt;/a&gt;. Travel north-east from there and clear the Academy Crystal Cave, at the bottom of the cliff on the western side of the academy.\nThen ride all the way around the academy to the north-eastern end of the lake, directly east of the large broken bridge, and enter the &lt;a href=\"Raya%20Lucaria%20Crystal%20Tunnel\"&gt;Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;. Clear the dungeon for the &lt;a href=\"Smithing-Stone%20Miner%27s%20Bell%20Bearing\"&gt;Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing&lt;/a&gt; [1] and a bunch of different Smithing Stones along the way. Upgrade your weapons again, then warp to the Academy Gate Town and enter the academy from there.\nStep 7: Academy of Raya Lucaria.\nTouch the grace, then run past the seal to the north out onto the bridge. You'll find a red summon sign for &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Finger%20Hunter%20Yura\"&gt;Bloody Finger Hunter Yura&lt;/a&gt;'s quest. Complete the invasion and talk to Yura at the bridge.\nPast the seal to the south is merchant hidden among the trees and even further down the path a &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Dew\"&gt;Celestial Dew&lt;/a&gt; guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Bloodhound%20Knight\"&gt;Bloodhound Knight&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnter the elevator next to the grace and fight your way through the academy. Once near the boss fog, use &lt;a href=\"Margit%27s%20Shackle\"&gt;Margit's Shackle&lt;/a&gt; to remove illusory walls and pick up some hidden items. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wolf%20of%20Radagon\"&gt;Red Wolf of Radagon&lt;/a&gt; and level up again.\nGo outside to where the Abductor Virgin patrols a plaza, but run upstairs and jump down a railing onto another set of stairs. Kill the mages, go downstairs and open the door for a shortcut, then go upstairs again and jump down onto the rooftops. Descend from there until you reach the Church of the Cuckoo. Enter the building through a window and position yourself on the wooden beams to jump down onto the chandelier that holds an item. It's the second &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Glintstone%20Key\"&gt;Academy Glintstone Key&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Thops\"&gt;Thops&lt;/a&gt;. Then jump over to the upper level and kick down the ladder for a shortcut. Go outside from the upper level and descend from there to kill a crystal crab, which drops the &lt;a href=\"Twinsage%20Glintstone%20Crown\"&gt;Twinsage Glintstone Crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow return to the Debate Parlor where you fought the Red Wolf and run across the plaza to the rafters. Jump over to the bridge and dodge the giant rolling globes. Defeat &lt;a href=\"Moongrum%2C%20Carian%20Knight\"&gt;Moongrum, Carian Knight&lt;/a&gt; and head to the east to unlock a shortcut by opening a door. Then take the gateway portal to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Church of Vows&lt;/a&gt; and touch the grace there. Return to the Debate Parlor again and make your way to the elevator where you defeated Moongrum and ascend to the Grand Library, where you have to fight and defeat &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Rennala\"&gt;Queen Rennala&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarp back to the Church where you met &lt;a href=\"Thops\"&gt;Thops&lt;/a&gt; and give him the Glintstone Key, then warp to the Academy's Schoolhouse Classroom grace and check on him outside of the building (he is dead).\nStep 8: &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Manor\"&gt;Caria Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarp to the Main Academy Gate grace and exit through the northern seal. Touch the East Raya Lucaria Gate grace and talk to &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boc\"&gt;Boc&lt;/a&gt;.\nVisit the Roundtable and talk to everyone again. &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Reader%20Enia\"&gt;Finger Reader Enia&lt;/a&gt; will give you your third &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20Pouch\"&gt;Talisman Pouch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fia\"&gt;Fia&lt;/a&gt; will have new dialogue if you let her hold you. Get the note from her on where to find the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knifeprint\"&gt;Black Knifeprint&lt;/a&gt; and travel to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Church of Vows&lt;/a&gt;. Ride north through the Uld Palace Ruins and up to the Minor Erdtree. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Avatar\"&gt;Erdtree Avatar&lt;/a&gt; there, then jump down to the north-east from there to continue further north and enter the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Catacombs\"&gt;Black Knife Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. There will be a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Assassin\"&gt;Black Knife Assassin&lt;/a&gt; miniboss hidden behind an illusory wall that you can dispel with &lt;a href=\"Margit%27s%20Shackle\"&gt;Margit's Shackle&lt;/a&gt; as usual. You can summon &lt;a href=\"D%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;D (NPC)&lt;/a&gt; for this boss.\nAfterwards, give the knifeprint to &lt;a href=\"Rogier\"&gt;Rogier&lt;/a&gt; and warp to the Revenger's Shack in west-Liurnia again. Now travel north to the Four Belfries, touch the grace at the top of the mountain, then warp back down again and continue further north to the Kingsrealm Ruins. Use Margit's Shackle again to dispel another illusory wall to the north. Unlock the Road to the Manor grace and talk to &lt;a href=\"War%20Counselor%20Iji\"&gt;War Counselor Iji&lt;/a&gt;. Mention that Blaidd sent you.\nRide north to the manor and dodge the sorcery rain. Touch the Main Caria Manor Gate grace and prepare &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Pot\"&gt;Fire Pot&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Grease\"&gt;Fire Grease&lt;/a&gt;. Enter the manor and kill the Fingercreepers with fire. Loot the whole place and touch the Manor Lower Level grace. There is a branching path here, one leads deeper into the manor, the other lets you jump down onto a rooftop and pick up the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Night%20and%20Flame\"&gt;Sword of Night and Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nMove on to the Manor Upper Level, pick up the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Seed\"&gt;Golden Seed&lt;/a&gt;, defeat the Troll Knight for the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Knight%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Troll Knight's Sword&lt;/a&gt;. You can exit to the left before the boss room and jump down several levels at the graveyard with pot enemies to pick up more items.\nDefeat the area boss, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Knight%20Loretta\"&gt;Royal Knight Loretta&lt;/a&gt;. Before moving on, warp back to the Roundtable and hear the news from &lt;a href=\"Rogier\"&gt;Rogier&lt;/a&gt; about the Knifeprint. Then return to the manor and continue to the Three Sisters. Fight the Glintstone Dragon Adula. It will run away once dropping to 50%. Enter Ranni's Rise and confront her about the Night of the Black Knives. She tells you to get lost, so return to Rogier, hear his proposition, then return to Ranni again and become one of her vassals. Speak with &lt;a href=\"War%20Counselor%20Iji\"&gt;War Counselor Iji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blaidd\"&gt;Blaidd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seluvis\"&gt;Seluvis&lt;/a&gt; in Ranni's Rise, then talk to Ranni again. Ranni sends you and Blaidd on a mission to find the &lt;a href=\"Fingerslayer%20Blade\"&gt;Fingerslayer Blade&lt;/a&gt; in Nokron.\nStep 9: &lt;a href=\"Siofra%20River\"&gt;Siofra River&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarp to the Mistwood Ruins in &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt; where you first met Blaidd, then take the elevator in the building near the Minor Erdtree down to the Siofra River. Clear the area, touch the Siofra River Bank grace and jump up the ledge to the west to pick up the &lt;a href=\"Armorer%27s%20Cookbook%206\"&gt;Armorer's Cookbook 6&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you craft &lt;a href=\"Preserving%20Boluses\"&gt;Preserving Boluses&lt;/a&gt;. You can farm the Crystal Cave Moss for it at the Academy Crystal Cave in &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou'll find Blaidd at the cliff north of the Hallowhorn Grounds. He'll tell you speak with &lt;a href=\"Seluvis\"&gt;Seluvis&lt;/a&gt; to get info on &lt;a href=\"Nokron%2C%20Eternal%20City\"&gt;Nokron, Eternal City&lt;/a&gt;. Clear the rest of the area and light all the fireplaces to fight the &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Spirit\"&gt;Ancestor Spirit&lt;/a&gt; boss. You can also take a gateway portal on top of a ruin in the central-east side where all the archers are, which leads you to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin%20Soldier\"&gt;Dragonkin Soldier&lt;/a&gt; boss.\nLevel up, warp back to Ranni's Rise and meet Seluvis. While at it, also check on &lt;a href=\"Pidia\"&gt;Pidia&lt;/a&gt;, who you'll need to jump down to from the cliff not far from where you find Seluvis. Seluvis tells you to ask &lt;a href=\"Sellen\"&gt;Sellen&lt;/a&gt; about Nokron. Sellen in turn says that you have to defeat &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;General Radahn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt; to be able to reach Nokron. You may also take &lt;a href=\"Seluvis%27s%20Potion\"&gt;Seluvis's Potion&lt;/a&gt; from him. Do not give the potion to anyone just yet. Report back to Blaidd.\nStep 10: &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to the &lt;a href=\"Summonwater%20Village\"&gt;Summonwater Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt; and ride to the east. Touch the Smoldering Church grace and pick up the two cookbooks. &lt;a href=\"Anastasia%2C%20Tarnished-Eater\"&gt;Anastasia, Tarnished-Eater&lt;/a&gt; will invade you there.\nKeep following the road, first to the east up until the Caelem Ruins and then south until the Caelid Waypoint Ruins. Skip the &lt;a href=\"Decaying%20Ekzykes\"&gt;Decaying Ekzykes&lt;/a&gt; dragon fight for now and also avoid the Aeonia swamp. Naturally, you touch every grace you come across. Stay on the road until you pass the Sellia Gateway. There will be an NPC message and a shack guarded by a large dog. Sneak past the dog and talk to &lt;a href=\"Gowry\"&gt;Gowry&lt;/a&gt;. \nTo complete Gowry's request, you need to defeat &lt;a href=\"Commander%20O%27Niel\"&gt;Commander O'Niel&lt;/a&gt; in the Aeonia swamp. Bring lots of &lt;a href=\"Preserving%20Boluses\"&gt;Preserving Boluses&lt;/a&gt;, because you will have to fight a Millicent invader on the way there. When the invasion begins, you get automatically dismounted. Run back to the shore, cure the Scarlet Rot and fight her on land. You'll need lots of space to dodge her Waterfowl Dance attack. \nGet the &lt;a href=\"Unalloyed%20Gold%20Needle\"&gt;Unalloyed Gold Needle&lt;/a&gt; and bring it to Gowry. He'll take it and repair it. In the meantime, warp back to west-Caelid and travel all the way to the south-west to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Gael\"&gt;Fort Gael&lt;/a&gt;. Clear the fort and take the gateway portal to &lt;a href=\"Redmane%20Castle\"&gt;Redmane Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Activate the Redmane Castle Plaza grace and return to Gowry. \nNow ride north from Gowry's Shack into Sellia, Town of Sorcery. Light all three fires, loot the place, defeat the Nox Swordstress and Nox Priestess duo miniboss, pick up the Golden Seed and exit the town to the north. Activate the Sellia Backstreets grace, ascent the mountain and meet &lt;a href=\"Millicent\"&gt;Millicent&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Plague\"&gt;Church of the Plague&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to her, give her the needle, rest, then talk to her again at the church and another time at Gowry's Shack. Now ride further north past all the dragons to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Faroth\"&gt;Fort Faroth&lt;/a&gt;. Clear the fort and pick up the second half of the Dectus Medallion.\nNow warp all the way back to &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven't done it yet, bring &lt;a href=\"Rya\"&gt;Rya&lt;/a&gt; her necklace. Otherwise go straight to the East Raya Lucaria Gate grace and ride north. Stop by at the Bellum Church to talk to &lt;a href=\"Hyetta\"&gt;Hyetta&lt;/a&gt; again, then continue up the mountain to the north-east and clear out the Frenzied Flame Village for the &lt;a href=\"Fingerprint%20Grape\"&gt;Fingerprint Grape&lt;/a&gt;. \nMove on to the Grand Lift of Dectus in the north of Liurnia and activate it. Follow the road to the Altus Highway Junction grace and activate it, then warp back to &lt;a href=\"Redmane%20Castle\"&gt;Redmane Castle&lt;/a&gt; and meet &lt;a href=\"Blaidd\"&gt;Blaidd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Fist%20Alexander\"&gt;Iron Fist Alexander&lt;/a&gt; at the plaza. Talk to Finger Maiden Thorelina to receive the Polite Bow gesture. Then talk to &lt;a href=\"Witch-Hunter%20Jerren\"&gt;Witch-Hunter Jerren&lt;/a&gt; to initiate the Radahn boss fight. Pick up all the items at the plaza, since some parts of it will be locked once you defeat Radahn.\nYou can summon infinite npc phantoms during the fight against Radahn, up to 5 at a time. If you summon Great Horned Tragoth, he gives you the Casual Greeting gesture. Defeat Radahn and talk to both Blaidd and Alexander. Activate the grace, level up and ride all the way to the north-east, alonside the shoreline. Inside the cliff are the &lt;a href=\"War-Dead%20Catacombs\"&gt;War-Dead Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. You can clear it now or later.\nStep 11: &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe're taking a detour to the Altus Plateau before finishing Ranni's mission. Talk to the Roundtable NPCs again. Take the dagger from Fia and give it to D. Warp to the Highway Junction grace. You'll meet &lt;a href=\"Corhyn\"&gt;Corhyn&lt;/a&gt; on the road right next to the Altus Plateau map. He is looking for &lt;a href=\"Goldmask\"&gt;Goldmask&lt;/a&gt;.\nJump off the road to the west and search for the Second Church of Marika. You'll find &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Finger%20Hunter%20Yura\"&gt;Bloody Finger Hunter Yura&lt;/a&gt; there again. Defeat the invader, Eleonora, and then continue north. Once you see a long bridge to the west, quickly go to the other side, touch the Bridge of Iniquity grace and then go back to the Altus Plateau and keep riding north until along the road you reach the Road of Iniquity Site of Grace. Goldmask is right above this road. Keep following the road to the north-east to the Windmill Village. Meet &lt;a href=\"Goldmask\"&gt;Goldmask&lt;/a&gt; on the bridge and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Godskin%20Apostle\"&gt;Godskin Apostle&lt;/a&gt; at the village. Then return to &lt;a href=\"Corhyn\"&gt;Corhyn&lt;/a&gt; and let him know about Goldmask's location.\nYou can explore the central area down the broken bridge north of Corhyn, where there is a Minor Erdtree and the Wormface miniboss, but it's optional. Warp back to the Highway Junction grace and ride to the east up to the gigantic gate. Sneak past the Tree Sentinel duo and pick up the two Golden Seeds at the Outer Wall Phantom Tree grace. Follow the road to the south-east, leading to the Minor Erdtree Church. Talk to Melina at the grace and pick up the items there. Jump down to the lake north-east of the church and enter the Sealed Tunnel. Use &lt;a href=\"Margit%27s%20Shackle\"&gt;Margit's Shackle&lt;/a&gt; again to dispel the illusory walls and pick up the &lt;a href=\"Smithing-Stone%20Miner%27s%20Bell%20Bearing\"&gt;Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing&lt;/a&gt; [2]. Defeat the Onyx Lord at the end of the dungeon and activate the grace.\nWarp back to the Outer Wall Phantom Tree grace, travel north to pick up more Golden Seeds and prepare for your rematch against &lt;a href=\"Margit%2C%20The%20Fell%20Omen\"&gt;Margit, The Fell Omen&lt;/a&gt; at the Outer Wall Battleground. Defeat him and stop by at the Hermit Merchant's Shack to the north-east, then go back to the Battleground. Leave the city wall to the north-west and travel south along the path all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Sainted%20Hero%27s%20Grave\"&gt;Sainted Hero's Grave&lt;/a&gt; on a hill. It will be guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Assassin\"&gt;Black Knife Assassin&lt;/a&gt; that drops the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife\"&gt;Black Knife&lt;/a&gt;. Clear the Sainted Hero's Grave or leave it for later. South of it is the Stormcaller Church with another &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Tear\"&gt;Sacred Tear&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow warp back to &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt; and ride to the north-end of the lake. Touch the \"The Ravine\" and \"Ruin-Strewn Precipice\" &lt;a href=\"Sites%20of%20Grace\"&gt;Sites of Grace&lt;/a&gt; on the way, then take the elevator to the mining cave and clear it to reach the \"Ravine-Veiled Village\" grace. Fight your way past the harpies. Near the boss fog is a ladder that leads to a Giant &lt;a href=\"Land%20Octopus\"&gt;Land Octopus&lt;/a&gt; that guards the &lt;a href=\"Serpent-God%27s%20Curved%20Sword\"&gt;Serpent-God's Curved Sword&lt;/a&gt;. If you didn't already summon Great Horned Tragoth against &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;General Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, you can do so here for the \"Casual Greeting\" gesture. The boss is &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Wyrm%20Makar\"&gt;Magma Wyrm Makar&lt;/a&gt;. Defeat him and continue though the Ruin-Strewn Precipice until you arrive at the Altus Plateau again.\nTouch the grace and walk up the mountain, where &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon%20Lansseax\"&gt;Ancient Dragon Lansseax&lt;/a&gt; will attack you. Hit him a few times until he flies away, then warp to the Sainted Hero's Grave, change the time of day to night-time at the grace and take the elevator back up. Ride uphill to the east, where Lansseax will attack you again, this time for real. Defeat the dragon.\nStep 12: &lt;a href=\"Nokron%2C%20Eternal%20City\"&gt;Nokron, Eternal City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is time to finish Ranni's quest. Upgrade everything as far as you can, then travel to the Fort Haight grace in &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;. There is now a huge crater with floating rocks that you can jump down on. It leads you to the upper level of the Siofra River. Fight your way further down and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Mimic%20Tear\"&gt;Mimic Tear&lt;/a&gt; miniboss. Ride over the bridge and stick to the western side of the cliff until you reach the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace. You can light all 6 fireplaces here on the upper level of the Siofra River to fight the &lt;a href=\"Regal%20Ancestor%20Spirit\"&gt;Regal Ancestor Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, or skip it and jump down onto the Night's Sacred Ground rooftops from the cliff at the Ancestral Woods grace.\nClimb all the way down through Nokron. You'll find the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Whetblade\"&gt;Black Whetblade&lt;/a&gt; near an altar inside of a building. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Stonesword%20Key\"&gt;Stonesword Key&lt;/a&gt; imp statue with the &lt;a href=\"Mimic%20Tear%20Ashes\"&gt;Mimic Tear Ashes&lt;/a&gt; in a treasure chest behind it. Summoning the Mimic Tear will make most bosses significantly less difficult, decide for yourself if you want to make use of it or not. Exit the building where you found the Whetblade and touch the Night's Sacred Ground grace. There is a large open space with a dozen Silver Tear enemies. Simply run past them and pick up the &lt;a href=\"Fingerslayer%20Blade\"&gt;Fingerslayer Blade&lt;/a&gt; from the treasure chest at the end, then escape via the gateway portal. \nStep 13: &lt;a href=\"Deeproot%20Depths\"&gt;Deeproot Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"War%20Counselor%20Iji\"&gt;War Counselor Iji&lt;/a&gt;, then warp back to the Agheel lake grace in &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt; and interact with the Evergaol where you fought &lt;a href=\"Bloodhound%20Knight%20Darriwil\"&gt;Bloodhound Knight Darriwil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blaidd\"&gt;Blaidd&lt;/a&gt; is inside of it. Warp back to Iji and get an explanation from him. You can then return to Blaidd and free him or leave him locked up, doesn't make a difference. Also interact with &lt;a href=\"Seluvis\"&gt;Seluvis&lt;/a&gt; if you still want anything from him.\nWarp to Ranni's Rise with the &lt;a href=\"Fingerslayer%20Blade\"&gt;Fingerslayer Blade&lt;/a&gt;. She will give you the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Inverted%20Statue\"&gt;Carian Inverted Statue&lt;/a&gt; that you need to find the Cursemark. The next time you rest, Ranni is gone and both &lt;a href=\"Pidia\"&gt;Pidia&lt;/a&gt; and Seluvis are dead. \nTravel to the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Study%20Hall\"&gt;Carian Study Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the east of &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, not far from the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Church of Vows&lt;/a&gt;. First clear the place without using the Inverted Statue, then return to the entrance, use the statue and progress all the way to the other end. A &lt;a href=\"Godskin%20Noble\"&gt;Godskin Noble&lt;/a&gt; will attack you on your way to the Divine Tower of Liurnia. Defeat it, take the elevator up the tower and pick up Ranni's &lt;a href=\"Cursemark%20of%20Death\"&gt;Cursemark of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you haven't already, check back on the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt; NPCs now. Fia leaves the Roundtable Hold and both &lt;a href=\"D%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;D (NPC)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rogier\"&gt;Rogier&lt;/a&gt; are dead. \nWarp back to the Ancestral Woods and ride north past the docile blue jellies. Touch the Aqueduct-Facing Cliffs grace and fight your way past the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20Knight\"&gt;Crucible Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Valiant%20Gargoyle\"&gt;Valiant Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; duo and give D's &lt;a href=\"Twinned%20Armor\"&gt;Twinned Armor&lt;/a&gt; to the unresponsive NPC in front of the boss arena. Then walk to the end of the Great Waterfall Basin and interact with the coffin, which will take you to the &lt;a href=\"Deeproot%20Depths\"&gt;Deeproot Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can fight the Erdtree Avatar for the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Avatar\"&gt;Staff of the Avatar&lt;/a&gt; or just jump over the large roots to the north, past the giant ants. You can also pick up the legendary incantation &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Stars\"&gt;Elden Stars&lt;/a&gt; from a ledge here. Continue north-west along the edge of the waterfall to the \"The Nameless Eternal City\" grace. You can jump one level down and further north-west until you run into &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20Knight%20Siluria\"&gt;Crucible Knight Siluria&lt;/a&gt;. The fight is optional, but behind the miniboss is a treasure chest with the Crucible Knight armor set.\nJump all the way up the roots to the east until you arrive at the \"Across the Roots\" grace. Fight &lt;a href=\"Fia%27s%20Champions\"&gt;Fia's Champions&lt;/a&gt; and touch the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Death%27s%20Throne\"&gt;Prince of Death's Throne&lt;/a&gt; grace. Let &lt;a href=\"Fia\"&gt;Fia&lt;/a&gt; hold you and give her Ranni's Cursemark. Rest at the grace, then enter Fia's dream and defeat &lt;a href=\"Lichdragon%20Fortissax\"&gt;Lichdragon Fortissax&lt;/a&gt;. Pick up the &lt;a href=\"Mending%20Rune%20of%20the%20Death-Prince\"&gt;Mending Rune of the Death-Prince&lt;/a&gt; and rest again. D's brother will show up and Fia is dead. Rest again to get the &lt;a href=\"Inseparable%20Sword\"&gt;Inseparable Sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twinned%20Armor\"&gt;Twinned Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep 14: &lt;a href=\"Ainsel%20River\"&gt;Ainsel River&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarp back down to the \"The Nameless Eternal City\" grace and hop into the coffin elevator. Touch the first grace you come across and warp back to Ranni's Rise. Ride north to Renna's Rise and pick up the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Witch%20Robe\"&gt;Snow Witch Robe&lt;/a&gt; from a treasure chest, then take the gateway portal. Pick up &lt;a href=\"Miniature%20Ranni\"&gt;Miniature Ranni&lt;/a&gt; from a coffin and sit at the grace. Select the \"Talk to Miniature Ranni\" option repeatedly until Ranni starts talking back to you.\nYou can now clear the entire Ainsel River area. Either head straight to &lt;a href=\"Nokstella%2C%20Eternal%20City\"&gt;Nokstella, Eternal City&lt;/a&gt;, or take a detour and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin%20Soldier\"&gt;Dragonkin Soldier&lt;/a&gt; of Nokstella first for some runes and a sorcery &lt;a href=\"Spells\"&gt;Spell&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can fight your way through &lt;a href=\"Nokstella%2C%20Eternal%20City\"&gt;Nokstella, Eternal City&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Seed\"&gt;Golden Seed&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Larval%20Tear\"&gt;Larval Tear&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Moon%20of%20Nokstella\"&gt;Moon of Nokstella&lt;/a&gt;, or just follow the river to the north and take the elevator down. Defeat the Baleful Shadow invader. Ranni will award you with the &lt;a href=\"Discarded%20Palace%20Key\"&gt;Discarded Palace Key&lt;/a&gt;. Take another elevator down. You'll arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20of%20Rot\"&gt;Lake of Rot&lt;/a&gt;.\nStock up on &lt;a href=\"Preserving%20Boluses\"&gt;Preserving Boluses&lt;/a&gt; by crafting them. You can fight the &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin%20Soldier\"&gt;Dragonkin Soldier&lt;/a&gt; and Alabaster Lord for the &lt;a href=\"Alabaster%20Lord%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Alabaster Lord's Sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Blade\"&gt;Dragonscale Blade&lt;/a&gt;, or just loot the place and move south to the Grand Cloister grace. Jump down the platforms from the Grand Cloister grace. There is an optional Tree Spirit boss in the river of rot. You can also just skip it and move to the end of the river, where there is a coffin in front of a waterfall. Hop into the coffin to progress to the area boss, &lt;a href=\"Astel%20Naturalborn%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Astel Naturalborn of the Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nTouch the grace after defeating the boss and warp back to the Academy's Grand Library with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Rennala\"&gt;Queen Rennala&lt;/a&gt;. Pick up the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Ring\"&gt;Dark Moon Ring&lt;/a&gt; and warp back to Astel's boss arena. Continue to the elevator, which takes you to the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Altar\"&gt;Moonlight Altar&lt;/a&gt;. Move uphill to the Cathedral of Manus Celes and defeat &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Dragon%20Adula\"&gt;Glintstone Dragon Adula&lt;/a&gt;. Touch the grace in the cathedral.\nYou can then do some optional content: the fight against &lt;a href=\"Alecto%2C%20Black%20Knife%20Ringleader\"&gt;Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader&lt;/a&gt; that awards you the Mimic Tear-level &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Tiche\"&gt;Black Knife Tiche&lt;/a&gt; summon, the &lt;a href=\"Ranni%27s%20Dark%20Moon\"&gt;Ranni's Dark Moon&lt;/a&gt; turtle puzzle, and some optional dragon fights for &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Heart\"&gt;Dragon Heart&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Cerulean%20Amber%20Medallion%20%2B2\"&gt;Cerulean Amber Medallion +2&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo finish Ranni's quest, jump down into the hole at the Cathedral of Manus Celes and interact with Ranni's puppet body in front of the slain Two-Fingers.\nStep 15: Dragonbarrow.\nWarp to the Church of the Plague in &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt; and ride north uphill, until you find the Spiritspring Jump. Jump up on top of the giant white skull and loot the bodies there for some free &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20Stone%207\"&gt;Smithing Stone 7&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThen continue north towards Fort Faroth again and kill the giant sleeping dragon, it will drop over 50,000 &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt;. Note that you can accelerate the process by using a bleed weapon. You can also farm this dragon indefinitely by riding back to the grace just as it dies and rest before it drops the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Heart\"&gt;Dragon Heart&lt;/a&gt;. This gives you all the Runes, but not the Dragon Heart, causing the dragon to respawn. This is also an easy way to become overpowered early game on a second playthrough, since the dragon doesn't fight back and bleed deals so much damage to it.\nJump down the next Spiritspring Jump near the fort to the Minor Erdtree and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Putrid%20Avatar\"&gt;Putrid Avatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpend your runes to level up once again. You should be at minimum level 60 by now, probably over 70. Travel to the west and towards the Divine Tower. Climb up using &lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;Torrent&lt;/a&gt;'s double jump and the ladders. Touch the grace, pick up Radahn's &lt;a href=\"Great%20Rune\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt;, warp back to the grace and descend the tower via the platforming challenge. There is a shortcut that you can unlock by climbing up the ladder immediately after the first iron elevator. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Godskin%20Apostle\"&gt;Godskin Apostle&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the tower, pick up the &lt;a href=\"Godslayer%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Godslayer's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; from the treasure chest behind it. Then use the teleporter to get sent back outside and continue further west until you find the Isolated Merchant that sells the &lt;a href=\"Beast-Repellent%20Torch\"&gt;Beast-Repellent Torch&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you haven't used the elevator in the north at the bottom level in &lt;a href=\"Siofra%20River\"&gt;Siofra River&lt;/a&gt; yet, go and activate it. It requires a &lt;a href=\"Stonesword%20Key\"&gt;Stonesword Key&lt;/a&gt;, but sends you to the Dragonbarrow Area with the Knights of the Great Jar, from where you can get the &lt;a href=\"Great-Jar%27s%20Arsenal\"&gt;Great-Jar's Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; talisman.\nStep 16: &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarp to the &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt; and explore the western area until you find the Lux Ruins. Nearby will be a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Seed\"&gt;Golden Seed&lt;/a&gt; and the \"Erdtree-Gazing Hill\" grace. Talk to &lt;a href=\"Millicent\"&gt;Millicent&lt;/a&gt; at the grace and then with &lt;a href=\"Rya\"&gt;Rya&lt;/a&gt; in the Lux Ruins, if you haven't already spoken to Rya after taking the Grand Lift of Dectus way back in Step 11.\nRya will teleport you to the &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor\"&gt;Volcano Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to Tanith and accept her offer to join the manor, there is no reason not to. Get the &lt;a href=\"Drawing-Room%20Key\"&gt;Drawing-Room Key&lt;/a&gt; from her and open all the doors. Pick up all the items in the manor and then go upstairs to fight &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Ghiza\"&gt;Inquisitor Ghiza&lt;/a&gt; to get &lt;a href=\"Ghiza%27s%20Wheel\"&gt;Ghiza's Wheel&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf you are short on Smithing Stones, warp back outside to the Erdtree-Grazing Hill grace and ride north through the ravine until you come across some trolls and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Altus%20Tunnel\"&gt;Old Altus Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; in the left side of the cliff. Clear the Old Altus Tunnel for some &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20Stone%205\"&gt;Smithing Stone 5&lt;/a&gt;s and Somber Smithing Stones 4, 5 and 6. If you need &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20Stone%206\"&gt;Smithing Stone 6&lt;/a&gt;s instead, go up one level to the Bridge of Iniquity, north of the Second Church of Marika, and fight your way up &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Full-Grown%20Fallingstar%20Beast\"&gt;Full-Grown Fallingstar Beast&lt;/a&gt;. You can also follow the path after it to fight another &lt;a href=\"Ulcerated%20Tree%20Spirit\"&gt;Ulcerated Tree Spirit&lt;/a&gt; near the Road of Iniquity grace, not far from the Volcano Manor entrance.\nOnce you are ready, travel alongside the Seethewater River in the ravine further north-west of the Erdtree-Gazing Hill. You have to go all the way around Mt. Gelmir and the Volcano Manor to the north-west. Clear Fort Laiedd for the &lt;a href=\"Prelate%27s%20Inferno%20Crozier\"&gt;Prelate's Inferno Crozier&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Wyrm\"&gt;Magma Wyrm&lt;/a&gt; south of it. Talk to &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Fist%20Alexander\"&gt;Iron Fist Alexander&lt;/a&gt; in the lava mass a little further south to get the &lt;a href=\"Jar\"&gt;Jar&lt;/a&gt; helmet. Keep on riding south until you arrive at the Hermit's Shack. Defeat the Demi-Human Queen miniboss and talk to Glintstone Sorcerer Azur for the &lt;a href=\"Comet%20Azur\"&gt;Comet Azur&lt;/a&gt; sorcery. \nWe're taking a quick detour to do &lt;a href=\"Sellen\"&gt;Sellen&lt;/a&gt;'s quest. Meet her in the &lt;a href=\"Waypoint%20Ruins\"&gt;Waypoint Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and get the key to Lusat's seal. Then warp to the Church of the Plague in &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt; and travel north until you arrive at the graveyard where there is a Battlemage enemy. Use &lt;a href=\"Margit%27s%20Shackle\"&gt;Margit's Shackle&lt;/a&gt; to remove the illusory wall that covers up the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Sellia%20Hideaway\"&gt;Sellia Hideaway&lt;/a&gt; cave. Find Lusat to get &lt;a href=\"Stars%20of%20Ruin\"&gt;Stars of Ruin&lt;/a&gt;. You can also fight the scarlet rot &lt;a href=\"Crystalian\"&gt;Crystalian&lt;/a&gt; trio at the end of the cave for the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Torrent\"&gt;Crystal Torrent&lt;/a&gt; Spell.\nReturn to Sellen and have her send you to the Witchbane Ruins in the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Peninsula\"&gt;Weeping Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to her there to get &lt;a href=\"Sellen%27s%20Primal%20Glintstone\"&gt;Sellen's Primal Glintstone&lt;/a&gt;. Reload the area to talk to &lt;a href=\"Witch-Hunter%20Jerren\"&gt;Witch-Hunter Jerren&lt;/a&gt; as well. Now warp to Ranni's Rise and search for Seluvis's hideout north of it. Use &lt;a href=\"Margit%27s%20Shackle\"&gt;Margit's Shackle&lt;/a&gt; if you're having trouble locating the illusory wall. Put Sellen's glintstone into the new body, exhaust her dialogue and then travel to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Rennala\"&gt;Queen Rennala&lt;/a&gt; in the Academy. Outside the grand library are two summon signs. Make your choice on who you want to aid, Sellen or Jerren.\nWith that done, do the Volcano Manor assassination quest in &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt; and return back to the manor. Talk to everyone again, then take the next set of missions. Warp to the Old Altus Tunnel and travel north towards the Shaded Castle and complete the invasion on your way there. Explore the Shaded Castle to find the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%27s%20Prosthesis\"&gt;Valkyrie's Prosthesis&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Millicent\"&gt;Millicent&lt;/a&gt;, then defeat &lt;a href=\"Elemer%20of%20the%20Briar\"&gt;Elemer of the Briar&lt;/a&gt;. Warp to where you fought &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Wyrm%20Makar\"&gt;Magma Wyrm Makar&lt;/a&gt; and do &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt;'s Volcano Manor mission, which requires killing &lt;a href=\"Great%20Horned%20Tragoth\"&gt;Great Horned Tragoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nReport back to &lt;a href=\"Tanith\"&gt;Tanith&lt;/a&gt; and the others. Explore the empty room near the grace inside of the manor, there is an illusory wall. Go deeper into the manor, fight the Bloodhound Knight, touch the grace further downstairs in the chapel. Go outside and clear the area. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Godskin%20Noble\"&gt;Godskin Noble&lt;/a&gt;. You can proceed to clear out the rest of the area, but do not touch the gateway portal.\nStep 17: &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarp to the merchant's shack near the battlegrounds where you had your rematch against &lt;a href=\"Margit%20the%20Fell%20Omen\"&gt;Margit the Fell Omen&lt;/a&gt;. Wait until night-time and reload the area to fight the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Bearing%20Hunter\"&gt;Bell Bearing Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Then also ride north-east from there to fight the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rite%20Bird\"&gt;Death Rite Bird&lt;/a&gt;. Keep going east past the golems firing giant arrows and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Draconic%20Tree%20Sentinel\"&gt;Draconic Tree Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. Enter the capital and talk to &lt;a href=\"Boc\"&gt;Boc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt; at the second grace. Fight your way all the way down to the main street where an &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Avatar\"&gt;Erdtree Avatar&lt;/a&gt; appears. \nRight next to the Erdtree Avatar is the Avenue Balcony grace. This is where the area branches out. You can either follow the main street and clear out that part of the area, or go downstairs from the Avenue Balcony grace and climb down a well to the sewers, or climb up the giant stone dragon's wing to find the &lt;a href=\"Fortified%20Manor\"&gt;Fortified Manor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Erdtree Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sewers lead to the &lt;a href=\"Subterranean%20Shunning-Grounds\"&gt;Subterranean Shunning-Grounds&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Eater\"&gt;Dung Eater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20the%20Omen\"&gt;Mohg, the Omen&lt;/a&gt;, while a spirit version of &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; awaits you at the Erdtree Sanctuary. Defeating the golden Godfrey is mandatory to progress and gives you the fourth &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20Pouch\"&gt;Talisman Pouch&lt;/a&gt;, while the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds are optional content.\nInside of the Fortified Manor near the Erdtree Sanctuary is the red sign for &lt;a href=\"Bernahl\"&gt;Bernahl&lt;/a&gt;'s Volcano Manor quest. There you will also find the &lt;a href=\"Coded%20Sword\"&gt;Coded Sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammer\"&gt;Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the paintings in the same room as the Fortified Manor grace.\n&lt;a href=\"Corhyn\"&gt;Corhyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goldmask\"&gt;Goldmask&lt;/a&gt; are in front of the closed-off colosseum uphill, past the roots that lead up to the Erdtree Sanctuary.\nOnce you defeat Godfrey, you can pick up the &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Gransax\"&gt;Bolt of Gransax&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order%20Principia\"&gt;Golden Order Principia&lt;/a&gt; prayerbook. Give the Principia prayerbook to &lt;a href=\"Miriel%2C%20Pastor%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Miriel, Pastor of Vows&lt;/a&gt; or Corhyn and learn the spell &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20Regression\"&gt;Law of Regression&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't have enough Intelligence to cast it, combine items and consumables that temporarily boost the stat, like the &lt;a href=\"Intelligence-knot%20Crystal%20Tear\"&gt;Intelligence-knot Crystal Tear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twinsage%20Glintstone%20Crown\"&gt;Twinsage Glintstone Crown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stargazer%20Heirloom\"&gt;Stargazer Heirloom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marika%27s%20Scarseal\"&gt;Marika's Scarseal&lt;/a&gt;. Visit the Radagon statue that is next to the two Perfumer enemies down the elevator from the Erdtree Sanctuary and cast Law of Regression while standing on top of the artist's message there. Then report back to &lt;a href=\"Goldmask\"&gt;Goldmask&lt;/a&gt; and tell him about the secret to receive the Golden Order Totality gesture.\nPast the Erdtree Sanctuary are the Queen's Bedchambers, where a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Assassin\"&gt;Black Knife Assassin&lt;/a&gt; attacks. Right next to the Bedchambers is the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott, the Omen King&lt;/a&gt; awaits you.\nAfter defeating Morgott, talk to him, then visit the Erdtree and talk to &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt; again at the grace.\nStep 18: &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Lands\"&gt;Forbidden Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo reach the Forbidden Lands and claim &lt;a href=\"Morgott%27s%20Great%20Rune\"&gt;Morgott's Great Rune&lt;/a&gt;, warp back to the Avanue Balcony in &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt; and open the gate to the east. You'll have to fight your way past a bunch of Perfumers and &lt;a href=\"Leonine%20Misbegotten\"&gt;Leonine Misbegotten&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep onto the large elevator and descend to the Forbidden Lands. Touch the grace, then take the elevator up again and jump off immediately to pick up the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Calling\"&gt;Blade of Calling&lt;/a&gt; from a hidden room in the elevator shaft. Jump back down, call the elevator again and this time take the road towards the Divine Tower. When approacing the patrolling soldier, the area morphs into the &lt;a href=\"Fell%20Twin\"&gt;Fell Twin&lt;/a&gt; boss arena. Defeat them, claim the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Rune\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt; and teleport back to the Forbidden Lands grace.\nThe Forbidden Lands are full of Vulgar Militia ambushes. There aren't many items to pick up here, only a Golden Seed on the path and a Somber Smithing Stone inside of a giant skull, so you can mostly just ride past everything, but there is an optional night-time &lt;a href=\"Night%27s%20Cavalry\"&gt;Night's Cavalry&lt;/a&gt; miniboss and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20Kindred\"&gt;Black Blade Kindred&lt;/a&gt; at the end.\nAfter defeating the Black Blade Kindred, touch the Grand Lift of Rold grace and take the lift up to the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep 19: &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first thing you should do here is pick up the &lt;a href=\"Smithing-Stone%20Miner%27s%20Bell%20Bearing\"&gt;Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing&lt;/a&gt; [3] from the treasure chest in the Zamor Ruins immediately after the lift. You can also pick up the &lt;a href=\"Zamor%20Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Zamor Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; Spell in the ruins while at it. You don't have to fight any of the enemies here.\nRide north to the cliff with a bunch of fire mages. Stop by at the Giants' Mountaintop Catacombs and touch the grace, then travel further north over the rock wall where a giant shoots arrows at you.\nOnce arriving at the other end, you can spot a &lt;a href=\"Teardrop%20Scarab\"&gt;Teardrop Scarab&lt;/a&gt; that will drop a Somber Smithing Stone 8. Right next to it is the Ancient Snow Valley Ruins grace. \nTake the opportunity to get a few questlines up to speed. First warp back to &lt;a href=\"Millicent\"&gt;Millicent&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. Give her the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%27s%20Prosthesis\"&gt;Valkyrie's Prosthesis&lt;/a&gt;, then travel to the windmill village grace where you defeated the &lt;a href=\"Godskin%20Apostle\"&gt;Godskin Apostle&lt;/a&gt; and talk to her there as well, then back to the Ancient Snow Valley Ruins and speak with her again. Then return to the &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor\"&gt;Volcano Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Complete &lt;a href=\"Diallos%20Hoslow\"&gt;Diallos Hoslow&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Jarburg\"&gt;Jarburg&lt;/a&gt; quest and &lt;a href=\"Rya\"&gt;Rya&lt;/a&gt;'s manor quest. You have to do this before the final Volcano Manor invasion, otherwise you'll miss out on some quest options involving &lt;a href=\"Tanith\"&gt;Tanith&lt;/a&gt; and Rya. Once you're ready to end the Volcano Manor questlines, return to the Mountaintops Valley Ruins again and keep going north until you reach the frozen river where a giant patrols. Follow the river to the west, past the in-fighting enemies. There at the Shack of the Lofty is your final &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor\"&gt;Volcano Manor&lt;/a&gt; invasion against &lt;a href=\"Juno%20Hoslow%2C%20Knight%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood&lt;/a&gt;. Defeat him, then take the Spiritspring Jump just south of the shack. \nYou'll arrive at the Stargazer's Ruins. Summon your &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Jellyfish%20Ashes\"&gt;Spirit Jellyfish Ashes&lt;/a&gt; to unlock the treasure room and loot the chest with the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Glintstone%20Blade\"&gt;Primal Glintstone Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Further south on the bridge are &lt;a href=\"Corhyn\"&gt;Corhyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goldmask\"&gt;Goldmask&lt;/a&gt;. Say hello to them and keep riding going east. If you still have healing left, fight the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Avatar\"&gt;Erdtree Avatar&lt;/a&gt; here, otherwise just keep going north-east over the next bridge and unlock the Snow Valley Ruins Overlook grace right next to the bridge and defeat the Erdtree Avatar after. Use the runes to level up and/or upgrade your weapon. You should be at around level 100 now and have a weapon at +20, or +9 in case of a Somber weapon. You can definitely take on &lt;a href=\"Praetor%20Rykard\"&gt;Praetor Rykard&lt;/a&gt; now, even without using the &lt;a href=\"Serpent-Hunter\"&gt;Serpent-Hunter&lt;/a&gt; (which you should still use regardless).\nAfterwards, return to the Snow Valley Ruins Overlook grace on the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; and climb up to the broken bridge east of the grace. There is an invisible bridge that lets you enter the Heretical Rise with the &lt;a href=\"Founding%20Rain%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Founding Rain of Stars&lt;/a&gt; in it. Then exit the Heretical Rise to the south, skip the Lord Contender's Evergaol and jump down to the graveyard below with the Spiritspring Jump. Keep on going to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Church%20of%20Marika\"&gt;First Church of Marika&lt;/a&gt; to the east. Pick up the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Tear\"&gt;Sacred Tear&lt;/a&gt; and talk to &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt; at the grace. Then jump back up to the Evergaol and defeat &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Knight%20Vyke\"&gt;Roundtable Knight Vyke&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to the Snow Valley Ruins Overlook grace once again and head west towards the graveyard. Run past the giant skeleton spirits, kill the &lt;a href=\"Tibia%20Mariner\"&gt;Tibia Mariner&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Helphen%27s%20Steeple\"&gt;Helphen's Steeple&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rite%20Bird\"&gt;Death Rite Bird&lt;/a&gt;. You can climb down the mountain from there to the north and visit &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Sol\"&gt;Castle Sol&lt;/a&gt;, right next to the &lt;a href=\"Walking%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Walking Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;. \nDon't bother fighting the two Lion Guardians, just run past them. Climb up the ladders and fight your way past the ballistae on the rooftops.\nOne of the buildings here has one of the artist paintings in it. Keep going until you reach the Church of the Eclipse grace and pick up the &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Shotel\"&gt;Eclipse Shotel&lt;/a&gt;. You can also pick up the &lt;a href=\"Cerulean%20Amber%20Medallion%20%2B1\"&gt;Cerulean Amber Medallion +1&lt;/a&gt; not far from the church. Then proceed further upstairs to fight &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Niall\"&gt;Commander Niall&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf you find yourself needing more damage, you can get more Smithing Stone 7s near the First Church of Marika from a body on a chair, in the frozen river from a statue, and at the Moonlight Altar, where there are also some Smithing Stone 8s guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wolf%20of%20Radagon\"&gt;Red Wolf of Radagon&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep 20: &lt;a href=\"Consecrated%20Snowfield\"&gt;Consecrated Snowfield&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarp back to the Grand Lift of Rold and use the \"select other\" left/right command to activate the Haligtree Secret Medallion instead of the regular &lt;a href=\"Rold%20Medallion\"&gt;Rold Medallion&lt;/a&gt;. You'll arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Path%20to%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Hidden Path to the Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;. You can fight a second &lt;a href=\"Mimic%20Tear\"&gt;Mimic Tear&lt;/a&gt; miniboss by jumping down onto the invisible platforms below the path with the Vulgar Militia.\nOnce you're outside, ride straight north until you arrive at the frozen river. On the opposite side of the river from the waypoint with the &lt;a href=\"Consecrated%20Snowfield\"&gt;Consecrated Snowfield&lt;/a&gt; map is the Inner Consecrated Snowfield grace. Activate it and then travel west on the frozen river to fight &lt;a href=\"Anastasia%2C%20Tarnished-Eater\"&gt;Anastasia, Tarnished-Eater&lt;/a&gt; for the third time. You may also explore the area south-east and south-west of the grace to plunder the Caravans. There is also an additional one guarded by two &lt;a href=\"Night%27s%20Cavalry\"&gt;Night's Cavalry&lt;/a&gt; that will drop the &lt;a href=\"Night%27s%20Cavalry%20Armor\"&gt;Night's Cavalry Armor&lt;/a&gt; set.\nFurther north of the frozen river is &lt;a href=\"Ordina%2C%20Liturgical%20Town\"&gt;Ordina, Liturgical Town&lt;/a&gt;. You can stop there to activate the grace and pick up the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Armor\"&gt;Black Knife Armor&lt;/a&gt; set, but clearing the town is not the goal yet. East of the town is a Rotten Duelist enemy that drops the &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Greataxe\"&gt;Rotten Greataxe&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the far south-west behind the madness-infested Yelough Anix Ruins is the &lt;a href=\"Yelough%20Anix%20Tunnel\"&gt;Yelough Anix Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;. Clear it if you want more Smithing Stones.\nIf you follow the frozen river to the north-west, you'll arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Apostate%20Derelict\"&gt;Apostate Derelict&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Walking%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Walking Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; in front of it. This is the final location for &lt;a href=\"Latenna\"&gt;Latenna&lt;/a&gt;'s quest. There is a prompt to summon her in front of the NPC.\nAll the way to the west is the gateway portal to &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Palace\"&gt;Mohgwyn Palace&lt;/a&gt;. It is guarded by some &lt;a href=\"Runebear\"&gt;Runebear&lt;/a&gt;s and an invader. Defeat the invader and enter the portal.\nStep 21: &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Palace\"&gt;Mohgwyn Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nExit the cave and touch the \"Palace Approaching Ledge-Road\" grace. This is your new best spot for Rune farming, either by making the bird in the nearby blood lake run of the cliff after shooting it with a bow, or by killing the Albinaurics near the grace.\nYou can skip most of the enemies here, but beware of the NPC invaders in the lake. Invasions cause you to dismount, leaving you stranded. In the lake are a bunch of useful items however: a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Seed\"&gt;Golden Seed&lt;/a&gt;, Smithing Stone 7 and 8, &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Glovewort%209\"&gt;Ghost Glovewort 9&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Haligdrake%20Talisman%20%2B2\"&gt;Haligdrake Talisman +2&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Swarm%20of%20Flies\"&gt;Swarm of Flies&lt;/a&gt; spell and the &lt;a href=\"Nomadic%20Warrior%27s%20Cookbook%2024\"&gt;Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook 24&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce ready to leave the lake behind you, ride past the Albinaurics that summon giant spirit skeletons and enter the Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum. Inside is an &lt;a href=\"Imprisoned%20Merchant\"&gt;Imprisoned Merchant&lt;/a&gt;, but there are infinitely respawning Sanguine Nobles nearby that will interrupt you while shopping. Just go further up the stairs and touch the next grace, then fight the Sanguine Noble on the altar with a small army of red Albinaurics in front. On the altar is a chest with a rare &lt;a href=\"Somber%20Ancient%20Dragon%20Smithing%20Stone\"&gt;Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone&lt;/a&gt;. \nUp the elevator right next to the altar is &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, but we're taking detour back to &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt; before fighting Mohg. If you didn't already go there, it is now time to clear the &lt;a href=\"Subterranean%20Shunning-Grounds\"&gt;Subterranean Shunning-Grounds&lt;/a&gt; beneath the capital. Finding &lt;a href=\"Mohg%27s%20Shackle\"&gt;Mohg's Shackle&lt;/a&gt; and defeating &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20the%20Omen\"&gt;Mohg, the Omen&lt;/a&gt; are the main goals, but you can also meet the &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Eater\"&gt;Dung Eater&lt;/a&gt;, fight &lt;a href=\"Esgar%2C%20Priest%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Esgar, Priest of Blood&lt;/a&gt; and visit the &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Flame%20Proscription\"&gt;Frenzied Flame Proscription&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Hyetta\"&gt;Hyetta&lt;/a&gt; is now. Do not open the door to the Frenzied Flame yet, it has an impact on the endings which we'll get to later.\nOnce you're through the Shunning Grounds, it is time to fight &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;. Equip the &lt;a href=\"Purifying%20Crystal%20Tear\"&gt;Purifying Crystal Tear&lt;/a&gt; that you got way back from &lt;a href=\"Eleonora%2C%20Violet%20Bloody%20Finger\"&gt;Eleonora, Violet Bloody Finger&lt;/a&gt; to your &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Wondrous%20Physick\"&gt;Flask of Wondrous Physick&lt;/a&gt; for this fight, it will be useful, just like &lt;a href=\"Mohg%27s%20Shackle\"&gt;Mohg's Shackle&lt;/a&gt;."}
