It is a standalone spinoff to with a greater emphasis on cooperative multiplayer, survival mechanics, and a roguelike gameplay experience. Revealed on December 12, 2024, the game is set for release in 2025 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.\nPlot.\n\"Nightreign\" takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; on a timeline parallel to the events of \"Elden Ring\", branching from the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Night%27s%20Tide\"&gt;Night's Tide&lt;/a&gt;, an encroaching wall of violet flames and relentless rain, threatens the land of &lt;a href=\"Limveld\"&gt;Limveld&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold%20%28Nightreign%29\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Nightreign%20Maiden\"&gt;blonde maiden&lt;/a&gt; in a white robe and silver mask urges the &lt;a href=\"Nightfarers\"&gt;Nightfarers&lt;/a&gt; to unite and prevent an impending catastrophe. Players must survive three nights before facing the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Lord\"&gt;Night Lord&lt;/a&gt;, who resides beyond a door on a petrified tree.\nGameplay.\n\"Elden Ring Nightreign\" delivers a fast-paced roguelike experience, playable solo or in groups of three. Players select one of eight unique classes and must survive three perilous nights in a procedurally generated world before confronting the Night Lord. The game combines cooperative survival with a shrinking safe zone, blending elements of \"Elden Ring's\" iconic design with new features to enhance replayability.\nThe compact game world draws inspiration from \"Elden Ring's\" &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt; and features randomized elements such as structure layouts, enemy placements, and environmental modifiers. Special map events, including meteoric impacts, ant swarms, and volcanic eruptions, create dynamic scenarios. &lt;a href=\"Sites%20of%20Grace\"&gt;Sites of Grace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt; return, allowing players to level up and gain abilities as they progress or fail. Additional mechanics, such as powerful ultimate abilities and new traversal options, expand gameplay possibilities. Players can summon a spectral bird to glide through the sky or scale walls by jumping.\nEach of the three nights lasts approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Players begin each run at level 1, simplifying progression and encouraging quick engagement without build optimization. The Night's Tide shrinks the safe zone each night and recedes at dawn. Players caught in the rain take damage, and while daytime deaths allow respawning, nighttime deaths do not.\nPlayable characters.\n\"Nightreign\" will offer eight playable &lt;a href=\"heroes\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; with unique abilities and impactful ultimate, each named for their character class. These classes are beginner-friendly and more easily defined, but their facial appearance may not be adjusted with the character slider. However, the armor of these characters may be customized with various cosmetics. Each hero has their own storyline and characters that were not selected can be interacted with at the Roundtable Hold. Currently, only four characters have been formally announced:\nBosses and enemies.\nThe game will feature eight new &lt;a href=\"Nightreign%20Bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;. Among the new additions is &lt;a href=\"Gladius\"&gt;Gladius&lt;/a&gt;, a monstrous hound with three heads. Several enemies and bosses return from the original game, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Hero%20of%20Zamor\"&gt;Zamor Knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20Knight\"&gt;Godrick Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Demi-Human%20Swordsman\"&gt;Demi-Human Swordsmen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Margit%2C%20the%20Fell%20Omen\"&gt;Margit, the Fell Omen&lt;/a&gt; pursues players across the map and grants a powerful &lt;a href=\"Favor%20of%20the%20Night\"&gt;Favor of the Night&lt;/a&gt; buff if defeated. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Adarksouls%3ACentipede%20Demon\"&gt;Centipede Demon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Adarksouls%3ANameless%20King\"&gt;Nameless King&lt;/a&gt; return from \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Adarksouls%3ADark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Adarksouls%3ADark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\", respectively. All encounters are randomized and defeated &lt;a href=\"Nightreign%20Enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; are not reset upon resting at a Site of Grace.\nInventory changes.\nMost items do not persist between runs. Items and gear are color-coded based on rarity. New items and weapons will be made available, including lootable skills, upgrades, and stat buffs. The inventory screens will be simplified, and up to three weapons can be equipped in each hand. Randomized passive bonuses from special weapons will persist when the item is equipped but not drawn. Weapon weight penalties and stat requirements are removed but some items have level requirements. Basic loot is shared between players, but special item drops are not. &lt;a href=\"Murk\"&gt;Murk&lt;/a&gt; can be used to purchase unlockable items that persist between runs. such as cosmetics, emotes, and build-defining &lt;a href=\"Relics\"&gt;Relics&lt;/a&gt;.\nMultiplayer.\n\"Nightreign\" is primarily designed for 3-player co-op, but offers a single-player mode with reduced enemy scaling. There are no plans for a 2-player mode at this time. The password system will return to handle private matchmaking. Multiplayer activities are no longer limited by in-game items or confined to a single area or dungeon. Players may communicate through a more robust gesture and ping system. Downed players are revived after receiving enough damage from their teammates, but game over occurs when all players are downed simultaneously. Unsuccessful runs will spawn &lt;a href=\"Red%20Phantom\"&gt;Red Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s in the worlds of others that may be defeated for valuable loot. Basic loot is shared with teammates, but special boss loot is not. The game will not include player-versus-player (PvP) elements.\nSystem requirements.\n\"Elden Ring Nightreign\" will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PC via Steam. Cross-platform multiplayer will not be available.\nDevelopment.\n\"Nightreign\" is directed by Junya Ishizaki, a veteran of FromSoftware since \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Adarksouls%3ADark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". The game retains the franchise's hallmark epic battles while introducing a faster-paced combat system. The project was green-lit by &lt;a href=\"Hidetaka%20Miyazaki\"&gt;Hidetaka Miyazaki&lt;/a&gt;, who gave creative control to Ishizaki. , who was heavily involved in the development of \"Elden Ring\", did not provide additional contributions for \"Nightreign\". The game was conceptualized while \"Elden Ring\" was still in development.\nNetwork test.\nA network test for \"Nightreign\" was announced on December 13, 2024. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test\"&gt;Registration&lt;/a&gt; begins on January 10, 2025, with testing scheduled for February 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S."}

He wears iron armor wrapped in iron thorns, which are a mark of the guilty and of those sentenced to death. He was slated for execution at the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Castle\"&gt;Shaded Castle&lt;/a&gt;, home of the family of House Marais, however he evaded death by snatching the sword from the site of his looming execution and furnished it with battle skills from his homeland. He gained the moniker \"Bell Bearing Hunter\" by killing numerous merchants and instructors, and taking their Bell Bearings.\nElemer can be encountered in the Castellan's Hall of the Shaded Castle, the site of his failed execution. He can also appear in various locations throughout the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;, typically in places where merchants can be found.\nThe Bell-Bearing Hunter will only appear when resting at night; to make him reappear after being defeated yourself, rest at the grace and set the time to night and then rest again. \nMoveset.\nCan include a separate table for a specific instance of this variant's moveset.\nBosses.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nElemer of the Briar=\nBackground.\nElemer is encountered in the hall at the top of the Shaded Castle. He can channel energy through his sword, allowing him to send it towards the player and control it at a distance, or fire a red beam by rotating it quickly.\nThe first time he is encountered he will be facing the painting at the end of the room, making a heavy initial attack such as a charged heavy attack more possible. On subsequent attempts he will be facing the entrance. \nWarmaster's Shack=\nBackground.\nThe Bell Bearing Hunter appears in Warmaster's Shack at night. He will only spawn if the player has talked to &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Bernahl\"&gt;Knight Bernahl&lt;/a&gt; and exhausted his dialogue. Bernahl will not be present while the Bell Bearing Hunter is spawned, but will reappear if the player dies or if they defeat the boss.\nChurch of Vows=\nBackground.\nThe Bell Bearing Hunter will appear inside the Church of Vows at night. To get him to spawn, speak to &lt;a href=\"Miriel%2C%20Pastor%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Miriel, Pastor of Vows&lt;/a&gt; and listen to all of his dialogue options. Miriel will not be present when the Bell Bearing Hunter appears, but will reappear if the player dies or if they defeat the boss.\nHermit Merchant's Shacks=\nBackground.\nThe Bell Bearing Hunter appears at night, in the Hermit Merchant's Shack in the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Outskirts\"&gt;Capital Outskirts&lt;/a&gt;.

One such way in which they can achieve this is by becoming the vessel of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;the Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;. \nDescription.\nThe most prominent Empyrean is Queen Marika, a &lt;a href=\"Numen\"&gt;Numen&lt;/a&gt; who became the vessel of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;, using it to found the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalenia and Miquella were born of a single god, which is indicated to be the reason that they were eligible to claim the title of Empyrean, and for the afflictions they were born with. It is likely that this is due to their parents, Marika and &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt;, being two parts of one god. Malenia is an example of an Empyrean who can become a god without being vessel to the Elden Ring, as she will become a goddess upon blooming a third time. It is unknown if other Empyreans possess their own means of godhood without the Elden Ring. \nLunar Princess Ranni is an Empyrean, and the daughter of Radagon and &lt;a href=\"Rennala%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Full%20Moon\"&gt;Queen Rennala of the Full Moon&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that being born of a single god is not a strict requirement to be an Empyrean. \nMalenia, Miquella, and Ranni, were selected during the Age of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; by their own Two Fingers to be candidates to succeed Marika.\nDuring the reign of Queen Marika, and at least the time immediately preceding it, Empyreans were chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;. The Two Fingers grant Empyreans &lt;a href=\"Shadowbound_Beast\"&gt;shadowbound beasts&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"shadows\", to serve as loyal vassals. Though incapable of treachery, shadows, against their own will, go mad if their masters resist the will of the Fingers, becoming a curse for their Empyrean. The only two shadowbound beasts currently known are &lt;a href=\"Maliketh\"&gt;Maliketh, the Black Blade&lt;/a&gt;, who serves Marika, and &lt;a href=\"Blaidd%20the%20Half-Wolf\"&gt;Blaidd the Half-Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, who serves Ranni. \nThe consort of an Empyrean holds the title of lord. &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg&lt;/a&gt; wished to take the role of monarch by becoming the consort of Miquella, whom he wished to raise to full godhood, despite Miquella already having chosen &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt; as his consort. The &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; may also gain the title of Lord by becoming the consort of Marika or Ranni.\nList of Empyreans.\nThe currently known Empyreans are:"}

The Age of Fracture, Age of Order, Age of the Duskborn and Blessing of Despair endings see The Tarnished rise as Marika's new Elden Lord of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, mending the Elden Ring, and ushering in their new Age of choice to rule over. The Age of the Stars ending sees The Tarnished aid &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt; in ousting &lt;a href=\"Marika\"&gt;Marika&lt;/a&gt; and remaining at her side as Ranni's first Elden Lord. The Lord of Frenzied Flame ending, caused by the possession of the Frenzied Flame, overrides the possibility of any other ending. The Tarnished's disregards the notion of becoming Elden Lord becoming the Lord of Frenzied Flame instead and incinerating everything that came before.\nFor The Tarnished to separate themselves from the Frenzied Flame's influence after being inherited, they must aquire &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Needle\"&gt;Miquella's Needle&lt;/a&gt; and follow its specific conditions of use. Once the Frenzied Flame is ridded, it can not be reclaimed in any way, preventing the Lord of Frenzied Flame ending.\nEnding Explanations.\nAge of Fracture.\nThe Tarnished becomes Elden Lord, fulfilling the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers's&lt;/a&gt; plans of using the Tarnished to restore the sense of stability not felt since the Elden Ring was shattered. The &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; remains in the truest state possible to what it once was and the status quo is restored.\nAge of Order.\nThe Tarnished becomes Elden Lord, fulfilling Goldmask's idea of a \"Perfect\" Golden Order, based upon his research into how it had fallen to its current state. Having realized that the imperfections of the Golden Order stemmed from the fickleness of the gods, who in fact were no better than men, Goldmask's new transcendental ideology attempts to bring true order to the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nAge of the Duskborn.\nThe Tarnished becomes Elden Lord, wielding the &lt;a href=\"Mending%20Rune%20of%20the%20Death-Prince\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt; born from &lt;a href=\"Fia%2C%20Deathbed%20Companion\"&gt;Fia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Prince of Death's&lt;/a&gt; union. Just as the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; had been created by confining &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Destined Death&lt;/a&gt;, the Tarnished creates a new order of death restored. The principle of life in death is embeded within this order, and &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt; are allowed to live in peace.\nBlessing of Despair.\nThe Tarnished becomes Elden Lord, fulfilling the Dung Eater's twisted vision of a cursed world. All will become cursed, thus none can be scorned, which despite its radicalism, does bring order back to the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nAge of the Stars.\nThe Tarnished helps Ranni fulfil her vision of a Lands Between without the Golden Order by allowing her to replace &lt;a href=\"Marika\"&gt;Marika&lt;/a&gt; in godhood and taking the role of her consort. Ranni ushers in a new order not of gold, but of the stars and moon of the chill night. Rather than make herself and her order objects of worship, she chooses instead to keep her order and the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; at a great divide, removing the certainties that had existed during Marika's rule. \nThe Tarnished and Ranni leave the Lands Between, embarking on a thousand year voyage into darkness under the wisdom of the Moon. \nLord of Frenzied Flame.\nRather than become Elden Lord, The Tarnished becomes the Lord of Frenzied Flame, fulfilling the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Shabriri\"&gt;Shabriri&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Fingers\"&gt;Three Fingers's&lt;/a&gt; will. The Tarnished is left almost completely alone, the Frenzied Flame rapidly consuming everything in existence.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt; was not sacrificed, she is seen vowing to hunt down and kill the Tarnished for not heeding her earlier warnings.\nChoosing an Ending.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;final boss&lt;/a&gt; is slain, they will return alone to a room with Marika's statue and a Grace. Ranni's summon sign will also appear on the ground close by to the Marika's statue, if Ranni's questline has been completed. The Tarnished will now have the option to choose their ending by interacting with Marika's statue, or, if present, Ranni's summon sign. If The Tarnished possesses the Frenzied Flame, Ranni's summon sign will not appear unless the Frenzied Flame is ridden by &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Needle\"&gt;Miquella's Needle&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, the only option will be to interact with Marika's statue, and the Lord of Frenzied Flame ending will automatically begin, offering no alternative choice at all.\nInteracting with Marika's statue without the Frenzied Flame will allow The Tarnished to choose from one of three possible mending runes to repair the Elden Ring that can obtained during their adventures. Once the respective rune has been chosen, the Age of Order, Age of the Duskborn, or Blessing of Despair ending will begin. A fourth option to \"Mend the Elden Ring\" without a rune is always available, and if chosen, results in the Age of Fracture ending. \nIf present, interacting with the Ranni's summon sign, instead of Marika's statue, will begin the Age of the Stars ending. \nIn all cases, the nearby Grace can be used to teleport anywhere else and return later, allowing the ending to be postponed and play to continue.\nTo begin a New Game+, an ending must be chosen. To then do so, after the end credits, select \"Begin Journey X\" or later at the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt; Grace if New Game+ is not originally selected.\nGallery.\nTBA"}

It will also affect the amount of invincibility frames and recovery frames, with heavier equipped loads affecting them negatively. More specifically, Light Load rolls and Medium Load rolls are equally effective and have the same recovery time, but the former will roll a longer distance. Heavy Load rolls meanwhile face an almost twice as long recovery animation, leaving the Tarnished very vulnerable to follow-up attacks. \nEquipped items totalling less than 30% of the maximum equip load is considered a Light Load.

It was thought that the blessed sap of the Erdtree would drip from its boughs forever, but that age of plenty swiftly came to a close, and with time, the Erdtree became more an object of faith.\nErdtree burial.\nErdtree burial was an honor awarded to heroes as a proper death meant returning to the Erdtree. The remains of such champions were deposited within the catacombs built around the great tree roots that once connected to the Erdtree. Indeed there were once heroes abundantly blessed by the Erdtree who upon earning their honors simply died. Statues of &lt;a href=\"Rosus%2C%20Usher%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rosus, Usher of Death&lt;/a&gt;, were erected in order to guide the dead who lose their way during their return to the Erdtree roots.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;, a stolen fragment of the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; was used to murder &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt;. As a hero and the first &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; to die, Godwyn's body was buried deep beneath &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deeproot%20Depths\"&gt;Deeproot Depths&lt;/a&gt; overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Eternal%20City\"&gt;Nameless Eternal City&lt;/a&gt;. Although his soul has perished, his body did not, and his Erdtree burial enabled the Rune of Death to spread throughout the great tree roots, sprouting in the form of &lt;a href=\"Deathroot\"&gt;Deathroot&lt;/a&gt; across the Lands Between. Deathroot violated the catacombs and gave rise to &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;, who refused the Erdtree's call to return. At some point, either before or after the Elden Ring was shattered, the connection between the Erdtree and the great tree roots was severed.\nThe Shattering.\n&lt;a href=\"Minor%20Erdtree\"&gt;Minor Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;s were considered to be the offspring of the Erdtree. After the Elden Ring was shattered, &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Seed\"&gt;golden seeds&lt;/a&gt; flew from the Erdtree and scattered across the Lands Between, as if life itself knew that its end had come. It used to be believed that Erdtree seeds could not exist, as the Erdtree was once perfect and eternal. &lt;a href=\"Erdtree%20Avatar\"&gt;Erdtree Avatars&lt;/a&gt; emerged following the shattering of the Elden Ring, determined to protect the withering Erdtree's offspring. Illusory trees, or phantom trees, also grew from the scattered golden seeds. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Gold\"&gt;Wrath of Gold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"incantation\"&gt;incantation&lt;/a&gt; was discovered, and feared as a sign of the Erdtree's wrath.\nQueen Marika was imprisoned inside the Erdtree after she shattered the Elden Ring. At some point following the shattering of the Elden Ring, the entrance to the Erdtree was blocked by impenetrable thorns, emblazoned with the seal of &lt;a href=\"Radagon%20of%20the%20Golden%20Order\"&gt;King Consort Radagon&lt;/a&gt;, which prevent access to anyone outside. The Flame of Ruin was capable of burning the Erdtree and destroying the impenetrable thorns, but doing so was long held to be the first cardinal sin.\nPresent.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott, the Omen King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished\"&gt;The Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; attempted to enter the Erdtree to repair the Elden Ring, become Marika's consort, and ascend as &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were unable to enter due to the &lt;a href=\"Impenetrable%20Thorns%20%28Sorcery%29\"&gt;impenetrable thorns&lt;/a&gt;. The Tarnished then traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; to rekindle the Flame of Ruin and burn the Erdtree, either by sacrificing &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt; (as was her duty as the kindling maiden) or by using the &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt;. This journey eventually led them to &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Crumbling Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt;, where the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%2C%20the%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;Maliketh, the Black Blade&lt;/a&gt; unbound the Rune of Death, enabling them to enter the burning Erdtree."}

However, Godfrey stopped Serosh, thanked him for his service, before killing him.

Certain Empyreans are granted their own shadow by the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, vassals of the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt;. Shadowbound Beasts are loyal to their Empyrean, however, should their Empyrean reject the path presented by the Two Fingers, the shadow will go mad, and become a terrible curse known as a Baleful Shadow. \nOverview.\nAccording to the old legends, wolves are shadows of the Empyrean. \nThe first named Shadowbound Beast is &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%2C%20the%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;Maliketh, the Black Blade&lt;/a&gt;, who became the loyal shadow and half-brother of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;. However, her sole need of her shadow was a vessel to lock away &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Destined Death&lt;/a&gt;, which was harboured in his sword after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Gloam-Eyed%20Queen\"&gt;Gloam-Eyed Queen&lt;/a&gt;. After a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt; he sealed the rune within his own body so that none could steal Death again. When the stolen fragment sprouted in the form of &lt;a href=\"Deathroot\"&gt;Deathroot&lt;/a&gt; throughout the Lands Between, he would attempt to recover it under the alias &lt;a href=\"Gurranq%2C%20Beast%20Clergyman\"&gt;Gurranq, Beast Clergyman&lt;/a&gt; by consuming the Deathroot. \nThe other named Shadowbound Beast is &lt;a href=\"Blaidd%20the%20Half-Wolf\"&gt;Blaidd the Half-Wolf&lt;/a&gt;. Blaidd was approved by &lt;a href=\"Rennala%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Full%20Moon\"&gt;Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon&lt;/a&gt; and given to her daughter, the Empyrean &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt;, at a young age. He became her stepbrother and they grew up together. In defiance of the fate he was born into, he swore to serve no other master but Ranni, assisting her in her rebellion against the Two Fingers. Against his own will, Blaidd would eventually succumb to becoming a Baleful Shadow, but in his final moments gave himself to Ranni. \nAlthough all Shadows who turn on their Empyreans are considered Baleful Shadows, there are particular &lt;a href=\"Baleful%20Shadow\"&gt;Baleful Shadows&lt;/a&gt; that are assassins of the Two Fingers. The last of the Baleful Shadows is killed by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ainsel%20River\"&gt;Ainsel River&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch's&lt;/a&gt; quest. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Vargram%20the%20Raging%20Wolf\"&gt;Vargram the Raging Wolf&lt;/a&gt; aspired to become a wolf and shadow of an Empyrean.

Unlike the other Shardbearers she is not a demigod, and the Great Rune in her possession is contained in the amber egg that was gifted to her by her former husband &lt;a href=\"Radagon%20of%20the%20Golden%20Order\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt;. Rennala also did not participate in the Shattering due to being locked inside &lt;a href=\"Raya%20Lucaria%20Grand%20Library\"&gt;Raya Lucaria Grand Library&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy's&lt;/a&gt; mages rebelled against the Carian Royals. Lastly, when the Tarnished confronts Rennala, their battle is interrupted by Ranni the Witch, who conjures a phantom of Rennala in her prime from the amber egg, which the Tarnished defeats instead."}

With Radagon's departure, Rennala left heartbroken. Realizing that their queen was no champion, the Academy of Raya Lucaria rebelled against the Carian Royal Family and Rennala was locked away in the academy's grand library, after she faced an assault from her own students.\nAfter Rennala was disposed, a Liurnian civil war erupted between the Carians and their retainers and the Academy and the Cuckoo Knights. As their chosen symbol is a Cuckoo bird, its shrewd gaze represents the knights' refusal to be mere servants of the Academy. The Cuckoos have free rein to wage war if they pleased and they gained an infamous reputation for their rapacious ways.\nThey use \"faux sorceries\" and were taught lesser spells by the Academy of Raya Lucaria as part of their contract. During that time, the Carians, meanwhile, prepared in secrecy against the Academy for its betrayal, in which they devise sorceries that could dispel incoming spells and &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Retaliation\"&gt;retaliate&lt;/a&gt; with glintblades.\nSiege.\nAs the civil war raged on, the Knights of the Cuckoo eventually launched a surprise assault on Caria Manor, in which they lay siege to the castle. Though the Carians were taken of guard, however, their strength had not waned. Using their magic, they repelled the Cuckoos by conjuring a powerful and enchanted snare. The Cuckoo Knights and Soldiers who got caught in the snare caused their souls to become trapped in Caria Manor as puppets."}

He also became acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Seluvis\"&gt;Preceptor Seluvis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dolores%20the%20Sleeping%20Arrow%20Puppet\"&gt;Dolores the Sleeping Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, although he and Seluvis would go their separate ways because of Dolores. \nAt some point, Gideon engaged in a long exchange with the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, and in doing so learned that everything- including the Erdtree and the Two Fingers themselves- had been broken. He also glimpsed into the will of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;, shuddering in fear at an end that should not be. He concluded from this that the queen wished for the Tarnished to struggle eternally.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt; makes their way to the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the first in a long time, Gideon is initially dismissive of them, welcoming them to the Hold but calling them a mere visitor. Gideon encourages the Tarnished to seek a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain audience with the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt; and be welcomed as a proper member of the Roundtable Hold. \nTrue to his word, Gideon inducts them as a true member of the Roundtable upon their meeting with the Two Fingers, and shares with them some of the information he has amassed on the &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;Shardbearers&lt;/a&gt;. \nAlthough Gideon had amassed knowledge on many of the shardbearers, he had not ascertained the whereabouts of four demigods: &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia, Blade of Miquella&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella of the Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;. In his search for the latter, he sends his men to ransack the &lt;a href=\"Village%20of%20the%20Albinaurics\"&gt;Village of the Albinaurics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that the Albinaurics possess half of a &lt;a href=\"Haligtree%20Secret%20Medallion%20%28Right%29\"&gt;secret medallion&lt;/a&gt; that would open the path to the Haligtree. The slaughter of the Albinaurics causes Nepheli to lose faith in him, which causes him to abandon her. He also sought &lt;a href=\"Latenna\"&gt;Latenna&lt;/a&gt;, an Albinauric woman with knowledge of the location of the other half of the medallion. If the Tarnished claims one half of the medallion, Gideon's underling &lt;a href=\"Ensha%20of%20the%20Royal%20Remains\"&gt;Ensha&lt;/a&gt; will ambush them in Roundtable Hold, apparently of his own volition. After Ensha is defeated, Gideon compensates the Tarnished by sharing the possible whereabouts of the medallion's other half.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; rejects the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to contemplate journeying to the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Forge of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; to burn the thorns barring entry into the Erdtree, Gideon encourages them to take no heed of the Fingers' warning that this would be a cardinal sin. He also offers to reward the Tarnished for any information they can deliver on the four great runes whose locations are unknown. If the Tarnished pursues this quest to its ending, finding the cocoon of &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Dynasty%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;, Gideon thanks them, declaring that this is one of the last pieces he needs to put everything together.\nAfter the Tarnished burns the Erdtree and unseals the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt;, Gideon makes his way to &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Ashen%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Ashen Capital&lt;/a&gt;, where he confronts the Tarnished in the Erdtree Sanctuary. Upon his defeat, he warns them that a Tarnished could not become a Lord, and that a man cannot kill a god.\nCharacter Information.\nSir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing is a boss encounter in Leyndell, Ashen Capital. He utilises both sorceries and incantations in combat, and learns new spells depending on whether you have defeated &lt;a href=\"Rykard%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blasphemy\"&gt;Rykard&lt;/a&gt;, Malenia, or Mohg. He only has seven memory slots, and knows six spells by default, meaning that the spells learned by defeating the aforementioned bosses can replace his default spells. If two of these bosses have been defeated, Gideon will lose Comet Azur. If all three have been defeated, he will lose Triple Rings of Light.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

As they are part of &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt; they are also very weak to certain holy based attacks such as the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Epitaph\"&gt;Golden Epitaph&lt;/a&gt;, , and &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Water%20Pot\"&gt;Holy Water Pot&lt;/a&gt;. \nAll skeletons also carry a trait unique to this enemy type where they do not die immediately upon having their health reduced to zero. Instead, after a few seconds, their remains begin to glow white and they can be finished off with any damage, or else they resurrect after another few seconds, now with full health. \nThis resurrection mechanics can be skipped by killing them with certain weapons more effective against &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere is also a version of the regular Skeleton variant, found only in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Catacombs\"&gt;Black Knife Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;, who cannot be finished off when defeated. Instead, they can only be dealt with permanently by killing one of the nearby Necromancer variant &lt;a href=\"Commoner\"&gt;Commoner&lt;/a&gt;s that otherwise keep them \"alive\". \nVariants.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVariant Description.\nSkeleton warriors found only on the surface (and within &lt;a href=\"Sage%27s%20Cave\"&gt;Sage's Cave&lt;/a&gt;) they carry a wide variety of weapons and clothes that help distinguish them from each other. They can be found in graveyards all across the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; and many of them are linked to local &lt;a href=\"Tibia%20Mariner\"&gt;Tibia Mariners&lt;/a&gt;, meaning should certain local Mariner's be felled, then the presence of these skeletons may fade from several nearby graveyards as a result.\nNotes.\nThese enemies are often encountered in groups, with Grave Wardens and Crossbow Militiamen providing range support while Knights close in from the front while blocking attacks and Bandits use their jump attacks. \nVariant Description.\nHeavily built skeletons wielding greataxes and halberds, they have much greater poise than normal skeletons and will attack sequentially as long a Tarnished remains near. \nVariant Description.\nSkeletons with golden bones, they share most of their moveset with the normal counterparts however with the addition of an attack that involves them gliding around the air like a kite while spewing magic gas beneath them. They've also shed most of their frailty against holy damage.\nNotes.\nAs these are so similar to the base variant of the skeleton, their sudden flight is likely to prove quite a scare when first encountered. Additionally, their existence is largely limited to one graveyard in &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt; that is just east of &lt;a href=\"Hermit%20Merchant%20%28Capital%20Outskirts%29\"&gt;Hermit Merchant (Capital Outskirts)&lt;/a&gt;. \nVariant Description.\nSame as the normal Skeleton variant, except only encountered in &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Crumbling Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt;. \nVariant Description.\nThese skeleton boasts most of the same moveset as their humanoid counterpart, however they have additional fire breath attacks, slightly more resilience to Holy Damage but less resilience to Fire Damage. \nVariant Description.\nThese skeletons are found exclusively in &lt;a href=\"Catacombs\"&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hero%27s%20Graves\"&gt;Hero's Graves&lt;/a&gt;. They carry no vestigial remains of clothes or armor of any kind and are generally distinguished from each other purely depending on the weapons they carry.\nDrops.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Yura warns them to stay away from the lake, where the mighty dragon &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Dragon%20Agheel\"&gt;Agheel&lt;/a&gt; roosts. He will however offer his aid in hunting Agheel, and if the Tarnished slays the beast, will inform them of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Dragon%20Communion\"&gt;Church of Dragon Communion&lt;/a&gt; and warn them about the dangers of seeking the power of dragons. \nWhen the Tarnished is ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Finger%20Nerijus\"&gt;Bloody Finger Nerijus&lt;/a&gt;, Yura intervenes and helps them kill him.

Yura manages to slice off one of her fingers, but receives a mortal wound.

However, he is fairly easy to knock around with a two-handed or heavy weapon; his poise is low due to his light armor set. If needing assistance, run back towards the bridge area to buy some time for &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Finger%20Hunter%20Yura\"&gt;Bloody Finger Hunter Yura&lt;/a&gt; to spawn in, who'll help assist in fighting Nerijus, though he can still be killed by Nerijus.

{"id": "12163", "revid": "5170510", "url": "https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12163", "title": "Bloody Fingers", "text": "The Bloody Fingers are a covenant of invaders from &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg the Lord of Blood's&lt;/a&gt; burgeoning &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mohgwyn Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. By his will, these bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; hunt their own.\nOverview.\nThis group of Tarnished is similar in practice to the &lt;a href=\"Recusants\"&gt;Recusants&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor\"&gt;Volcano Manor&lt;/a&gt;, in that Bloody Fingers seek out and kill other Tarnished throughout the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. However, they seem to differ in long-term goals as well as rites of induction. To become a Bloody Finger, one must be inducted via a process overseen by a White Mask, such as &lt;a href=\"White%20Mask%20Varr%C3%A9\"&gt;Varr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. The first step is to prove their dedication to their Lord's cause by hunting fellow Tarnished, using fetishes made from &lt;a href=\"Furled%20Finger\"&gt;Furled Finger&lt;/a&gt;s blackened with &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Loss\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; congestion, to invade their worlds as blood-red phantoms; these seem to have been chopped off rather unceremoniously. Killing one &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Fingers\"&gt;Host of Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, or attempting to do so at least three times, is enough to pass this step. Next, the inductee must stain a special cloth, the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Blood%27s%20Favor\"&gt;Lord of Blood's Favor&lt;/a&gt;, in the blood of a Tarnished's &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Maidens\"&gt;Finger Maiden&lt;/a&gt;. One need not necessarily kill a maiden, let alone their own maiden, to do so, as long as they can obtain the blood. With this done, it can be brought to the White Mask. \nThe initiate, now a formal Bloody Finger, is then given one last blessing: the Lord of Blood's own glistening blood, siphoned into the nail of their finger. This &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Finger\"&gt;Bloody Finger&lt;/a&gt;'s skin becomes sickly pale and loses feeling, although the nail aches with sweetest pain. The process is agonizing, but it gives the ability to invade other worlds as often as they like without the need for the consumable fingers. Over time, the inductee begins to fall to \"cessblood\", an infection-like condition that causes an onset of bloodlust and insanity, removing any inhibition that would prevent the Bloody Finger from killing their fellow Tarnished with a zealous devotion to Mohg.\nThe new Bloody Finger may also be given a &lt;a href=\"Pureblood%20Knight%27s%20Medal\"&gt;Pureblood Knight's Medal&lt;/a&gt;, with the power as to gain an audience with Mohg himself, when the time is right; obtaining one sometimes requires the White Mask to go out of their way to ontain it.\nThere are those that hunt the Bloody Fingers in return, however: &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Finger%20Hunter%20Yura\"&gt;Yura&lt;/a&gt; is one such warrior seeking to put an end to their cessblood. The group has taken notice of this, however, and sent assassins after him.\nTrivia.\n&lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Noble\"&gt;Sanguine Nobles&lt;/a&gt;, who have ties to the Bloody Fingers and Mohg, are noted to have curly black horns similar to his coming from their head and their feet, as well as sporting claws. Given that Cessblood seems to use his blood, this process appears capable of partially transforming someone, over time, into an Omen or at least taking on Omen traits."}

Her ability to create garments from scratch surpassed even the royal seamsters of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;.

She taught him the art of tailoring, inspiring his deep desire to follow in her footsteps.\nThough Boc struggled with his appearance, his mother was the only one who called him beautiful, giving him a sense of self-worth that he clung to throughout his life. Her memory drove him to perfect his skills, always striving to live up to the talent and kindness she embodied.\nCharacteristics.\nBoc's mother was a &lt;a href=\"Demi-Humans\"&gt;demi-human&lt;/a&gt; with deft hands. Her compassionate voice was recorded by a &lt;a href=\"Prattling%20Pate%20%22You%27re%20beautiful%22\"&gt;Prattling Pate&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Hermit%20Village\"&gt;Hermit Village&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt.

He offers the player the ability to &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Adjustment\"&gt;modify&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;garments&lt;/a&gt;, free of charge.\nOverview.\nBoc is a &lt;a href=\"Demi-Humans\"&gt;demi-human&lt;/a&gt; seamster from &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;. He was very close to his &lt;a href=\"Boc%27s%20Mother\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;, a seamstress, until her passing. Inspired by her, Boc aspired to follow in her footsteps and inherited her &lt;a href=\"Tailoring%20Tools\"&gt;sewing kit&lt;/a&gt;. He lived with a demi-human tribe in a &lt;a href=\"Coastal%20Cave\"&gt;Coastal Cave&lt;/a&gt; on the western coast of Limgrave, but at some point, he was cast out by his &lt;a href=\"Demi-Human%20Chief\"&gt;kin&lt;/a&gt;. Lost and isolated, Boc was transformed into a bush by a &lt;a href=\"Spells\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; came across Boc and broke the spell, freeing him. Grateful, Boc offered to sneak back into the cave where he had been exiled to retrieve something precious with which to repay his champion. However, his former tribe discovered him and beat him mercilessly. When the champion found Boc again, he warned them not to enter the cave. Ignoring his warning, the champion avenged Boc and recovered his mother's cherished &lt;a href=\"Sewing%20Needle\"&gt;sewing needle&lt;/a&gt;. Moved by their kindness, Boc vowed to become a seamster like his mother.\nBoc next encounters the champion in &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, where he humbly offers his services as the champion's personal seamster. He will trace the champion's footsteps, following them to the &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;the Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;. Boc remains in awe of his master, and as the Tarnished champion draws closer to the throne of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, Boc will begin to refer to them as a lord. \nEven though Boc is given a golden needle worthy of a master seamster, allowing him to perform modifications to the grab of the demigods themselves, Boc remains terribly self-conscious and bothered by his appearance. He asks his master whether they think he is ugly and expresses an interest in being reborn by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Rennala\"&gt;Queen Rennala&lt;/a&gt;. Should the Tarnished champion aid Boc in fulfilling his wish to be reborn, Boc will travel to the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt; and will be reborn a human through her powers. However, like many of those reborn by Rennala, the process goes awry, and Boc dies shortly thereafter.\nInstead, the Tarnished champion may find a &lt;a href=\"Prattling%20Pate%20%22You%27re%20Beautiful%22\"&gt;Prattling Pate&lt;/a&gt; which speaks with the voice of Boc's deceased mother, and tells him he's beautiful. Upon hearing this, Boc will be contented and will continue faithfully serving his lord. \nDialogue.\n\"Note: This dialogue includes variations for Boc calling the player master (\u3054\u4e3b\u4eba\u3055\u307e) and lord (\u308f\u304c\u738b\u3088).\"\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

A health bar and the boss's name appear prominently at the bottom of the screen. Bosses yield a larger amount of &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt; when defeated, and their &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; rewards are added directly to the inventory.

If the player is defeated, they may be required to pass through a fog gate to rechallenge the boss. Some difficult bosses may be encountered early on, which can drive player exploration.\nMandatory bosses.\nOver two hundred bosses are available to fight, but only a few must be beaten to finish the game.

He can be given prayerbooks in exchange for access to an array of Incantations.\nOverview.\nBrother Corhyn is a cleric of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Corhyn made his way to &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where he teaches the incantations of the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt; to Tarnished of the Roundtable, hoping that one of them might one day claim the title of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, so that Corhyn might council them. When a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt; makes their way to the Roundtable, Corhyn introduces himself to them, and offers his tutelage. Corhyn will even teach the champion heretical incantations, from outside the line of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, though he does so reluctantly.\nAfter the Tarnished champion opens the way to the &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, Corhyn announces that he is departing the Roundtable to search for the legendary &lt;a href=\"Goldmask\"&gt;Goldmask&lt;/a&gt;, an eminent scholar of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;. While searching for Goldmask, Corhyn continues his own investigations into the nature of the Golden Order, and while he makes some advancements, he also becomes aware of how little he truly knows. With guidance from the Tarnished champion, Corhyn is united with Goldmask.\nCorhyn takes it upon himself to become Goldmask's disciple and to chronicle his wisdom, deciphering the meaning behind every minute movement made by the mute Goldmask. The process goes well, until Goldmask's movements suddenly cease, as he is confounded by the nature of &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt;. The Tarnished champion may solve the riddle, revealing to Goldmask that Radagon and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; are in fact one and the same, allowing Corhyn to continue his work.\nGoldmask leads his disciple to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Lands\"&gt;Forbidden Lands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, where none may tread. Corhyn continues his duty, but begins to doubt his master. He detects in his movements that Goldmask has begun to suspect the holism of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, an unacceptable heresy in Corhyn's mind. Corhyn continues to serve his master, but is tormented by doubt.\nAfter the Tarnished champion unleashes the flame of the giants to burn the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, Corhyn is found in the ashen ruins of &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;. Corhyn denounces his master as nothing more than a madman, who rejected the perfection of the Golden Order and sought to replace it with his own \"perfected\" order. As the Erdtree burns above him, Corhyn loses his mind. Alternatively, Corhyn may be offered the Tonic of Forgetfulness, causing him to remain in the Mountaintops, seemingly unaware that Goldmask has returned to Leyndell. \nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "12158", "revid": "44564686", "url": "https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12158", "title": "Buff", "text": "Buffs are effects applied by a Tarnished to either themself or to themself and their allies, and are used to strengthen offence or defence. \nThey primarily come in three categories: Weapon Buffs, Body Buffs, and Aura Buffs. \nWeapon Buffs.\nAll Weapon Buffs are self-targeted, and almost all of them have only offensive benefits, with very few exceptions. They cannot be applied to any type of ranged weapon or casting implement, and only a few specific ones can be used on shields. \nIt's possible to keep two weapons buffed at the same time by two-handing the left-hand weapon and using either a Grease or a Skill on it, then stopping the two-handing so that the right-hand weapon also can be buffed with either a Grease or a Skill. It isn't necessary to use the same buff category for both weapons. \nSome weapons are buffable and some aren't. As a general rule, weapons upgraded with &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20Stones\"&gt;Smithing Stones&lt;/a&gt; are buffable while weapons upgraded with &lt;a href=\"Somber%20Smithing%20Stones\"&gt;Somber Smithing Stones&lt;/a&gt; aren't buffable unless their innate skill grants them a weapon buff. Exceptions to this rule are the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Knife\"&gt;Crystal Knife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Sickle\"&gt;Ivory Sickle&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20Stones\"&gt;Smithing Stone&lt;/a&gt; weapons that aren't buffable, and the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhound%27s%20Fang\"&gt;Bloodhound's Fang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Treespear\"&gt;Treespear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varr%C3%A9%27s%20Bouquet\"&gt;Varr\u00e9's Bouquet&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href=\"Somber%20Smithing%20Stones\"&gt;Somber Smithing Stone&lt;/a&gt; weapon that are buffable. \nAdditionally, weapons equipped with affinities that aren't either Standard, Heavy, Keen, or Quality also aren't buffable except for with the &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt;s that are compatible with those affinities, with no exceptions. \nFor Weapon Buffs that are also either &lt;a href=\"Sorceries\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Incantations\"&gt;Incantations&lt;/a&gt;, they can only be cast on right-handed weapons (or left-handed shields for the shield-specific ones). \nBody Buffs.\nMost Body Buffs are self-targeted and defensive in their benefits, but some, primarily those that are the upgraded form of weaker Body Buffs, also grant their benefits to nearby allies. A scant few are instead focused on increasing the caster's offensive strength. \nAura Buffs.\nAll Aura Buffs target both the caster and their nearby allies, and most, with the exception of some offense-only Aura Buffs, provide both offensive and defensive benefits."}

They originated from the mist-laden region in the west of the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Carian royal family would reach its peak under &lt;a href=\"Rennala%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Full%20Moon\"&gt;Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon&lt;/a&gt;. In her youth, she was a prominent champion who would go on to charm the academy with her lunar magic, becoming its master. She also led the &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Knights\"&gt;Glintstone Knights&lt;/a&gt; and established the house of Caria as royalty. \nBackground.\nThe Carian Royals have always been closely associated with the western coast of Liurnia, which is the location of their estate, the &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Manor\"&gt;Caria Manor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Sisters\"&gt;Three Sisters&lt;/a&gt; immediately behind it. Another location of importance was the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Study%20Hall\"&gt;Carian Study Hall&lt;/a&gt;, a large library in eastern Liurnia that connects to the &lt;a href=\"Regions\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Tower%20of%20Liurnia\"&gt;Divine Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Carian royals were served by magic &lt;a href=\"preceptors\"&gt;preceptors&lt;/a&gt; notable for large &lt;a href=\"Preceptor%27s%20Big%20Hat\"&gt;hats&lt;/a&gt; with the movements of the stars drawn on the inside of the brim, as well as on their bright blue gowns. All &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Sorcerers\"&gt;glintstone sorcerers&lt;/a&gt; are the descendants of &lt;a href=\"Astrologer\"&gt;Astrologer&lt;/a&gt;s, a fact that the Carians remained aware of. The astrologers preceded the sorcerers and had established themselves in &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;mountaintops&lt;/a&gt; that nearly touched the sky, and considered the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giant\"&gt;Fire Giant&lt;/a&gt;s their neighbors. They would read fate in the &lt;a href=\"stars\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt;, but alas, the night sky no longer cradles fate. \nHowever, the Carian royal family were mostly known for the famous &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Knight\"&gt;enchanted knights&lt;/a&gt; that served them. These enchanted knights, anointed by the Lunar Queen, were heroes of the highest honors, and served as direct retainers to the kingdom's princesses. Their &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Knight%27s%20Sword\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; were embedded with blue glintstone, and could serve as &lt;a href=\"catalysts\"&gt;catalysts&lt;/a&gt;, letting them wield sorcerous battle &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s. Despite numbering fewer than twenty, this power made them a match for even the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;champions of gold&lt;/a&gt; in battle. They combined this art with their swordsmanship to maintain pressure upon their foes, striking in waves of steel and sorcery. The Carian knights never wavered, and even had sorceries that could alleviate the buildup of &lt;a href=\"sleep\"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"madness\"&gt;madness&lt;/a&gt;. There were also enchanted &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Knight\"&gt;troll knights&lt;/a&gt; among their number, comrades of young Rennala, bound by oath. They were called into service when the Queen invoked an oath they swore. These &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s were treated as true knights of Caria, and would fight arm in arm with their human comrades. \nThe famous &lt;a href=\"Loretta%2C%20Knight%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Loretta&lt;/a&gt; was once a royal &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Knights\"&gt;Carian knight&lt;/a&gt;, and served as a personal guard to Carian royalty. Despite fighting mounted and using a &lt;a href=\"Loretta%27s%20War%20Sickle\"&gt;war sickle&lt;/a&gt;, her favored weapon was said to be the bow, and she developed sorceries imitating the power of a greatbow. She would leave her service in search of a haven for &lt;a href=\"Albinaurics\"&gt;Albinaurics&lt;/a&gt;, but an &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Knight%20Loretta\"&gt;apparition&lt;/a&gt; of her remains to defend Caria Manor to this day. Several Albinauric mages, such as &lt;a href=\"Pidia%2C%20Carian%20Servant\"&gt;Pidia&lt;/a&gt;, remained as servants to the Carian royal family, seemingly facing less persecution there then in other parts of the Lands Between. \nThe oldest sorcery devised by the Carians would conjure a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Glintblade\"&gt;Magic Glintblade&lt;/a&gt;, and it would serve as a prototype for more enhanced &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Phalanx\"&gt;sword-phalanx&lt;/a&gt; sorceries wielded by royal enchanted knights. They also created sorceries that would conjure magic swords that could &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Greatsword\"&gt;sweep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Slicer\"&gt;slice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Piercer\"&gt;pierce&lt;/a&gt; their enemies. Some sorceries were said to have been taught to them by the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Crystalian\"&gt;Crystalian&lt;/a&gt;s, to mark the swearing of an old concord.\nDue to the influence of the Carians, the study of the &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Current\"&gt;primeval current&lt;/a&gt; was forbidden at the Academy of Raya Lucaria. However, the &lt;a href=\"Lazuli%20Conspectus\"&gt;Lazuli Conspectus&lt;/a&gt; would eventually developed in the academy. The scholars of this &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria%20Conspectuses\"&gt;conspectus&lt;/a&gt; sought to master Carian sorcery, and viewed the moon as equal to the stars. This would be seen as a heterodox pursuit, or even outright heresy, by their colleagues at the academy.\nHistory.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; established her new Age of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, she dispatched a champion known as &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt; to lead her armies against the lands of Liurnia. Not much was known about Radagon before he joined the ranks in the &lt;a href=\"Liurnian%20Wars\"&gt;Liurnian Wars&lt;/a&gt;, but he was seen as a great champion with flowing red locks, and he would lead a great golden host to Liurnia, where he would meet Rennala in battle. \nRadagon would fight two wars against Rennala and the Academy, both of which saw no clear victor. Instead, Radagon eventually repented his territorial aggressions by cleansing himself with &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Dew\"&gt;Celestial Dew&lt;/a&gt;, swore his love to Rennala and became the husband of the Carian Queen. \nHe married her at the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Church of Vows&lt;/a&gt;, and it would be this matrimonial union, and reconciliation between the houses of the Erdtree and the Full Moon that would eventually have grave consequences for the Carians, as it was during the age of the Erdtree, that Carian astrology withered on the vine, as the fate once writ in the night skies had been fettered by the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nRennala would bequeath Radagon with a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, to honor a long standing tradition in which a Moon Greatsword is bestowed by a Carian queen upon her spouse. Upon entering into marriage with Rennala and joining the Carian line, Radagon would order Carian magic preceptors to don masks of confidence, to make it clear that all of their matters were to be kept strictly private. While husband to Rennala, he studied glintstone sorcery taught at the Academy. Together, Radagon and Rennala would go on to have three children: &lt;a href=\"Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rykard\"&gt;Rykard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ranni\"&gt;Ranni&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, was hounded from the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;, Radagon left Rennala to become the second husband and King Consort of Queen Marika, and would receive the title of second Elden Lord. Queen Marika made Radagon's and Rennala's children her demigod stepchildren. When Radagon left, Rennala's heart left with him. Realizing their heartbroken queen was no champion at all, the Academy rebelled against the Carian royal family and Rennala would find herself under the assault of her own students, who would eventually lock her away in the grand library.\nLiurnia would descend into civil war, with the Carians and their retainers on one side, and the Academy and its Knights of the Cuckoo on the other. The soldiers of Raya Lucaria were known as the Cuckoos, as their symbol was a peering cuckoo bird, the bird's shrewd gaze an expression of their refusal to be mere servants of the academy. They were given free rein by the scholars of the academy to wage war as they pleased, and they were infamous for their rapacious ways\".\" The Knights of the Cuckoo would use \"faux sorceries\" and would be taught lesser spells by the academy as payment for their contract. Meanwhile, the Carian royal family had secretly been preparing against the disloyalty of the academy by devising sorceries that could dispel incoming spells and &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Retaliation\"&gt;retaliate&lt;/a&gt; with glintblades. The moon and stars would go their separate ways. \nThe war would eventually lead to the siege of Caria Manor. The Carians were taken of guard, but their strength had not yet fully waned, and they managed to repel the onslaught by conjuring a powerful enchanted snare that remains potent to this day.\nCurrent Events.\nAs the Lands Between fell into disarray, the last Carian Princess, Ranni, made her way back to her family's ancestral home, where she would gather her allies and vassals in order to set her own plans into motion. Her vassals included her faithful shadow, the Half-Wolf &lt;a href=\"Blaidd\"&gt;Blaidd&lt;/a&gt;, her families old troll blacksmith &lt;a href=\"War%20Counselor%20Iji\"&gt;Iji&lt;/a&gt;, who was now her war counsellor, as well as &lt;a href=\"Seluvis\"&gt;Seluvis&lt;/a&gt;, a preceptor in the sorcerous arts. She also won the loyalty of &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Dragon%20Adula\"&gt;Glintstone Dragon Adula&lt;/a&gt; who swore a knightly oath to her and now guards the path to her tower. The &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; can join the group and eventually become her consort as she ushers in her Age of the Stars.\nRelevant Items.\nItems associated with: \n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "5336", "revid": "53256869", "url": "https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5336", "title": "Carian Study Hall", "text": "Carian Study Hall is a dungeon in .\nOverview.\nThe Carian Study Hall is a building on the eastern coast of Liurnia, to the north of &lt;a href=\"Jarburg\"&gt;Jarburg&lt;/a&gt;. It is connected to the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Tower%20of%20Liurnia\"&gt;Divine Tower of Liurnia&lt;/a&gt; by a great bridge, though it is not accessible initially. \nThe Study Hall consists of a vast library spanning multiple storeys, accessed by an elevator from a chapel-like entrance hall. The study hall is patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Preceptor%20Miriam\"&gt;Preceptor Miriam&lt;/a&gt;, a sorceress who calls upon blue, spectral nobles and prefers to fight from a distance using magical projectiles. \nThe hall hides a secret, which is revealed when a &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Inverted%20Statue\"&gt;Carian Inverted Statue&lt;/a&gt; is placed onto a pedestal of a celestial globe in the entrance hall. Doing so flips the entire building upside-down, leading to another encounter with Miriam and revealing the entrance to the Divine Tower of Liurnia.\nThe player receives the Carian Inverted Statue from &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt; after bringing her the &lt;a href=\"Fingerslayer%20Blade\"&gt;Fingerslayer Blade&lt;/a&gt;. The Divine Tower beyond the study hall hides Ranni's true body, which bears the &lt;a href=\"Cursemark%20of%20Death\"&gt;Cursemark of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nSites of Grace.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nStudy Hall Entrance = \nFound in the entrance chamber at the start of the dungeon.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nWalkthrough.\nFor both versions of the area, the greatest danger will be dangerous ranged &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; attacks, so bringing some way to counteract that (such as &lt;a href=\"Spellproof%20Dried%20Liver\"&gt;Spellproof Dried Liver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Fortification\"&gt;Magic Fortification&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Spelldrake%20Talisman\"&gt;Spelldrake Talisman&lt;/a&gt;) is useful. \nNormally only the Standard version is accessible but both versions can be freely switched between after acquiring the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Inverted%20Statue\"&gt;Carian Inverted Statue&lt;/a&gt;. \nStandard version.\nFrom the only Grace, ignore the altar and walk around it. Take the elevator up to a split with stairs to a bridge on the left and a sidepath on the right. At the end of the sidepath is a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Rune%203\"&gt;Golden Rune [3&lt;/a&gt;] and picking up spawns two puppet Estoc variant &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Noble\"&gt;Wandering Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. \nWalking up the stairs spawns two more puppet Nobles and &lt;a href=\"Preceptor%20Miriam\"&gt;Preceptor Miriam&lt;/a&gt;. Hitting Miriam once or twice causes her to teleport further away, a behavior that will continue for the rest of the area until she is killed (though do note that she can skip over spots if enough damage is inflicted in one go). On the bridge itself 5 more Nobles will spawn as you approach Miriam on the other side, while she will snipe at you with &lt;a href=\"Loretta%27s%20Greatbow\"&gt;Loretta's Greatbow&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe stairs at the other side of the bridge has Miriam and another puppet Noble and 2 more Nobles will spawn upon approaching a small raised stone section with the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Glintstone%20Staff\"&gt;Carian Glintstone Staff&lt;/a&gt;. Further along and to the right is an elevator to the second floor. \nThe first level of the second floor is essentially a circular balcony where you play a game of ring-around-the-rosie with Preceptor Miriam and occasionally spawning puppet Nobles, now also with the sorcerer variant. Miriam will alternate between either using Loretta's Greatbow or &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Downpour\"&gt;Magic Downpour&lt;/a&gt; while teleporting clockwise around the area if you approach closely while she isn't charging a spell, so try to either attack her as the spell is being charged up or use a ranged weapon like a &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt;. Since the puppets don't respawn until resting at a grace one may want to focus their first lap in killing them. Killing her gives the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Downpour\"&gt;Magic Downpour&lt;/a&gt; sorcery and a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Rune%204\"&gt;Golden Rune [4&lt;/a&gt;] can be found on the ring. \nTo the left of the elevator used to come up and two lengths of the railing along is a ladder to the lower rafters. There is no item on the lower level but there are to &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Rat\"&gt;Giant Rats&lt;/a&gt;, one straight ahead and one far to the right. Additionally there is another ladder up to the upper rafters, with 3 more Giant Rats and also the &lt;a href=\"Cerulean%20Seed%20Talisman\"&gt;Cerulean Seed Talisman&lt;/a&gt;. \nInverted version.\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Inverted%20Statue\"&gt;Carian Inverted Statue&lt;/a&gt; on the altar instead changes the path behind it. The elevator well is now fall onto a ledge around a hole in the floor, and beyond it is a thin hole with 1 small &lt;a href=\"Fingercreeper\"&gt;Fingercreepers&lt;/a&gt; with another 2 flanking it on the walls. \nEntering into the bridge room, which is now a set of walkways with a platform in the middle. Take a left to drop down to a nook with the &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20Confidence\"&gt;Mask of Confidence&lt;/a&gt; while dropping down on the right takes you to 2 small Fingercreepers. Since &lt;a href=\"Preceptor%20Miriam\"&gt;Preceptor Miriam&lt;/a&gt; will be standing on the central platform and bombard you with &lt;a href=\"Loretta%27s%20Greatbow\"&gt;Loretta's Greatbow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Downpour\"&gt;Magic Downpour&lt;/a&gt;, stick close to the wall when approaching. Two more small Fingercreepers are on the same platform and a spear-wielding &lt;a href=\"Raya%20Lucaria%20Soldier\"&gt;Raya Lucaria Soldier&lt;/a&gt; puppet hides around a corner to support her. Reducing Miriam to half health causes her to teleport further away. \nThe Preceptor will stand across the gap, now unrestricted by cover, so keep an eye on her while dealing with the new enemies. Moving forward and to the right is a bridge with 2 Fingercreepers on it and a nook with a Fingercreeper to the right. Guarding Miriam final location will be 2 sword-wielding Raya Lucaria Soldiers that may have to be dealt with first. Defeat her to get &lt;a href=\"Lucidity\"&gt;Lucidity&lt;/a&gt;. \nSince there are no more doors forward you instead have to either drop down to either the middle chandelier below you and then one below that or fall of the right side to the wooden walkway around the area. Either way lets you drop down to the rafters and some &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Rat\"&gt;Giant Rats&lt;/a&gt;. The lower level of the rafters holds some &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Firefly\"&gt;Glintstone Fireflies&lt;/a&gt; on the central ring and a few &lt;a href=\"Holyproof%20Dried%20Liver\"&gt;Holyproof Dried Livers&lt;/a&gt; one the lower left offshoot beam (seen from Miriam's last spot). \nDrop down into the elevator and use it to go down to access the door to &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Tower%20of%20Liurnia\"&gt;Divine Tower of Liurnia&lt;/a&gt;. \nEnemies.\nStandard\nInverted\nNotable Loot.\nStandard\nInverted"}

In the past, Jerren was a nomadic warrior who became a guest of the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Carian Royal Family&lt;/a&gt;. There, he became acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;General Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Radagon%20of%20the%20Golden%20Order\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rennala%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Full%20Moon\"&gt;Rennala&lt;/a&gt;, the Carian queen, who would later challenge the stars and arrest their movements, halting fate. He was considered an eccentric by &lt;a href=\"War%20Counselor%20Iji\"&gt;Iji&lt;/a&gt;, the blacksmith and war counselor of the Carians. During this time, Jerren made a promise to kill &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20Sellen\"&gt;Sellen&lt;/a&gt;, a sorceress who had long been a hindrance to the Carians.\nAfter spending time as a guest of the Carians, Jerren served as a guest commander under General Radahn, and the two swore an oath of honourable death to one another. During &lt;a href=\"the%20Shattering\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Radahn fought &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia, Blade of Miquella&lt;/a&gt; in the Battle of Aeonia, and in the aftermath was driven mad by Malenia's rot, cursed to wander the battlefield, devouring the corpses of friends and foes alike. Jerren convened the Radahn Festival to honour his lord, attracting champions from across the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; by promising a battle against the General and a chance to claim his &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the champions who converge upon Redmane Castle to participate in the festival is a &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; who succeeds in defeating Radahn, giving him an honourable death. With Radahn dead, the stars are once again set into motion, and Sellen is dispossessed of her immortality. Finally able to uphold his old promise, Jerren travels to &lt;a href=\"Witchbane%20Ruins\"&gt;Witchbane Ruins&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Peninsula\"&gt;Weeping Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, where Sellen is bound by the Academy's shackles. When he arrives, he finds her as a husk, her soul having seemingly already fled. Suspecting Sellen to still be alive somewhere, Jerren continues his hunt, eventually tracking her down to the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt;. He vows to kill her and crush her &lt;a href=\"Sellen%27s%20Primal%20Glintstone\"&gt;Primal Glintstone&lt;/a&gt;, which facilitated her survival. Should the Tarnished aid him in defeating Sellen, he will thank them before departing, promising to meet them again at the next tournament.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It refers to the prophesied, messiah-like figure of the &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt; and its ailing &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Followers\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;. Promising them salvation from their torment, despair, their affliction, every sin, and every curse by melting it all away.\nOverview.\nA chosen few of those afflicted with the flame of frenzy are capable of transforming into the Lord after death. The strength of its form can seemingly vary depending on its original host, with several having proven capable of becoming one. However, many of them were either too weak-willed or physically feeble to accomplish anything, causing them to be considered frauds and failures in the eyes of their followers.\nSimilar to the power of its namesake, it has an uncanny ability to erase the original identity of its vessel. It can emerge from its host even if they don't want it to and can even prompt them to abruptly die at a moment's notice to force their transformation into itself. \nOnce a Lord of Frenzied Flame manifests, the head of the original host is replaced by a black hole with yellow flames spewing out of its core, erasing any visible trace of the original host's identity. It moves their bodies around with mannerisms completely alien to not only the original host but even other &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Followers\"&gt;chaos followers&lt;/a&gt; as well. Making gestures that suggest complete delight and overwhelming euphoria at the sight of its flames consuming everything in its path. An ironic contrast for something supposedly being born from unspeakable torment and despair.\nWhile it is seen as a savior from the perspective of those stricken by &lt;a href=\"madness\"&gt;madness&lt;/a&gt;, it is a harbinger of insanity and death to everyone else. A menace to all life and the joys of living. \nGallery.\nRelevant Items.\nItems related to or referencing the Lord of Chaos"}

Thus, she and everyone blessed by her Grace would live forever, granting her the title of Queen Marika the Eternal. However, this very same Grace was taken away from Godfrey and his army, whom she instructed to wage war and die abroad, with the promise that life and Grace would be returned to them when needed.\nAll those who were stripped of their Grace, as well as their descendants, became known as the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;.

The Shattering ensued; a war that wrought only darkness. The Elden Ring was broken, but by whom? And why? What could the Demigods ever hope to win by warring? \n\"The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn. And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed.

She is a &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;Shardbearer&lt;/a&gt; who is encountered in &lt;a href=\"Elphael%2C%20Brace%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;. She and her elder twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella of the Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;, are together known as the Twin Prodigies (\u5929\u8ce6\u306e\u53cc\u5b50, \"Tenpu no Futago\").\nOverview.\nEarly Life.\nMalenia was born the child of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; and her second husband, the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt;. She had an elder twin brother by the name of &lt;a href=\"Miquella\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt;. Both Malenia and Miquella were &lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyreans&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they had the potential to one day replace their mother as a new god of a coming age. But since Radagon and Marika were in fact the same person, Malenia and Miquella were born afflicted. Malenia was afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;Scarlet Rot&lt;/a&gt;, which ravaged her from within and would cost her several limbs, while Miquella was afflicted with eternal childhood, unable to ever grow into adulthood. \nAt some point, Malenia encountered a blind swordsman who had sealed away an &lt;a href=\"Outer%20God\"&gt;Outer God&lt;/a&gt; of Rot. The swordsman became her master, and trained her in the ways of the blade, allowing her to gain wings of unparalleled strength. Malenia would eventually become a warrior without peer. She would attract loyal servants like her &lt;a href=\"Cleanrot%20Knight\"&gt;Cleanrot Knights&lt;/a&gt; (who vowed to fight next to her despite the inevitable gradual putrefaction of their flesh), as well as worshippers, who believed her a goddess. Members of House Marais, who were all sickly born, were naturally drawn to the beautiful and fierce Malenia who became such a powerful warrior in spite of being born into rot, and requiring prostheses to fight. \nMalenia and Miquella were close, and Malenia would become her brother's sworn blade and protector, while Miquella worked tirelessly to try and undo the curses they had both been born into. While unable to find a cure for his sister, Miquella designed a &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Needle\"&gt;needle&lt;/a&gt; of unalloyed gold that could keep the Scarlet Rot ravaging Malenia's body at bay. \nThe Shattering.\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Malenia and Miquella both claimed shards of the broken &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;. During the wars between the demigods which followed the Shattering, Malenia led an army that marched south from the &lt;a href=\"Haligtree\"&gt;Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;. She won many battles, even humbling fellow demigod and &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;shardbearer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the Grafted&lt;/a&gt;, who groveled at her feet for mercy after first insulting her and then suffering defeat.\nMalenia and her half-brother &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt; would eventually be the last two demigods left standing in the conflict. Their forces clashed in the &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, and the two fought a bitter duel for supremacy. In the midst of the combat with Radahn, the Scarlet Rot was unleashed by Malenia, resulting in her first &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Aeonia\"&gt;bloom&lt;/a&gt;. The blooming of the Scarlet Rot devastated Caelid, leaving it a rotting wasteland, and caused Radahn to rapidly degenerate, losing his wits and cursing him to wander the battlefield as a mindless beast, feasting on the bodies of friend and foe alike.\nMalenia herself was not unaffected, and unleashing the Scarlet Rot left her in a coma. She was rescued by one of her Cleanrot Knights, &lt;a href=\"Cleanrot%20Knight%20Finlay%20Ashes\"&gt;Finlay&lt;/a&gt;, and brought to the Haligtree to await her brother's rebirth, as he had encased himself within the Haligtree in an effort to reverse his curse. However, either during Malenia's absence, or during her slumber, Miquella was ripped from the womb of the tree and taken away by &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt; before he could emerge from his cocoon. \nWhile Malenia slept, the Scarlet Rot seeped out from her and began infecting the Haligtree. When she had blossomed in Caelid, she had inadvertently birthed the &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20of%20Rot\"&gt;Kindred of Rot&lt;/a&gt;, who worshipped her as a goddess and hoped to cause her to bloom once again, believing that she would usher in a new age of rot. Malenia's slumber is eventually disturbed by a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, who found their way to the roots of the Haligtree. The two fight, and Malenia finally meets her match and suffers her first true defeat. However, in the end Malenia succumbs to the Scarlet Rot and blossoms yet again, reborn as a nascent goddess. She unleashes her full fury against the invader, but falls short yet again, her dying words an apology to her vanished brother.\nBoss Fight.\nMalenia is fought at the end of Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree, in a large chamber beyond the Haligtree Roots Site of Grace. \nMalenia will regain lost HP with every successful attack, even if they are blocked.\nPhase 1 - Malenia, Blade of Miquella.\nIn phase 1, Malenia will primarily make use of melee attacks using her sword. Her quick attacks, combined with her HP regeneration on hit, mean that she can rapidly recover from any damage dealt. However, she staggers easily, and her attacks can be cancelled by attacking during her wind-up animations. Frostbite and Blood Loss are especially good for staggering her.\nPhase 2 - Malenia, Goddess of Rot.\nOnce her health reaches 0, a cutscene will play, instigating phase 2. Malenia, now with large wings, gains a variety of Scarlet Rot-based attacks, and many of her regular attacks can now inflict the status effect. She will begin the phase with 80% of her maximum health, but can recover this using her HP regeneration. This phase will always begin with a Scarlet Aeonia attack, which can immediately end the fight if the player does not immediately get some distance. She can also create phantom projections of herself, which will attack and then disappear.\nEnvironment.\nMalenia's arena is a wide cavern with a shallow pool of water in the middle. There are no obstacles, so there is plenty of space to gain distance during some of Malenia's more devastating attacks.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

This is not an optional boss as Maliketh must be defeated to unlock &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Ashen%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Ashen Capital&lt;/a&gt; and reach the endgame of Elden Ring.\nOverview.\nMaliketh is the loyal &lt;a href=\"Shadowbound%20Beast\"&gt;Shadowbound Beast&lt;/a&gt; and half-brother of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Numen\"&gt;Numen&lt;/a&gt; descent, who would become the vessel of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;. \nMaliketh fought and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Gloam-Eyed%20Queen\"&gt;Gloam-Eyed Queen&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Godskin%20Apostle\"&gt;Godskin Apostle&lt;/a&gt;s. On Marika's orders, Maliketh sealed away the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt;, binding it within his blade, causing the true power of the god-slaying black flame to be lost.\nWhen the Rune of Death was plucked from the Elden Ring, and confined, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; was created, with Queen Marika as its one true god. Marika's offspring were granted a form of immortality owing to the removal of their fated deaths from the Elden Ring, however there was not one Demigod who did not fear Maliketh and his blade imbued with death. He was a beast of such terrifying ferocity that his name came to mean \"Death of the Demigods\". He also led the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20Kindred\"&gt;Black Blade Kindred&lt;/a&gt;, living gargoyles who wielded weapons held together by blackened corpse wax.\nDuring the Golden Age of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh. The perpetrator was &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to forge godslaying black knives, which were wielded by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Assassin\"&gt;Black Knife Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s during the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;. Maliketh responded by binding his blade- and the Rune of Death sealed within- into his own flesh, to prevent death from ever being stolen again. Later, the Rune of Death sprouted from Godwyn's corpse and began to spread through the Lands Between in the form of &lt;a href=\"Deathroot\"&gt;Deathroot&lt;/a&gt;. Maliketh, under the name &lt;a href=\"Gurranq%2C%20Beast%20Clergyman\"&gt;Gurranq&lt;/a&gt;, resolved to track down and devour the Deathroot, eventually gaining an insatiable hunger for it.\nMaliketh, now Gurranq, eventually came into contact with &lt;a href=\"D%2C%20Hunter%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;D, Hunter of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. D entered Gurranq's service and assisted him in weeding Deathroot, the source of &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;. D would later find a &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to take his place in weeding Deathroot.\nThe Tarnished encounters Gurranq in the &lt;a href=\"Bestial%20Sanctum\"&gt;Bestial Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt;. The beast, dressed in the robes of a clergyman, gives them an eye which trembles in the presence of Deathroot, and instructs them to bring him any Deathroot they find in return for bestial incantations. Despite consuming all the Deathroot the Tarnished could bring him, Gurranq is not sated. Despondent, he realises that he has done all he can for the land and departs, with his hunger as his only companion.\nWhen the Tarnished arrives at the foot of the Erdtree, they find the entrance obstructed by thorns. To remove the thorns, the Tarnished and their companion, &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt;, set the Erdtree ablaze at the Giant's Forge. After doing so, the Tarnished finds themselves in &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Crumbling Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient city in the sky, where they seek the Rune of Death. The Tarnished finally comes upon Gurranq, who attempts to stop them from stealing the Rune of Death from him. Despite his best efforts, Gurranq struggles to overcome the Tarnished. As a last resort, he unbinds his death-imbued blade from his flesh and reveals his true identity to the Tarnished. Nevertheless, Maliketh falls to the Tarnished, and with his dying breath cries out to Marika for forgiveness. The Rune of Death is unbound, and enshrouds the Lands Between. However, this allows the impenetrable thorns to finally burn away, allowing the Tarnished to finally gain access to the Erdtree.\nBoss Fight.\nPhase 1 - Beast Clergyman.\nPhase 1 is much like combat against Gurranq. During this phase, the Beast Clergyman will make use of his &lt;a href=\"Cinquedea\"&gt;Cinquedea&lt;/a&gt; as well as a variety of bestial incantations. His attacks are very fast, leaving few obvious spaces for the player to attack. He may use an earthquake attack, causing area of effect damage in a small circle around him. \nPhase 2 - Maliketh, the Black Blade.\nAt half health, a cutscene will play and phase 2 will begin. Maliketh now wields his Black Blade, and all of his attacks will cause rapid health loss overtime as well as temporary reduction of maximum health. Maliketh is a fast and acrobatic fighter, relying on quick slashes, spins and leaps. He will sometimes jump up and cling to the pillars around the arena, before either jumping at the player or jumping away and firing a ranged attack.\nDuring this phase, the &lt;a href=\"Blasphemous%20Claw\"&gt;Blasphemous Claw&lt;/a&gt; can be used to deflect Maliketh's Black Blade attack, as well as the spin attack he performs after plunging his sword into the ground. Deflecting his attacks will stun him for a few seconds, creating a window during which to attack.\nEnvironment.\nThe arena is a wide, circular room. It is possible to fall off the edges all around the perimeter of the room. There are several pillars around the centre of the room, which Maliketh may jump onto to perform certain attacks. These pillars can also be used to create distance between oneself and Maliketh, or to avoid his ranged attacks.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Although he is defeated, Margit's voice is heard as he disappears. \nLater, he appears once more outside &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;, initially in the guise of a &lt;a href=\"Commoner\"&gt;Commoner&lt;/a&gt;. After being defeated by the Tarnished once more, he vanishes, leaving the corpse of the commoner behind.\nAfter the Tarnished has made their way through Leyndell and reached the Elden Throne, Margit stands between them and the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. He repudiates the other &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigods&lt;/a&gt;, calling them all traitors, before revealing himself to be &lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott, the Omen King&lt;/a&gt;, a Demigod of the Golden Lineage, who took up the responsibility of protecting the Erdtree, despite receiving no love in return. He fights the Tarnished once more and, upon his defeat, he warns them that the Erdtree will reject them, as it did him.\nEncounters.\nAs the Tarnished approaches the gates of Stormveil Castle, Margit will materialize on a nearby tower and jump down the courtyard to confront his opponent. This encounter will not take place if Morgott, the Omen King is defeated beforehand. \nAs the Tarnished treks through the Capital Outskirts, Margit will possess the body of a nearby Commoner to once again hunt down his enemy. This encounter does not count as a boss fight, and it is possible to run away when he appears.\nBoss Fight.\n&lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Rogier\"&gt;Sorcerer Rogier&lt;/a&gt; is available as a summon for this fight.\nPhase 1.\nMargit is quick and relentless, his powerful combos and rapid follow-ups make it hard to find a window to punish him, but there are two types of attacks that leave him open amply: overhead strikes and ground stabs.\nSince both can be easily evaded by running to the right, the key to victory is learning how to bait out these moves, which is generally done by dodging away from the first part of a combo, while remaining just in range for him to keep going through with it fully.\nHis jumping stab can also be exploited, as he always tells this move by tossing his holy dagger twice, while the player is far way: as he finishes throwing his weapons, walk towards him and dodge through the jump attack.\nWithout being particularly weak to anything, he still takes some additional damage from slashing and fire attacks, and he can also be poisoned and bled, which makes the &lt;a href=\"Uchigatana\"&gt;Uchigatana&lt;/a&gt; a particularly favorable choice against this boss.\nWhile standard light attacks won't impact him much, an aggressive playstyle made of jump attacks, charged attacks and Ash of War will see Margit repeatedly falling on his knees, leaving him open to a critical strike.\n&lt;a href=\"Margit%27s%20Shackle\"&gt;Margit's Shackle&lt;/a&gt; can be used during this phase to temporarily stun him, opening him to attacks. This will not work in phase 2.\nPhase 2.\nAs his health drops to 60% or below, he will enter Phase 2 always executing the same hammer sweep plus jumping strike.\nEven with the addition of some new moves, the bait-and-punish strategy of Phase 1 is still applicable.\nWhile the moves made with his holy weapons cannot be parried, the majority of his regular weapon attacks are susceptible to interruption.\nEnvironment.\nMargit's arena is a narrow and long pathway with chasms on each side. While the boss himself cannot fall to his death, the player must constantly reposition himself to avoid having their back against the wall or the brink.\nThe area is also filled with obstacles and while the weapons scattered through out can be broken by dodging into them, the wooden barricades might just get in the way of a safety roll.\nOne must also not overestimate the length of the arena, as Margit's gap-closing attacks are fast and cover a long distance.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

She offers an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; to help them on their journey.\nOverview.\nBackground.\nMelina has long observed the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. She was born at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. She is a secret child of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika\"&gt;Queen Marika&lt;/a&gt;, but not born of a mother. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Messmer\"&gt;Messmer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Morgott\"&gt;Morgott&lt;/a&gt;, Melina does not recall Marika with fondness.\nAt some point long ago, Melina bore a vision of fire. She was burned, leaving her bodiless; a drifting &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; bound to &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Grace&lt;/a&gt;.. Like her brother Messmer, she was assigned a purpose by Marika. However, she was unable to remember it. And so, Melina traveled with the spectral steed &lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;Torrent&lt;/a&gt; in search of the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; who would lead her back to the foot of the Erdtree. There, she may ascertain her given purpose.\nThe Tarnished.\nMelina and Torrent spot a washed-up, maidenless Tarnished whom she believes is fortunate. Sometime later, she approaches to offer them an accord: She could play the role of the missing &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Maiden\"&gt;Finger Maiden&lt;/a&gt; in return for a ride to the foot of the Erdtree. If the player desires the strength of &lt;a href=\"runes\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt;, and, if they accept the accord, Melina entrusts them with the &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Steed%20Whistle\"&gt;Spectral Steed Whistle&lt;/a&gt; and, therefore, Torrent.\nWhen Melina starts traveling with the Tarnished, she advises them to follow the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Grace&lt;/a&gt; and seek the &lt;a href=\"shardbearers\"&gt;shardbearer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Tarnished defeats the &lt;a href=\"demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;, Melina confesses that she was testing the Tarnished to see if they truly possessed the guidance of grace and if they were fit for the challenges to come. Satisfied with her new companion, Melina offers to take them to &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;, a gathering place for Tarnished champions. Throughout their journey, Melina also provides specks of guidance at certain sites of grace and, at churches dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika&lt;/a&gt;, she offers to reveal words spoken by Marika herself in the distant past. \nLeyndell, Royal Capital.\nUpon arriving at their destination, the &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt; at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, Melina thanks the Tarnished for escorting her and leaves to ascertain her purpose, claiming that she can govern her movement more freely there. She entrusts the power of runes and Torrent to the Tarnished. She will also offer her aid should the Tarnished challenge &lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott, the Omen King&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Leyndell and guardian of the Erdtree.\nAfter defeating Morgott, the Tarnished finds the path into the Erdtree barred by thorns refusing entrance to all. Melina, having ascertained her purpose and seeing the Tarnished stuck, rejoins the Tarnished to say that she can burn the Erdtree to gain entrance inside, provided that she can get ahold of the &lt;a href=\"Giants%27%20Flame\"&gt;Giants' Flame&lt;/a&gt;. And hence, she asks to go on a new journey, this time to the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;. and tells them she will take care of the \"kindling\" required to set the tree alight.\nDefeating Morgott also opens a path to the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Fingers\"&gt;Three Fingers&lt;/a&gt;. If the Tarnished rests at the nearest grace from their entombment, Melina will warn against meeting them and insist against inheriting the Frenzied Flame, for it would end all lives and births, which she cherishes. If the player ignores her warnings, or just inherits the Frenzied Flame without speaking with her, she will say that The Tarnished is no longer fit, ending her accord, and forever leaving their side but threatening to kill them should they become &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. If the Tarnished instead heeds her warnings, Melina and the protagonist will continue their journey for the flame of ruin. \nCardinal Sin.\nWhen making their way to the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Forge of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, Melina clarifies that she is now acting of her own volition, regardless of the purpose that her mother gave her. After defeating the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giant\"&gt;guardian of the flame&lt;/a&gt;, Melina puts her plan into action. She takes the Tarnished's hand, narcotizing them by doing so, and proceeds to sacrifice herself to channel the flame of ruin, setting the Erdtree aflame. The Tarnished, maidenless once more, wakes up at &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Crumbling Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt;. There, they must confront the &lt;a href=\"Maliketh\"&gt;Black Blade Maliketh&lt;/a&gt; and recover the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt;. In this, Melina fulfills her purpose: \"The one who walks alongside flame, Shall one day meet the road of Destined Death.\"\nDestined Death.\nIn a cutscene for the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Frenzied%20Flame%20%28ending%29\"&gt;Lord of Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt; ending, a chorus of whistling leads a transformed Melina to the Spectral Steed Whistle. She recovers the smoldering ring from a pile of ash and holds it in her open palm. As the final remnants of Torrent are consumed by the &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt;, she vows retribution upon the player in the form of &lt;a href=\"Destined%20Death\"&gt;Destined Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter Information.\nMelina may only be encountered when resting at &lt;a href=\"Sites%20of%20Grace\"&gt;Sites of Grace&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuestline Progression.\nMelina's questline runs parallel to the main storyline and thus must be completed to finish the game.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Known to Messmer as the &lt;a href=\"Base%20Serpent\"&gt;Abyssal Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, this force was restrained only through Marika's intervention\u2014she removed her son's right eye and replaced it with a &lt;a href=\"Marika%27s%20Scarseal\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt; of her &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Grace&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since his accursed birth, Messmer was in constant company of the &lt;a href=\"winged%20serpents\"&gt;winged serpents&lt;/a&gt;, friends who suppressed the base serpent.\nMuch like his &lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;younger sister&lt;/a&gt;, Messmer bore a vision of &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. He despised this &lt;a href=\"Messmer%27s%20Kindling\"&gt;flame&lt;/a&gt;, and time and time again hoped to rid himself of it, but found that it ever burned. \nAt some point, Messmer befriended &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gaius\"&gt;Commander Gaius&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Albinauric\"&gt;Albinauric&lt;/a&gt; who like him was cursed from birth. Gaius would go on to command &lt;a href=\"Messmer%27s%20Army\"&gt;Messmer's armies&lt;/a&gt; in the wars to come. They both acted as \"older brothers\" to &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;General Radahn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crusade.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Messmer was charged by his mother with carrying out a purge of the &lt;a href=\"Enir-Ilim\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;-dwelling &lt;a href=\"hornsent%20%28people%29\"&gt;hornsent&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Land of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, who did not bear the light of grace. At some point during his &lt;a href=\"Crusade\"&gt;Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, Messmer was abandoned in the &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Land of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, but continued to zealously enforce the purge even though Marika ceased all contact with him. Messmer came to reside in a fort known as the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Keep\"&gt;Shadow Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nKey in his army were the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knights\"&gt;Black Knights&lt;/a&gt;, commanded by &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Commander%20Andreas\"&gt;Black Knight Commander Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and his son and second-in-command &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Captain%20Huw\"&gt;Black Knight Captain Huw&lt;/a&gt;. Although they remained devoutly loyal to Messmer despite his abandonment by Marika, they ultimately rebelled upon learning of his &lt;a href=\"Serpents\"&gt;serpentine&lt;/a&gt; nature. The pair were imprisoned in an &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Rift%20Catacombs\"&gt;underground tomb&lt;/a&gt;, and despite his betrayal, Messmer mourned the loss of Huw, whom he had considered a brother-in-arms. His &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Knights\"&gt;Fire Knights&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against burning the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Ruins%20of%20Rauh\"&gt;Ancient Ruins of Rauh&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the specimens in the &lt;a href=\"Specimen%20Storehouse\"&gt;Specimen Storehouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, an intruder invaded Messmer's stronghold, the Shadow Keep, and was noticed by the demigod's serpents, who identified them as &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;a Tarnished Champion&lt;/a&gt; and a pretender to the title of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Though surprised that a Tarnished had come to the Land of Shadow, Messmer nonetheless attacked them to continue enforcing the purge. However, the serpentine demigod struggled overcome the Tarnished. Unwilling to accept \"a Lord devoid of light\" and desperate to regain the upper hand, Messmer ripped out Marika's seal and unleashed the power of the Abyssal Serpent, allowing him to frequently transform into a massive serpent. Nonetheless, the Tarnished was able to land a fatal blow upon Messmer. Realizing that his mother had indeed forsaken him, Messmer used his dying breath to curse Marika.\nBoss Fight.\nMessmer is not an optional boss as he must be defeated in order to acquire &lt;a href=\"Messmer%27s%20Kindling\"&gt;Messmer's Kindling&lt;/a&gt; that would allow the burning of the Sealing Tree.\n&lt;a href=\"Hornsent%20%28character%29\"&gt;Hornsent&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this boss. His summon sign is found inside of the boss room, and will appear if the player decides to side with him against Leda or ignore this part of Leda's quest. \nPhase One.\nThe attacks of Messmer the Impaler are imbued with &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, making him a formidable opponent who relies heavily on his spear's reach and agility. To proceed in this boss fight, readiness for his swift movements is important. When fighting Messmer at a close range, you will have more chances of retaliating and chipping away at his health while he recovers. Engaging Messmer patiently is the best strategy to effectively take him down. When he finishes a string of attacks, focus on breaking his poise by pulling off heavy attacks for a chance to deal significant damage.\nBecause of his speed, Messmer can quickly transition between offense and defense by quickly disengaging with a leap after he finishes a move. Be aware that Messmer counters swiftly after sustaining damage, too. As his speed and precision in combat are his biggest asset, observation is required to avoid being overwhelmed. Once Messmer's health is half-depleted, a cutscene will trigger, which will start Messmer's second phase.\nPhase Two.\nDuring the second phase, Base Serpent Messmer remains at 50% &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; and not only retains his original attacks, but also introduces a set of new and more lethal attacks with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Base%20Serpent\"&gt;Abyssal Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. Among the fresh additions to his move set is the ability to transform into a big red serpent that rises up to the ground to throw a fireball or do bite attacks.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

During the Crusade, Messmer and his army cleansed the realm with fire, destroying everything in their path and putting them to the torch. This caused the surviving Hornsent to develop a strong hatred of Messmer and his followers to the point where they began to seek out vengeance for their betrayal."}

She possessed a microcosm which allowed her to receive messages from the Greater Will. Metyr gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt; that guide the &lt;a href=\"empyreans\"&gt;empyreans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh treason.\nMetyr was damaged and her &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Finger\"&gt;Ringed Finger&lt;/a&gt; was removed. She would never again receive a signal from the Greater Will. The wisdom received by the Two Fingers was severed, and Metyr began birthing the aberrant &lt;a href=\"Fingercreeper\"&gt;Fingercreeper&lt;/a&gt;s. Although Metyr was broken, her Two Fingers continued guiding the empyreans without a word from the Greater Will. It is said they presided over the birth of &lt;a href=\"Marika\"&gt;Marika&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; as she created it from the primordial matter of the &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;.\nA New Mother.\n&lt;a href=\"Count%20Ymir\"&gt;Count Ymir&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"glintstone%20sorcerer\"&gt;glintstone sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; who became a &lt;a href=\"finger-weaver\"&gt;finger-weaver&lt;/a&gt; and uncovered the secrets of Metyr herself. He found Metyr concealed within the Finger Ruins of Miyr, below the Cathedral of Manus Metyr, still waiting in vain for a signal from her lord. Ymir uncovered that Metyr's true power, and the guidance of the Two Fingers, had been broken long ago. After Ymir's young child &lt;a href=\"Yuri\"&gt;Yuri&lt;/a&gt; died, his grief drove him to find a way to bring him back. He decided he would succeed Metyr as the next mother of Fingers.\nYmir shares the wisdom of the cosmos and a &lt;a href=\"Hole-Laden%20Necklace\"&gt;Hole-Laden Necklace&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt;. He directs them to sound the ominous hanging bells at the &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Ruins%20of%20Dheo\"&gt;Finger Ruins of Dheo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Ruins%20of%20Rhea\"&gt;Rhea&lt;/a&gt;. Once both bells are rung, Ymir reveals the location of the Ruins of Miyr. Ringing the third and final bell will leave one's fate guided by the stars\u2014and face-to-face with Metyr. If the Mother of Fingers is defeated, Ymir's hope is rekindled but the prospect of achieving his dream drives him mad. He achieves a partial transformation and fails to birth Yuri anew, instead creating more Fingercreepers.\nAppearance.\nMetyr is a monstrous being made from fingers. Her head resembles an elongated thumb, and her face a pronounced thumbprint. At its center is a small, wart-like eye from which she blasts pink energy beams. Ridge-like wrinkles, forming fingerprint-like patterns, cover Metyr's head and neck. She moves about on four sets of four-fingered hands, 16 coordinated finger legs in total. Metyr has two long-reaching arms that terminate in four-fingered hands tipped with sharp nails painted red. She may use these to pry open her abdominal cavity when birthing new Fingercreepers. Her tail forks into two tail fingers which wrap each other like a spiral. Between them rests an orb containing a microcosm.\nMetyr's body festers with unhealed wounds. Upon her right chest is a deep laceration, and her belly has been split wide open, revealing gore and the stillborn remains of malformed fingers. Several more protrude from large lesions on her neck and tail fingers, and her microcosm appears clouded like an eye with cataracts. The iris of her bloodshot eye is quartered into an X.\nBoss Fight.\nMetyr is an optional boss fight that can be fought by the end of &lt;a href=\"Count%20Ymir\"&gt;Count Ymir&lt;/a&gt;'s questline; after blowing the two finger bells at the other finger ruins, and returning to the cathedral and examining Ymir's throne, she is found in the &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Ruins%20of%20Miyr\"&gt;Finger Ruins of Miyr&lt;/a&gt;, just beneath the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Manus%20Metyr\"&gt;Cathedral of Manus Metyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhase One.\nMetyr crawls around and can fire a laser beam from her eye. Try fighting her head-on. She punishes flanking during this phase.\nPhase Two.\nMetyr summons her damaged microcosm and uses it to channel gravity magic. Be wary that she can fly during this stage, which can be troubling for some melee players."}

Here, she reveals to the Tarnished that she is of Malenia's blood, although she is unsure whether she is a sister, daughter, or offshoot of the Demigod. Unbeknownst to Millicent, however, the Tarnished has been advised by Gowry to assist his remaining four daughters in killing Millicent, so that she can be reborn as a &lt;a href=\"scarlet%20valkyrie\"&gt;scarlet valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; when Malenia ascends to godhood.\nThe Tarnished may then make a choice: kill Millicent alongside her four sisters, or fight alongside her against the attackers.

They all wear the &lt;a href=\"Traveler%27s%20Set\"&gt;Traveler's Set&lt;/a&gt; and use weapons and skills associated with either aspects of their inadvertent mother &lt;a href=\"Malenia\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt;, both her role as the unalloyed blade of &lt;a href=\"Miquella\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt; and her looming transformation into the goddess of rot. They all seek to aid their adoptive father in cultivating Millicent into a &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Valkyrie\"&gt;Scarlet Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nAll sisters can be found in &lt;a href=\"Elphael%2C%20Brace%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree&lt;/a&gt; towards the end of Millicent's questline.\nTo reach them the player needs to:\nThe Sisters.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDetails.\nUnlike her sisters Polyanna can be encountered long before the confrontation at Elphael. \nShe can be summoned within the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Aeonia\"&gt;Swamp of Aeonia&lt;/a&gt; as a friendly cooperator against &lt;a href=\"Commander%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Commander O'Neil&lt;/a&gt; to help retrieving the snapped needle for Gowry. \nHer Summon sign can be found directly south of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Aeonia\"&gt;Inner Aeonia&lt;/a&gt; site of grace, en-caved among the tall roots of the Aeonia flower that are erupting directly up from the ground.\nPolyanna's Appearance.\nPolyanna has a slender body, fair skin and the left half of her face is covered with a large, sickly birthmark.\nHer right eye is covered with a white eye-patch and her visible left eye reveal that they are slightly clouded with a golden-yellow iris and a darkened, near-black sclerae. \nShe has faded orange-red hair tied into a bun at the back of her head, her forehead is covered with bangs that have been cut horizontally at the height of her eyebrows, along with thinner bangs on the sides reaching down to the height her chin.\nAmy's Appearance.\nAmy has a slender body, fair skin and the upper half of her face from the top of her cheeks to her forehead, is covered with a large, sickly birthmark.\nShe has small pursed lips and both of her eyes are covered with a white blindfold. Despite not being visible, her eyes share the same features as Polyanna. \nShe has a faded orange-red, unkempt hair that reaches down to her shoulders, enveloping most of her whole head and even the right side of her face.\nMaureen's Appearance.\nMaureen has a slender body, fair skin and the upper-left half of her face is covered with a large, sickly birthmark.\nHer left eye is covered with a white eye-patch and her visible right eye reveal that her sclerae is also darkened like her sisters however unlike them, her iris and pupils are almost completely clouded over. \nShe has chin-length, curvaceous, faded orange-red hair covering most of her head. An opening revealing her face beginning on the right side of her forehead before curtaining out to the sides. where they eventually begin flowing back in towards the cheeks to then finally curve back outwards to the sides.\nMary's Appearance.\nMary has a slender body, fair skin and the upper half of her face, from the top of her right cheek to the left-side top of her forehead is covered with a large, sickly birthmark.\nShe has both of her eyes are covered with a white blindfold. Despite not being visible, her eyes share the same features as Polyanna and Amy. \nShe has long faded orange-red hair that reaches down to her collar bone, an opening beginning on the upper left side of her face before curtaining outwards into large fluffy bangs framing her face.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nTactics.\nSuccessfully assisting Millicent can be accomplished with relative ease even with a character that hasn't leveled any of their attributes or weapons yet, as Millicent herself is significantly more powerful than any of the sisters individually. Her damage is high but her health is relatively low, so Millicent's safety is at the most risk only when she's greatly outnumbered and the majority of her sisters are attacking her at once.\nDue to Millicent's high damage (particularly from her ), the player can equip the &lt;a href=\"Shabriri%27s%20Woe\"&gt;Shabriri's Woe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Talisman\"&gt;Talisman&lt;/a&gt; and/or any pieces of the &lt;a href=\"Duelist%20Set\"&gt;Duelist Set&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Duelist%20Set\"&gt;Rotten Duelist Set&lt;/a&gt; to make the majority of the sisters more easily prone to chase them around the environment, leaving Millicent to deal with a single sister one at a time.\nSince Polyanna can cast Pest Threads, she's the only one who can harm the running player from a distance and so it's preferable to leave her with Millicent first so she can eliminate Polyanna before she becomes a problem for the player."}

Built into the canopy is &lt;a href=\"Haligtree%20Town\"&gt;Haligtree Town&lt;/a&gt;, a sanctuary for the unwanted. At the base of the tree is &lt;a href=\"Elphael%2C%20Brace%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;, a city largely inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Haligtree%20Knight\"&gt;Haligtree Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cleanrot%20Knight\"&gt;Cleanrot Knight&lt;/a&gt;s who serve Miquella and &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt;. Both areas contain statues of the twin &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigods&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; Miquella abandoned &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt; Fundamentalism after realizing it could not treat &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;Scarlet Rot&lt;/a&gt;. He sought to establish an &lt;a href=\"Unalloyed%20Gold\"&gt;Unalloyed Gold&lt;/a&gt; order away from the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; and settled on the Haligtree. Miquella watered the sapling with his own Empyrean blood, and later wove a cocoon and embedded himself within its trunk to nurture it directly. However, it would fail to grow into an &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. Before he could finish, Miquella was cut and taken from the tree by &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg&lt;/a&gt;, who was under his charm. The Lord of Blood zealously wished to raise the Empyrean to &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;godhood&lt;/a&gt; and become his consort. After returning from her battle with &lt;a href=\"Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, Malenia awaited her brother's return at the base of the tree, and over time infected the tree with her Scarlet Rot.\nNevertheless, the Haligtree and its city became a haven for those rejected by society, such as the &lt;a href=\"Misbegotten\"&gt;Misbegotten&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20of%20Rot\"&gt;Kindred of Rot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Loretta\"&gt;Loretta&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Knight\"&gt;Knight of Caria&lt;/a&gt;, founded a sanctuary for &lt;a href=\"Albinaurics\"&gt;Albinaurics&lt;/a&gt; among the boughs of the Haligtree. Those who made the pilgrimage presented a &lt;a href=\"Haligtree%20Secret%20Medallion%20%28Right%29\"&gt;secret medallion&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Lift%20of%20Rold\"&gt;Grand Lift of Rold&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to the Consecrated Snowfield.

He is the elder twin brother of &lt;a href=\"Malenia%20the%20Severed\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt;, and together they are known as the Twin Prodigies (\u5929\u8ce6\u306e\u53cc\u5b50, \"Tenpu no Futago\"). He is a &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Boss\"&gt;Remembrance Boss&lt;/a&gt; in .\nOverview.\nEarly Life.\nMiquella and his twin sister were born with incurable afflictions, with Miquella's curse being perpetual youth. Miquella made a promise to Malenia and experimented tirelessly in an attempt to undo their curses. The twins were very close, and Malenia became Miquella's sworn blade and protector. Miquella was loved by many people and had a remarkable ability to compel affection from others. For this reason, many regarded him as the most fearsome Empyrean.\nMiquella was chosen by his Two Fingers to become an Empyrean, destined to succeed &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika&lt;/a&gt;. He was an adherent of &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order Fundamentalism&lt;/a&gt;, and developed new &lt;a href=\"incantations\"&gt;incantations&lt;/a&gt; as gifts to his father Radagon. However, Miquella abandoned Fundamentalism when it failed to treat Malenia's rot. He then began creating &lt;a href=\"Unalloyed%20Gold\"&gt;Unalloyed Gold&lt;/a&gt;, which he used it to craft &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Needle\"&gt;needles&lt;/a&gt; that could ward away the meddling of &lt;a href=\"Outer%20God\"&gt;outer gods&lt;/a&gt; and forestall Malenia's incurable rot. These needles could even be used to subdue the power of the &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt;. He also unsuccessfully sought a solution for his half-brother &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn&lt;/a&gt;'s state of incomplete death.\nSt. Trina.\nJust as his parents were two halves of the same person, Miquella also had another half\u2014&lt;a href=\"St.%20Trina\"&gt;St. Trina&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who was said to visit people in their dreams.\nThe Haligtree.\nAt some point, Miquella started watering a sapling with his own blood in the hope that it would become a new &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. The sapling was grown on top of the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Elphael%2C%20Brace%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Elphael&lt;/a&gt; and became known as the &lt;a href=\"Haligtree\"&gt;Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;. Soldiers and Knights sworn to protect the Haligtree would use Unalloyed gold as a symbol of their loyalty and devotion to Miquella, wearing crowns made of the metal and creating shields embedded with it. Miquella was also said to bless the low and meek. The Haligtree would became a hidden haven, and was intended to be the eventual salvation for many of the persecuted and the unwanted in the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Albinaurics.\nAs Miquella ascended closer to godhood as an Empyrean, he would soon desire to take his half-brother &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;General Radahn&lt;/a&gt; as a consort. He made a vow with Radahn, where Radahn would become his consort, and in return, Miquella would have to uphold some unspecified part of the vow. During the shattering, Malenia and Radahn fought, culminating in Malenia unleashing the Scarlet Aeonia. As the flower blossomed, Malenia whispered in Radahn's ear \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\" After Malenia's battle with &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;General Radahn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt;, one of her &lt;a href=\"Cleanrot%20Knight%20Finlay%20Ashes\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; carried her slumbering body back to the Haligtree. Radahn survived the battle, but his mind was destroyed, and he was fated to aimlessly wander the battlefield, devouring the corpses of friends and foes alike, until a Tarnished champion eventually bested him in combat.\nMiquella embedded himself into the Haligtree, but before he could finish this process, his tree was cut open and Miquella was kidnapped. His captor was none other than his half-brother &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, who had gained power from an outer god known only as the &lt;a href=\"Formless%20Mother\"&gt;Formless Mother&lt;/a&gt;. Mohg took the slumbering Empyrean's infant form deep underground, where he worked to raise Miquella to full godhood, wishing to become his consort, create a new dynasty, and take the role of monarch. He would have his followers render offerings of blood and drench Miquella's cocoon in order to facilitate his awakening. Despite all of Mohg's efforts, no matter how much of his bloody bedchamber he tried to share, Miquella would remain completely unresponsive. In truth, Miquella had placed an enchantment on Mohg, wishing to use the Omen to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and to use his body as a vessel for his king consort. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Ansbach\"&gt;Sir Ansbach&lt;/a&gt;, a Pureblood Knight in service to Mohg, attempted to free his lord by challenging Miquella, only to succumb to an enchantment of his own.\nWith Miquella's absence, his Haligtree became a misshapen husk, slowly succumbing to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;Scarlet Rot&lt;/a&gt;. The Haligtree's soldiers and Malenia, presumably unaware of Miquella's abduction, desperately awaited Miquella's return to the rotten tree. \nThe Realm of Shadow.\nMaking use of Mohg, Miquella entered the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, the location of the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;Gate of Divinity&lt;/a&gt;. As Miquella travelled through the Realm of Shadow, he abandoned parts of himself, including his flesh, his eye, his doubt and vacillation, his love, and his fears. Golden &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Cross\"&gt;Miquella's Cross&lt;/a&gt;es resembling a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt; appeared at each location where he abandoned something, akin to Miquella's footprints. Miquella's followers, who pursued him into the Realm of Shadow, used these crosses to trace his path through the realm. Miquella also discarded his other half, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Trina\"&gt;St. Trina&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Coffin%20Fissure\"&gt;Stone Coffin Fissure&lt;/a&gt;. St. Trina, whose love for Miquella was boundless in spite of her abandonment, recognized that godhood would be a prison for the Empyrean, and desired for him to be killed out of mercy. \nEventually, a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt; broke into Mohg's palace and slew the Lord of Blood for his great rune. Sir &lt;a href=\"Gideon%20Ofnir\"&gt;Gideon Ofnir&lt;/a&gt; suggested it might be safer to destroy the cocoon that Miquella remains asleep in. Instead, the Tarnished met &lt;a href=\"Needle%20Knight%20Leda\"&gt;Needle Knight Leda&lt;/a&gt;, a loyal follower of Miquella, who urged them to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; by touching Miquella's withered arm within the cocoon.\nWithin the Realm of Shadow, the Tarnished encounters several more of &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Followers\"&gt;Miquella's followers&lt;/a&gt;, learns of his mission to ascend to godhood via the Gate of Divinity, and of the powerful charm that he had placed upon his disciples, which is broken when he discards his &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Great%20Rune\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt;. After gaining access to the tower of &lt;a href=\"Enir-Ilim\"&gt;Enir-Ilim&lt;/a&gt;, the Tarnished is confronted by a resurrected Radahn, in a vessel made from the remains of Mohg. During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort. The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion."}

The great strength they granted tainted the demigods, compelling them to war over control of the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nThe Great Runes are the shards of the Elden Ring, currently making up the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, and represent the concepts of order and discipline that the &lt;a href=\"demigods\"&gt;demigods&lt;/a&gt; enforced on the physical world. They were inherited by some of the demigod offspring of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; following the shattering of the Elden Ring. The mad taint of the newfound strength granted by the Great Runes precipitated &lt;a href=\"the%20Shattering\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, wherein the demigods fought for control of the Lands Between. The demigods who inherited Great Runes were known as &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;Shardbearers&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe known Great Runes are as follows:\nIt is unknown if the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; is considered a Great Rune.\nThe Great Runes reflect the demigods that inherited them. For example, Morgott's Great Rune was proof that he was born of the Golden Lineage, and the rightful Lord of Leyndell. &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood's&lt;/a&gt; Great Rune was soaked with accursed blood from his devout love for the wretched mire he was born into. Morgott's and Mohg's Great Runes were naturally similar due to their bearers being twins. &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia, Blade of Miquella's&lt;/a&gt; Great Rune was half-rotted but infused with Malenia's spirit of resistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella of the Haligtree&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt; are the only Shardbearers known to have discarded their Great Runes. The whereabouts of Ranni's Great Rune remain unknown. Miquella relinquishes and breaks his Great Rune after the Tarnished crosses into one of three areas of the &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Land of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;: the eastern half of &lt;a href=\"Scadu%20Altus\"&gt;Scadu Altus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rauh%20Base\"&gt;Rauh Base&lt;/a&gt; region, or &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Keep\"&gt;Shadow Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, upon returning to the Lands Between, were compelled by the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt; to seek out demigods to relieve them of their Great Runes in order to become &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;. The Tarnished required one Great Rune to be granted audience with the Two Fingers in the inner chamber of the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;. They also required enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring before the Two Fingers would permit them to enter &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt; to have an audience with Queen Marika to become Elden Lord. During the course of the game, this is two Great Runes, however since the Shardbearer &lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott, the Omen King&lt;/a&gt; guards the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; and must be killed to access it, they will have at least three when granted audience. &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Reader%20Enia\"&gt;Finger Reader Enia&lt;/a&gt; has only ever seen two Great Runes together once before this.\nWhen initially obtained by the player, a Great Rune (except the Great Rune of the Unborn) would be devoid of any benediction, and had to be taken to the Divine Tower mentioned in its description, whereupon it would be restored by interacting with the image of the Great Rune above the inert Two Fingers at the summit of the tower. Further, a &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Arc\"&gt;Rune Arc&lt;/a&gt; was required for The Tarnished (Protagonist) to be granted the blessing of a Great Rune after restoring it. \nThe Great Runes acquired by &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;The Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; were used to repair the Elden Ring in at least one &lt;a href=\"ending\"&gt;ending&lt;/a&gt;.

The vassals and envoys of the Greater Will are central to the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;. It inhabits a lightless void outside the Lands Between.\nBackground.\nLong ago, the Greater Will fractured the &lt;a href=\"One%20Great\"&gt;One Great&lt;/a&gt;, creating births and souls. The adherents of the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Fingers\"&gt;Three Fingers&lt;/a&gt; consider this action to be a mistake, because it resulted in torment, despair, affliction, sins, and curses.\nTogether with a golden star, the Greater Will once sent an &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Beast\"&gt;Elden Beast&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; that would later become the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;. This beast was its vassal, and the living incarnation of the concept of Order. The Greater Will has other vassals and envoys known as the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, who speak in a sign language of light.\nEternal Cities.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"age%20of%20the%20Erdtree\"&gt;age of the Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, the denizens of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Cities\"&gt;Eternal Cities&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against the Greater Will. To shield themselves from its influence, the &lt;a href=\"Nox\"&gt;Nox&lt;/a&gt; donned ritual &lt;a href=\"Nox%20Mirrorhelm\"&gt;mirrorhelms&lt;/a&gt; to block its intervention and that of its vassals. In an act of blasphemy, they drew the ire of the Greater Will by wielding the &lt;a href=\"Fingerslayer%20Blade\"&gt;Fingerslayer Blade&lt;/a&gt; against one of its vassals. In response to this transgression, the Greater Will unleashed &lt;a href=\"Astel\"&gt;Astel&lt;/a&gt;, whose destruction of the Eternal Cities condemned them to an existence underground.\nAge of the Erdtree.\nDuring the age of the Erdtree begun by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; and at least the era immediately preceding it, the Greater Will's envoy Two Fingers selected &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyreans&lt;/a&gt; as candidates to become the God of the coming age. Queen Marika was one such candidate, and created the Golden Order by confining the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt;. However, Marika would eventually shatter the Elden Ring, leading to her &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; offspring inheriting the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Runes&lt;/a&gt; which in turn would trigger a war known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Shattering\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt;. The Greater Will abandoned the demigods following the Shattering, as none managed to claim title of Elden Lord.\nAccording to the Two Fingers, the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it, proclaiming this is why the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; have been extended the &lt;a href=\"Grace\"&gt;Guidance of Grace&lt;/a&gt;. After the Tarnished returned to the Lands Between following the Shattering, the Two Fingers, at the behest of the Greater Will, bade them kill the demigods in order to claim their Great Runes to become &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt; by becoming Marika's consort, as the Greater Will had long since renounced the demigods. \nIn the time of &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;The Tarnished (Protagonist)&lt;/a&gt;, it was discovered that the entrance to the Erdtree was blocked by impenetrable thorns, preventing anyone from becoming Elden Lord. This caused the Two Fingers to commune with the Greater Will in search of answers, which may take thousands or tens of thousands of moons. When The Tarnished (Protagonist) suggested burning the Erdtree, which would unbind Destined Death and slay the world itself, Finger Reader Enia exclaimed that the Fingers and the Greater Will would never allow it.\nAfter The Tarnished (Protagonist) caused the &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor\"&gt;Volcano Manor's&lt;/a&gt; recusants to disband following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Rykard%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blasphemy\"&gt;Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy&lt;/a&gt;, the recusant known as &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Bernahl\"&gt;Knight Bernahl&lt;/a&gt; declared himself the inheritor of his comrade recusant's will. He declared their refusal to become the Greater Will's pawns and swore it would fall by his blade."}

From there, they follow a trail of lights, cross the river to &lt;a href=\"Ordina%2C%20Liturgical%20Town\"&gt;Ordina, Liturgical Town&lt;/a&gt;, and use a &lt;a href=\"Sending%20Gate\"&gt;Sending Gate&lt;/a&gt; to reach the Haligtree.\nThe Haligtree is divided into two areas: &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella's Haligtree&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elphael%2C%20Brace%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;. The upper area, &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella's Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;, is a sparse canopy containing &lt;a href=\"Haligtree%20Town\"&gt;Haligtree Town&lt;/a&gt;, a refuge for the unwanted. The lower section, &lt;a href=\"Elphael%2C%20Brace%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;, is a fortified city guarded by &lt;a href=\"Haligtree%20Knight\"&gt;Haligtree Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cleanrot%20Knight\"&gt;Cleanrot Knight&lt;/a&gt;s who serve &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20the%20Kind\"&gt;Miquella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt;. Both areas feature statues of the twin &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigods&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; Miquella abandoned &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order Fundamentalism&lt;/a&gt; upon realizing it could not cure his twin sister Malenia's &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;scarlet rot&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to create a new order of &lt;a href=\"Unalloyed%20Gold\"&gt;Unalloyed Gold&lt;/a&gt;, he settled on the Haligtree as his sanctuary. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Aeonia\"&gt;Battle of Aeonia&lt;/a&gt;, Miquella watered the sapling with his own Empyrean blood. He later embedded himself within a cocoon in the tree's roots to nurture it, attempting to grow it into an &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. However, his efforts were interrupted when &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, the Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, abducted him from the Haligtree. Under Miquella's charm, Mohg zealously sought to elevate the Empyrean to &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;godhood&lt;/a&gt; and establish the &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mohgwyn Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; as Miquella's consort. Without Miquella, the Haligtree began to wither.\nAfterward, &lt;a href=\"Cleanrot%20Knight%20Finlay\"&gt;Cleanrot Knight Finlay&lt;/a&gt; carried Malenia's slumbering body to the Haligtree, placing her at its roots. There, Malenia awaited her brother's return while slowly corrupting the tree with the scarlet rot.\nNevertheless, the Haligtree became a refuge for societal outcasts, including the &lt;a href=\"Misbegotten\"&gt;Misbegotten&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20of%20Rot\"&gt;Kindred of Rot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Loretta\"&gt;Loretta&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Knight\"&gt;Knight of Caria&lt;/a&gt;, established a sanctuary for the &lt;a href=\"Albinaurics\"&gt;Albinaurics&lt;/a&gt; within its boughs, turning the area into a sacred haven for their kind."}

Note that these builds are not necessarily \"good\", they are just what this origin is better at than any other.\nPure Strength.\nThe Hero is by far and away the best origin for a build that increases strength while forsaking all other damage stats, saving 6 entire levels when compared to &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretch&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it the best choice for weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Greatsword\"&gt;Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Giant-Crusher\"&gt;Giant-Crusher&lt;/a&gt;, which demand high strength but little of anything else. If a weapon requires 13 or more dexterity to wield, &lt;a href=\"Vagabond\"&gt;Vagabond&lt;/a&gt; will tie with Hero in point efficiency but hero will still outmatch every other origin considerably.\nThe Hero origin is also either the most efficient or tied for most efficient option for any hybrid class which is focused on raising the strength stat, with the exception of strength/dexterity/intelligence focuses and strength/dexterity/faith focuses, for which prisoner and vagabond are the best options respectively. This makes Hero the best option for essentially any strength hybrid weapon that does not demand high dexterity, such as:\nNote that &lt;a href=\"Astrologer\"&gt;Astrologer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prophet\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt; both beat out Hero for strength/intelligence and strength/faith builds respectively if the dexterity requirement is 10 or higher, meaning that Hero is not optimal for weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Greatsword\"&gt;Starscourge Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;\nPure Arcane.\nSurprisingly, Hero is also the best origin for a build which focuses on ignoring the leveling of other damage stats in favor of only increasing Arcane - although only being 1 level more efficient than both &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bandit\"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt; - making it potentially the best option for bleed, poison and occult infusions. However, if the build also requires at least 11 dexterity or 9 intelligence, &lt;a href=\"Bandit\"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt; then becomes the most optimal origin."}

Indeed, they perform some of the darkest duties that drive the wheels of mankind. The most famous relic of the House of Marais is their legendary &lt;a href=\"Marais%20Executioner%27s%20Sword\"&gt;executioner sword&lt;/a&gt;, which has beheaded countless sinners.\nThe only image of the first representative of this house remains in the form of a mask of a young nobleman with long white hair, which is worn by all heads of the house. The heads of the house also wear a robe with a black cape on their shoulders, their family crest emblazoned on their chest. \nWhile it has not prevented them from performing their executions, the sons of House Marais are all sickly born. Many protecting their fragile skin beneath layers upon layers of bloodsoaked bandages along with a variety of masks obscuring their festering faces beneath.\nThe current head of the family is &lt;a href=\"Maleigh%20Marais%2C%20Shaded%20Castle%20Castellan\"&gt;Maleigh Marais&lt;/a&gt; who had become besotted by &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia the Severed&lt;/a&gt;. So much so that he would hang up a large portrait of her in the castle's great hall, as well as develop a collection of &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%27s%20Prosthesis\"&gt;prostheses&lt;/a&gt; akin to what Malenia herself uses. \nOne day, &lt;a href=\"Elemer\"&gt;Elemer&lt;/a&gt;, the assassin of merchants and teachers alike, was brought to the Shaded Castle for execution. He was supposed to be beheaded with the family sword, however, Elemer stole the sword from the site of his looming execution, furnished it with &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;battle skills&lt;/a&gt; from his &lt;a href=\"Eochaid\"&gt;homeland&lt;/a&gt; and laid siege to the castle. Now Elemer has taken up residence at the &lt;a href=\"Castellan%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Castellan's Hall&lt;/a&gt;, and while Maleigh managed to escape the stronghold alive, he now spends most of his time wallowing in a graveyard of broken statues west of his childhood home.\nSome argue that all the misfortunes of House Marais are just punishments for its veneration of Malenia, whom Maleigh in particular idolized. However, it shouldn't be much of a surprise that a child from family with a history of lifelong disease could become so captivated, when the figure of obsession would be a fierce and beautiful goddess, who despite having been rotting alive since birth, managed to persevere.\nRelevant Items.\nItems related to or referencing House Marais."}

They each carry a &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Sword%20Insignia\"&gt;Winged Sword Insignia&lt;/a&gt; talisman, representing the beautiful and relentless blade of Malenia, in honor of their service to her. All Cleanrot Knights wield a &lt;a href=\"Cleanrot%20Knight%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Cleanrot Knight's Sword&lt;/a&gt; as a secondary weapon to complement their long-handed armaments. This allows them to land multiple attacks in quick succession, triggering the Talisman's blessing to strengthen them even further.\nMost Cleanrot Knights wield a &lt;a href=\"Cleanrot%20Spear\"&gt;Cleanrot Spear&lt;/a&gt; which bears a small shield on its shaft. They will imbue their spear with gold prior to performing their more deadly attacks. Such as grabbing their enemy with the spear tip and infecting them with Scarlet Rot, and summoning forth a golden palisade from the ground. They can also brace their spear with their sword to absorb an incoming blow and quickly retaliate with their own. \nCleanrot knight commanders wield the &lt;a href=\"Halo%20Scythe\"&gt;Halo Scythe&lt;/a&gt;. They prefer ranged combat over direct confrontation, and will repeatedly fire Miquella's rings of light at a distance. Upon more direct confrontations, they may vomit Scarlet Rot. \nThey are quite resistant to &lt;a href=\"Slash\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; damage, taking 35% and 40% less damage from these types. They have no resistance to &lt;a href=\"Pierce\"&gt;Pierce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage and will take 20% extra damage from &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; attacks unless the scythe-wielding variant has cast its resistance incantation. \nBosses.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nStillwater Cave=\nBackground.\nA lone Cleanrot Knight, encountered in an alcove at the very end of &lt;a href=\"Stillwater%20Cave\"&gt;Stillwater Cave&lt;/a&gt; that has been partially flooded in poisonous waters.\nStrategy.\nMost of the room is full of &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;poisonous&lt;/a&gt; water so it's advisable to quickly run to the small island of safety just left of the boss, in the middle left to far left section of the room. \nSince this boss is the spear-wielding variant and this fight will most likely happen early in the game it's extremely important to avoid its &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;Scarlet Rot&lt;/a&gt;-inducing, charging grab attack (signified by its spear glowing a bright gold). This is most easily done by rolling diagonally forward to get to the other side of the boss. Since the boss is vulnerable to backstabs\nAbandoned Cave=\nBackground.\nA Cleanrot Knight and its commander, both encountered in an alcove at the very end of &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Cave\"&gt;Abandoned Cave&lt;/a&gt; that has been partially flooded by scarlet rot. The remains of numerous Abudctor Virgins lay scattered around the arena. \nStrategy.\nAs the fight starts only the spear-wielder is present, with the scythe-wielding commander rising from the rot pool to the left within 12 seconds of starting the fight. As such it is best to spend that opening either summmoning a &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; or rushing down the spear knight to try and at least severely wound it before the scythe knight can join the fray. \nOf the two combatants, the spear knight is more aggressive and will try to restrict player movement with its Sacred Phalanx and inflict &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;Scarlet Rot&lt;/a&gt; with its charge while the scythe knight will harass from afar with Miquella's Ring of Light and buff both of them with a unique combination of health regeneration and extra &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; resistance to cover for one of their weaknesses. \nIf fighting alone, try to pull the spear knight to the right so that the hill blocks the light rings and buy extra time to kill it. \n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Origins become more efficient when they have lower stats as this means the low stat can be ignored and the points can instead be invested in attributes that the build makes use of. With Confessor's lowest stat values being a 9 in Intelligence and a 9 in Arcane, the origin only has a maximum of 2 points it can potentially save when compared with &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretch&lt;/a&gt;. Even in a build where none of its other points are wasted, &lt;a href=\"Prophet\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hero\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vagabond\"&gt;Vagabond&lt;/a&gt; save more stat points overall than Confessor, as their lowest stats are all at 7 which grants them far more build potential. Note that these builds are not necessarily \"good\", they are just what this origin is better at than any other.\nSword of Night and Flame.\nDespite the issues inherent to confessor it has one single solitary niche, being one of the two most optimal origins to build for the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Night%20and%20Flame\"&gt;Sword of Night and Flame&lt;/a&gt;. It shares this tie with &lt;a href=\"Astrologer\"&gt;Astrologer&lt;/a&gt; and both origins save 1 stat point on this build when compared to &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretch&lt;/a&gt;. The only notable difference between the two options is that Confessor has 2 less Mind than Astrologer. This gap in FP does not affect the number of times you are able to use the sword's weapon skill, meaning that Confessor is overall the most optimal origin if you specifically do not want to cast spells as part of this build, or invest in being able to cast the weapon skill more often."}

They were characterized by the torrent of life design emblazoned on their reddish armor. Much like the Crucible they venerated, the Crucible Knights possessed the ability to manifest the forms of various beasts. It is said the vitalic power they drew from inhabited their very armor. \nThe two most-renowned knights were &lt;a href=\"Ordovis\"&gt;Ordovis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Siluria\"&gt;Siluria&lt;/a&gt;. Ordovis led the axe knights in battle with a &lt;a href=\"Ordovis%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and heavy &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20Hornshield\"&gt;hornshield&lt;/a&gt;.

Her warriors marked themselves with the image of a great tree.\nThe Crucible Knights were instrumental in the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; and fought for &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; when he was &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their accolades, they too fell from grace. As the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; flourished and its origin became a distant memory, the knights came to be treated with scorn for their chaotic strength and appearance.\nThe knight &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20Knight%20Devonia\"&gt;Devonia&lt;/a&gt; entered the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; in search of the very source of the Crucible. Their solitary quest led them to &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Ruins%20of%20Rauh\"&gt;Ancient Ruins of Rauh&lt;/a&gt; where it was said the power of the Crucible once flourished. Devonia fixated their gaze upon the distant &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;Gate of Divinity&lt;/a&gt; atop the veiled tower of &lt;a href=\"Enir-Ilim\"&gt;Enir-Ilim&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics.\nThe &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; of the Crucible Knights were forged with the red-tinted &lt;a href=\"primordial%20gold\"&gt;primordial gold&lt;/a&gt;, and are imbued with its divine energies. As a result, they serve as conduits for invoking the primal &lt;a href=\"Aspects%20of%20the%20Crucible%20Incantations\"&gt;Aspects of the Crucible&lt;/a&gt;. These abilities manifest as gleaming pair golden wings, a hefty tail covered in horns, or an expandable throat pouch filled with fiery breath. High-ranking members of the Crucible Knights were able to use their weapons to generate a Crucible vortex. The wind generated by these abilities is capable of forming tornados."}

However, the &lt;a href=\"Hornsent%20%28people%29\"&gt;hornsent&lt;/a&gt;, worshippers of the primordial &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, oppressed and persecuted the shamans, whom they saw as impure. The Crucible was revered by the hornsent for its blending of life, and those without its blessings were butchered and placed in &lt;a href=\"Jar%20Innards\"&gt;jars&lt;/a&gt; to undergo a divine rebirthing ritual to achieve sainthood. The shamans' flesh was prized for its unique affinity to meld harmoniously with others.\nAt some point, Marika was chosen as an &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt; and was given a &lt;a href=\"Shadowbound%20Beast\"&gt;Shadowbound Beast&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Maliketh\"&gt;Maliketh&lt;/a&gt;, though she was unaware that her guiding &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt; had long been broken. Upon reaching the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;Gate of Divinity&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Enir-Ilim\"&gt;Enir-Ilim&lt;/a&gt;, she ascended to godhood, becoming the divine vessel of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;. This event led to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; and its counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"Scadutree\"&gt;Scadutree&lt;/a&gt;, an act the Hornsent saw as treachery.\nPurging the Realm of Shadow.\nDuring her rise to power, Marika waged war on the Hornsent and ordered her son Messmer to purge the Realm of Shadow, since it didn't bear the light of grace. The campaign proved to be such an appalling war where there was no honor nor mercy. Together with his &lt;a href=\"Messmer%20Soldier\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; (which also consists of his primary force, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knights\"&gt;Black Knights&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Furnace%20Golem\"&gt;Furnace Golems&lt;/a&gt;), Messmer laid waste to the Realm of Shadow, destroying everything in his path while slaughtering any Hornsent he would find and those deemed impure. He was aided by his brother-in-arms &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gaius\"&gt;Commander Gaius&lt;/a&gt;, who directed Messmer's soldiers while atop his boar steed.\nAs the Crusade raged on, Messmer's army came across the church of &lt;a href=\"Romina%2C%20Saint%20of%20the%20Bud\"&gt;Romina, Saint of the Bud&lt;/a&gt;, which was put to the torch by Messmer's forces, leaving Romina in stunned silence as she held a bud in her hands amidst the burning ruins of her church. During the campaign, Messmer would engage many foes in battle, including the Divine Beasts, who are revered by the Hornsent as messengers of the heavens. A majority of the Divine Beasts were killed in the Crusade, in which they were gored and then impaled on Messmer's spears alongside many other victims, earning him the infamous cognomen, \"Messmer the Impaler\", with his undertaking of the Crusade making him a symbol of fear as his mother wished.\nAftermath.\nMarika the Eternal abandoned Messmer in the Realm of Shadow so he could continue the purge while Marika ceased all contact with him and severed all history related to the Crusade so nobody could know of her origins. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;a Tarnished Champion&lt;/a&gt; entered the Land of Shadow. In traversing the lands, they came into contact with and frequently engaged Messmer's army, leading to the deaths of Gaius and eventually Messmer himself.\nDespite this, the Crusade continued to have a lasting impact on the Realm of Shadow, as surviving Hornsent hold the Erdtree in contempt, developing a deep grudge for or seeking revenge against Messmer and his forces for their betrayal. Because of how appalling and disgraceful the Crusade turned out to be, the war was deemed unworthy of being put to song."}

They possess a form of cognition known as the \"wisdom of the stone\", and bear the sole purpose of safeguarding their crystals until the end. They wield weaponry fashioned from crystal, a deed impossible for a human, and are believed by some to await the return of their creator who will craft them new brethren. \nIn combat, Crystalians are highly resistant to attacks. Breaking their stance will lower their defence, rendering them significantly more susceptible to all forms of attack, and prevent most weapons from bouncing of them.\nPutrid Crystalians, infected by Scarlet Rot, also exist.

Darian encountered and became an ally of Gurranq, who bid him to weed out &lt;a href=\"Deathroot\"&gt;Deathroot&lt;/a&gt;, a plant which caused the emergence of Those Who Live in Death, so that he might feed it to him.\nFollowing the traces of death, Darian came upon &lt;a href=\"Summonwater%20Village\"&gt;Summonwater Village&lt;/a&gt;, where a &lt;a href=\"Tibia%20Mariner\"&gt;Tibia Mariner&lt;/a&gt; had set up shop.

After the champion defeats the Mariner and weeds out the Deathroot, Darian offers them a deal; to take his place as Gurranq's servant, in exchange for Gurranq sharing with them the strength of beasts.\nWith other matters to attend to, Darian relocates to &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;. After the Tarnished takes him up on his offer, he declares them brothers-in-arms and teaches them the fundamentalist techniques wielded by the hunters of the dead. Another resident of &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt; and associate of the Tarnished champion is &lt;a href=\"Fia\"&gt;Fia&lt;/a&gt;, a deathbed companion and servant of the &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Prince of Death&lt;/a&gt;. Fia gives the Tarnished a dagger, asking them to find its rightful owner. After the Tarnished shows Darian the dagger, he offers to return it to its owner.\nShortly thereafter, Darian is murdered by Fia.

Their purpose was to tend the ghostflame by raking out the ashen remains of the death from their kiln. Because of this, they were called graveyard fire keepers and used to be widely active before the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; existed, although regarded as malevolent deities by some.\nThrough the ancient act of the rite of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;, priests of old were permitted to come among the deathbirds and become their guardians, and act which serves as an oath sworn to their distant resurrection. Such priests can be seen inside their wings as spirit beings wielding &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ritual%20Spear\"&gt;death ritual spears&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoss fight.\nThe Death Rite Bird often spawns from a giant ball of Ghostflame up in the sky.\nIt is possible to lock onto either the boss's head or the spine. It takes extra damage when hit in the head, but due to how much it moves, it can disorienting and result in getting dead-angled when blocking, so it's usually safer to lock into the spine or not at all.\nWhile it is possible to fight this boss on horseback, it is not recommended. The safest place to be in melee range is behind its legs, where neither the weapon swings, nor the beak can hit you.\nThis boss can be staggered when dealt enough damage, giving you a window to land a visceral attack on its head.\nMoveset.\nThe first phase is very similar to a normal Deathbird fight, with the difference that its melee attacks deal both physical and ghostflame damage, making shields somewhat less effective although blocking is still preferable to receiving the damage directly.\nDeath Rite Birds also uses Ghostflame Ignition, the unique ash of war of the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Poker\"&gt;Death's Poker&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhase 2.\nWhen dropping to 50% HP it gains 3 new attacks:\nWeaknesses.\nAs they count as &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt; they are weak to &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; damage and extremely weak to specific anti-undead weapons. and &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Water%20Pot\"&gt;Holy Water Pots&lt;/a&gt; are useful tools to make short work of these enemies, even if the user doesn't have a lot of &lt;a href=\"Faith\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;. \nBosses.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nLiurnia of the Lakes=\nBackground.\nFound at night.

Although they are intelligent and capable of speech, as exemplified by &lt;a href=\"Boc%20the%20Seamster\"&gt;Boc the Seamster&lt;/a&gt;, they are typically violent and brutish, particularly at night when their blood boils and they turn feral.\nDemi-Humans wield a variety of weapons, such as falchions, daggers, and clubs. Those considered to be the toughest wield spiked clubs, which they believe to be a badge of honor.\nDemi-Human society appears to be hierarchical, with the lesser Demi-Humans following much larger Demi-Human Chiefs. Demi-Humans lose hope if their leader dies, causing them to panic and stop attacking. At the top of the Demi-Human hierarchy are the Queens, who are capable of wielding rudimentary sorceries via their staves. \nDespite their violent demeanour, Demi-Humans are capable of fostering diplomatic relations with humans, with &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Haight\"&gt;Kenneth Haight&lt;/a&gt; building an alliance with a group of Demi-Humans in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Haight\"&gt;Fort Haight&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nLarger, more bestial Demi-Humans that serve as leaders of their smaller brethren.

His devoted apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Demi-Human%20Swordsman%20Yosh\"&gt;Yosh&lt;/a&gt;, defied him and spent the remainder of his days in hermitage by his side.\nDecline.\nAt some point, the demi-humans were stripped of their staggering intelligence and were reduced to violent, cave-dwelling brutes. Their blood began to boil, and their eyes shone red beneath the moonlight. Their vast knowledge of the cosmos vanished as they reverted into savagery. \nDemi-human society remained stratified, but its complexity was greatly diminished. Although sorceress queens still reigned over large colonies, most demi-humans fragmented into small bands formed under &lt;a href=\"Demi-Human%20Chief\"&gt;chief&lt;/a&gt;s. They yielded to strength and valued toughness. Nonetheless, demi-humans became cowards who only ventured out from the safety of their caves to raid or ambush travelers on the road. The very few that retained their wits or manners were beaten and shunned.\nDespite their general incivility, demi-humans were capable of amicable relations during the age of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. The principled and noble &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Haight\"&gt;Kenneth Haight&lt;/a&gt; once forged an alliance with a group of demi-humans at his &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Haight\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt; in east &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Sorcerer\"&gt;glintstone sorcerers&lt;/a&gt; left the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt; to dwell among the demi-humans. They offered &lt;a href=\"Demi-Human%20Queen%27s%20Staff\"&gt;specialty staves&lt;/a&gt; to the queens to earn their trust and observe their dormant magic. A mission was established at a &lt;a href=\"Hermit%20Village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt; ruled by &lt;a href=\"Demi-Human%20Queen%20Maggie\"&gt;Queen Maggie&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the very colony that &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Sorcerer%20Azur\"&gt;Primeval Sorcerer Azur&lt;/a&gt; joined after glimpsing the &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Current\"&gt;Primeval Current&lt;/a&gt; beyond the &lt;a href=\"Crystalian\"&gt;wisdom of stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics.\nDemi-humans are bestial in appearance, often characterized by fur, elongated faces, and pointed ears. They exhibit a blend of human and mammalian features, yet all share the common trait of possessing five fingers and toes. While typically shorter than the &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, demi-humans vary greatly in size\u2014some are as small as children while others are of towering stature. The chiefs and queens are tattooed with archaic symbols. \nDemi-humans wield a variety of melee &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"club\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"falchion\"&gt;falchion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Knife\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodstained%20Dagger\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rickety%20Shield\"&gt;rickety shields&lt;/a&gt;. Those who prove their toughness carry &lt;a href=\"Spiked%20Club\"&gt;spiked clubs&lt;/a&gt;. The ancient swordsmen among them remain devoted to their &lt;a href=\"Star-Lined%20Sword\"&gt;star-lined blades&lt;/a&gt;, while their queens cast remedial glintstone sorceries with the wave of a &lt;a href=\"Demi-Human%20Queen%27s%20Staff\"&gt;sceptor&lt;/a&gt;. Although many demi-humans carry &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;, few demi-humans are known for their skill with &lt;a href=\"Sewing%20Needle\"&gt;sewing needles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs night falls, demi-humans become increasingly feral and aggressive, their eyes glowing a menacing red. In certain queens, this glow is permanent, shifting to a deep, ominous purple."}

It is represented in the visage of a single eye with a fiery-orange iris and nine pupils within.\nIt physically manifests itself in the shape of a grotesque face in the torsos of its followers, channeling its power through them, its greatest flames emerging from its mouth (commonly located in the host giant's stomach) along with the undying flames found seeded within their &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;giant black forge&lt;/a&gt; enabling its followers to develop innumerable fire &lt;a href=\"incantations\"&gt;incantations&lt;/a&gt;. \nBackground.\nThe fell god of fire has been around for a long time and predates the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;.

Once the Fire Giants were defeated, Queen Marika realized the fires of their forge could not die and thus sealed it away, reducing its once formidable flame into mere embers and cursing the last surviving Fire Giant to keep them so for all eternity. \nEven then, after countless years, innumerable &lt;a href=\"Prophet\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;s would be haunted by visions of its flames consuming the Erdtree. And the one-eyed god still lurks dormant within its subjects, on the cusp of being awakened at any moment with a sufficient sacrificial offering.\nRelevant Items.\nItems related to or referencing the One-Eyed God\nReferences.\n[[Category:Lore]]\n[[Category:Outer Gods]]\n[[Category:Unseen Characters]]"}

She would receive the warmth and vigor from champions, and then lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life. This was the sole purpose of Fia's existence, and was considered a sacred act in her homeland. \nHowever, before Fia could bear the noble into new life, she was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from her birthplace, travelling to the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. At some point she met a chivalrous knight by the name of &lt;a href=\"Lionel%20the%20Lionhearted\"&gt;Lionel the Lionhearted&lt;/a&gt;. Upon meeting the exiled Fia, Lionel declared himself to be her father, and became her loyal companion..\nFia found herself in &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where she continued to perform her role as a Deathbed Companion. Here, she encountered &lt;a href=\"Rogier\"&gt;Rogier&lt;/a&gt;, a spellblade obsessed with Those Who Live in Death, and a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt; seeking to become &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Rogier began an investigation into the events surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;, which had led to the death of Godwyn, aided by the Tarnished champion. Fia subtly aided the pair in their investigation, pointing them towards the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knifeprint\"&gt;Black Knifeprint&lt;/a&gt;, and granted her services to the Tarnished champion, taking their warmth and vigor in exchange for her blessings.\nUnbeknownst to the other Tarnished of Roundtable Hold, Fia was the companion of &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn&lt;/a&gt;, the Prince of Death, and wished to become a mother to Those Who Live in Death.

He is encountered at &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Peak\"&gt;Flame Peak&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;. This encounter is not optional as it must be completed to unlock &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Crumbling Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt; and advance the main storyline.\nOverview.\nIn the days before the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, the Giants carved out a civilization in the inhospitable mountains to the north, after chasing away the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Ice Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s who had previously ruled it. Here, they worshipped a &lt;a href=\"Fell%20God\"&gt;Fell God&lt;/a&gt; and were bound to tend the &lt;a href=\"Giants%27%20Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; of their god for eternity. \nBefore &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; ushered in her &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20the%20Erdtree\"&gt;Age of the Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, she had her then husband, &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, launch an &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Giants\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; against the Giants, fearing that their &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; might burn her &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mighty Giants borrowed the power of their fell god, but were still defeated by Godfrey and his &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20Knights\"&gt;Crucible Knights&lt;/a&gt;, with Marika allegedly striking down the fell god. Only a single Fire Giant remained, and Marika cursed him to forever tend his Flame, ensuring it could not harm her Erdtree. During this time, the Fire Giant crafted a leg brace for a wound on his left leg. \nAfter untold ages of tending the flame, the Fire Giant's vigil is interrupted by a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to harness the Flame to burn the Erdtree. The Fire Giant fights to crush the champion, but the Tarnished repeatedly strikes at the Giant's legs, slicing apart his leg brace and causing the Giant's left leg to break. In immense pain, the Fire Giant tears off the foot of his broken leg, using it as a sacrifice to unleash the power of the fell god. Despite being on more even terms, the Fire Giant is eventually felled by the Tarnished.\nBoss Fight.\n&lt;a href=\"Alexander%2C%20Warrior%20Jar\"&gt;Alexander, Warrior Jar&lt;/a&gt; is available as a summon for this fight, provided he has been met at &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;. His summon sign is just inside the boss gate.\n&lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;Torrent&lt;/a&gt; can be used during this fight.\nThe arena is a large snowfield with craggy, uneven terrain. The field slops upwards from the entrance, and the Giant begins the fight at the top of the slope. Torrent can be called during this fight, and is useful for covering distance and avoiding the avalanche by jumping.\nPhase 1.\nDuring phase 1, the Fire Giant will fight using a large, circular dish. Although he is fairly slow-moving, he is able to cover distance using his roll. He also possesses the ability to launch an avalanche straight towards the player. Initially, the majority of his attacks involve slamming the dish into the ground.\nThe objective initially is to attack the red braids wrapped around his left leg. After enough damage has been dealt, the braids will fall off, uncovering his injured ankle. At this point he will roll three times in succession, and then reach into the mouth on his abdomen, coating his hand in flames. He now gains the ability to use two fire-based abilities- a fast-moving fireball, and a large, slow-moving fire orb that homes in on the player.\nPhase 2.\nOnce his health drops below 47%, a cutscene plays and phase 2 begins. The Fire Giant has now lost the large dish as well as his left leg, and is forced to kneel on the ground. He is less mobile during this phase, however he can still roll. He now has a greater variety of fire spells. He may summon pillars of fire that erupt from the ground around him, breathe fire, or spew molten rocks that rain down on the arena. His weak spot is now on his left forearm."}
