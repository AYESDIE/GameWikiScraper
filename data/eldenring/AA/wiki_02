It is feared by many for its uncanny ability to destroy individuality, capable of melting away even eternal spirits. Those deeply stricken by its folly develop an insatiable need to spread its influence further, willingly seeking to infect others with it. These patients known by some as &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Followers\"&gt;Chaos Followers&lt;/a&gt;, yearn for the arrival of their &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;lord&lt;/a&gt; so that they may incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.\nOverview.\nOne of the unique properties of the flame, destroying individuality, manifests mainly in its ability to seemingly brainwash those it has afflicted. Many patients are capable repeating the same crys and phrases as each other despite never having interacted with one another (the most notable of these phrases being \"Melt it all away...\" and \"May chaos take the world!\" repeated ad nauseam). Seemingly blending their minds into a single, hivemind-like state.\nA chosen few of those afflicted are capable of transforming into the Lord of Frenzied Flame after death. The strength of a lord can seemingly vary depending on who its original host was, with several having proven to be capable of becoming one, however many of them were either too non-committal or physically feeble to accomplish anything, causing them to be considered frauds and failures in the eyes of their followers. Once a Lord of Frenzied Flame manifests, the head of the original host is replaced by a black hole with yellow flames spewing out of its core, completely erasing any trace of the original host's identity.\nThe origins of the flame is unclear, as the flame itself is said to have made its first appearance in the empty eye sockets of &lt;a href=\"Shabriri\"&gt;Shabriri&lt;/a&gt;, after his eyes were gouged out in punishment for slander. However, its incantations, the most powerful means that the flame manifests itself through, are also said to have come from the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Fingers\"&gt;Three Fingers&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the clasp of Three Fingers that appoints a specific subject to become a Lord of Frenzied Flame.\nEven without direct influence of the Three Fingers, the flame is capable of appearing on its own in sites of great suffering, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ninth%20Mt.%20Gelmir%20Campsite\"&gt;ninth campsite&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;, where it has appeared in the eyes of &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%20Soldier\"&gt;Leyndell Soldiers&lt;/a&gt; suffering from the trauma of a particularly appalling battle. It has also appeared in the eyes of the surface-dwelling &lt;a href=\"Nomadic%20Merchants\"&gt;Nomadic Merchants&lt;/a&gt;, and while they are unable to settle and are forced to move around the lands constantly, their relative freedom gives them enough comfort to endure only minor symptoms, enabling some them the ability to have fairly normal conversations with average passerby. Uttering the mantras of the Chaos Followers only when attacked or dying at the hands of murderous highwaymen.\nSome have willingly pursued the Frenzied Flame in an attempt to use it as a powerful weapon, however every attempt to control the flame has ended in failure and left the people who pursued it with irreparable psychological damage. \nIn a cruel twist of fate, the fear the world has for the flame has only supported its growth, as any attempt to quell it through the punishment and subjugation of its subjects has only intensified and worsened their symptoms, allowing the flame to fester more deeply into its hosts, becoming more powerful and widespread as their own suffering increases. Primary example of this being the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order's&lt;/a&gt; punishment of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Caravan\"&gt;Great Caravan&lt;/a&gt;, after they were accused of heretical beliefs and the &lt;a href=\"Hornsent%20%28people%29\"&gt;Hornsent's&lt;/a&gt; damnation of &lt;a href=\"Midra%2C%20Lord%20of%20Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Midra&lt;/a&gt; and his entourage, after their attempt of studying of the flame. Both events would eventually lead to the near-or-complete successful manifestation of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Lord of Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt;. \nRelevant Items.\nItems related to or referencing the Frenzied Flame\nReferences.\n[[Category:Concepts]]"}

This results in combat feeling clunky and unfair, as players doubt and question if the game is even responding to their inputs when it\u2019s supposed to. These are similar to exploits and passive glitches, which tend to affect the game as a whole negatively for all players, but in a way that is difficult for most to pin down. \nThe following are input drop issues that players have been able to identify:\nSprint-Guarding Input-Drop.\nWhen stopping a sprint and lowering your guard around the same time, any action the player inputs will be dropped (e.g. rolling, attacking). \nTwo-Hand-Jumping Input-Drop.\nWhen continuing to sprint after a jump, the player cannot queue a light attack action for a significant amount of time after landing, while any other input works including guarding. This does not occur when 1-handing weapons.\nAt the below timestamp, you can see the keyboard \u201cLight Attack\u201d input being repeatedly dropped, only while 2-handing and after landing from a sprinting jump. \nDamage Occurrence Input-Drop.\nWhen the player receives damage that does not stun them, certain actions seem to be cleared from the input queue such as roll dodging, which causes players to be hit again as they expected the game to not clear their input. This has been confirmed to be a result of the damage occurrence and not any misconceptions with queue timing. \nMoving Toggle Input-Drop.\nWhile moving during a toggle (weapon swap/2-handing) animation, it is impossible to buffer another action out of the animation until it finishes. Despite this, you are still able to buffer actions when toggling while standing still.\nAt the timestamp below, you can see the keyboard \u201cHeavy Attack\u201d input being dropped only while doing a moving toggle. \nNotes &amp; References.\nFor preservation purposes: this page currently uses the information and wording offered by the community-made, yet currently expired (as during the writing of this page) Elden Ring PvP website."}

He resided in a fort known as &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Haight\"&gt;Fort Haight&lt;/a&gt;, and is known for his considerable largesse, at least by his own account. &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the Grafted&lt;/a&gt; assumed control of &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, and at some point sent a knight commander to seize Fort Haight.\nDriven out of his home, Kenneth began searching for adventurers who might help him restore control of his fort. He was stumbled upon by a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt;, and despite some reticence in accepting the help of a Tarnished, bid them to retake his fort in exchange for a handsome reward, while also sharing with them his exceedingly low opinion of Godrick.\nUpon the Tarnished's success, a joyous Kenneth Haight grants them a reward and thanks them profusely. In addition, he offers them the opportunity to be knighted and enter into his service. He tells them to meet him as his fort, where the ceremony shall be held.\nHowever, upon seeing the sorry state of his fort, Kenneth becomes maudlin. Believing that Limgrave cannot remain without a proper ruler, he dedicates himself to finding a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage as soon as possible. He apologizes to the Tarnished, telling them he now lacks the authority to lift them to knighthood. \nAfter the death of Godrick, Kenneth eventually encounters a worthy lord; &lt;a href=\"Nepheli%20Loux\"&gt;Nepheli Loux&lt;/a&gt;. Kenneth joins her in the throne room of &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle&lt;/a&gt; to aid her in assuming the reins of the castle. When the Tarnished who had once aided him comes to visit, Kenneth tells him he intends to eventually return to his fort, where he can fulfill his old promise and raise them to knighthood at last. \nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

From a young age, Diallos was all talk and no trousers, with an inability to commit to action. As a result, Juno inherited the Hoslow legacy without resistance. Juno loved his brother dearly and showered him with adoration. Diallos, in turn, admired his brother, a mighty warrior who lived up to the bloody legacy of House Hoslow. Diallos aspired to be like his older brother, knowing that pursuing the bloody legacy of their house would break his brother's heart.\nDiallos had a servant by the name of &lt;a href=\"Lanya\"&gt;Lanya&lt;/a&gt; and the two were companions since childhood. At some point, the two set out on a journey in the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;, but Diallos lost track of the fickle Lanya, and the two became separated. He made his way to &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt; where he implored the Hold's visitors to keep an eye out for Lanya.\nDiallos eventually managed to track Lanya down to &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, where he found her dead. He deduced that the recusants of the &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor\"&gt;Volcano Manor&lt;/a&gt; were behind her death and swore vengeance upon them. He tracked them down to their hideout on &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt.

Having achieved nothing, he declared himself a complete fool, just as his brother had said, for abandoning the path of revenge and sullying the name of his house. \nDiallos left the Volcano Manor and travelled to &lt;a href=\"Jarburg\"&gt;Jarburg&lt;/a&gt;, a settlement for &lt;a href=\"Living%20Jars\"&gt;Living Jars&lt;/a&gt;. Diallos became Jarburg's new \"Potentate\" and devoted himself to caring for the jars. Diallos was at peace with his new calling, feeling for the first time in his life that he was on the straight and narrow.\nWhen Jarburg was invaded by jar-poachers, Diallos took up arms to defend his charges. He was mortally wounded in the battle, but managed to drive off the poachers and saved most of the jars. Diallos died at peace, having finally proven his worth.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

All variants are gaunt, elongated figures with smooth, slippery skin. Dorsal and caudal fins line their long tails, which they use to prop themselves upright in a curved posture. Their drooped faces bear four sets of forward-facing, human-like eyes. They have five fingers on their large hands, but three digits on their vestigial feet. Strips of what appear to be shed skin or textile loosely cling to their lower body.\nThere are three variants of this enemy: Black Lamprey, White Lamprey, and Giant Lamprey.\nThe black lampreys are the standard variant of this enemy type.\nThe pinkish-white lampreys dwell in the foggy &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Ruins%20of%20Dheo\"&gt;Finger Ruins of Dheo&lt;/a&gt;. These individuals have additional attacks that deal &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage. They appear to vomit a mixture of blood, bile, and worms when fighting at short range.\nThe largest lampreys are vigilant sentries that cast binding magic from afar. These creatures act as stationary turrets, maintaining their position and refusing to pursue distant targets that move out of their line of site. However, they are more active when fighting nearby targets.\nGiant lampreys conjure explosive purple spheres and hurl them at their targets. Upon detonation, the blast stuns the victim with concentric purple rings for a few seconds. If their target is stunned by their Finger Snare attack, one nearby lamprey will teleport in to perform a grab attack.\nMoveset.\nEach move has several alternate animations."}

Cone-shaped hats woven from straw are also worn in the Land of Reeds.\nThe warrior, &lt;a href=\"Okina\"&gt;Okina&lt;/a&gt;, was a swordsman from the Land of Reeds. It is said that through repeated combat, his mind was sharpened. From his perspective, he began to see the absurdities of the world in stark relief. As a result, he chose to renounce everything, ascending to a plane where it only himself, his katana, and his mastery. Before long, Okina had become a demon of a swordsman. For unknown reasons; perhaps seeking stronger opponents, Okina travelled to the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. There, he met &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, in battle. Upon feeling OkIna's blade strike his flesh, Mohg realised the extent of the Reedlander's maddness, and was captivated. In that moment, he made the swordsman an offer: a life in which his thirst for blood would never be sated. Okina agreed, joining the ranks of Mohg's Bloody Fingers. In return, Mohg coated &lt;a href=\"Rivers%20of%20Blood\"&gt;his katana&lt;/a&gt; in cursed blood, so that Okina could better pursue his bloodlust.\nDuring Okina's time in the Land of Reeds, his talents had earned a loyal following of fellow warriors known as the &lt;a href=\"Inaba%2C%20Disciple%20of%20Okina\"&gt;Inaba&lt;/a&gt;, who became his disciples. The Inaba, and potentially Okina himself, practiced Seppuku, a forbidden combat technique developed in the Land of Reeds. It involves the user impaling themselves with their own weapon, briefly enchanting it to improve damage output and its abilty to inflict blood loss on others. Having been abandoned by Okina when he left for the Lands Between, the &lt;a href=\"Inaba%2C%20Disciple%20of%20Okina\"&gt;Inaba&lt;/a&gt; soon pursued their former master, seeking revenge and death in battle, as was their ultimate goal.\nPeople.\nThe peoples hailing from this land are referred to as \"Reedlanders\" and are select-able as a base template for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;player character's&lt;/a&gt; appearance."}

Following Fortissax's defeat, Fia gestates the &lt;a href=\"Mending%20Rune%20of%20the%20Death-Prince\"&gt;Mending Rune of the Death-Prince&lt;/a&gt;, which may usher in an age of death restored.\nAs well as being able to breathe fire like other Ancient Dragons, Fortissax possesses the ability to summon a storm of gold and black lightning bolts which cover a wide area and inflict &lt;a href=\"Death%20Blight\"&gt;Death Blight&lt;/a&gt;. It can also summon a bolt of red lightning, which it slams into the ground, releasing waves of red lightning in multiple directions. After its health has been reduced to 60%, it gains the ability to summon two lightning spears at once, as well as a divebomb ability which is followed by a spinning attack using a lightning glaive.\nMoveset.\nCan include a separate table for a specific instance of this variant's moveset."}

War Surgeons, despite their name, are not surgeons or doctors. They act as mercy killers on battlefields, putting dying soldiers out of their misery as quickly as possible by delivering final blows. Varr\u00e9 was a war surgeon prior to his association with Mohg.\nVarr\u00e9 was abducted by Mohg against his will along with various other war surgeons, however it was noted that Varr\u00e9 was particularly talented with blood incantations, and that of all the war surgeons abducted he was the only one able to \"tame\" Mohg's cursed blood. Somewhere along the way Varr\u00e9 came to genuinely worship Mohg. If game data is accessed to remove his mask, you can see Mohg's emblem painted on his forehead.\nVarr\u00e9 is generally regarded as enticing but deceitful. He is eloquent and is kind to the Tarnished at first, but this appears to be a front as his personality can change dramatically if elicited by disobedience. For example: He will try to suggest he is helping the Tarnished, and refers to them with the pet name \"Lambkin\", but if provoked he consequently will refer to them as a \"runt\" and \"low born\". If the tarnished refuses Varr\u00e9's offer to join Mohg, then he will indignantly remark that they must have misheard his request, and that he will wait \"for your ears to clean out.\"\nVarr\u00e9 seems to also harbor some level of sadism, or in the least, an indifference to the pain of others. He asks the Tarnished to soak a cloth in a finger maiden's blood and remarks that since they have no maiden of their own, \"any maiden will do\". When he injects the tarnished with royal blood and they scream in pain, he chuckles in a shocked tone and says \"clench your teeth, or something.\" When the ritual is completed he will remark that the tarnished as \"the sweetest scream\". If attacked at the Rose church he will remark upon killing the tarnished that \"materials of quality are so hard to find these days\", revealing that he only ever thought of the Tarnished as a material or tool.\nEvents in Game.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;The Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; first encounters him in Limgrave, after exiting the Stranded Graveyard, where he offers them guidance, noticing that they are not accompanied by a Finger Maiden. He advises the Tarnished to journey to &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle&lt;/a&gt; and challenge &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the Grafted&lt;/a&gt; for his &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt;, and recommends that they visit the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tarnished encounters him again in &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, outside the &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Church\"&gt;Rose Church&lt;/a&gt;. Here, he tests the Tarnished's dedication to the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, expressing his own doubts about the veracity of their words. If the Tarnished shares his concerns, he reveals himself to be a loyal disciple of &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, and offers the Tarnished the opportunity to join his new dynasty. After the Tarnished completes their initiation, by soaking a cloth in the blood of a maiden, Varr\u00e9 awards them with a &lt;a href=\"Pureblood%20Knight%27s%20Medal\"&gt;medal&lt;/a&gt; which will grant them audience with Mohg when the time is right. He also injects the Tarnished's finger with noble blood, allowing them to invade other worlds.\nThe Tarnished journeys to &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Palace\"&gt;Mohgwyn Palace&lt;/a&gt; where they encounter Varr\u00e9 for the final time, invading his world and defeating him. Varr\u00e9 dies on the ground of Mohgwyn Palace after blessing Mohg's dynasty.\nLocation.\nJust past the &lt;a href=\"Sites%20of%20Grace\"&gt;Site of Grace&lt;/a&gt;. Will leave a message in his spot after talking with &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Reader%20Enia\"&gt;Finger Reader Enia&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Church\"&gt;Rose Church&lt;/a&gt;, to the west of the Site of Grace.\nHis invasion sign is located in the hallway before the Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint Site of Grace. After defeating him, Varr\u00e9 will be found laying on the floor close to where the sign previously was.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

While this encounter is not required to advance the story, Rennala must be defeated to unlock &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Altar\"&gt;Moonlight Altar&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to respec, and &lt;a href=\"Endings\"&gt;a certain ending&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAs a young &lt;a href=\"astrologer\"&gt;astrologer&lt;/a&gt; who gazed at the night sky and always chased the &lt;a href=\"stars\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt;, Rennala would encounter an enchanting &lt;a href=\"Rennala%27s%20Full%20Moon\"&gt;full moon&lt;/a&gt; that would one day bewitch the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria\"&gt;Academy of Raya Lucaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn her youth, she was a prominent champion who charmed the academy with her lunar magic, becoming its master. She established the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;house of Caria&lt;/a&gt; as royalty, and also led the &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Knights\"&gt;Glintstone Knights&lt;/a&gt;. These Carian Knights were heroes of the highest honors, anointed by the Lunar Queen, and despite numbering fewer then twenty, their power made them a match for even the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;champions of gold&lt;/a&gt; in battle. \nAfter &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; established her new &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20the%20Erdtree\"&gt;Age of the Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, she dispatched a champion known as &lt;a href=\"Radagon\"&gt;Radagon&lt;/a&gt; to lead her armies against &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;. Radagon fought two &lt;a href=\"Liurnian%20Wars\"&gt;Liurnian Wars&lt;/a&gt; against Rennala and the Academy, both of which saw no clear victor. Instead, Radagon repented his territorial aggressions by cleansing himself with &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Dew\"&gt;Celestial Dew&lt;/a&gt;, and swore his love to Rennala. They married at the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Church of Vows&lt;/a&gt;, uniting the houses of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; and the Moon. Rennala would gift Radagon with a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, bestowed by a Carian queen upon her spouse to honor long-standing tradition. \nTogether, they had three children: &lt;a href=\"Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rykard\"&gt;Rykard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ranni\"&gt;Ranni&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;, was hounded from the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;, Radagon left Rennala's side to become the second husband and King Consort of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika&lt;/a&gt;, and received the title of second Elden Lord. Queen Marika made Radagon's and Rennala's children her demigod stepchildren. When Radagon departed, he gifted Rennala the &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Egg\"&gt;amber egg&lt;/a&gt; containing the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Rune%20of%20The%20Unborn\"&gt;Great Rune of the Unborn&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen Radagon left, Rennala's heart left with him. Realizing their heartbroken queen was no champion at all, the Academy rebelled against the Carian Royal Family and Rennala would find herself under the assault of her own students, who would eventually lock her away in the &lt;a href=\"Raya%20Lucaria%20Grand%20Library\"&gt;grand library&lt;/a&gt;. She would slowly lose her mind and ended up devoting herself to the grim art of &lt;a href=\"Rebirth\"&gt;reincarnation&lt;/a&gt;, clutching the amber egg left to her by Radagon. She would use it on &lt;a href=\"Juvenile%20Scholar\"&gt;Juvenile Scholar&lt;/a&gt;s found around her, calling them her \"sweetings\", continuously rebirthing them in an imperfect process which would leave their memories fading into oblivion. The children born anew by Rennala were all frail and short-lived, imperfect beings, each and all. \nThe &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; gains entry to the Academy of Raya Lucaria in search of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Rune\"&gt;Great Rune&lt;/a&gt; contained within Rennala's amber egg. After fighting their way through the Academy, they encounter Rennala in the grand library, hovering in the air and clutching her egg. The tarnished fights their way through the Juvenile Scholars, halting the protective spell cast on the queen by their song. Before they can kill the Carian Queen, however, they are interrupted by the voice of Ranni, and an image of Rennala as she was long ago appears before them. The Tarnished does battle with the illusory Rennala in a moonlit sea, eventually defeating her and claiming her Great Rune. Rennala is left alive, sitting in her chair in the middle of the library, still clutching her egg. \nBoss Fight.\nPhase 1.\nRennala will float around the room, encased in a golden sphere which prevents her from taking damage. She will not contribute directly to the fight very often, instead relying on the &lt;a href=\"Juvenile%20Scholar\"&gt;Juvenile Scholar&lt;/a&gt;s, who will use lunges, fire breath, and telekinesis to attack the player. One of the Juvenile Scholars is singing- they can be spotted by the golden aura they emit plus the enchanted purple books they telekinetically throw at you, and will get louder as the player gets closer. If this Scholar is hit at least once (it does not need to be killed), another will start singing instead. Disrupt three singing Scholars to cause Rennala's sphere to break, dropping her to the ground and allowing the player to inflict damage; while Rennala is downed all of the Juvenile Scholars stop attacking you so you'll have a free window of opportunity to attack. After a few seconds, she will emit a golden explosion and begin floating again with her protective sphere restored. Repeat the process of hitting the singing Scholars several times for further opportunities to inflict damage on Rennala. Periodically, she will summon new scholars to replace those who have been killed.\nScholars will often hide behind the bookshelves that line the room. The gaps between bookshelves often have chandeliers above them, which will fall if the player stands beneath them or passes under them.\nThrough both phases Rennala is fairly resistant to magic damage, and more vulnerable to physical damage.\nPhase 2.\nAfter reducing Rennala's health to 0, a cutscene will play. The arena will change to a large, open watery plane, and Rennala will engage the player directly, with a full health bar. She makes use of an array of ranged magical attacks, but can also use her staff to physically attack the player if they get to close. Once her health drops below 60% she will begin summoning spirits to aid her. When she summons, a wide circle will appear around her, inflicting damage. She can summon a Bloodhound Knight, three wolves, a Dragon, and a Troll, each of which will disappear after a few seconds. Rennala is much more evasive during this phase, so a melee fighter may have trouble landing consecutive combos of attacks on her.\nEnvironment.\nPhase 1 takes place in a circular room with an open inner area and a more narrow outer area, divided by bookcases. The majority of the Juvenile Scholars congregate in the inner arena, however a few can be found hiding behind the bookcases. They can use their telekinetic abilities on the clutter in the area, such as the astrolabes, which they can throw at the player. Chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and may fall if the player stands underneath them.\nPhase 2 takes place in a large, open area with no obstacles or clutter. The space is useful for moving away from Rennala's homing attacks as there is nothing to get stuck on or blocked in by, as well as for separating Rennala from her summoned allies.\nRennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC).\nAfter defeating her, Rennala becomes an NPC, remaining in the library where she was fought in phase 1. As an NPC she offers two services: Rebirth allows the player to reallocate levels to different stats at the cost of a &lt;a href=\"Larval%20Tear\"&gt;Larval Tear&lt;/a&gt;, while Cosmetics allows the player to alter their character's appearance, which is the same function that the mirror in &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt; has.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20Sellen\"&gt;Sorceress Sellen&lt;/a&gt; moves to the Academy of Raya Lucaria during her questline, she will temporarily occupy Rennala's spot, while Rennala will move behind one of the bookshelves in the library. She will return to her usual place once Sellen's questline is completed.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

During that time, she held the Bud in speechless and in silence.\nAfterwards, she discovered a divine, but twisted element and weaved it into the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;Scarlet Rot&lt;/a&gt;. Through unknown means, she transformed into a parasitic creature, a hybrid of a centipede, &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt; and butterfly, while the Bud she held was converted into a poleblade that became Romina's signature weapon.\nBoss Fight.\nRomina is not an optional boss as it must be defeated in order to burn the Sealing Tree and reach &lt;a href=\"Enir-Ilim\"&gt;Enir-Ilim&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhase One.\nRomina is a distinctive opponent whose weaponry are her poleblade, centipede fangs and a scorpion stinger. It is important to have a balanced strategy of both offense and defense but it is advantageous to be more aggressive in battle.\nWhen fighting her, focus on her central human body as well as her centipede fangs and scorpion stinger, which act as her arms. These parts move independently, allowing her to launch multiple simultaneous attacks, such as swinging her spear while her stinger strikes from another direction. Her attacks include Heavy Spear Thrusts, Sweeping Stinger strikes, and Biting Fangs.\nHowever, her most common opening move is her Centipede Sweep, where the centipede part of her body will swing from right to left. It can be dodged by rolling forward. This will let you get close to Romina to deliver a full heavy attack. However, you have to be aware that she may follow up by dashing quickly and swing her poleblade, which can be avoided by rolling to the left or backwards.\nIt is important to always look at Romina's poleblade, as when it glows red, this shows that it has become enchanted with Scarlet Rot. If hit with the enchanted weapon, it will cause a Scarlet Rot build-up. Always be wary of her weapon status. One of the combos that she does with her enchanted weapon, is the Leap Combo where she starts with a poleblade sweep, an overhead attack, and then she jumps high in the air, and then plunges her weapon down. In order to dodge this, you can either:\nWhen the leap combo is dodged properly, you can deliver a couple of free hits while she recovers. This combo also has a variation where Romina would skip the 3rd part of the attack and will just do an enchanted weapon combo. She also has another basic move where she makes 3 quick sweepingmovements with her poleblade without enchantments. Finally, she can also do the Rolling Attack where she will curl up into a ball, and then roll around the arena. After she finishes rolling, she will then slam the ground and do a swing with her poleblade. This can be initially avoided by getting out of her way by either dodging or sprinting away. Lock the camera onto her to see where she is going. At the end of the roll, roll to the right to dodge both of her attacks. Then, you can retaliate with a heavy attack.\nAfter she finishes a combo, quickly counterattack to take advantage of the time where she will be briefly vulnerable. While powerful, her attacks have high recovery times, allowing you to dodge and immediately counter. When she begins a combo, dodge her attacks by rolling to the side or towards her to close the distance. Immediately after dodging, counter with heavy attacks to break her poise. Frequent usage of jumping and heavy attacks is recommended as it can stagger her, leaving her open to further attacks. \nOne of her special moves is the Double Spin 360 Combo, where she will lift up her human body as her weapon glows red, and will do 2 full spins while swinging her poleblade. After performing this move, she will pause to recover. This move can be dodged by rolling to the left, then dodging to the left again after a slight delay. This move usually causes Romina to end up at a far position from you, but she will take time to recover and you can do at least 1 light attack or a jump attack if you sprint up to her.\nPhase Two.\nAfter her health drops to 50%, she will immediately transition to her second phase; her attacks remain the same, but she now has the ability to conjure butterflies that will explode like bombs after a short period. She will be seen with pink butterflies circling around her, and after a brief period will cause a whirlwind in the small arena. Romina then follow up this move with more butterflies in the outer area of the whirlwind that will randomly explode throughout the area. To dodge this move, start sprinting away as her body lights up with pink hue, then, if you can outrun the AoE, you can just stand at the edge and you will not get hit. If you get caught, you can spam roll until you get out of the AoE. As the fight goes on, Romina will likely redo this move again, but with a shorter preparation. So you will need to react quicker to get out of the exploding butterflies.\nRomina at first seems like you must wait and punish with a typical melee build. She has a glaring weakness of being weak to animations that shift the players' hurt box down to low profile common moves she performs, such as her double glowing spear lunge and swipe move. A perfect example I found was using Dryleaf Arts, the Heavy attack naturally low profiles many of her spear-swiping moves. During my run I found it more beneficial to be aggressive rather than defensive, staying on her inner right side up front will negate a lot of her attacks with a dodge as needed. I ran frost to add the slow to her animations which was a plus but not needed in fighting her. The low profiling and staying on the offensive to break stance to heal as needed or deal big damage was enough."}

It guards a chest containing the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Needle\"&gt;Frozen Needle&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nEncountered in a very small room and without having to go through their signature lengthy spawning animation, this Revenant will turn aggressive quickly. \nIf it leaps towards roll forwards to the left of it and get in a hit before backing away, being ready to roll. Should it start to use more short-ranged melee slams, back away to provoke more leaps. Sometimes it will start to chain these slams into one long combo, either try to keep as far away as possible from this or get behind it if already close. \nOccasionally it will start to emit a green color around its head which signifies that it's about to spit out a thin cone of &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; sludge. Potentially dangerous if caught in the middle of an action such as drinking a &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Crimson%20Tears\"&gt;Flask of Crimson Tears&lt;/a&gt; but otherwise easily rolled or jumped away from. \nSometimes it will slip through a portal underground to appear behind its target and spit poison before starting its attack routine again. \nHealing incantations.\nOne easy way to kill it is to find an opening to cast a cheap healing spell such as &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; and then cast it again immediately while it's stunned. Any class can do this as even a &lt;a href=\"Prisoner\"&gt;Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; has enough &lt;a href=\"Faith\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Commoner%27s%20Garb\"&gt;Commoner's Garb&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Commoner%27s%20Simple%20Garb\"&gt;Commoner's Simple Garb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers%20Heirloom\"&gt;Two Fingers Heirloom&lt;/a&gt;. \nAnother way to do this is to summon the &lt;a href=\"Finger%20Maiden%20Therolina%20Puppet\"&gt;Finger Maiden Therolina Puppet&lt;/a&gt;, though she's more unreliable in casting her healing incantation. \n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

She led the &lt;a href=\"Godskin%20Apostle\"&gt;Godskin Apostles&lt;/a&gt;, who served Destined Death, until her defeat by &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%2C%20the%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;Maliketh, the Black Blade&lt;/a&gt;, the loyal &lt;a href=\"Shadowbound%20Beast\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, the Rune of Death was sealed away and the true power of the black flame was lost. The sealing away of the Rune of Death was the beginning of the Golden Order, and its power was harbored within &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%27s%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;Maliketh's black greatsword&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sealing of the Rune of Death involved removing the fated deaths of the &lt;a href=\"demigods\"&gt;demigods&lt;/a&gt; from the Elden Ring, granting them immortality. However, at a later point in history, during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh by &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni the Witch&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to create the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite. On that night, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Assassin\"&gt;Black Knife Assassins&lt;/a&gt; used the black knives to murder &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt;, the first death of a demigod in all history. However, due to Ranni the Witch carving the cursemark of Destined Death into her flesh at the same moment as Godwyn's death, he was unable to die a proper death and perished in soul alone, becoming the Prince of Death. Meanwhile, Ranni's flesh perished and her soul continued to live. \nGodwyn was buried below the capital at the Erdtree's roots. The fragment of the Rune of Death spread through the great underground roots of the Erdtree, sprouting in the form of &lt;a href=\"Deathroot\"&gt;Deathroot&lt;/a&gt;, and leading to the birth of &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter the Night of Black Knives, Maliketh bound his sword within his own flesh in order to ensure that none would ever steal Death again. In the guise of &lt;a href=\"Gurranq%2C%20Beast%20Clergyman\"&gt;Gurranq, the Beast Clergyman&lt;/a&gt;, he would attempt to reassemble the Rune of Death by consuming Deathroot. To this end, he employed the likes of &lt;a href=\"D%2C%20Hunter%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;D, Hunter of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, and later, &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;the Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve Deathroot for him from throughout the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rune of Death was later unbound by the Tarnished defeating Maliketh in &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Crumbling Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt;, in their attempt to burn the impenetrable thorns blocking the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, in order to become &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;."}

He had two siblings, &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ranni%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Ranni&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the first Elden Lord, &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%2C%20First%20Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, was robbed of grace and hounded from the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. Rykard's father, Radagon, left Rennala to become &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika's&lt;/a&gt; new consort and the second &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Rykard and his siblings were thus raised to demigods by their new step-mother, Marika. \nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, Rykard was a ruthless justiciar who commanded a company of inquisitors. His inquisitors persecuted and mercilessly tortured those considered heretics to the Golden Order, such as the &lt;a href=\"Albinaurics\"&gt;Albinaurics&lt;/a&gt;. He spent time in the volcanic Mt. Gelmir, where he discovered the ancient magma hexes of a forgotten serpent-worshiping religion native to the region, which he brought back into practical use as new sorceries. Rykard also travelled to a foreign land where he encountered a dancer by the name of &lt;a href=\"Tanith\"&gt;Tanith&lt;/a&gt;, who he would eventually take as his consort.\nRykard was also known for the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Virgin\"&gt;Iron Virgins&lt;/a&gt;, automatons which were capable of both battlefield carnage and abducting victims to transport them to the Volcano Manor.\nRykard's budding blasphemous inclinations led him to assist his sister, Ranni, in orchestrating the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives.&lt;/a&gt; On the night of the plot, Ranni rewarded Rykard with a &lt;a href=\"Blasphemous%20Claw\"&gt;slab of rock&lt;/a&gt; engraved with the traces of the Rune of Death, which would allow him to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%2C%20the%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;black beast of Destined Death&lt;/a&gt;, should the coming trespass one day transpire.\nThe Shattering.\nAt some point following the the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and her offspring acquired the Great Runes. The maddening taint of their newfound strength led to the Shattering, a war between Marika's demigod descendants, each seeking to become the new ruler of the Lands Between.\nRykard was indignant, and viewed the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; and the gods demanding that the demigods fight over miserly scraps of power to be debasing. He launched a blasphemous campaign against the Erdtree and the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Will\"&gt;Greater Will&lt;/a&gt;. When he turned to heresy, taking by force became the rule, the gods themselves being no different. Rykard's ambitions, though blasphemous, marked him a worthy sovereign, and drew many followers to his cause who admired his heroic aspirations. His rebels were known as the &lt;a href=\"Recusants\"&gt;Recusants&lt;/a&gt;. \nBased in the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir, his forces battled the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt; in what would become the most appalling battle of the Shattering, a wretched, unending war with no glory. Acts of cannibalism became a sickening reality across the battlefields, and some forces from both sides became afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Flame\"&gt;Frenzied Flame&lt;/a&gt; sickness.\nAt some point during the Shattering, Rykard fed himself, Great Rune and all, to the blasphemous serpent that dwelled inside Mt. Gelmir, an ancient traitor to the Erdtree, merging with the creature. In the final moments before being devoured, he briefly had a vision of the future wherein he witnessed a serpent devouring the world. \nFollowing this, his lofty ambition degraded into gluttonous depravity. He fed on his greatest champions, and in the bowels of the serpent, they became the lord's family. Disturbed by what had become of their master and by the costly battles waged in his name, Rykard's forces abandoned him. Some attempted to put him to rest by searching for a mighty weapon capable of killing their lord. Such a weapon was found in the &lt;a href=\"Serpent-Hunter\"&gt;Serpent-Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, an enchanted spear crafted to hunt an immortal serpent in the distant past. However, all attempts made to take his life failed. The spear would come to reside in Rykard's chambers, left by a former Recusant who hoped a worthy champion might one day appear to wield it and spare the once-noble Rykard from further dishonor.\nWhen Rykard gave himself to the elder serpent, the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Man-Serpent\"&gt;man-serpents&lt;/a&gt; followed, the deformed offspring of a repellent birthing ritual. One such man-serpent, known as &lt;a href=\"Rya\"&gt;Zorayas&lt;/a&gt;, would go on to be adopted by Tanith, and learn to assume an illusory human form in which she went by Rya. She was unaware of the origins of her birth, as Tanith concealed the truth of the Volcano Manor from her and insisted she was born of the grace of a king. It is implied that the woman known as Daedicar was one such woman subjected to the ritual, the biological mother of Zorayas and other man-serpents.\nAt some point before giving himself to the serpent, Rykard offered Tanith the &lt;a href=\"Tonic%20of%20Forgetfulness\"&gt;Tonic of Forgetfulness&lt;/a&gt; to purge her memories of him. However, she refused, claiming \"My Lord, there could be no greater distress than to forget you.\" Tanith was the only human known to stand with Rykard after he merged with the serpent of blasphemy; as in that moment, she was truly charmed by him. The &lt;a href=\"Tanith%27s%20Knight\"&gt;Crucible Knight&lt;/a&gt; bodyguard of Tanith may have also served the Volcano Manor before Rykard was devoured, and as such, would have been the second human known to remain loyal, but this remains unknown. Tanith would continue her lord's legacy by leading a new force of Recusants, recruiting unsuspecting &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; after their return to the Lands Between following the end of the Shattering. The worthiest of these Tarnished champions would be granted an audience with Rykard, which ended with them being devoured by the serpentine demigod to increase his power further. \nEventually, &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;a Tarnished champion&lt;/a&gt; managed to reach Rykard's chambers, and defeated the serpentine demigod to claim his Great Rune. Rykard took notice of this and awoke to confront the Tarnished, then pulled out a massive sword from the serpent's mouth, while boasting that they would join the Serpent King as family. After a hard battle, Rykard was ultimately slain by the Tarnished. Upon his death, he claimed \"A serpent never dies\", proven true when his initially vanished corpse began to regenerate. After Rykard is slain, Tanith suggested she planned to soon depart, having no reason to remain at Volcano Manor. However, afterwards she secretly journeyed to Rykard's chambers and attempted to eat his tremendous corpse, muttering her hopes that Rykard might live on within her, just as he had the serpent.\nBoss Fight.\nThe fight consists of two distinct phases, each with its own health bar. Phase 1 must be beaten each time to reach phase 2.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Serpent-Hunter\"&gt;Serpent-Hunter&lt;/a&gt; can be found sticking out of a pile of corpses near the entrance to the arena, and can be obtained without alerting the boss. This weapon makes the fight significantly easier, as it produces blades of light when swung that allow for long-distance attacks.\nDefeating this boss will terminate &lt;a href=\"Tanith%2C%20Volcano%20Manor%20Proprietress\"&gt;Tanith's&lt;/a&gt; questline, regardless of how far one has progressed it. Any Volcano Manor targets not yet unlocked will also be missed.\nPhase 1 - God-Devouring Serpent.\nThe God-Devouring Serpent is slow-moving, surrounded by a pool of magma. The magma makes it difficult to get close without taking damage, however the Serpent-Hunter allows for one to attack from a safer distance. It uses a combination of quick biting attacks and eruptions of magma, as well as a poison attack.\nPhase 2 - Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy.\nAfter reducing the Serpent's health to 0, a cutscene plays and phase 2 begins. Rykard, armed with a sword, moves around the arena similarly to the Serpent, however his moveset is almost entirely new.\nEnvironment.\nRykard's arena is a spacious cavern, dotted with piles of corpses and tall corpse pillars, which can be broken by Rykard's attacks. The size of the arena is helpful for avoiding Rykard's Rancor and Rancor Rain, as one can run around the room until the attack ends. \nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

When the &lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia&lt;/a&gt; unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Rot\"&gt;Scarlet Rot&lt;/a&gt; during her battle with &lt;a href=\"General%20Radahn\"&gt;General Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, she permanently blighted Caelid. Since that day, Gowry has dedicated himself to her and the Order of Rot he hopes she will usher in.\nGowry found &lt;a href=\"Millicent\"&gt;Millicent&lt;/a&gt; and her sisters in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Aeonia\"&gt;Swamp of Aeonia&lt;/a&gt; and raised them as his daughters. Seeing them as buds, he sent each of Millicent's sisters to the Haligtree in the hopes that they would bloom into scarlet valkyries. \nMillicent became consumed by the Scarlet Rot, and was housed in a church, where she was worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Pest\"&gt;Pests&lt;/a&gt;. Gowry sought the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, offering to reveal to them the secret of the magical town of &lt;a href=\"Sellia%2C%20Town%20of%20Sorcery\"&gt;Sellia&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their aid. Gowry bids the Tarnished to journey deep into the Swamp of Aeonia to retrieve a needle of unalloyed gold, which could stem the effects of the Scarlet Rot. After the Tarnished retrieves the needle, Gowry shares the secret of the town, and asks them for another favor; to find Millicent and give her the needle.\nGowry avoids Millicent when she comes to visit his shack, later telling the Tarnished that she has no need of him anymore, and must embark on her fated journey. The Tarnished may aid Millicent on her journey, even giving her a &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%27s%20Prosthesis\"&gt;prosthetic arm&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so will earn them Gowry's good will, who will offer to teach them a rot incantation, and reveal to them his allegiance to Malenia.\nAs Millicent travels to the &lt;a href=\"Haligtree\"&gt;Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;, where Malenia awaits, she draws ever closer to her \"sisters\", who made the same journey as her. Gowry bids the Tarnished to aid the sisters in murdering Millicent, believing that a betrayal by someone she trusts so dearly will cause her to blossom into a flower, which will be reborn as a scarlet valkyrie when Malenia ascends to godhood.\nShould the Tarnished kill Millicent, they will return to Gowry's shack to find him seemingly dead. Should they instead aid Millicent against her sisters, she will prevail, but will remove the golden needle, willfully allowing herself to succumb to the Scarlet Rot. The Tarnished may then find Gowry lamenting Millicent's decision, questioning whether she and Malenia detests him and the other children of rot so utterly. \nIf the Tarnished attempts to kill Gowry, his body will transform into that of a &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20of%20Rot\"&gt;Kindred of Rot&lt;/a&gt;. Upon returning to his shack, he will once again resume his human form, revealing that he can inhabit other pests to avoid death.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The player's resistance to this status ailment is determined by their &lt;a href=\"Stats%20and%20Attributes%23Resistance\"&gt;Immunity&lt;/a&gt; stat, which is increased by the Vigor stat.\nOverview.\nScarlet Rot is an old legend in the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous sickness that eats away life like a vicious plague. It corrupts men and beasts who come into contact with it, deforming their bodies and eating away their wits, driving them to madness and causing them to act like wild animals. Those afflicted with the Scarlet Rot such as &lt;a href=\"Millicent\"&gt;Millicent&lt;/a&gt; also suffer from nightmares due to the affliction. Areas afflicted with Scarlet Rot sprout fungal growths or flower buds. As such, Scarlet Rot is often fended off using fire. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Empyreans\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malenia%2C%20Blade%20of%20Miquella\"&gt;Malenia, Blade of Miquella&lt;/a&gt; harbored the affliction of Scarlet Rot within her body from birth, which has decayed her body and caused her to lose her limbs. Her will, pride, dignity, and sense of self, along with the help of her brother &lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella of the Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Unalloyed%20Gold%20Needle\"&gt;Unalloyed Gold Needle&lt;/a&gt; assisted with resisting the call of the Scarlet Rot. However, at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Aeonia\"&gt;Battle of Aeonia&lt;/a&gt;, the final battle of &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;the Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, she abandoned this pride to meet &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;Starscourge Radahn&lt;/a&gt;'s measure. This resulted in the blooming of the first flower of Aeonia causing both &lt;a href=\"Caelid\"&gt;Caelid&lt;/a&gt; and Radahn to become blighted by the Scarlet Rot. Upon Malenia's return to Miquella's &lt;a href=\"Haligtree\"&gt;Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;, it too was infected and malformed by the Scarlet Rot. The &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Aeonia\"&gt;Swamp of Aeonia&lt;/a&gt; spawned by the flower in Caelid gave rise to &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20of%20Rot\"&gt;Kindred of Rot&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"Pests.\" Some inorganic beings are capable of contracting and hosting the disease; a number of Crystalians, and their weapons, fester with Scarlet Rot.\nDespite the horrific effects of the sickness, some worship the Scarlet Rot as a god. The sickly &lt;a href=\"Maleigh%20Marais%2C%20Shaded%20Castle%20Castellan\"&gt;Maleigh Marais&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Castle\"&gt;Shaded Castle&lt;/a&gt; was a private believer, and considered Malenia his personal goddess. To those enraptured by the Scarlet Rot, the mushrooms that spawn from it growing on their bodies are holy vestments that root them to the earth. Long ago, great lords served the Scarlet Rot, perhaps with such large fungal bodies serving as their crowns. Ever since the Battle of Aeonia, &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Gowry\"&gt;Sage Gowry&lt;/a&gt; has dedicated himself to the resplendence of the Order of Rot, the cycle of decay and rebirth, desiring Malenia to bloom into a goddess, and her daughters to join her as scarlet valkyries. \nLong ago, Malenia's mentor, the &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Swordsman\"&gt;Blind Swordsman&lt;/a&gt;, sealed away an ancient god that was Rot itself using a flowing sword bestowed upon him by a fairy in legend. The divine essence of this &lt;a href=\"Outer%20God\"&gt;Outer God&lt;/a&gt; was sealed in the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20of%20Rot\"&gt;Lake of Rot&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ainsel%20River\"&gt;Ainsel River&lt;/a&gt; deep below &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe head confessor Crepus, an assassin of the Roundtable Hold serving the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, used bolts imbued with Scarlet Rot with his &lt;a href=\"Crepus%27s%20Black-Key%20Crossbow\"&gt;Black-Key Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;. \nMechanics.\nScarlet Rot accumulates gradually and comes into effect once the threshold is reached. The higher the player's Immunity stat, the longer it will take for Scarlet Rot to become effective. Immunity can be increased by increasing the Vigor stat. Once effective, the player will receive continual damage over time until the effect wears off.\nCuring and Mitigation.\n&lt;Tabber&gt;\n&lt;/Tabber&gt;\nUtilization.\n&lt;Tabber&gt;\nThere are currently no skills in the game that apply Scarlet Rot.\nThere are certain equipment that gives the player buffs when scarlet rot has been inflicted in the general vicinity, they do not discriminate between what has been poisoned in order to activate, it can be friend, foe and even oneself and generally lasts for around 20 seconds since the last rot infliction.\n&lt;/Tabber&gt;\nEnvironment.\nSwamps.\nRot swamps can be found in several locations throughout the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey generally comprise of bodies of filthy sludge that continuously build up Scarlet Rot as the player is standing in them. Rolling around in said sludge will also cover the player-character's body with the fluids, which will slowly yet consistently build up Scarlet Rot even if the player is no longer directly standing in the liquid itself or even tries to cure their Rot ailment with boluses. While these stains will gradually wear off over time, they can be removed immediately if it's raining, the player rolls around in clean water or uses &lt;a href=\"Soap\"&gt;Soap&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnemies.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnemies capable of inflicting Scarlet Rot include:\nNPCs capable of inflicting Scarlet Rot include:\nBosses capable of inflicting Scarlet Rot include:\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The twins were both born as accursed &lt;a href=\"Omen%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result were confined and shackled to the &lt;a href=\"Subterranean%20Shunning-Grounds\"&gt;Subterranean Shunning-Grounds&lt;/a&gt; below &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt;. \nUnlike his brother, Mohg would grow to embrace his Omen blood. Deep underground, Mohg made contact with an &lt;a href=\"Outer%20God\"&gt;Outer God&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Formless%20Mother\"&gt;Formless Mother&lt;/a&gt;. The Formless Mother ignited his accursed blood with fire, prompting him to develop powerful bloodflame magic. \nAfter Queen Marika shattered the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28object%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;, Mohg escaped confinement and claimed one of the shards of the Elden Ring. During this period, he began establishing his domain from &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Palace\"&gt;Mohgwyn Palace&lt;/a&gt; and recruiting followers, including his Sanguine Nobles and a band of Tarnished known as the Bloody Fingers. Among these followers was &lt;a href=\"White%20Mask%20Varr%C3%A9\"&gt;Varr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, a war surgeon who was able to successfully tame Mohg's accursed blood.\nThe specific timing of Mohg assuming the title of Lord of Blood and the exact sequence of his activities relative to the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; are not well-documented, making the precise timeline of these events unclear.\n&lt;a href=\"Miquella%20of%20the%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella the Unalloyed&lt;/a&gt; later embedded himself within his &lt;a href=\"Haligtree\"&gt;Haligtree&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to shed his affliction. In this vulnerable and unguarded state, Mohg seized the opportunity to abduct him from the tree. Miquella was an &lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt;, thus having the potential of ascending to godhood; Mohg intended to raise Miquella to full godhood so that he may rule at his side as consort and take the role of monarch. At some point during or after the abduction, Mohg was unknowingly enchanted by Miquella. The circumstances and timeline of this enchantment remain unclear.\nAfter abducting Miquella, Mohg hibernated with him within a cocoon and had his followers render offerings of blood, drenching its chamber in order to facilitate Miquella's awakening. But no matter how much of Miquella's bloody bedchamber Mohg tried to share, he would receive no response from the young empyrean.\nDuring this time, Mohg largely escaped the notice of the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;, who were searching for clues as to his whereabouts. Eventually, a &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; came to learn the location of Mohg's palace, where he had hidden alongside the stolen Miquella. When the Tarnished stumbles upon his chambers, Mohg emerges from a pool of blood, holds Miquella's hand and apologizes for leaving him, ready to confront their \"guests\". Despite unleashing the full power of his accursed blood, Mohg is unable to overcome the Tarnished, falling at their hands.\nFollowing Mohg's death, his corpse was stolen and transported to the Land of Shadow where Miquella utilized it for &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Rite%20Scroll\"&gt;an ancient ritual&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;Gate of Divinity&lt;/a&gt;, Miquella used Mohg's body as a vessel to revive the &lt;a href=\"Spirits\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;Radahn&lt;/a&gt;, his promised consort, to honor their solemn vow.\nBoss Fight.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMohg, the Omen=\nMohg, the Omen is encountered in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds, in a chapel beyond the Forsaken Depths Site of Grace. He must be defeated in order to access the Frenzied Flame Proscription.\n&lt;a href=\"Dung%20Eater\"&gt;Dung Eater&lt;/a&gt; is available as a summon for this fight, provided he has been released from his cell.\nMoveset.\nMohg's trident attacks have long delays, and cover a wide range. He uses a number of bloodflame-based attacks, which deal blood loss as well as fire damage. &lt;a href=\"Mohg%27s%20Shackle\"&gt;Mohg's Shackle&lt;/a&gt; can be used to stun him for a few seconds, allowing for some additional hits.\nEnvironment.\nThe arena is a fairly small chapel, with pillars on the side that can be used to gain distance. \nMohg, Lord of Blood is encountered at the end of Mohgwyn Palace. This fight plays much like the Mohg, the Omen fight, until the second phase when his moveset is expanded. He must be defeated to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20of%20the%20Erdtree\"&gt;Shadow of the Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; expansion, and enter the Land of Shadow.\nPhase 1.\nPhase 1 is largely the same as the fight against Mohg, the Omen. The key difference is the introduction of a countdown. When his health drops to certain levels, he will chrust his spear into the air and chant, causing a red ring to appear around the player. He will do this three times, and once his health reaches 50% he will perform Bloodboon Ritual, dealing huge amounts of damage for each ring and inflicting blood loss, while simultaneously recovering his own health. The Purifying Crystal Tear can be added to the Flask of Wondrous Physick to significantly decrease the amount of damage dealt by this move.\nPhase 2.\nAfter performing Bloodboon Ritual and recovering much of his health, Mohg will sprout wings and his spear will be imbued with bloodflame. The majority of his attacks will spray bloodflame on the ground, leaving patches of fire that last for a long time. He also now has abilities that utilise his wings to get out of range or to cover distance easily.\nEnvironment.\nThe arena is reasonably wide and open, with some gravestones on each side that act as obstacles. During phase 2, many of Mohg's attacks will cover large areas in fire.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "1165", "revid": "51929598", "url": "https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1165", "title": "Morgott, the Omen King", "text": "Morgott, the Omen King, is a boss in . He is a &lt;a href=\"Demigods\"&gt;Demigod&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;Shardbearer&lt;/a&gt; who is encountered in &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;. He is not an optional boss and must be defeated to unlock &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; and progress the story.\nOverview.\nEarly Life.\nMorgott was born of the Golden Lineage, the offspring of the first Elden Lord, &lt;a href=\"Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika&lt;/a&gt;, and was the twin brother of &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg&lt;/a&gt;. The twins were both born as accursed &lt;a href=\"Omen%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result were confined to the &lt;a href=\"Subterranean%20Shunning-Grounds\"&gt;Subterranean Shunning-Grounds&lt;/a&gt; below the &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;. Because they were born of royalty, their horns were not excised. Unlike his brother, Morgott would renounce his accursed blood and seal it away within a &lt;a href=\"Morgott%27s%20Cursed%20Sword\"&gt;warped blade of shimmering hue&lt;/a&gt;, which was in turn concealed within a wooden staff he carried. \nThe Shattering.\nWhen Queen Marika shattered the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;, Morgott claimed one of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;Great Runes&lt;/a&gt;, which proved that he was indeed the Lord of Leyndell. With Leyndell in disarray, Morgott claimed the city for himself and defended it and the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; against his fellow demigods. While he succeeded in securing Leyndell against outsiders, he found that the Erdtree would not admit him, or anyone else, to claim the title of Elden Lord. Despite the fact that he had been reviled as an accursed fiend by the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, Morgott took it upon himself to become the Erdtree's protector.\nHe assumed the name &lt;a href=\"Margit%20the%20Fell%20Omen\"&gt;Margit the Fell Omen&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, slaughtering champions who approached the Erdtree in the hopes of becoming Elden Lord. Under this pseudonym, he also lead the &lt;a href=\"Night%27s%20Cavalry\"&gt;Night's Cavalry&lt;/a&gt;, who assisted him in the killing of great warriors, knights and champions. Simultaneously, he ruled Leyndell as the Veiled Monarch. During this time, he was able to somehow both at &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle's&lt;/a&gt; outer gate and in the battle-torn fields outside of Leyndell, in the lattermost case disguising himself as a &lt;a href=\"commoner\"&gt;commoner&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter claiming enough &lt;a href=\"Great%20Runes\"&gt;shards&lt;/a&gt; of the Elden Ring, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; gains entrance to Leyndell and challenges Morgott at the Elden Throne. Denouncing them and all of his demigod siblings as willful traitors and pillagers emboldened by ambition, he attacks the Tarnished champion. As he begins to falter during the fight, he even unleashes his curse to aid him, although feeling unbearable shame in doing so. Upon his defeat, Morgott warns the Tarnished that the Erdtree would ward them off as it had done for him, and that none may claim the title of Elden Lord. Later, after setting fire to the Erdtree using the Giant's Forge and releasing the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt;, the same Tarnished encounters Godfrey in the throne room, tenderly holding Morgott's body as it fades away.\nBoss Fight.\n&lt;a href=\"Melina\"&gt;Melina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Eater\"&gt;Dung Eater&lt;/a&gt; are both available as summons for this fight. For Dung Eater to be available, the player must have released him from his cell in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds.\nPhase 1.\nMorgott is a highly aggressive and fast-moving enemy, chaining together attacks in rapid succession while leaving few openings. His curved sword inflicts blood loss on impact, while the holy armaments he summons deal holy damage. He has ranged attacks, such as his throwing knives and spear, and utilises jumps, cartwheels, and dashes to close or create distance.\nPhase 2.\nOnce his health drops to 50%, Morgott performs an area of effect attack in which his cursed blood erupts from the ground. His blade becomes infused with his cursed blood, and he gains a number of bloodflame-based attacks. He may also summon golden blades that rain down from the sky.\nEnvironment.\nThe arena is a wide, circular platform with no obstacles, aside from the throne which will break if hit. \nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"Margit%20the%20Fell%20Omen\"&gt;Margit the Fell Omen&lt;/a&gt;"}

Leda was guided by Miquella to the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; alongside her compatriots, all of whom were under the influence of a powerful charm which compelled them to follow the Empyrean. While in the Realm of Shadow, Leda followed the trail of &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Cross\"&gt;crosses&lt;/a&gt; left by Miquella, discovering in the process that he sought the Gate of Divinity, which was sealed away by a tree. \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;The Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; encounters Leda in &lt;a href=\"Mohgwyn%20Palace\"&gt;Mohgwyn Palace&lt;/a&gt;, where she urges them to touch the withered arm in Miquella's cocoon to enter the Realm of Shadow. Within the Land of Shadow, the Tarnished meets Leda and her various compatriots on their search for Miquella, seeking out the crosses to ascertain his route. However, the charm inflicted upon the compatriots is broken when Miquella's Great Rune is shattered. Leda's devotion to Miquella is unshaken, but she begins to suspect her compatriots of disloyalty. Leda sets about ferreting out those she believes undeserving of a place at Miquella's side, with her potential targets being the &lt;a href=\"Hornsent%20%28character%29\"&gt;Hornsent&lt;/a&gt; and Sir &lt;a href=\"Ansbach\"&gt;Ansbach&lt;/a&gt;.

Leda deduces that the Tarnished was never guided by Miquella, and concludes that they were instead following the guidance of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. Viewing the Tarnished as a threat to Miquella's ascension, she challenges them.

In her infancy, Nepheli lived through murder and pillage unchecked At some point, she lost the guidance of grace, and was taken in by &lt;a href=\"Gideon%20Ofnir\"&gt;Gideon Ofnir&lt;/a&gt;, who became her foster father. Gideon promised Nepheli that if he became Elden Lord he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated again, earning her loyalty and aid in his pursuit of the title of Elden Lord.\nAt the behest of Gideon, Nepheli infiltrates &lt;a href=\"Stormveil%20Castle\"&gt;Stormveil Castle&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the Grafted&lt;/a&gt;. Here, she encounters a &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, who aids her in defeating the decrepit demigod. With Godrick slain, she returns to &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where she awards them with an &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20Charm\"&gt;Arsenal Charm&lt;/a&gt; she found in Stormveil, and encourages them to speak to her foster father.\nTravelling to &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, Nepheli comes upon the &lt;a href=\"Village%20of%20the%20Albinaurics\"&gt;Village of the Albinaurics&lt;/a&gt;, where she witnesses the slaughter of the Albinauric inhabitants at the hands of her father's men. Reminded of the brutality she witnessed as a child, Nepheli vows to deliver justice to the oppressors, assisting the Tarnished in defeating the &lt;a href=\"Omenkiller\"&gt;Omenkiller&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the slaughter.\nFor giving into her emotions and abandoning the mission, Nepheli is cast aside by Gideon. Without her estranged father's guidance, she becomes crestfallen, resigning to the lower levels of Roundtable Hold where she questions the faith she had in Gideon. \nThe Tarnished obtains the ashes of &lt;a href=\"The%20Stormhawk%20King\"&gt;The Stormhawk King&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Anticipation\"&gt;Chapel of Anticipation&lt;/a&gt;, which they may choose to give to Nepheli. She can smell the ancient storm within the ash, and is reminded of her first hawk. Despite her inability to sense spirits within ash, she gladly receives them.\nAfter claiming the Stormhawk King's ashes, Nepheli encounters &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Haight\"&gt;Kenneth Haight&lt;/a&gt;, who recognises her as a worthy heir of &lt;a href=\"Limgrave\"&gt;Limgrave&lt;/a&gt;. Nepheli accepts the role, having been reminded by Limgrave of her own home. As the new lord of Limgrave, Nepheli pledges to aid the Tarnished should they become Elden Lord, pledging to call upon the storm to drive away the foulness that has settled on the winds.\nQuestline Progression.\nNOTE: as &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20Gostoc\"&gt;Gatekeeper Gostoc&lt;/a&gt;'s questline is intertwined with Nepheli's, hers will fail is he's killed and if aggroed you'll have to cleanse your sin at the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Church of Vows&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Dew\"&gt;Celestial Dew&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEN=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It involves the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;. Although the conspirators behind it remained unknown to the wider world, it was in fact orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Princess%20Ranni\"&gt;Lunar Princess Ranni&lt;/a&gt; as she was looking for a way to free herself from the control of the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Fingers\"&gt;Two Fingers&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nRanni, who sought to change her fate of being a pawn to the Two Fingers, stole a piece of the rune of death from &lt;a href=\"Maliketh\"&gt;Maliketh&lt;/a&gt;, who served as the guardian of the rune. With the stolen fragment, Ranni proceeded to imbue the weapons of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Assassin\"&gt;Numen Assassins&lt;/a&gt;, all of them being women with ties to Marika, with the powers of Destined Death. Wishing to shed her &lt;a href=\"Empyrean\"&gt;Empyrean&lt;/a&gt; body but preserve her spirit, she knew that the spirit of someone else has to die as well. Whether or not Ranni knew that Godwyn the Golden would be targeted is unclear. \nOn the same night, Ranni awarded her brother, &lt;a href=\"Praetor%20Rykard\"&gt;Praetor Rykard&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Blasphemous%20Claw\"&gt;Blasphemous Claw&lt;/a&gt;, a rock engraved with traces of the Rune of Death, in the hopes that Rykard would be able to challenge Maliketh as a last resort.\nAssassination.\nOn the night of the plot, the assassins arrived in &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt;, the Royal Capital, and slew Godwyn the Golden, carving the &lt;a href=\"Cursemark%20of%20Death\"&gt;Cursemark of Death&lt;/a&gt; into his flesh. The Cursemark was supposed to form a circle; however, as Ranni perished in the same moment as Godwyn, the mark was split into two half-wheels. Godwyn's soul alone perished, while Ranni became the first Demigod to die in the flesh.\nImmediately following the assassination, the Black Knives fled the capital. &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Tiche\"&gt;Tiche&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of the &lt;a href=\"Alecto%2C%20Black%20Knife%20Ringleader\"&gt;Black Knife Ringleader Alecto&lt;/a&gt;, died protecting her mother during the escape.\nAftermath.\nGodwyn's body was interred in the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;'s roots, where he mutated and deformed into the being that would become known as the Prince of Death. Later, the traces of the Rune of Death used to slay him spread through the network of roots that span the Lands Between, taking the form of &lt;a href=\"Deathroot\"&gt;Deathroot&lt;/a&gt;, the source of &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanni, whose Empyrean body perished upon the carving of the Cursemark, transferred her soul into a doll modelled after her &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Witch\"&gt;mentor&lt;/a&gt;. She maintained a low profile following the Night of Black Knives, and it is unknown whether her death was widely known of.\nFollowing the Night of Black Knives, the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt; was shattered by Queen Marika. As a result, the Great War known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Shattering\"&gt;The Shattering&lt;/a&gt; ensued. \nin the aftermath of the Shattering, a Tarnished known as &lt;a href=\"Fia\"&gt;Fia, the Deathbed Companion&lt;/a&gt;, came into contact with the soulless body of Godwyn. Fia sought the two half-wheels, wishing to reunite them and produce &lt;a href=\"Mending%20Rune%20of%20the%20Death-Prince\"&gt;a Mending Rune&lt;/a&gt; which could introduce Those Who Live in Death to the Elden Ring. During this time, another Tarnished named Rogier began to study the Night of Black Knives, bringing him into contact with Fia."}

Some can be seen playing a somber melody on stringed instruments. The wares they sell are frequently influenced by or representative of their current locations.

He had several disciples in a group called the White Reeds, combatants who seek proper deaths won honorably through hard-fought combat. The head disciples of Okina were called the &lt;a href=\"Inaba%2C%20Disciple%20of%20Okina\"&gt;Inaba&lt;/a&gt; (Japanese name for the leaves of the rice plant).\nAs time passed, the more Okina sharpened his mind, the more the absurdities of the world came into stark relief.

This eventually led him to &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, and, when Mohg first felt Okina's sword, and madness, upon his flesh, he had a proposal: to offer Okina the life of a demon, whose thirst would never go unsated.\nBefore long, Okina became a demon of a swordsman, known as the only to wield an &lt;a href=\"Wakizashi\"&gt;auxiliary weapon&lt;/a&gt; in his left hand while using a &lt;a href=\"Rivers%20of%20Blood\"&gt;full-sized cursed katana&lt;/a&gt; in his right.\nThe Inaba traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit of the master who abandoned them and, desiring nothing more than to die by the sword, also sought proper deaths. And so, all that was known of them was that their armor and spirit were left lingering in the &lt;a href=\"Spiritcaller%20Cave\"&gt;Spiritcaller Cave&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nHis summon sign is found within &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;Starscourge Radahn&lt;/a&gt;'s arena.\nInvades at the entrance."}

Certain Omen, such as &lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott, the Omen King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Mohg, Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt; also have tails and feathered wings. These traits are reminiscent of the vestiges of the Crucible, considered a signifier of the divine in ancient times, but reviled as an impurity as civilization advanced. \nOmen babies have all their horns excised, which causes most to perish; they are memorialized with small fetish dolls in the likeness of an infant Omen with their horns cut off. Meanwhile, Omen born to royalty keep their horns, but are kept underground, unbeknownst to anyone, where they are bound by shackles for eternity. Fetish dolls depicting the Omen infant with their horns left intact are crafted in secret to memorialize these Omen. &lt;a href=\"Wraiths\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt; erupt from the bodies of Omen whose horns remain intact, and can also be expelled via the breath, or used to enwreathe their weapons. \nOmen are seen as impure due to their cursed blood. For this reason they are hunted by &lt;a href=\"Omenkiller\"&gt;Omenkillers&lt;/a&gt;, the first of which was the perfumer &lt;a href=\"Omenkiller%20Rollo\"&gt;Rollo&lt;/a&gt;, who wield giant cleavers comprised of amputated Omen horns that cause blood loss, and wear masks imitating the evil spirits that haunt the Omen in their nightmares. The perfumer &lt;a href=\"Perfumer%20Tricia\"&gt;Tricia&lt;/a&gt; and her associates dedicated their efforts to treating Omen, among others seen as impure. When her efforts failed, she instead became their companion when they died, ensuring they could pass peacefully. \nDespite being reviled, excised Omen are sometimes used as soldiers. They are awarded cleavers of colossal size, taking advantage of the Omen's brute strength. However, the blades are etched with a remnant of a deteriorative malediction to ensure that the blade can be taken away. They occasionally can be found wearing black cloaks, and certain Omen among these cloaked variants have taken to worshiping the &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Prince of Death&lt;/a&gt;."}

The double-jump of &lt;a href=\"Torrent\"&gt;Torrent&lt;/a&gt; can easily get you onto the lower cabin, and from there another double-jump can get you onto the roof of the taller one. From there, the Omenkiller will not be able to reach you with any of his attacks. He does often get rather close to the wall of the cabin which can be difficult for you to hit, and at longer range (usually after a fire-breath when he backs up a bit) he tends to dodge attacks, but carefully timing your shots should slowly but surely allow you to kill this enemy solo at little risk.\nPerfumer's Grotto=\nBackground.\nAn Omenkiller fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Miranda%20the%20Blighted%20Bloom\"&gt;Miranda the Blighted Bloom&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Perfumer%27s%20Grotto\"&gt;Perfumer's Grotto&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Altus%20Plateau\"&gt;Altus Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

This option absent on the PC version of .\n\"Launch Settings\".\nThis setting controls whether the game automatically attempts to log-on to the official Online servers after crossing the \"PRESS ANY BUTTON\" prompt on the title screen. \nThis option is automatically set to \"Play Online\" at the start of a new profile, meaning players who have a functioning connection but are adamant to play specifically in Offline mode need to manually set it to \"Play Offline\" then either make a character first then quit to return to the title screen or turn the game off then boot it back up again. Starting the game in Offline mode adds a \"LOG IN\" prompt amongst the \"CONTINUE\", \"LOAD GAME\" and \"NEW GAME\" options on the main menu.\n\"Data User Agreement\".\nDetails your consent to the game's &lt;a href=\"Data%20User%20Agreement\"&gt;Data User Agreement&lt;/a&gt;.\nPasswords.\nLocated in it's own designated Multiplayer menu. Passwords are used to isolate potential connections and make it easier for specific players to connect with each other.\n\"Multiplayer Password\".\nHosts who have inserted a multiplayer password may only be able to see the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Signs\"&gt;Summon Signs&lt;/a&gt; of players who have the same password and likewise the Summon Signs of a Guest with a password can only be seen by Hosts carrying the same password. \nThis option also completely removes Player-Level and Weapon-Upgrade-based matchmaking, allowing vastly under-leveled or over-leveled guests to join a host's world. Over-leveled guests will have their stats reduced in an attempt of preserving game-balance, though the effectiveness of this down-scaling varies greatly based on the Host's level compared to the guest and what kind of build the guest is using. Under-leveled guests do not get their stats scaled upwards.\n\"Group Password\".\nPlayers can have a total of five active group passwords at a time. They do not influence the matchmaking system in any way and only serve as a means of letting players know that a Player Phantom, Message, Bloodstain or Summon Sign came from someone carrying the same Group Password. Players accomplishing a significant feat of progression in their own game will also let everyone carrying the same group passwords as them know of this feat while at the same time distributing a rune-boosting buff to those same players.\nPassive Features.\nOnline has a number of passive features that are present at all times and require no direct input from the player to appear. These features include:\n\"Player Phantoms\".\nSpectral afterimages of other players exploring and interacting with the world in their own game. The moments captured are mere recent short recordings of their journey and are not quite real-time. \nOutside of being a reminder than in some way one is never truly alone in the adventure, these momentary glimpses into the lives of other players may directly assist the person witnessing them in revealing potential secrets such as a seeing a phantom appear just as it walks through an &lt;a href=\"Illusory%20Wall\"&gt;Illusory Wall&lt;/a&gt; that the witness wasn't initially aware of themselves.\n\"Messages\".\nPlayers may leave &lt;a href=\"Messages\"&gt;messages&lt;/a&gt; comprised of differing combinations of preset words and phrases to either assist, deceive or lighten the mood of any other player who may come across them and read them. \nShould a message leave a strong enough impression for the reader to rate them Good or Poor, either option results in the writer (should they be playing at the moment of rating) receiving a decent chunk of their HP healed.\n\"Bloodstains\".\nBloodstains appear at the location of a player's death. They are five second recordings of their last moments before being forcibly sent back to a &lt;a href=\"Sites%20of%20Grace\"&gt;Sites of Grace&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Shared Accomplishments\".\nShould someone with a group password either defeat a &lt;a href=\"Shardbearers\"&gt;Shardbearer&lt;/a&gt; or reach the &lt;a href=\"Credits\"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt; screen in their playthrough, every other player who shares the same group password as them will receive a buff that increases the amount of &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt; received from fallen enemies by 5% for five minutes.\nMatchmaking.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFor the sake of balance the game will primarily search for guests that are within a certain radius of the Host's &lt;a href=\"Level\"&gt;character level&lt;/a&gt; as well as and the highest upgraded weapon the players has ever obtained. It does not matter if said weapon has been stored or even discarded, even if the player has completely removed access to said upgraded weapon the game will still count that weapon's level to their matchmaking radius.\nWeapon Upgrade Level.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nFlasks.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFlask Count.\nFor the sake of balancing, multiplayer alters how many flasks charges different players have and how these charges are replenished based on what role said player is currently in.\nThe Hosts of Fingers will keep their maximum flask count and guests will have their flasks charges cut by half of what it usually is in their own world. If a guest's flask-count is an odd number in their own world then it will be rounded down to an even number when visiting another host's world, so if a guest wants to maximize their flask-count they should try to allot both of their flasks into an even number whenever possible.\nReplenishing Flasks.\nAllies can have their flasks replenished from &lt;a href=\"About%20Vanquishing%20Enemy%20Groups\"&gt;vanquishing enemy groups&lt;/a&gt;, killing &lt;a href=\"Scarab%23Crimson_Tear_Scarab\"&gt;Crimson Tear Scarabs&lt;/a&gt; and defeating &lt;a href=\"Invader\"&gt;Invaders&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile Adversaries will have their flasks replenished from the death of any other player, whether it be a &lt;a href=\"Furled%20Finger\"&gt;Furled Finger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; or even a fellow &lt;a href=\"Invader\"&gt;Invader&lt;/a&gt;. The death of the &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Fingers\"&gt;Host of Fingers&lt;/a&gt; does not replenish flasks however as it will end the session anyway.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

While able to engage in melee, they prefer to attack from a distance with bubbles of holy energy.\nOverview.\nOracle Envoys are bloodless creatures, said to appear, playing their pipes, to herald the arrival of a new god or age. They hide their face behind a soft bundle of densely wrapped cloth. No one knows what the cloth hides, but some claim to hear faint whimpering from inside.\nAs a whole, Oracles are very slow, easy to avoid by running past them, and relatively passive creatures as they focus on their tasks. Their attacks are slow and telegraphed, particularly in melee, but can hit for appreciable damage; the two smaller ones are easy to stagger and keep stunlocked using heavier melee weapons. However, they become considerably more of a threat at a distance, particularly if you cannot reach them. Adding to this, once they become hostile, they can summon bubbles at your position even if you're on the other side of a wall or in a different room.\nThe regular oracles are of little threat individually, but almost aways appear in groups.\nThe large oracles can spawn additional bubbles and attack more regularly; they can also hover off the ground and out of reach for a limited time while they blow bubbles. This version also has surprising reach and dexterity with its very long weapon.\nThe giant Oracle Envoy is the least mobile of all, using its giant horn to cast a repeated barrage of large bubbles from afar or slamming it into anyone who comes too close. It can also jump in the air and do a repeated ground slam. This variant is only found in Miquella's Haligtree."}

Originally designed with the intent of capturing and transposing victims for interrogation, they can be found strewn around the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. Though the majority have lost their powers of transposition, they will still attempt to fulfill their original directive if approached.\nTo aid in their task, Abductor Virgins have been outfitted with heavy weaponry on both arms that alter how they approach each target. When a Virgin has approached a target, they will open their chest cavity and attempt to pull them in with &lt;a href=\"serpents\"&gt;serpentine&lt;/a&gt; tendrils. Given the loss of their transposition ability, the target will be constricted instead. If they survive this, they will be spat back out. \nThey are weak to &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage and all damage taken is greatly increased if attacked when their chest cavity is opened during a charge or attempted grab. \n&lt;tabber&gt;\nWheel=\nVariant Description.\nA model with arms that end in great iron wheels, based on the device used by &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Ghiza\"&gt;Inquisitor Ghiza&lt;/a&gt;. One such model lies at the bottom of the big waterwheel of Raya Lucaria, its transpostitional powers still fully intact.\nThese variants will often use their wheels by pressing them down on the ground. When placing both wheels at their sides, they will either perform a small spin in place, or a larger spin where they gradually spiral outwards. When there is distance, the Virgin will place both wheels in front and rapidly accelerate forward. Sometimes they will stop before reaching the target and open their chest cavity in an attempt to grab them.\nMoveset.\nCan include a separate table for a specific instance of this variant's moveset.\nVariant Description.\nA model with arms that end in great scythes on chains that it can extend and retract at will. Though they only have one spin attack, they will often use it to get some distance between them and their target. At the very end, they may throw their scythes at the target. This is something that they will do whenever there is sufficient distance. It is important to be careful after dodging the initial throw, as the scythe may hit when it is being retracted. This is especially true when near the Virgin, as the scythe will spin back around behind it upon return.\nIt's important to note that the Scythe can sometimes go through walls.\nVariant Description.\nA unique model of the Iron Virgin that has both the scythe and wheel devices installed. They are capable of using a mixed move-set, often consisting of using the wheel to spin and close distance and the scythe to attack from far away.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nDrops.\nThis enemy has no drops.\nBosses.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSubterranean Inquisition Chamber=\nBackground.\nA pair of Iron Virgins, one wielding the wheel implements and the other wielding the scythe implements. The latter will make itself known immediately at the start of the fight. Whereas the former will charge at the player from the left side of the cave.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

She became the Academy's master and established the house of &lt;a href=\"Carian%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Caria&lt;/a&gt; as royalty.

Those at the Academy then realised that Rennala was no champion, and she was confined to the great library. She still clutches the amber egg given to her by Radagon, which contains the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Rune%20of%20the%20Unborn\"&gt;Great Rune of the Unborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Academy offers multiple fields of study, known as &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Raya%20Lucaria%20Conspectuses\"&gt;Conspectuses&lt;/a&gt;. Scholars of note are permitted to don Glintstone Crowns modelled after notable sorcerers in their chosen fields of study. &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Sorcerer%20Azur\"&gt;Azur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Sorcerer%20Lusat\"&gt;Lusat&lt;/a&gt;, regarded as founding glintstone sorcerers, founded the Karolos and Olivinus Conspectuses, respectively. Most of the sorcerers found within wear Glintstone Crowns that denote their area of study, and hint at the types of sorceries they may wield.\nThe Academy declared that it would not take part in &lt;a href=\"The%20Shattering\"&gt;The Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, and repelling seals were cast upon its doors, blocking outside access to anyone not in possession of a &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Glintstone%20Key\"&gt;Academy Glintstone Key&lt;/a&gt;.

Thus, each conspectus is associated with its own glintstone crown, as well as its own set of glintstone sorceries.\nKarolos Conspectus.\nThe oldest and most venerable of the Academy's conspectuses, the Karolos Conspectus was founded by &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Sorcerer%20Azur\"&gt;Azur&lt;/a&gt;, the primeval sorcerer, and aspires to follow in his footsteps by pursuing the mysteries of comets. Scholars who study the Karolos Conspectus don &lt;a href=\"Karolos%20Glintstone%20Crown\"&gt;Karolos Glintstone Crowns&lt;/a&gt; and utilise comet-based sorceries.\nOlivinus Conspectus.\nA conspectus begat by the primeval sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Sorcerer%20Lusat\"&gt;Lusat&lt;/a&gt;, with a focus on the study of meteors.

Those who study the Twinsage Conspectus wear &lt;a href=\"Twinsage%20Glintstone%20Crown\"&gt;Twinsage Glintstone Crowns&lt;/a&gt; depicting dual heads, and are permitted to study and excel at all manner of sorceries.\nSpells:\nLazuli Conspectus.\nA heterodox conspectus that views the moon as equal to the stars. Scholars of the Lazuli Conspectus study Carian sorceries, and fight using wooden &lt;a href=\"Lazuli%20Glintstone%20Sword\"&gt;Lazuli Glintstone Swords&lt;/a&gt; inlaid with glintstone. They don &lt;a href=\"Lazuli%20Glintstone%20Crown\"&gt;Lazuli Glintstone Crowns&lt;/a&gt; and wear pale &lt;a href=\"Lazuli%20Robe\"&gt;Lazuli Robes&lt;/a&gt; in the hue of the full moon, signifying their heresy.\nSpells:\nHaima Conspectus.\nThe conspectus of Haima, the adjudicator of the Academy. Scholars of the Haima Conspectus, known as battlemages, seek to quell conflict through the use of their sorceries of cannon fire and gavel, as well as through the use of their &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Club\"&gt;Stone Clubs&lt;/a&gt; made from hard glintstone, which allow them to feel the impact of their blows. During times of war, when the Academy seals its gates, only Haima's scholars dare to venture outside. Scholars of the Haima Conspectus wear &lt;a href=\"Haima%20Glintstone%20Crown\"&gt;Haima Glintstone Crowns&lt;/a&gt;.\nHierodas Conspectus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hierodas%20Glintstone%20Crown\"&gt;Hierodas Glintstone Crown&lt;/a&gt; was granted to scholars who engaged in nomadic study away from the Academy. A notable follower of this conspectus is &lt;a href=\"Errant%20Sorcerer%20Wilhelm\"&gt;Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, a silent seeker of sorcery who made contact with the primeval current, and was led by guidance into conflict with his friend &lt;a href=\"Vargram%20the%20Raging%20Wolf\"&gt;Vargram the Raging Wolf&lt;/a&gt;. Scholars of the Hierodas Conspectus typically wield Night Sorceries, using the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Loss\"&gt;Staff of Loss&lt;/a&gt; as a catalyst.\nSpells:"}

This process can be seen most clearly in the elderly, bearded Albinaurics that inhabit the &lt;a href=\"Village%20of%20the%20Albinaurics\"&gt;Village of the Albinaurics&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlbinaurics are viewed as impure, and are persecuted by the &lt;a href=\"Cuckoo%20Knight\"&gt;Knights of the Cuckoo&lt;/a&gt; for their defiled blood. They seek salvation in &lt;a href=\"Miquella%27s%20Haligtree\"&gt;Miquella's Haligtree&lt;/a&gt;, which they believe to be their chosen land. Aged Albinaurics carry &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Sickle\"&gt;Ivory Sickles&lt;/a&gt; in dedication to the Haligtree, despite having never entered its presence.\nCharacteristics.\nAll first-generation Albinaurics are disabled and have lost the use of their legs. The males appear as withered old men with long beards whose legs are vanishing into shadow. The female archers, who wear blue silver mail born from the same mother as themselves, also lack the functionality of their legs, which they compensate for by riding wolfback. Nonetheless, they were feared as deadly sharpshooters.\nSecond-generation Albinaurics differ visually from the more humanoid first generation specimens, having heads that resemble those of frogs and protruding bellies. They wield weaponry modelled after the ripples that are said to be the origin of their species, as well as wooden clubs shaped like the crescent moon.\nLocations.\nAlbinaruics are encountered throughout the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20Between\"&gt;Lands Between&lt;/a&gt;. A majority may be found in central &lt;a href=\"Liurnia\"&gt;Liurnia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlbinaurics are also found in the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;."}

On his way to the festival, he crosses paths with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tarnished%20%28Protagonist%29\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; multiple times, often requiring their assistance to get out of unfortunate situations such as being stuck in potholes.\nAlexander finally gets the chance to participate in the Radahn Festival, a brawl between several champions and &lt;a href=\"Starscourge%20Radahn\"&gt;Starscourge Radahn&lt;/a&gt;. Alexander survives the ordeal, however he suffers damage to his body and is forced to hide for the remainder of the battle. Undeterred, he replenishes himself with the bodies of mighty warriors littering the battlefield, vowing to grow even stronger.\nNext, Alexander travels to &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt.

Finding the lava to be lukewarm and insufficient to strengthen his vessel, he sets his sights upon the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, seeking out the flame of ruin.\nAlexander travels to the mountaintops, where he witnesses the Tarnished's fight with the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giant\"&gt;Fire Giant&lt;/a&gt;.

It is a region of great significance, for it is here that the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; can be found, as well as &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt;, the royal capital of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika&lt;/a&gt;. Altus borders &lt;a href=\"Liurnia%20of%20the%20Lakes\"&gt;Liurnia of the Lakes&lt;/a&gt; to the south, and the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Lands\"&gt;Forbidden Lands&lt;/a&gt; which lead to the &lt;a href=\"Mountaintops%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Mountaintops of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; to the east. Due to its high elevation, Altus is connected to its neighbouring regions primarily through two lifts; the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Lift%20of%20Dectus\"&gt;Grand Lift of Dectus&lt;/a&gt; to the south and the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Lift%20of%20Rold\"&gt;Grand Lift of Rold&lt;/a&gt; to the east. There is another, more dangerous path to Liurnia that goes through the mountains separating the two regions.\nAltus is a lush and verdant land, once over-flowing with the bounty of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; itself. Most of the vegetation that grows in Altus is tinged with the gold of the Erdtree, and flowers that grow on the plateau are prized reagents by Perfumers. The people of the plateau believed that those born at the foot of the Erdtree, like themselves, were blessed. While still beautiful, the land is marred by scars from the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, left over from the many battles waged here. The land is dotted by ruined battlefields and soldier's camps. \nThe western parts of Altus are mountainous and dominated by the volcanic &lt;a href=\"Mt.%20Gelmir\"&gt;Mt. Gelmir&lt;/a&gt;. At the top of the mountain lies the &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Manor\"&gt;Volcano Manor&lt;/a&gt;, home to the demigod &lt;a href=\"Praetor%20Rykard\"&gt;Praetor Rykard&lt;/a&gt;. At the foot of the mountain lies bubbling geysers as well as a village of Demihumans. \nIn the north of Altus, through a deep canyon, lies the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Castle\"&gt;Shaded Castle&lt;/a&gt;, ancient manor of the Marais family who served as both executioners and castellans of the Shaded Castle for generations. The castle lies in disrepair, haunted by Wraith-Callers and Revenants, and with most of its courtyard sinking into a poison swamp.\nThe eastern parts of Altus are dominated by &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Marika's royal capital, built at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;. Two primary paths lead into the capital grounds; one from the southwest and one from the northwest. The southwestern path is the main road, a well-maintained and well-guarded highway gloriously decorated with statues of Queen Marika's soldiers. The capital grounds are defended by double ramparts. Within the outer wall, to the northeast, lies a Minor Erdtree. Just outside the outer wall, on an outcropping north of the southwestern highway, lies the &lt;a href=\"Giant-Conquering%20Hero%27s%20Grave\"&gt;Giant-Conquering Hero's Grave&lt;/a&gt;, final resting place of a hero who fought against the Giants.\nThe inner wall of the capital is surrounded by a moat, which appears to have mostly dried out, as its waters are now shallow. Within the inner walls, the Royal Capital is bounded by a lake, which serves as yet another layer of protection. The capital is ruled by the Demigod &lt;a href=\"Morgott%2C%20the%20Omen%20King\"&gt;Morgott&lt;/a&gt;, known also as the Veiled Monarch. \nSites of Grace.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/Tabber&gt;"}

They exist beyond the purview of the &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt;, and follow the principle that life sprouts from death as it does from birth. This process is reflected by their horns, which sprout new growths even after the ancestor's death. Shamans of the &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Follower\"&gt;Ancestral Follower&lt;/a&gt;s don headdresses fashioned from horns with buds, mirroring the appearance of the ancestor spirits.\nAncestor Spirits appear emaciated, with exposed ribs, matted fur, and cavities in their chests.

It will also sometimes collapse and fade away, and then emerge from one of the other animals in the arena.

They wielded red lightning as a weapon, and had scales made of sharp, pointed gravel stones. They were ruled over by &lt;a href=\"Dragonlord%20Placidusax\"&gt;Dragonlord Placidusax&lt;/a&gt;, said to have been &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Lord\"&gt;Elden Lord&lt;/a&gt; in the time before the Erdtree, from the royal city of &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Farum%20Azula\"&gt;Farum Azula&lt;/a&gt;, and it is said that they would protect their lord as a wall of living rock. \nAncient Dragons have light grey bodies resembling stone. They possess four legs, as well as four wings inlayed with gold, distinguishing them from their lesser descendants. They have short, flat muzzles, orange-yellow eyes, and wispy grey hairs along their backs. They can breathe fire like many of their descendants, however they also possess the ability to wield red lightning, which often manifests in the form of spears and glaives. \nDuring the reign of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;, the Ancient Dragon Gransax wrought havoc on &lt;a href=\"Leyndell%2C%20Royal%20Capital\"&gt;Leyndell, Royal Capital&lt;/a&gt;, the only time in recorded history that Leyndell's walls have fallen. This marked the dawn of the war against the Dragons, during which the Tree Sentinels clad themselves in armour resembling the bodies of the Dragons in order to protect the Erdtree. During this conflict &lt;a href=\"Godwyn%20the%20Golden\"&gt;Godwyn the Golden&lt;/a&gt; fought to the last against the Ancient Dragon &lt;a href=\"Lichdragon%20Fortissax\"&gt;Fortissax&lt;/a&gt;. Godwyn defeated Fortissax, however he befriended his fallen foe, ending the conflict and giving rise to the capital's Ancient Dragon Cult. Worship of the Ancient Dragons does not conflict with faith in the Erdtree, as the Dragons' lightning is imbued with gold, and as such the Cult was permitted within Leyndell. \nMoveset.\nCan include a separate table for a specific instance of this variant's moveset.\nBosses.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nAncient Dragon Lansseax=\nBackground.\nLansseax, the sister of Fortissax, is said to have taken the form of a human priestess in order to commune with the knights of the Ancient Dragon Cult. Her most beloved knight was &lt;a href=\"Vyke\"&gt;Vyke&lt;/a&gt; the dragonspear, a Tarnished knight of the &lt;a href=\"Roundtable%20Hold\"&gt;Roundtable Hold&lt;/a&gt;, who was later scourged by the frenzied flame.\nLansseax is first encountered near the Abandoned Coffin Site of Grace, near the entrance to Altus Plateau from the &lt;a href=\"Ruin-Strewn%20Precipice\"&gt;Ruin-Strewn Precipice&lt;/a&gt;. After sustaining enough damage, she will fly away. She can later be encountered on a hill just south-west of the Rampartside Path Site of Grace in the east of Altus Plateau, where she can be defeated for good.\nLansseax has two unique moves that involve her summoning a glaive made of red lightning. One is a diagonal slam which releases waves of lightning across the ground that can be dodged through. The other is a horizontal sweep which also sends out waves.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The implementation of the faith in Leyndell would be supported largely by &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon%20Lansseax\"&gt;Lansseax&lt;/a&gt;, who would assume the form of a humanoid priestess and teach the blessings of the Ancient Dragons to Leyndell's inhabitants, with their lightning becoming a significant addition to the arsenal of its military.\nRelevant Items.\nItems related to or referencing the Ancient Dragon Cult"}

They can also be duplicated by Hewg with &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ashes%20of%20War\"&gt;Lost Ashes of War&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 whether in the inventory or already on a weapon \u2014 consuming them in the process.\nAcquisition.\nAshes of War are most commonly obtained as a drop from certain &lt;a href=\"Teardrop%20Scarab\"&gt;Teardrop Scarab&lt;/a&gt;s; however, they are sometimes contained in chests, sold by merchants, dropped by certain enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Night%27s%20Cavalry\"&gt;Night's Cavalry&lt;/a&gt; or the unique &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20Knight\"&gt;Godrick Knight&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Haight\"&gt;Fort Haight&lt;/a&gt;, or occasionally are available as potential rewards from boss &lt;a href=\"Remembrances\"&gt;Remembrances&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 for example, from the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20of%20the%20Naturalborn\"&gt;Remembrance of the Naturalborn&lt;/a&gt;. \nAdditionally, some weapons have Ashes of War pre-equipped on acquisition, such that they can be applied to other weapons or duplicated from them. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Nagakiba\"&gt;Nagakiba&lt;/a&gt; has Ash of War: Piercing Fang equipped on acquisition, despite having as its base skill when Piercing Fang is removed; and &lt;a href=\"Backhand%20Blade\"&gt;Backhand Blade&lt;/a&gt; has pre-equipped while simultaneously having Blind Spot as its underlying base skill. This often occurs when the Ash is otherwise impossible to obtain naturally.\nSkill Scalings.\nIt depends on the Ash of War individually if the Skill it grants scales with the weapon's attack rating, or your character's stats and the weapon's upgrades.\nFor example: will deal over 1000 damage on a Keen-infused +25 &lt;a href=\"Flamberge\"&gt;Flamberge&lt;/a&gt; equipped to a character with 20str/40dex and less than 1000 if the Ash of War's default Heavy-infusion was chosen instead; meanwhile, will deal less damage if any infusion option other than Heavy is chosen, even if the weapon's attack rating would be higher with something else.\nNumber of Ashes.\nThere are a total of 91 Ashes of War in the Elden Ring base game:\nStandard 12, Keen 11, Quality 12, Lightning 3, Magic 10, Sacred 11, Heavy 14, Fire 3, Blackflame/Flame Art 2, Poison 2, Cold 3, Blood 4, Occult 4\nList of Ashes of War.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\ncategory = Ashes of War\nnotcategory = Closed Network Test\nordermethod=title\nuses = Template:Infobox Item\ninclude = {Infobox Item}:image, {Infobox Item}:title, {Infobox Item}:affinity\nformat=\nsecseparators =\\n|-\\n| align=\"center\" | \\n,| &lt;a href=\"%25PAGE%25\"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt;

{"id": "505", "revid": "3358567", "url": "https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki?curid=505", "title": "Astrologer", "text": "Astrologer is one of the starting &lt;a href=\"Origins\"&gt;origins&lt;/a&gt; in .\nConsider this origin very carefully. While melee and bow fighters are spoiled for choice of weapons and equipment very early on from both loot and stores, you will not get access to effective equipment for spellcasting until you are past at least two major bosses of &lt;a href=\"Margit%2C%20the%20Fell%20Omen\"&gt;Margit, the Fell Omen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Godrick%20the%20Grafted\"&gt;Godrick the Grafted&lt;/a&gt;, where you will be finally able to buy the equipment listed below that the Astrologer starts with. The &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20Sellen\"&gt;Sorceress Sellen&lt;/a&gt; who will be your main spell teacher is also locked behind a boss fight. Even if you heavily prefer melee or bow combat, it might be worthwhile taking the Astrologer anyways just for the early tactical option of the spells.\nWhen choosing to be an Astrologer i.e. spellcaster, you're going to have to force your \"hand preference\" and controls based on your intended combat style due to two key spells that hard-force whether your Staff can be in your Right or Left hand, with such spells being blocked from firing in the opposite orientation. Note that the handedness has no effect on the raw strength of spells, nor does 2-handing a staff.\nGiven that you can't have the same staff equipped twice in two different weapon slots and that it is not economical to keep Strengthening two separate staffs as you level up, it is suggested to stick with just one of the above. If you truly detest melee combat except as a last resort and want to stick with spells as much as possible, go with a Right-handed staff to be able to use the shield buff for more defense (which is the Astrologer's default setup when you first start the game). Otherwise, switch the staff to the Left hand and get used to the different activation keys so that you can use the surprisingly powerful weapon buff.\nStarting equipment.\nArmaments\nSpells\nGear\nMisc. \nBuild Optimization.\nFor people who wish to select an origin that will have the most optimal stat distribution for a build with the fewest stat points wasted, the Astrologer is the best choice for essentially any build which focuses mainly on Intelligence, and more specifically the &lt;a href=\"Sorceries\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt;. Note that these builds are not necessarily \"good\", they are just what this origin is better at than any other.\nIntelligence-Strength-Dex.\nThe main goal of this build is to give the Astrologer access to the very powerful spells while simultaneously giving some tactical flexibility in melee and the ability to lure/damage enemies at a range beyond what their spells can reach via a &lt;a href=\"Longbow\"&gt;Longbow&lt;/a&gt;. If you get your Strength to 20 and Dexterity to 14, you can fully use the &lt;a href=\"Longbow\"&gt;Longbow&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pike\"&gt;Pike&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several of the shields that have a 100% Physical damage reduction through guarding like the &lt;a href=\"Heater%20Shield\"&gt;Heater Shield&lt;/a&gt;. However, as an alternate option you can stick with the Pike and Staff build for liberal use of &lt;a href=\"Scholar%27s%20Armament\"&gt;Scholar's Armament&lt;/a&gt;, and then you can easily have both spells and melee attacks happening interchangeably along with relying on dodge rolls for defense. In this instance, just remove the shield to reduce your &lt;a href=\"Equip%20Load\"&gt;Equip Load&lt;/a&gt;; remember that a Shield only helps you, in any way, if you Guard with it. They do not give any bonus passive defenses just from wearing them like Armor does, so you may be better off saving the weight of the Shield and wearing a stronger Armor instead.\nYou won't really need to push either stat much further than this for a LONG time. Then you can pile on Intelligence, as well as the occasional Vigor, Mind and Endurance for improved HP, FP and Stamina capacity; keep Vigor and Mind up enough so that your HP and FP max capacities are just slightly above what a Flask charge can restore, growing as you upgrade the Flask strength.\nMake liberal use of the auto-targeting feature and your range. While not having a particularly fast damage output, &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Pebble\"&gt;Glintstone Pebble&lt;/a&gt; is extremely FP-efficient against single targets. &lt;a href=\"Glintstone%20Arc\"&gt;Glintstone Arc&lt;/a&gt; has identical damage per shot as Pebble but with a higher FP cost and slightly less range, however it can hit small groups of enemies simultaneously which is where it truly shines. Combine these with a careful evasive ranged combat style and a decent Summon, and you can do VERY well for quite some time before you even find another reasonable spell.\nOnce you've gotten comfortable with the attack patterns of certain enemies you can easily switch to melee with the ultra-long &lt;a href=\"Pike\"&gt;Pike&lt;/a&gt; (using the &lt;a href=\"Spear\"&gt;Spear&lt;/a&gt; beforehand which is acquired earlier), allowing for efficient kills without burning through too much FP.\nOne additional benefit of this playstyle is that the equipped weaponry and staves of Magic Users tends to be fairly light, since they can use spell selection to give them a spread of short range and long range combat options. This in turn allows magic users to wear heavier, more protective armor than melee fighters normally would at the same load limit and still maintain good mobility."}

The catacombs are said to contain a knifeprint which hides the truth of the conspiracy of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Black%20Knives\"&gt;Night of Black Knives&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkeletons in this dungeon cannot be killed normally after being defeated unless using special weaknesses of &lt;a href=\"Those%20Who%20Live%20in%20Death\"&gt;Those Who Live in Death&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, nearby Commoner's wielding special staves have to be killed to finished them off normally. \nThe entrance to the main boss arena can be found just after the Site of Grace at the entrance. Head left to find a split in the route, with a &lt;a href=\"Stonesword%20Key\"&gt;Stonesword Key&lt;/a&gt;-locked room to the left that holds 2 Skeletons and the &lt;a href=\"Rosus%27%20Axe\"&gt;Rosus' Axe&lt;/a&gt;. \nTo continue, head forward instead of to the left and run into a large room with 3 guillotines. \nMain boss route.\nRun through the guillotine to a ladder and climb down. Straight ahead is the dungeon lever, guarded by 2 Giant Crabs that pop up from the back and the front as you approach. \nReturn to the entrance and head through the now unlocked door to arrive at the boss, a Cemetery Shade who is accompanied by 2 sword-wielding Skeletons and 1 bow-wielding Skeleton. Since this can be a very overwhelming fight it is recommended to bring a &lt;a href=\"Ashes\"&gt;Spirit Ash&lt;/a&gt; to distract at least some of the foes, or otherwise bring a strong anti-undead attack such as the skill to deal with the mobs. \nSecondary boss route.\nAfter the second or third guillotine blade has fallen down in the large room they can be stepped onto and ridden to a ledge above. Following through the door leads to more regular enemies as well as a corridor that seemingly ends with a small hole to the right to drop down to the lever below. If one instead attacks the wall straight ahead another fog wall for a boss will be revealed, along with the summon sign for &lt;a href=\"D%2C%20Hunter%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;D, Hunter of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; should he be alive. \nSince the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knife%20Assassin\"&gt;Black Knife Assassin&lt;/a&gt; within is a very agile foe capable of making lunges across the rather small arena, it is advisable to summon D or a &lt;a href=\"Ashes\"&gt;Spirit Ash&lt;/a&gt; to help keep the assassin's attention on someone else and get a safe moment to heal. \nSites of Grace.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nBlack Knife Catacombs = \nFound at the start of the dungeon.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They were under the command of their first leader &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Commander%20Andreas\"&gt;Black Knight Commander Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, a man of great strength who has command over the primordial powers of the &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;. Having absolute loyalty to their master, the Black Knights possess an iron conviction to their &lt;a href=\"Crusade\"&gt;Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and they never yield nor doubt their purpose. Despite their strong dedication to purging the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Realm of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, they nevertheless show some consolation to &lt;a href=\"Messmer%20Soldier\"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; who are forced to wage a war without grace or honor.\nWearing black armor ornamentally and etched in gold, they carry weapons and shields of black steel, decorated with golden embellishments, and are imbued with &lt;a href=\"Erdtree\"&gt;Erdtree&lt;/a&gt; incantations. The Black Knights also seem to emit a rotten odor from their gauntlets and greaves. The cause may be from the tainted nature of the blood that stains their armor, or it may stem from their blackened souls, which fester as a result of endless slaughter.\nDespite their devoted loyalty, however, not all Black Knights serve Messmer without doubt; both Black Knight Commander Andreas and his son and second-in-command &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Captain%20Huw\"&gt;Black Knight Captain Huw&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against Messmer upon learning of his serpentine nature. For their betrayal, they were ultimately imprisoned in underground tombs."}

It possessed god-slaying power, capable of killing &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt;. \nBackground.\nPrior to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Order\"&gt;Golden Order&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; was the source of the power of the Black Flames, which was channeled by the Gloam-Eyed Queen through her &lt;a href=\"Godslayer%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Godslayer's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. Under her leadership, the Godskin Apostles wielded the god-slaying Black Flames during their god hunt.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Marika%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Queen Marika the Eternal&lt;/a&gt; desired to remove the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Death\"&gt;Rune of Death&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Ring%20%28concept%29\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt; in order to establish the Golden Order, her &lt;a href=\"Shadowbound%20Beast\"&gt;Shadowbound Beast&lt;/a&gt; and half-brother &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%2C%20the%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;Maliketh&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Gloam-Eyed Queen and her apostles, and the Rune of Death was sealed away in his &lt;a href=\"Maliketh%27s%20Black%20Blade\"&gt;black blade&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the true power of the Black Flame was lost while the Gloam-Eyed Queen's sword was locked away at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Tower%20of%20Caelid\"&gt;Divine Tower of Caelid&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Blackflame%20Monk%20Amon\"&gt;Amon&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Monk\"&gt;Fire Monk&lt;/a&gt;, became enthralled by the Black Flames, leading him to cowardly abandon his duty as a guardian of the &lt;a href=\"Giants%27%20Flame\"&gt;Giants' Flame&lt;/a&gt;. He swore fealty to the god-slaying blackflame, becoming the first &lt;a href=\"Blackflame%20Monk\"&gt;Blackflame Monk&lt;/a&gt;. Other Fire Monks soon followed suit, and they turned traitor after also becoming enthralled by the Black Flames.\nCharacteristics.\nBlackflame is an ancient fire that is fueled solely by &lt;a href=\"Faith\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; alone. Back when it had its true power, the Black Flames held the deadly power of killing Gods and were channeled through Black Flame incantations such as &lt;a href=\"Scouring%20Black%20Flame\"&gt;Scouring Black Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flame%20Ritual\"&gt;Black Flame Ritual&lt;/a&gt;. The Godskin Apostles also used Blackflame for protection as if it were armor. \nIn their current, weaker state this means that all offensive Black Flame effects deal additional damage equal to 2% of the target's maximum &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; + 20 over the course of 2 seconds per hit (note that this doesn't stack, with another hit merely refreshing the duration). \nAll bosses in are resistant to this percentage-based damage, only taking damage equal to 1% of target's maximum &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; + 10 over 2 seconds. &lt;a href=\"Messmer%20the%20Impaler\"&gt;Messmer the Impaler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bayle%20the%20Dread\"&gt;Bayle the Dread&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Promised%20Consort%20Radahn\"&gt;Promised Consort&lt;/a&gt; are even more resistant to the effect, only taking damage equal to 0.7% of target's maximum &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; + 7.

Spells and items affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt; also cause this status effect. \nMechanics.\nDeals a combination of flat and percentual damage when inflicted and humanoid or smaller enemies, and &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt;, are slightly staggered. The flat damage is usually 100, but increases to 200 when done by Somber Smithing Stone-upgraded weapon with innate Blood Loss and &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Arcane&lt;/a&gt;-scaling or by a regular Smithing Stone-upgraded with innate Blood Loss and with the Blood-affinity. The percentual damage depends on the enemy: normal ones and &lt;a href=\"Tarnished\"&gt;Tarnished&lt;/a&gt; take 15% damage, bosses and enemies that directly accompany them take 10.5% damage, and the &lt;a href=\"Mohg%2C%20Lord%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Lord of Blood&lt;/a&gt; takes 7.5% damage. \nAdditionally, the blood loss inflicted by Mohg's Nihil attack is unique and only inflicts percentual damage, roughly 33% damage on each of the first two pulses and about 66% on the final pulse. Using the &lt;a href=\"Purifying%20Crystal%20Tear\"&gt;Purifying Crystal Tear&lt;/a&gt; greatly reduces this damage to about 5% on the first two pulses and 10% on the final one. \nBlood loss can also be inflicted on someone in the middle of invincibility frames, such as a roll, though this only causes the stun and not the damage. \nCuring &amp; Mitigation.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nUtilization.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nThere are certain equipment that gives the player buffs when blood loss has been inflicted in the general vicinity, they do not discriminate between what has been bled in order to activate, it can be friend, foe and even oneself and generally lasts for around 20 seconds since the last blood loss infliction.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEnemies.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Abductor%20Virgin\"&gt;Abductor Virgin&lt;/a&gt;
