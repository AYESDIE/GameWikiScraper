However, certain companions will depart the area map (somehow) and can't be reached again in Chapter 7 (which is the final portion in the Shadow's of Amn campaign).\nFor instance &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; will go to the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt; will travel to the front of the &lt;a href=\"Galvarey%20Estate\"&gt;Galvarey Estate&lt;/a&gt;. This could also mean that companions who leave the party in Chapter 7 might not be available in the either. It is advised that a save game is made before letting a party member go - just in case the player wishes to reverse this decision later.\nSome other Bioware and Beamdog core companions will remain in the Abyss and can be recruited again. Mod introduced companions will behave as scripted by that particular mod content.\nResting with no disturbance is permitted in the Abyss area. Feel free to rest as desired, in the pleasant and calming atmosphere of Hell.\nWhenever the player moves the party to another sub-map connected to the main Abyss area by descending steps and transitioning to one of the various tests - be aware that the party cannot return or leave that new area until it has possession of that specific test's &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tear of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, once the party commits to traveling to a sub-map, it must finish the test and obtain the tear of Bhaal before it can return to the main starting area again.\nPlot recap.\nThe last location the party was in was the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life\"&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/a&gt;, which was the site of the battle with &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus%20%28Tree%20of%20Life%29\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Ellesime\"&gt;Queen Ellesime&lt;/a&gt; was freed from her bonds. Jon Irenicus attacked the party. After a tumultuous battle, the bhaalspawn was triumphant and killed Jon, preventing him from draining the tree and garnering the divine power of Rillifane he sought.\nBut then, something strange happened, and Gorion's Ward and any companions there were inexorably drawn down into this Hellish plane, tugged and pulled along with Jon's soul. Yet the party isn't dead, the bhaalspawn's soul hasn't been restored, there is no apparent way to escape this plane of existence.\nThis begins the second part of Chapter 7, somewhere in the Nine Hells.\nGameplay / walkthrough.\nThe walkthrough material is located on the &lt;a href=\"Finding%20Irenicus%20in%20Hell\"&gt;Finding Irenicus in Hell&lt;/a&gt; article."}

Gameplay is roughly 8 hours for first-time playthrough, 2 to 3 hours if importing strong characters.\nCharacters may reach roughly level 10 (level 9 for high experience requirement classes and level 11 for low experience requirement classes). You may export your characters anytime then start the main games with them. They'll remain at the levels at the time of exportation, but their experience cap will be reduced to 161,000 in BG1 or 500,000 in SoD. One default playthrough of The Black Pits earns the player 1,261,175 experience and 165,464 gold combined in total.\nPlot.\nThe Black Pits start with the player's party being abducted under unclear circumstances from wherever they were, and forced to fight in the arena (actually, multiple arenas of the same complex). For each victory the player gains some money to spend on upgrading equipment and gets some advice on the upcoming battle from a geased beholder. Finally, the owner of the place runs out of things to throw at the party and has to face them himself in the pits.\nBetween the fights you can get some backstory and inconsequential semi-side quests of no reward aside story-satisfaction, and a Potion of Power.\nCharacters.\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"Baeloth%20Barrityl\"&gt;Baeloth the Entertainer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"drow\"&gt;drow&lt;/a&gt;) to enter the arena battle, You may pre-buff your party before each fight, you may also repeat previously completed battles which will net you additional Gold and XP. \n&lt;a href=\"Ghlouralk\"&gt;Ghlouralk&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"beholder\"&gt;beholder&lt;/a&gt; is here to provide insights upon the upcoming battle, it'll join Baeloth in the final fight if you killed &lt;a href=\"Elan%20Garaq\"&gt;Elan Garaq&lt;/a&gt; but not Baeloth first. \nThese NPCs have stores from which you can buy various weapons, armors, accessories, spells, wands and consumable items. They'll have their own perspectives in serving Baeloth and minor stories, Elan Garaq and Thardek will fight alongside Baeloth in the final battle. The combatants of 5th, 10th and 15th battle will also appear in the prison cells. \nYou cannot attack any of those NPCs.\nBest Classes.\nAll Hit Point (HP) values shown for &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; of 18 with maximized &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Dice\"&gt;Hit Dice&lt;/a&gt; rolls."}

Both the &lt;a href=\"Tanar%27ri\"&gt;Tanar'ri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baatezu\"&gt;Baatezu&lt;/a&gt; encounters have different criteria for whether the party will be rejected at first contact, and then a second check is performed to see if the dialogue can continue or if hostilities will commence. The game provides no clues are warnings ahead of time for this dynamic, so realistically the player couldn't know this.\nIn short, expect any Paladin or lawful good aligned \"Player1\" (this is usually &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;) to trigger hostilities and void the opportunity for the quest. Depending on the encounter, a Cleric class, or lawful neutral and neutral good alignment may also shutter the quest. There isn't much that can be done about these restrictions.\nAquisition - Tahazzar.\nAgreeing to perform a task from the demon &lt;a href=\"Tahazzar\"&gt;Tahazzar&lt;/a&gt; will register this side quest in the player's Journal, as follows:\nAquisition - Ka'rashur.\nDeciding to perform a task for the devil &lt;a href=\"Ka%27rashur\"&gt;Ka'rashur&lt;/a&gt; will register this side quest in the player's Journal, as follows:\nGameplay.\nThe party will encounter the &lt;a href=\"Tanar%27ri\"&gt;Tanar'ri&lt;/a&gt; leader Talhazzar or the &lt;a href=\"Baatezu\"&gt;Baatezu&lt;/a&gt; leader Ka'rashur at some point in the exploration of the Teleport Maze.\nThis side quest can be missed or not materialize for several reasons. First, the party's composition may be incompatible with the requirements/restrictions placed on striking a deal with either of the fiends. Secondly, the party can choose to destroy the fiends and fight them, or the same result can occur through refusing to take on the job. \nIf the party is using and following the &lt;a href=\"Madman%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Madman's Journal&lt;/a&gt; to navigate a path through the maze (or perhaps following the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Teleport%20Maze%20Walkthrough\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Teleport Maze Walkthrough&lt;/a&gt;), then it is likely that the demon Tahazzar will be the first fiend encountered.\nHowever, if the party is making its own way and forging a unique path, then it is possible that the devil Ka'rashur is the first fiend found.\nOnce the party has accepted the job and had the quest entry registered in the Journal, then this sets a \"global\" in the game files that precludes the player from making the same deal with the rival demons/devils. \nIn fact, both Tahazzar and Ka'rashur will sense if a deal has been struck with the other group, leading to immediate hostile reaction. For example, if the party has accepted the job from Tahazzar, then when the party finds Ka'rashur, the Pit Fiend will say:\nand a similar reaction from Tahazzar will be made if the party has a deal with the devils, saying:\nTo advance the quest, the party will need to defeat the targeted quarry, killing the fiend and obtain their heart as a sign of completing the deed - either &lt;a href=\"Tahazzar%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Tahazzar's Heart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ka%27rashur%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Ka'rashur's Heart&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis can only be done through force of arms.\nReturn the grisly proof to the requisite quest giver by backtracking and returning to Tahazzar or Ka'rashur, as appropriate.\nThe party will have dialogue with the fiend, and it'll ask if they have the heart. Select from the responses offered. \nIf the party says no, but they intend to find it and return, then the fiend will wish you well and the quest continues.\nIf the party says no, and that they have no intention of getting it either, then the fiend will make a remark in disgust, and then become hostile (and the quest is shuttered).\nShould the party have the heart, the fiend will have some dialogue and be appreciative, and automatically claim the item from the party's inventory. At this time the party is awarded a magical item - the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%27%20Hood\"&gt;Thieves' Hood&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20Gem\"&gt;Scepter Gem&lt;/a&gt; and (quest type).\nSolved quest - Tahazzar.\nWhen the fiend takes &lt;a href=\"Ka%27rashur%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Ka'rashur's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, it'll say:\nAt this time the player's Journal updates the quest:\nSolved quest - Ka'rashur.\nWhen the fiend takes &lt;a href=\"Tahazzar%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Tahazzar's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, it'll reply: \nAt this time the player's Journal updates the quest:"}

There are three potential quest givers for this quest: &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Hannah\"&gt;Lady Hannah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ramazith\"&gt;Ramazith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ragefast\"&gt;Ragefast&lt;/a&gt;.\nLady Hannah can be found in &lt;a href=\"central%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;central Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest corner of the local map standing near the &lt;a href=\"Poultry%20Store\"&gt;Poultry Store&lt;/a&gt;. When the party is close enough she greets them and begins complaining about the mage Ragefast being a dirty old man. If the player asks her to explain further the quest begins and Lady Hannah tells the player that Ragefast is keeping a nymph captive in his home. If the player says they do not wish to get involved she leaves and the quest does not start.\nRamazith can be found in &lt;a href=\"north%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;north Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Ramazith%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Ramazith's Tower&lt;/a&gt;. He will greet the player and ask them if they are interested in doing some work of an illegal nature. If the player refuses his offer at any point he will leave and return to his tower. If the player expresses interest he says that he wants them to steal a nymph from the mage Ragefast and will reward them with magical items. If asked to improve his offer he will say that he cannot. The quest can also be acquired by simply entering &lt;a href=\"Ragefast%27s%20Home\"&gt;Ragefast's Home&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinding and Confronting Ragefast.\nThough Lady Hannah and the in-game journal both say Ragefast's home would be located in &lt;a href=\"northwest%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;northwest Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, it is actually in the &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;city's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"west%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;west district&lt;/a&gt;. West Baldur's Gate can be reached by going to central Baldur's Gate and walking to the west side of the map. Ragefast's Home is in the north-northeast corner of the west district. The door is locked.\nOnce the player is inside, Ragefast will greet them and refuse to let them leave because they have seen the nymph, &lt;a href=\"Abela\"&gt;Abela&lt;/a&gt;, whom he holds captive. He expresses his belief that he and Abela are meant to be together. Abela says that she is not long for this world. If the player says that they were sent by Ramazith, Ragefast will become hostile. This is not necessarily a problem as Ragefast must die in order to take Abela to Ramazith. If the player threatens Ragefast or Abela in any way during the conversation he will attack. In order to talk Ragefast into releasing Abela the player must avoid threats and use Ragefast's feelings for Abela as leverage to convince him to set her free.\nOutcomes.\nFree Abela the Nymph.\nIf the player frees Abela and returns to Ramazith without her, he will become hostile and challenge the party before teleporting to the top of his tower, in the original \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" not without attacking with a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;. If the party has not spoken to Ramazith prior to freeing Abela, he can be found inside his home. If you refused his offer then freed Abela before returning, Ramazith will act as if he is unaware and you must agree to his terms then follow him inside to advance the plot. Either way, the party must then fight their way up through the tower. The second floor has two &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20Jelly\"&gt;mustard jellies&lt;/a&gt;, the third floor has six &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, the fourth floor has six &lt;a href=\"hobgoblin\"&gt;hobgoblin&lt;/a&gt;s, and the fifth has six &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s. Ramazith is on the sixth floor. It is possible to fight him there for a brief time before he teleports away to a different floor of the tower.\nDeliver Abela to Ramazith.\nIn the , if Ragefast is killed and Abela is taken to Ramazith, the party will receive &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20of%20Defense%20A.C.%207\"&gt;Bracers of Defense&lt;/a&gt; and 2000 XP as a reward (the quest is glitched in the original &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and the player receives no reward for their effort except for the loot from Ragefast). At this point the player can still talk to Abela and free her. They will not rejoin the party after he is dead. His body can be looted for an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Metaspell%20Influence\"&gt;Amulet of Metaspell Influence&lt;/a&gt;, knave's robes, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Guard%27s%20Ring%20%2B2\"&gt;The Guard's Ring +2&lt;/a&gt;"}

The item draws its power from the life force of the wearer and as a result, &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; is lowered by two points and a -4 penalty saving throws vs. paralysis/poison/death is incurred, making the wearer less resistant to poison and disease.\nBecause &lt;a href=\"halfling\"&gt;halfling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have a saving throw bonus depending on the Constitution character ability, the saving throw bonus could be lower and the penalty to death saving throws even higher than expected under certain circumstances. At least in the current EE version, this is not a concern; \"shorty saves\" seem to be calculated off base Constitution and not the value after being altered by any items, meaning the Claw's Constitution debuff will not affect them at all. \nIn return for all these drawbacks, the wearer receives a blurred image, just like with the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Displacement\"&gt;Cloak of Displacement&lt;/a&gt;, which makes all attacks directed to him/her less accurate.

During the conversation, an enchanted boulder will break through into fort, beginning the quest.\nWarning: At the start of this quest, all members of the party suffered one level's worth of &lt;a href=\"level%20drain\"&gt;level drain&lt;/a&gt;, as will anyone who joins the group as long as the quest is active.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter approaching the stone, a conversation will trigger with Wynan, who will ask to find a copy of the spell that enchanted the stone so that the magic can be nullified.\nThe target enchanter in question is the former &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wizards%20of%20Thay\"&gt;Red Wizard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vichand\"&gt;Vichand&lt;/a&gt;, who is camped out at the &lt;a href=\"Shining%20Crusade\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; encampment outside the fort. It can be reached by leaving through the teleport circle that granted entrance, and if access to the camp has already been gained, Vichand can be approached directly.\nThere are multiple ways to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Scroll%20of%20Impactful%20Doom\"&gt;Arcane Scroll of Impactful Doom&lt;/a&gt; from Vichand.\nIf the threaten path was used, there are several ways to end, with varying consequences. Saying you dealt fairly and leaving will trigger him to yell and turn the camp hostile if you ever speak to him again or another threat is an option, requiring Charisma or Strength \u2265 14. A strange option is putting him to sleep, which requires someone in the party to have one of the following: &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Person\"&gt;Charm Person&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Charm\"&gt;Dire Charm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sleep\"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Sleep\"&gt;Power Word, Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person\"&gt;Hold Person&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Monster\"&gt;Hold Monster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mental%20Domination\"&gt;Mental Domination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Safana%27s%20Kiss\"&gt;Safana's Kiss&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Sleep\"&gt;Wand of Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, checked and used in that order. Lastly, as mentioned above, he can just be killed, and as long as it's out of sight of any other person in the camp, will not turn the camp hostile.\nNote, the request for a &lt;a href=\"Planetar%20Feather\"&gt;Planetar Feather&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"The%20Call%20of%20the%20Wild%20Mage\"&gt;The Call of the Wild Mage&lt;/a&gt; can be made immediately after the initial threat, which gains both the item for free and ends with the same reaction as a successful threat.\nAfter returning to the fortress and the stone, the scroll is given to Wynan or have a mage in the party can counteract the magic. Either way, the quest ends with a reward of for each party member, and dispelling the enchantment will release a &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28SoD%29\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt;, which still needs to be killed. The party will all silently receive a &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Restoration\"&gt;Lesser Restoration&lt;/a&gt; effect, removing the level drain suffered at the start of this quest.\nThis quest will also end if the Crusaders take the fort through surrender or trechery.\nIndirect Rewards.\nIf the disenchanted boulder is interacted with 3 times, &lt;a href=\"Voidstone%20Shards\"&gt;Voidstone Shards&lt;/a&gt; can be collected, which &lt;a href=\"Jegg\"&gt;Jegg&lt;/a&gt; can make into one of several weapons.\nThough not directly part of the quest, once it is finished, Jegg can be asked to forge &lt;a href=\"Jegg%27s%20Leathers\"&gt;Jegg's Leathers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"M%27Khiin%20Grubdoubler\"&gt;M'Khiin&lt;/a&gt; to wear.\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"Jegg\"&gt;Jegg&lt;/a&gt; mentions that &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; saved everybody from certain death and shows her gratitude with extraordinary prices (both for selling and buying) from now on."}

Begin dialogue using Veldrin. She introduces you:\nThe matron mother doesn't seem very eager about Veldrin and snaps back:\nPhaere puts in a good word for Veldrin and reports your prowess. The matron mother then addresses Veldrin directly:\nShe continues:\nPhaere protests about the Beholder comments, but is quickly silenced by the Matron, who continues:\nThe Player's Journal will update under the header \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Drow%20Summoning%20Ritual\"&gt;The Drow Summoning Ritual&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIf the party has not obtained at least one of the necessary items, then now is the time to do so. Visit the &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayers%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Eastern Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Cave%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Southern Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Kuo%20Toa%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Western Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;. Better yet, visit and do all three areas. Much experience, treasure, adventure and danger await. A Journal Entry will be present, revealing the following text:\nRemember to finish off any other quests before returning any of the items the Matron Mother seeks.\nDeliver the items to the matron mother.\nAs long as the party has obtained at least one of the required items including &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toa%27s%20Blood\"&gt;Kuo-toa's Blood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Brain%20Blood\"&gt;Elder Brain Blood&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Eyestalk%20of%20an%20Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Eyestalk of an Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt; the party can return to the matron mother and speak with her. She will say:\nPhaere will also be pleased and say:\nThe Matron mother now expounds how she must safeguard her plan for a special ritual, which can now be undertaken with the special blood component. She also makes known that she shall seal the city to prevent anything from interfering with the plan. Some of what she says is paraphrased here:\nShe also addresses Veldrin:\nHowever, Phaere then looks at Veldrin and says:\nExperience Reward: For delivering one (or more) Noble Race components to the Matron, each party member receives .\nMeet Phaere in her quarters within 1 hour.\nBack in the Female Fighter's Society structure, speak with Phaere and find out what she wants of Veldrin. She'll say:\nRegardless of what you may think of Phaere, it will behoove the party to agree to betray the matron mother. \nThis does not mean that at a later period afterwards that the party cannot change its mind or pursue a different path. \nIf, however, Veldrin is hesitant in the answers to Phaere, or says no (there will be several other dialogue options) then, in the end, Phaere will not be confident that she can trust you and that will lead to hostilities. for instance, if Phaere says \"Hmmm... no. No, I do not trust you, Veldrin. You will betray me for your own benefit to the matron mother, I think. It is time for you to die.\" Then Veldrin has failed his mission. Another indicator is if Phaere says \"Then die, fool. If you are not with me in this plan, then you are only a danger to me. Darkness take you for your stubbornness!\"\nIf Veldrin does agree to help, then Phaere explains:\nPhaere continues:\nPhaere gives you the &lt;a href=\"Despana%20Treasury%20Key\"&gt;Despana Treasury Key&lt;/a&gt; to be able to enter the treasury storage area in the Temple of Lolth and concludes with:\nThe party now knows its next action. Note that while Phaere is alone in her apartment, killing her after receiving the fake eggs still fails the quest and raises the alarm in the city.\nThe Temple of Lolth treasury room.\nAs soon as the party is prepared to venture to the Temple, then set out and make haste to the building. Perhaps the player should formulate a plan on how best to get past the treasury guards Phaere warned you about. Or perhaps the player may be thinking of turning on Phaere and taking a chance to report the whole plot to the Matron?\nOn the way to the temple on the main pathway there, a teleport animation appears before the party, and to your surprise, appears &lt;a href=\"Solaufein\"&gt;Solaufein&lt;/a&gt;. If the party killed Solaufein earlier in the quest, then obviously this won't occur, and keep reading past the part where Solaufein introduces his scheme and then departs.\nSolaufein immediately says:\nHe continues his remarks:\nSolaufein then asks:\nThe party can accept these phony eggs and use them later or keep them as a possible option for future use as the plot unfolds. If Veldrin declines the eggs, then Solaufein will have one final remark and then depart. If Veldrin accepts them, Solaufein concludes with:\nThis will be the last time you will encounter Solaufein in a game, without specific Mod content installed. With (or without) Solaufein's fake eggs in hand, continue into the Temple and retrieve the Dragon's eggs.\nIf the player has decided to enter the treasury room, then recall that Phaere has warned that the guards near the chamber's doors will attack you if an attempt to open the doors is observed. Stealth was advised and is possible since you have the key to the room. The party can decide how it wishes to undertake this task. Perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; spell would suffice, or a sneaking party member, or use of &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;?\nWithin the Treasury room are a number of egg-shaped containers on the perimeter of the space. Three &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt; guardians are in here - neutral at the moment.\nRemember to swap the real dragon eggs in the treasury room - place Phaere's fake eggs in the treasury container if planning to help her take down the Matron. The golems will activate if attacked or the Dragon Eggs are removed.\nAssuming the real Dragon Eggs are obtained - return to Phaere, or the party could decide at the last minute to report Phaere's planned betrayal to matron Ardulace, if desired.\nReturn some eggs to Phaere.\nIf the party has reported Phaere's betrayal to the matron mother, then this section does not apply. Also, if Solaufein's fake eggs weren't obtained by the party then that path is closed off.\nWith the real Dragon eggs in the party's possession return to the Female Fighter's Society building as she commanded. At this stage, Veldrin needs to decide if the real dragon eggs will be presented to Phaere, or if the convincing fake eggs obtained from Solaufein will be given to her. Choose wisely.\nPhaere will greet Veldrin, paraphrased here:\nShe then says the following, and then departs for the Temple of Lolth:\nPhaere departs, and few seconds pass when a strange teleport animation plays out before the party. \nAn imp of some kind has transported to the chamber and begins to speak in an odd cadence, and unnatural speech pattern. The imp says: \nFurther dialogue delivered will differ depending on whether the party has given Phaere the real eggs or Solaufein's eggs. The reason for this is that if Phaere has the real eggs, then there is one last chance to get them back during the upcoming ritual, if done properly. If not, then the eggs will be lost forever. However, if the party is planning to do the double-cross trick on the two drow then the Imp continues its message:\nIf Phaere has the real dragon eggs, the imp says:\nIf Phaere has the fake eggs, the imp closes with a final message and teleports away:\nExperience Reward: For providing Phaere the real eggs . For providing Solaufeins fake eggs .\nThe party must go to the temple of Lolth and find Phaere.\nPrelude to the summoning ritual.\nThere are basically three outcomes for the Summoning ritual, all determined by actions the party has taken before.\nSupporting the matron mother.\nThis path means that Veldrin has convinced the Matron that Phaere was planning to betray her. Through actions and dialogue options Veldrin is able to earn the Matron's trust. \nThe Matron will ask for proof of Phaere's betrayal, and proof can mean showing the Matron the &lt;a href=\"Despana%20Treasury%20Key\"&gt;Despana Treasury Key&lt;/a&gt;, or Phaere's Dragon eggs (or even the real Dragon eggs). Choose wisely.\nTo do this, Veldrin should take the eggs to Matron Ardulace (x=520, y=1150) and show her both the real eggs Phaere required you to steal, and the fake eggs Phaere planned to replace them with. If the Key was used to provide proof, there are dialogue options for that as well.\nThe Matron will believe you and have armed guards arrest Phaere and bring her before the party and the Ardulace. Phaere will be killed after some heated verbal exchanges. Note that Veldrin may opt to give the Matron Solaufein's fake eggs instead of the real ones - the trickery can continue. Of course, if the party already killed Solaufein, this won't be possible.\nThis choice leaves just the Matron and the party to be present during the ritual. Knowing that, Veldrin can decide if he wishes the Matron to offer the real eggs, or Solaufeins fake eggs as an offering during the ritual. If the matron has the real eggs after Phaere is killed, then the upcoming summoning ritual will only have one outcome, and there cannot be any trickery or subterfuge from the player.\nSupporting Phaere.\nIf the party wishes to let Phaere triumph over the Matron, then follow Phaere's plan, and retrieve the real dragon eggs and place Phaere's phony eggs in the treasury room. When the summoning ritual is commenced, the Matron will not know the dragon eggs she has are the fake ones. Phaere will have the real dragon eggs, and present those during the ritual as an offering.\nDouble-cross both the Matron and Phaere.\nVeldrin will keep the real dragon eggs all along. The Matron will have Phaere's fake eggs, and Phaere will have Solaufein's phony eggs.\nThis path leads to both Ardulace and Phaere being destroyed during the ritual. The last persons standing will be Veldrin and party, and the summoned demon.\nThe summoning ritual.\nThe actual ritual rite will take place in a fairly large room in the Temple. The doors are closed, and the Matron leads the ceremony she has some commands and remarks before beginning:\nSoon, after some on-screen animations and magical effects are displayed, the abyssal gate is opened and the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Demon%20Lord\"&gt;Lesser Demon Lord&lt;/a&gt; appears before the drow and party. The demon booms out an opening remark:\nThe Matron and demon have an exchange, and she offers eggs to the demon.\nIf the Matron has the real dragon eggs to offer, then the demon accepts them, and also knows the party's deception and reveals this to the drow, thus exposing the party as intruders. Some shouted remarks will occur from those present, and then the demon, and all drow will become hostile and attack the party. The player's cover is blown.\nIf the Matron has offered fake eggs to the demon, the demon will say:\nThe demon will now smite the Matron dead as she screeches curses and other last words.\nAn Abyssal Flame strike will roar down upon the matron, slaying her in one fiery stroke.\nIf Phaere is present, she will then engage the demon, and offer eggs to the fell lord. If she has the real dragon eggs, the party has one last chance to interrupt the ritual. A dialogue box will present that gives the party a chance to say nothing or to make an announcement. See the Screenshot.\nIf the party interrupts, Phaere will curse Veldrin and she and the demon will turn hostile. A journal entry will also present indicating the party has blown its cover, and the entire drow city is now hostile as well. This action is the only way for the player to be able to actually fight and destroy the demon AND to get the real Dragon Eggs. Remember, the real Dragon Eggs can be recovered from Phaere's body - assuming she and the demon are defeated.\nIf, however, Phaere provides the real eggs to the demon, then the demon will reveal that the party are surfacers and that results in both Phaere and the demon becoming hostile and attacking. The real eggs will be lost forever. The city will immediately turn hostile.\nIf the real dragon eggs are in possession of the party, then they can just remain silent or tell the demon to go back to its plane, and the beast will leave with a few final remarks. However, if &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; is evil aligned, then a additional dialogue option is present - and if selected will allow the PC to offer the real Dragon Eggs to the Lesser Demon Lord. \nIf the party decides to go down the \"evil path\" with the demon it can do so at this time. The drow must be dead, and then Veldrin can attempt to bargain with the demon by offering the real dragon eggs - the demon will reply:\nAssuming no party member objections, then the bhaalspawn may ask for one of several different favors from the demon in exchange for the real dragon eggs. These are simplified as:\nExperience Reward: For tricking the Matron and Phaere and their destruction by the demon for each party member.\nFinal actions.\nWith the death of the Matron, the gates to Ust Natha are now unsealed. The party can make its way to the city exit and should do so quickly. If the party has engaged the Matron and or Phaere in combat, then the entire drow city will be hostile as the party travels to leave the city. \nThere is an opportunity to slay everything in the city now, and accumulate more sellable loot, and gain experience points for combat actions. At this stage of the saga, the party is most likely able to pull this action off with little risk. The game didn't really include any epic city defense script at this juncture, and it may feel anti-climactic. \nIf the party is in possession of the real dragon eggs, return to &lt;a href=\"Adalon\"&gt;Adalon&lt;/a&gt; to finish the quest and receive assistance leaving the Underdark and a treasure from her hoard."}

Pick a side and then agree to retrieve the mantle in order to receive the &lt;a href=\"Trademeet%20Tomb%20Key\"&gt;Trademeet Tomb Key&lt;/a&gt;, without which, the crypt is inaccessible.\nWhen you open the door to the tomb, &lt;a href=\"High%20Merchant%20Logan%20Coprith\"&gt;High Merchant Logan Coprith&lt;/a&gt; will appear and ask you to give the mantle to him to avoid bloodshed between the two families.\nEnter the tomb, defeat the skeletons there, and take it from the remains of one of the Skeleton Warriors.\nGiving the mantle to Logan.\nBring the mantle to Coprith at the &lt;a href=\"Mayor%27s%20House\"&gt;Mayor's House&lt;/a&gt;.

The head of the opposing family simply disappears from game after giving the Mantle to Logan, leaving only their guards, who can now be slaughtered with no negative consequences. They yield each and have some minor loot.\nGiving the mantle to one of the feuding families.\nIf you give the mantle to either Skarmaen or Lilith, the other family will appear and they will both attack you for it. You end up killing both families one way or another. The rewards are all the items in the house and the experience earned during the battle - a total of and minor treasure, plus &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Chain%20Mail\"&gt;Elven Chain Mail&lt;/a&gt;. This has little consequence for you, except missing Logan's reward. Logan mourns the loss of two important families who couldn't accept they were both descended from the founders of the city.\nPreemptively solving the feud through murder.\nThere is also a way to make one of the two feuding families both triumph over the other and survive the quest: murdering the head of their families before officially picking a side (Lord Alibakkar will still drop the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Chain%20Mail\"&gt;Elven Chain Mail&lt;/a&gt; and Lady Lurraxol will still have no fixed drops). This is a legitimate way to complete the quest, as the game will even acknowledge it, with the surviving family head rewarding you with (double the amount promised, but never delivered, in other routes) after explaining that the job of finding the mantle is no longer needed.

The quest begins in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%206\"&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/a&gt;. \nAquisition.\nThe party receives this quest and the player's Journal registers the initial entry after the questioning from &lt;a href=\"Elhan\"&gt;Elhan&lt;/a&gt; and verification by the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20War%20Sage\"&gt;Elven War Sages&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough (abbreviated).\nOnce Elhan and Gorion's Ward have finished the elven commander's questioning and dialogue, the party receives &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Elven Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Stake\"&gt;Wooden Stake&lt;/a&gt; supplies to assist with the next objective.\n&lt;a href=\"Suldanessellar\"&gt;Suldanessellar&lt;/a&gt;, an elven city in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Tethir\"&gt;Forest of Tethir&lt;/a&gt;, built amongst the treetops - has seemingly disappeared. This is likely the work of &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;. Elhan is evasive and unwilling to provide much information about why this city was targeted by Irenicus - There is some kind of connection between the elves and whatever power play your antagonist is scheming.\nElhan explains that an elven artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Rhynn%20Lanthorn\"&gt;Rhynn Lanthorn&lt;/a&gt; will surely reveal the now hidden entrance to Suldanessellar - and even Irenicus's dark magic cannot keep the city obscured. He is unsure of the artifact's current location.\nGorion's Ward suspects that &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; has been entrusted with keeping the lanthorn from the elves and has most probably made off with it. Her lair in the catacombs underneath the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Athkatla Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; would be a safe bet for her current refuge.\nElhan makes it clear that getting back the lanthorn from whomever stole it is a must do requirement. Only the lanthorn will allow a way to save the elven city and is necessary to put a stop to whatever Irenicus is plotting there. The party is to find the lanthorn and return it to the elven commander.\nTravel back to Athkatla.\nWhen the party is ready to leave the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Temple%20at%20Underdark%20Exit\"&gt;Elven Temple at Underdark Exit&lt;/a&gt; area and travel, it is recommended to first head towards &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt;. For best plot scripting results choose the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20City%20Gates\"&gt;Athkatla City Gates&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt; as a travel destination. If playing with mods that added locations to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;World Map&lt;/a&gt;, don't visit those at this time. The reason for this is that the scripting functions that trigger the &lt;a href=\"Encounter%20-%20Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Encounter - Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt; may not initiate - and if it doesn't happen at this travel opportunity, then it will never occur later.\nMeet &lt;a href=\"Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssuming the party was able to get the scripting to trigger when travelling for the first time upon leaving Elhan and the elves - the party will be \"waylayed\" with an encounter of Drizzt Do'Urden and his band of allies. See the link for what might transpire. \nThis is an opportunity to potentially recruit some assistance in the upcoming conflict with Bodhi. It can also lead to hostilities, or it can just be a peaceful meeting where both the PC and Drizzt' part ways amicably. The choice rests mostly with the player and how they handle the discourse.\nBack in Athkatla.\nWhen the party returns to the \"City of Coin\" the player can take care of various tasks as desired.\nIt's likely the party has much loot to dispose of and may need to restock supplies. Perhaps certain components found in Chapters 4 and 5 can be put to use with the master smith &lt;a href=\"Cromwell\"&gt;Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Athkatla Docks&lt;/a&gt;. There may be some fresh gear and interesting items available from &lt;a href=\"Ribald%20Barterman\"&gt;Ribald Barterman&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nIf the party is in the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Blade\"&gt;Silver Blade&lt;/a&gt; then moving through the Athkatla districts will trigger a surprise visit from the Githyanki &lt;a href=\"Kruin\"&gt;Kruin&lt;/a&gt;. See his article page for details.\nThere may be open quests sill available for the party to finish off if they wish to do so before tackling Bodhi.\nElhan said that the party could seek allies in the confrontation with Bodhi, from various organizations the party had ties to before. This might mean that &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt; could possibly be a worthwhile visit if the player previously sided with the Shadow Thieves against Bodhi.\nPerhaps the various temple organizations might have some advice or provide help against the vampire coven as well. \nIf the PC is a cleric and has a stronghold at one of the temples, then defiantly explore this option if help is desired.\nDon't travel to the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Athkatla Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; until the party is ready to face Bodhi. The first visit to this district will trigger the event, and it is best done when the party is prepared and ready to do the task.\nAssault Bodhi.\nWhen the party is prepared to undertake the task to face the vampire coven, travel to the graveyard district. Regardless of what time the party does this, it will be nighttime in the graveyard when the party arrives. \nBodhi will intercept the party upon arrival there and initiate dialogue. The player won't be able to control the party or make any actions at all until the dialogue chain is finished. At this time the questline &lt;a href=\"The%20final%20battle%20with%20Bodhi\"&gt;The final battle with Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; is registered in the player's journal. See that article for that part of the quest.\nReturn the lanthorn.\nUpon the defeat of Bodhi, the PC will have possession of the lanthorn and &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Black%20Heart\"&gt;Bodhi's Black Heart&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf applicable, pursue the research and methods necessary to do something about one of the party being afflicted by vampirism, and pursue reviving the PC's lover.\nWhen the player is ready to progress to &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%207\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt;, travel back to speak with Elhan. He'll automatically know if the Rhynn lanthorn was found. Much dialogue will be shared.\nDuring the conversation, Elhan makes mention that he knows that the murderous Bhodi had the lanthorn, which means he knows more than he was letting on before. More dialogue will take place about this, and the PC may be annoyed that Elhan won't give him the full story and background about what exactly Irenicus has against the elves. Elhan basically says that it is not for the party to know this - and mentions that Irenicus is referred to as \"The Exile\", and that he and Bhodi are deemed criminals by their society. \nRegardless of how persistent Gorion's Ward is to get additional info, Elhan refuses to share anymore, saying it is not his place to do so. He says that those involved in the city might be able to provide the answers, and to seek out &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Demin\"&gt;Priestess Demin&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the end, the party will be transported via teleportation to a section of the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Tethir%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Forest of Tethir&lt;/a&gt; - the party and Elhan appear on a massive tree trunk sloping up to a stone cliff face.\nElhan is excited that the lanthorn is abuzz and is able to penetrate Irenicus wards - it will reveal a doorway which leads to &lt;a href=\"Suldanessellar\"&gt;Suldanessellar&lt;/a&gt;. \nElhan says he must see the state of the city himself, and that the party should walk with reverence as one of the few outsiders to visit the place. \nHe then enters the city and bids the party to follow when ready. The party then receives a large experience point reward for fulfilling the questline, to each party member.\nWhen ready to do so, enter through the gateway.\nWhen inside the city after a a cut scene, and a few conversations, this will officially closeout and finish \"The Elven City Requires My Aid \" questline - and registers the beginning of Chapter 7. \nShortly after that a new quest entitled &lt;a href=\"Getting%20Inside%20the%20Palace%20in%20Suldanessellar\"&gt;Getting Inside the Palace in Suldanessellar&lt;/a&gt; is added in the player's journal."}

You can choose to engage him in dialogue or not. Now seven days must pass before he'll attempt the next two-part banter. Again you can talk with him or brush him off. After this 48 more hrs must pass and then have the party head for &lt;a href=\"South%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;South Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\nThe first set of dialogues provides insight into Rasaad's path to becoming a &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Sun Soul&lt;/a&gt; monk and his purpose for coming to &lt;a href=\"Nashkel\"&gt;Nashkel&lt;/a&gt;, which introduces the name of &lt;a href=\"Alorgoth\"&gt;Alorgoth&lt;/a&gt; to the story.\n\"You appear troubled.

The second dialogue gives some background to Rasaad's upbringing with the Sun Soul monks and provides the initial insight as to what helped to drive Gamaz into the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Dark Moon&lt;/a&gt; monks.\n\"Do you seek enlightenment?\"\nRasaad's quest will then advance once you enter South Baldur's Gate with him at least two days later. No matter when you visit the docks (including during daylight hrs), a cut-scene will begin and the time is set to the next midnight. This could prove fatal in some time limited quests, like &lt;a href=\"Eldoth%20and%20Skie\"&gt;Eldoth's quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouth Baldur's Gate.\nUpon entering the area, the time will be advanced to midnight and the party will be confronted by a trio of &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Dark Moon&lt;/a&gt; monks near the docks. Rasaad will identify them as some of the people who attacked him and his brother Gamaz in &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt;, and a fight ensues. Viconia (if in party) will taunt Rasaad after the fight but Rasaad will insist that the party meet &lt;a href=\"Sorrem\"&gt;Sorrem&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20and%20Stars\"&gt;Blade and Stars&lt;/a&gt; tavern to find more clues. Just remember to pick up a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Note\"&gt;Dark Moon Note&lt;/a&gt; before you leave the scene.\nSorrem is found on the second floor of the tavern. He'll try to lure you into a trap if you choose to follow him into the Dark Moon's &lt;a href=\"Generic%20homes%20%28southwest%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%29%23AR1101\"&gt;safe house&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Suns\"&gt;Seven Suns&lt;/a&gt; building in &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Southwest Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; or you can directly kill the thug. Either way be sure to get &lt;a href=\"%20Sorrem%27s%20Note\"&gt;his note&lt;/a&gt; which, when added to your inventory, reveals the location of the &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Peaks\"&gt;Cloud Peaks&lt;/a&gt; mountain range where the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Temple\"&gt;Dark Moon Temple&lt;/a&gt; is located.\nCloud Peaks.\nTravel to the &lt;a href=\"Nashkel%20Mines\"&gt;Nashkel Mines&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gibberling%20Mountains\"&gt;Gibberling Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Tombs\"&gt;Valley of the Tombs&lt;/a&gt; and exit via the eastern (NM) or southern (GM/VT) edge of the areas to obtain access to the Cloud Peaks\u00a0area. Once you arrive and begin to explore the area, the party will first witness a group of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Applicant\"&gt;Dark Moon Applicant&lt;/a&gt;s being berated and attacked by some Dark Moon monks. You can choose to intervene in the ensuing fight to save them for a reward of &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Fiery%20Burning\"&gt;Oil of Fiery Burning&lt;/a&gt; or watch as the monks slaughter them and then turn and attack the party. If you save at least one and kill all the monks it is also possible to extort an extra out of them besides receiving the potion or ask them to join your attack of the Dark Moon shrine.\nThe area is also populated by several &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Troll\"&gt;Snow Troll&lt;/a&gt;s and either spawning &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Wolf\"&gt;Winter Wolves&lt;/a&gt;. A wide, multi-tiered corridor begins near the center bottom of the area and snakes up the eastern side to the entrance of the temple. Four more monks are found near the beginning of the corridor and then two more three tiers up followed by a second pair near the top.\nOnce you have worked your way up to the entrance to the temple, you'll discover that Gamaz, who's been turned by Alorgoth to the worship of &lt;a href=\"Shar\"&gt;Shar&lt;/a&gt;, is still alive and it becomes obvious that the two brothers aren't going to be friends anymore. Following a back and forth dialogue between the two, with occasional interjections by Gorion's Ward, Gamaz will command the six &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Initiates\"&gt;Dark Moon Initiates&lt;/a&gt; who are standing in front of him to attack the party while he darts inside the temple.\nDark Moon Temple.\nThe temple is occupied by Dark Moon monks and initiates. Beware of traps--they are present on both the ground and on a few chests. Continue north through the interior of the temple to find Gamaz near the rear of the temple surrounded by a smattering of monks and initiates. Another dialogue session takes place (before Gamaz runs off again) where Rasaad admits how he held back during their training, but ultimately he cannot convince Gamaz to turn back. Be wary of the &lt;a href=\"fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt; trap near the exit during the fight. Grab the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Big-Fisted%20Belt\"&gt;Big-Fisted Belt&lt;/a&gt; in the locked chest (2200.450) and continue on.\nDark Moon Temple Cave.\nTransition from the temple into the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Temple%20Cave\"&gt;Dark Moon Temple Cave&lt;/a&gt;. In a side chamber you'll meet a pair of caged men named &lt;a href=\"Jasper%20Banff\"&gt;Jasper Banff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bassano\"&gt;Bassano&lt;/a&gt;. Their riddle is classical, the honest solution (besides saving/loading) is to ask one of them \"Which cage will the other prisoner tell me is safe to open?\" then open the cage opposite to the answer received. Bassano turns out to be a Dark Moon monk spy and after going invisible, he will be waiting in the shadows to backstab you near the cages where the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bear\"&gt;Black Bear&lt;/a&gt;s were located (1596.1906).\nNow travel east for the opening to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Temple%20Summit\"&gt;summit&lt;/a&gt; for the final showdown.\nDark Moon Temple Summit.\nNear the Shar statue (they sure are capable of replacing a giant statue fast) the party catches up with Gamaz one last time and a fight is inevitable. Gamaz will fall down when enough damage is dealt, but he won't initiate his final words before his minions are also taken care of. Rasaad's grief is grave but we'll have to loot Gamaz for &lt;a href=\"Glimmering%20Bands\"&gt;Glimmering Bands&lt;/a&gt; and ."}

Every time they attempt to 'get a boat into the water' it's swamped by the rain, two of them were washed away walking to the dock and presumed drowned and now the rest are afraid to go near the water. Since they can't prove to the guards that the priestess is responsible, they ask you to \"take care\" of the problem.\nBefore \u2026.\nRumors about the fishermen's story can be heard from &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Beregost\"&gt;Beregost&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nashkel\"&gt;Nashkel&lt;/a&gt;, and will \u2013 as long as this &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; isn't accepted or declined \u2013 add a farmer's tale to the journal:\nConfronting the Priestess.\nThe priestess, &lt;a href=\"Tenya\"&gt;Tenya&lt;/a&gt;, is located in the northern part of &lt;a href=\"Wyrm%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Wyrm's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. She turns out to be \"a child of no more than twelve.'\nIf you initiate a conversation and tell her that you are going to put an end to her villainous deeds, she will turn hostile and attack. If you ask her for more information about what happened between her and the fishermen or say you know nothing of the fishermen, she will ask you to leave but will not attack.\nIf you speak to her again, she will attack no matter what you say to her. She must be provoked to violent action for the quest to advance. She often casts &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt; at the start of battle, so it may be best to use some ranged weapons against her. She is not very dangerous, even to very low-level parties. Once you bring her near death, she will surrender and explain that she is trying to avenge her mother's death.\nAccording to Tenya, the fishermen are the villains.\u00a0They stole her mother's &lt;a href=\"Bowl%20of%20Water%20Elemental%20Control\"&gt;elemental summoning bowl&lt;/a&gt; and tortured her for its secrets before killing her. Now, they use it to pillage the seas. Tenya begs &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and their party to help her recover the bowl. You can promise to help her, or kill her and collect your reward from the fishermen. Both Tenya and the fishermen are evil-aligned.\nCompletion and Outcomes.\nHelping Tenya.\nGo back to the fishermen and talk to &lt;a href=\"Telman\"&gt;Telman&lt;/a&gt;. Let him know that priestess told you her side of the story. &lt;a href=\"Sonner\"&gt;Sonner&lt;/a&gt; will try to persuade you stay on their side. Refuse his offer and Sonner will explain how they made arrangements with priest of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; for safe passage at sea.\u00a0Part of the deal was extracting a little \"payback\" from &lt;a href=\"Umberlee\"&gt;Umberlee&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen threatened, Sonner and he will give up the bowl. It is also possible to pickpocket the bowl from Sonner.\nOnce you have the bowl, return it to Tenya to complete the quest. She will give you nothing for your effort, but promises the favor of Umberlee and help in the future - a promise she will grudgingly make good on during the quest &lt;a href=\"Tremain%27s%20Son\"&gt;Tremain's Son&lt;/a&gt;. (Of course, if you kill her before she teleports away, you won't be able to meet her in the future [at least in BGEE 2.6.6]) \nReward: if you did not kill the fishermen, if you did; plus a \"favor\" &lt;a href=\"Tremain%27s%20Son\"&gt;you may use later&lt;/a&gt;. Once you return to the fishermen all three of them will be gone. Killing the fishermen gets you meager experience points, and &lt;a href=\"Flail%20%2B1\"&gt;Flail +1&lt;/a&gt; hovewer the Flail can also be pickpocketed(50) from Sonner. You can also pickpocket(80) &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20of%20Defense%20AC%207\"&gt;Bracers of Defense AC 7&lt;/a&gt; from Tenya.\nHelping the Fishermen.\nEven if you intend to kill Tenya, it is best to speak with the &lt;a href=\"fishermen\"&gt;fishermen&lt;/a&gt; again to gain an additional &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Piece\"&gt;monetary&lt;/a&gt; reward. When you tell them that you spoke with Tenya, they will admit to having killed her mother and making a deal with the god &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; for his protection on the sea. They will then offer you 50 or to kill Tenya, depending on your dialog choices. If you pressured them into paying you more earlier, your reward can rise up to . Once you have spoken with the fishermen again, return to Tenya and kill her. Her &lt;a href=\"Priest%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, especially Entangle, will probably be exhausted as long as you have not rested since fighting her. Once she is dead, she can be looted for &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20of%20Defense%20AC%207\"&gt;Bracers of Defense AC 7&lt;/a&gt; and a common &lt;a href=\"flail\"&gt;flail&lt;/a&gt;. There are no reputation penalties for killing Tenya.\nAfter reporting her death to the fishermen, &lt;a href=\"Sonner\"&gt;Sonner&lt;/a&gt; will reward you with his &lt;a href=\"flail%20%2B1\"&gt;flail +1&lt;/a&gt;. He also gives you gold, if you asked for some earlier or made clear that their offer wasn't enough.\nReward: between 0 and , Bracers of Defense AC 7, &lt;a href=\"flail%20%2B1\"&gt;flail +1&lt;/a&gt;, flail, ."}

Your dialogue with the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist%20Enforcer%20%28Siege%20of%20Dragonspear%29\"&gt;Flaming Fist Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; after the battle can provide an important clue for this quest: if you ask whether Korlasz was acting alone, he will tell you that the only other cell is occupied by a &lt;a href=\"doppelganger\"&gt;doppelganger&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you approach the northernmost door in the basement of the Ducal Palace, a voice will call out to you from behind it.

When he is near death, he will call for mercy and offer a reward in exchange for his life. Alternatively, you can have this discussion without a fight if you had learned the truth and let him know about it before opening his cell.\nHe will promise a veritable fortune beneath the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Throne\"&gt;Iron Throne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Throne%20Headquarters\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; if you meet him there. With less than 9 intelligence you can humorously ask him what \"veritable\" means. You now have the choice of letting him go, locking him back in his cell, or killing him.\nIf you let him go, travel to the basement of the Iron Throne building. The doppelganger will be waiting for you in the northern corner, and will give you the items he promised.

What would you wish to play for?\nSelect one of these responses:\nThe first card draw.\nWhen the character decides to engage in play with the cambion, they aren't sure how many draws of the cards will be allowed. But, this can be figured out with dialogue. In the end, there can be either one, two, or three card draws depending on the choices made by the character. Below are the choices and potential outcomes for the first card draw.\nPlaying for: The gem.\nIf the character selects this option, then this will be the final gambling card draw allowed. In other words, no matter the outcome, the Spectral Brand and the wish scroll won't be offered again. Assuming the character commits to do this then Aesgareth says:\nHe then says a variable line depending on which card is drawn (determined by script, which has a 50% chance either the \"&lt;a href=\"Strife%20%28card%29\"&gt;Strife (card)&lt;/a&gt;\" card or the \"&lt;a href=\"Plague%20%28card%29\"&gt;Plague (card)&lt;/a&gt;\"). Note that Strife will expose the character to a modified &lt;a href=\"Slow%20effect\"&gt;Slow effect&lt;/a&gt; at this time, with a visual effect animation. The \"Plague\" card exposes the character to &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constituition attribute&lt;/a&gt; curse.\nAfter this Aesgareth says:\nThe cambion then reveals which card it pulled, with \"&lt;a href=\"Triumph%20%28card%29\"&gt;Triumph (card)&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Construct%20%28card%29\"&gt;Construct (card)&lt;/a&gt;\". The Triumph card summons some warriors which attack Aesgareth, and the Construct summons an Adamantine Golem. The cambion and allies will fight and destroy the creatures. Aesgareth then says:\nThe cambion will now reveal who won. He may say:\n is awarded, and acquisition of the final gem will also trigger the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20Gem\"&gt;Scepter Gem&lt;/a&gt;. Aesgareth will then say:\nThe cambion and servants will now attack the party. Additionally, the player's Journal updates, as follows:\nIf the cambion wins the draw, then he will ask for the Holy Symbol, but promises you the gem and he'll return the scepter as well. The party can either provide the holy symbol, at which point Aesgareth says a farewell and the fiends leave the area (in a mini cut scene). The cambion keeps his word and gives you the gem and returns the holy symbol. The player's Journal will update:\nOr the party can refuse to give up the Holy symbol, which leads to a disappointed remark, and then hostilities.\nPlaying for: Spectral Brand.\nIf the character selects playing for the Spectral Brand, then the same dynamic outlined in the gem choice above is used on the first card draw.\nThe main difference is what the character wagers. If the \"way out of here\" is selected, and the player loses, then the Spectral Brand is not won, and the cambion wins, and asks for the Holy symbol. The character provides it, and Aesgareth leaves the area. If it isn't provided, then hostilities commence.\nOn the other hand, if the player wins the draw, then the Spectral Brand is received as well as . \nAesgareth will say:\nIf the player wagers their Experience or Vitality, then the player can win or lose the draw. If the player wins, the prize is received and the cambion extends the invitation to play another draw.\nIf the player loses the draw, then Aesgareth says:\nPlaying for: The wish scroll.\nThere is no difference in this dynamic except for the prize. The process is essentially the same as playing for the Spectral Brand. \nIf the character loses the draw the same conclusion is reached. The character's wagered \"Experience\" or \"Vitality\" is claimed.\nIf the character wins the draw, then the scroll of &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; is received and awarded.\nWhen ready, approach the cambion for the second draw.\nThe second card draw.\nSelect a party member to play Aesgareth for the second card draw. Approach and speak to the cambion to initiate this.\nAs this is the second draw, the character offers a wager, either \"play for a way out\" or \"Experience\" or \"Vitality\".\nNext, select what is to be played for, either the \"gem\" or the Spectral Brand/wish scroll. If the player already has one of these from the first draw, then it won't appear as a prize.\nThe character draws a card. There is an even chance of drawing the \"&lt;a href=\"Guile%20%28card%29\"&gt;Guile (card)&lt;/a&gt;\" or the \"&lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28card%29\"&gt;Strength (card)&lt;/a&gt;\" card. Whichever one is drawn; the card's effect takes place at this time.\nNext, the cambion draws a card. There is an even chance of drawing the \"&lt;a href=\"Defiance%20%28card%29\"&gt;Defiance (card)&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Empress%20%28card%29\"&gt;Empress (card)&lt;/a&gt;\" card. Whichever one is drawn; the card's effect takes place at this time.\nThe highest suit card wins the draw. If the character wins, they receive their prize. If the cambion wins, then it collects the wager of either \"Experience\" or \"Vitality\". If the gem was wagered, then then it is the same as explained on the first draw section above.\nThe third card draw.\nThe player selects a party member to approach and speak with Aesgareth.\nThe cambion will say:\nThe character can choose from three responses:\nThe second or third reply will lead to a hostile reaction from Aesgareth, and fight will commence.\nAgreeing to the stakes and playing another round of cards will begin with the character drawing the first card, and then the cambion. By agreeing the party earns each.\nThe character has an even chance of drawing either the \"&lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20%28card%29\"&gt;High Priestess (card)&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28card%29\"&gt;Emperor (card)&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAlas, the script for the game disallows a chance to win for the player, and Aesgareth will always have the higher suit \"&lt;a href=\"Wheel%20%28card%29\"&gt;Wheel (card)&lt;/a&gt;\". He'll exclaim:\nThe character can choose from two responses:\nProviding the Holy symbol to the cambion allows cambion and servant group to leave the area. Aesgareth bids thanks and departs with the servants via a short cut scene. The gem and symbol are returned to Gorion's Ward as promised. This will most likely result in the automatic restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Radiance\"&gt;Scepter of Radiance&lt;/a&gt;, and for each party member.\nNot giving Aesgareth the prize results in a hostile reaction, and a fight will break out.\nThe final Journal entries are now trimmed down and are resolved, leaving only one in the player's Journal. The quest is complete.\nWith possession of the restored scepter, the party may now escape the maze through the portal."}

The first time you enter &lt;a href=\"The%20Zephir\"&gt;The Zephir&lt;/a&gt; Inn, &lt;a href=\"Marlowe\"&gt;Marlowe&lt;/a&gt; will approach you and ask to meet in his house to discuss a problem he faces.\nWhen you enter Marlowe's home, which is actually labelled as &lt;a href=\"Empty%20Home%20%28Amkethran%29\"&gt;Empty Home (Amkethran)&lt;/a&gt;, the party has to decide if they will hear his tale, or tell him they aren't interested, or that you are actually going to kill Marlowe. If you decide to hear his tale, he will say he is a merchant from &lt;a href=\"Calimshan\"&gt;Calimshan&lt;/a&gt;. He will also mention that a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Vongoethe\"&gt;Vongoethe&lt;/a&gt; has stolen his daughter's soul and that the undead being is likely trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Cave of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. Your party can ask for more details and inquire about why a lich would be hunting Marlowe, and some further information can be gained. In the end, you either agree to help or you don't. If you agree, then Marlowe explains that he has spent the last of his coin to bribe a Monk who prevents access to the Cave. He has only to give the word to the Monk, and then your party will be allowed to enter the Cavern.\nSo, at your earliest convenience, travel to speak with the monk positioned near the cavern entrance. The Monk says \"\"You're the one Marlowe wants me to let in? Ilmater's patience! *sigh* I'll likely get in huge trouble for this, but a deal's a deal, I suppose. Go on in the cavern, I'll be elsewhere\".\" The monk will then hurry off, and you may enter the cavern.\nAfter entering the cavern, the lich will quickly rise from the center of the circular raised platform and address you, saying \"Ahhh...I had sensed that one with great power was close by, And here you are, come to my little prison. What do you wish, godling? Vongoethe has no quarrel with you!\". \nThere are a few replies that you could choose. One of which is to initiate hostilities and prepare to destroy the Lich. Or you can try and get more information to find out what is going on. There is the demanding tone and the calmer tone offered. It appears that the lich really does not want to fight you, as he recognizes your power, but it also clarifies that Marlowe has lied to you, and that he has a contract and a debt to collect from Marlowe, who has reneged paying it. A strange debt involving promising the Lich his very soul in return for twenty years of prosperity and good fortune. When the lich confronted Marlowe that the debt was due, Marlowe refused. The lich then took the soul of his wife to force Marlowe to surrender his soul voluntarily as promised. Yet Marlowe refused, and then his wife sickened and died. Marlowe fled again with his daughter &lt;a href=\"Malla\"&gt;Malla&lt;/a&gt;. The lich tracked them down and was able to force Malla's soul into a \"soul stone'. Just like his now dead wife, the lich has done this to force Marlowe to surrender his soul - or his daughter will eventually die as well. This is the reason Marlow's daughter is bedridden and ill. \nThe lich wraps up his version of events by saying \"\"He evaded me for years until I found him here! I have his daughter's soul now, and he will live up to his promise, or she shall suffer the consequences! He had his desire... and now I want mine\".\"\nOnce again you have choices available to you through dialogue. You find out through dialogue that if you raise a hand against the lich, then Malla will perish. You may tell the lich that no one else will be harmed and attack him anyway - See the Gameplay - Fighting the Lich section below. You may tell the lich that you will not bring Marlow to him, and just leave. If you do this Malla will perish, but Marlowe will not. You may also ask a few questions, and then agree to get Marlowe and bring him to the Lich. The lich has promised that he will give the soul stone to you if you bring Marlow to him. Once you have the soulstone, you can do whatever you wish with it, including healing Malla if you want.\nIf you decide to get Marlowe, then leave the cavern and travel back to his home. Once back with Marlowe, a series of back and forth dialogue occurs, and Marlowe comes clean and admits everything. He seems truly sorry for his misdeads and poor judgement. He does not want his daughter to perish, like his wife did. He agrees to face his fate and will go with you back to face the lich's debt collection. A cutscene will now play and the party and Marlowe are standing on the platform with Vongoethe back in the Cavern.\nThe lich addresses marlowe and eventually wants to know if he freely gives up his soul to him as he promised. Marlow answers, and agrees - resigned to his fate and knowing that the soulstone will be given to the Gorion's Ward. The lich then says \"\"Most Excellent. As I live up to my bargains, here is the mortal girl's soul, godling. Take it and begone. Now, for what is long overdue, Marlowe\"...\" Your inventory now receives &lt;a href=\"Malla%27s%20Soul%20Stone\"&gt;Malla's Soul Stone&lt;/a&gt; and the information screen displays \"The Party Has Gained An item\".\nThe party has dialogue options and choices of action. They are as follows:\nGameplay - Fighting the Lich.\nThe lich and a number of assisting undead and Banshees manifest to destroy the party. Two &lt;a href=\"Banshee\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;s and two &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; Warriors will be on the platform with the lich. Five Skeleton archers will fire missiles at those in range from the edges of the room, some on the balcony. The lich will quickly get up a few rapidly cast protection spells, and possibly bring in a Simulacrum of himself. If not interrupted, the lich will probably try and cast a time stop and other level 8 and 9 spells. Note that the Banshees may be a problem for party members who are not protected against instant &lt;a href=\"Slay\"&gt;Slay&lt;/a&gt; effects or miss a saving throw vs. Death, as they have a &lt;a href=\"Wail%20of%20the%20Banshee\"&gt;Wail of the Banshee&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nIt is up to you if you want to activate any of the pedestals on the raised platform during the battle. It may provide an advantage, confusion for your enemies or it could be a poor tactical choice.\nIf unlucky, Marlowe can be killed by accidental friendly fire, or even by the Lich's AoE spells. Some players have reported that protecting him with a &lt;a href=\"Otiluke%27s%20Resilient%20Sphere\"&gt;Otiluke's Resilient Sphere&lt;/a&gt; is a good choice to avoid mishaps.\nMod Content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod provides a much more responsive and smarter script to Vongoethe and the allied creatures assisting him. Also, it ups the numbers of Skeleton Archers to about 12. The Skeleton Warriors are more efficient in their melee attacks with weapon proficiencies and are protected from &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=\"Vongoethe\"&gt;Vongoethe&lt;/a&gt; creature page for more SCS stats to the lich. Expect an instant battery of buffs from the lich (Stoneskin, PFMW, Spell Trap, Protection from Fire and Magical Energy and Spell Shield), followed a few seconds later by Immunity Divination and Improved Invisibility. A Simulacrum will be attempted as well. If the simulacrum appears, the clone will also instantly cast a number of defensive buffs. Then later, the lich will try a Time Stop. Mage HLA's will be used against the party as well. It should be a challenging battle. The key to defeating him will be to survive the Timestop, with Improved Alacrity and multiple offensive actions, and then strip its defensive buffs. As a level 30 Necromancer, Vongoethe will have a powerful Remove Magic, and Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting attack. \nTrivia.\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe was a German poet and writer whose work includes the epic play Faust, in which a deal with the devil (Mephisto) is made about a soul in return to eternal life, The idea for of that plot was derived from the earlier work of English playwright Christopher Marlowe, who again used German folk stories as a source. Thus, Vongoethe vs Marlowe with Margarete (Gretchen) alias Malia."}

The group has the following members:\nGameplay.\nWords exchanged between Tarnor and you may lead to conflict. If the party wished to avoid bloodshed, a payment of gold can be made, otherwise expect an axe splitting party member skulls. At the stage of the saga where you will first encounter this party of thuggish adventurers, it's likely that you do not match up in experience. This may mean that you will find it difficult to go toe to toe and slug it out with this group. But there are tactics that can even the odds or even give you the advantage, such as:\nScout ahead under stealth, sanctuary, or invisibility, and pin-point the group, before they see one of your party and trigger any conversation. If done correctly, you can then move your scout(s) back out of their sight, and prepare your party for battle. You can set an ambush, lay snares and traps, perhaps a glyph. You can cast buffs or drink some potions, and summon creatures to help you. And then you can confront The Hatchetman's Party when you're ready. You can entice their fighters to give chase after you and lead them into your prepared ambush.\nYou can also preemptively attack by surprise with anything you've got before they see you - you don't have to speak with Tarnor before you decide to attack this group. Launch a cloudkill or let loose of a fireball (or do both) while you're stll out if their sight, send forward some summoned creatures, discharge several bolts of lightning from a wand (and be prepared for a bounce back in the sewers!). \nThe AI in an unmodded game is somewhat inflexible, and you can gain an advantage by moving your party in and out of their sight and launch area of effect spells and missiles. It's not as challenging, but is an effective tactic. Don't do that if you want to test your mettle, and beat the group \"fair and square\", as they say. It's up to you.\nOf course, if you want a fairer challenge, then see how you fare by just advancing your party within sight of Tarnor and company, with your \"tanks\" at the front, and your missile firing support members and casters at the back. When hostilities break out, go into action as best as you can. If you know what you're doing, it's not a particularly hard fight (but that also depends on difficulty settings and mods). \nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod will mean that this group is better able to deal with being ambushed by the party. It could mean that an invisible scout is detected due to a Invisibility Purge or Oracle Spell scripted for use if approached by a hidden party member. The spell casters will have pre-cast spell contingencies which trigger immediately upon hostilities. The enemies will summon help in the form of Aerial Servant, Animated Dead and a Mordenkainen's Sword. A cloud spell can be dispersed by one of the Clerics. The AI is better at chasing down attackers who are darting in and out of visual range. The enemy is just smarter in general."}

Depending on dialogue choices you can either brush off their questions (which will send them hostile) or tell them that you aren't here to hurt their master if you're not looking for a fight.\nIn his cabin, Valygar tells you that he killed the Cowled Wizards out of self-defense because they needed him, dead or alive, to access the &lt;a href=\"The%20Planar%20Sphere\"&gt;The Planar Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, which was created by his ancestor, a Necromancer named &lt;a href=\"Lavok%20Corthala\"&gt;Lavok&lt;/a&gt;.

So long as the player does not choose dialog that instead causes Minsc to leave the party, he will direct them to return to the Docks.\nMinsc's Strength is reduced to 10 until he retrieves &lt;a href=\"Boo\"&gt;Boo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe person Minsc is looking for is a young boy named \"Billy\", who appears outside of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%27s%20Bounty%20Tavern\"&gt;Sea's Bounty Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. Upon seeing him, Minsc angrily demands that he return Boo, and Billy will flee through the door into the upper room of the Sea's Bounty, seeking safety from some rough sailors, led by a man named Vivick.\nIf the party is not diplomatic, Vivick and company will attack.\nWhilst Billy demands 50000 gold pieces for Boo's return, &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; can instead appeal to his protector, Vivick, to control him. Whilst the player can pay him 50 or 500 gold pieces, the easiest way is to point out that Minsc is a hugely strong and mentally unhinged berserker. Recognizing that it's probably best to give the crazy thug back his precious pet before he goes into a killing rage, Vivick makes Billy explain what he did.\nBilly explains he sold Boo to a halfling petshop owner named Smethy, and leads the party there before running off. Smethy calmly explains he bought Boo from Billy for 1 gold piece, but then sold him for 50 gold pieces to a young girl from the Government district named Eleana. If the party is polite, he teleports them there directly so they can see about retrieving Boo.\nEleanya can be found at the lone fountain, just south-west of the Government Park square to which Smethy teleports the party. If the party insults her too grievously, or threatens her with violence, she blasts Gorion's Ward with a five-bolt Magic Missile spell and then runs off, letting four De'Lyl guards try and \"discipline\" the party for her. When the party slays them, she will surrender and, chiding the party about killing four men for the sake of a hamster, return Boo, giving the party 15000 EXP. Alternatively, a diplomatic party can agree to play Eleanya's riddling game for ownership of Boo.\nGet only one riddle correct and the party will be rewarded with 10000 EXP. Plus the return of Boo.\nGet at least two riddles correct and the party will be rewarded with 15000 EXP and the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Hound\"&gt;Jade Hound&lt;/a&gt; figurine, which can summon an Astral Hound to fight at the party's side once per day.\u00a0Plus the return of Boo.\nGet all three correct, and the party will be rewarded with 20000 EXP and Minsc will gain the ability \"Boolets\", which lets him summon a hamster once per day. Plus the return of Boo.\nGet all answers wrong, and you get no EXP, but Boo is returned to you.\nOnce the noblewoman leaves, one way or the other, two Cowled Enforcers will teleport in and thank you for getting rid of the arrogant wench. They will also ask if you have a magic license; if not, they will grant you one, otherwise they give you 1000 gold pieces.\u00a0"}

It is referred to as an \"Elder Brain\" in a few lines of text and dialogue. An Elder Brain is a type of illithid, as is an Alhoon or Ulitharid.\nThe brain has no physical attacks. It is also limited to only a couple of scripted actions. It can attack opponents in its detection range with &lt;a href=\"Ego%20Whip\"&gt;Ego Whip&lt;/a&gt;, and it has a scripted ability to manifest actual &lt;a href=\"Brain%20Golem\"&gt;Brain Golem&lt;/a&gt; allied guardians to defend against attackers within its chamber.\nThe Master Brain will create two Brain golems initially, and an additional single golem every 45 game seconds. This stops if the creature is destroyed.\nRelated Quests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Drow%20Summoning%20Ritual\"&gt;The Drow Summoning Ritual&lt;/a&gt; - this quest will imply that a certain item, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Brain%20Blood\"&gt;Elder Brain Blood&lt;/a&gt;, is needed in order to fulfill a task for &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nThe creature's alignment was changed from Chaotic Evil to Lawful Evil in the Enhanced Edition.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises the creature by changing the brain's class to mage and raising it to level 20. No other ability changes are made to its characteristics or abilities/immunities. In terms of the AI script however, SCS does make considerable modifications.\nWhen a party member first enters the chamber, the combat screen will display:\nThis attack will expose all party members to the Ego Whip affect, regardless of where they may be on the area map, even if currently undetected and elsewhere.\nThe brain is now scripted and able to apply the following &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; attacks at detected opponents: Psionic Disjunction, Psionic Domination, Psionic Maze, Detonate and Ballistic Attack.\nThe Master brain is able to recognize certain player protections from spells and specific equipped items which typically shield against psionic attacks. This creature can selectively attack with any of the provided psionic abilities or change to a less protected target if available. There is no single spell, innate ability, scroll, potion or item in the basic game which can protect against all of SCS's psionic abilities on their own.\nThe brain also summons the same Brain Golem allies as the unmodified game and will continue to summon one every 45 game seconds until it is destroyed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a found item that can be recovered from the dead Master Brain - this item is called \"Brain Tissue\" which is a component for the party spell caster to create its own variety of Brain Golem to manufacture and have as a party-controlled allied creature."}

Its first attack is a &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; with a high penalty to your saving throws, which can easily knock out a few of your party members (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt;, a 12th Level &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Hunter\"&gt;Bounty Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving Throw&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Posion&lt;/a&gt; of 10 [including a -1 bonus from &lt;a href=\"The%20Protector\"&gt;The Protector&lt;/a&gt;], still failed to save even on a roll of 17). Continuing around the bend of the hallway you see a window grate through which you can peer down to the room below. To reach that area, double back and take the other hallway (now to your right).\nTaking the southeast hall becomes your only option, at this stage.\nDoor to the Inner Chambers.\nOn the north side of the Entrance Hall there is a door to the Inner Chambers. It has an unconventional lock and is warded against simple spells. It leads to the Lair of the Cult Outcasts. Both of these features are marked on the player's map of The Old Tunnels.\nSquare Room and Bridge Room.\nThe Southeast hall leads first to a seemingly empty square room, and then to a circular room with a rickety wooden bridge (which you may have sighted before from the window grate above).\nAt the far side of the Square Room, is a silent trigger that spawns four &lt;a href=\"Ettercap\"&gt;Ettercaps&lt;/a&gt; behind you in the square room. Directly on the other side of this trigger, is a trap right before the bridge, as well as five &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: It is possible to cross the silent trigger with a Stealthie character without stepping on the trap ahead of it. Reversing course back into the square room is what will set off the silent trigger, thus spawning the Ettercaps. In this way, you can first fight the Ettercaps, then the Shadows independently. Otherwise it can be a battle to face both groups simultaneously.\nAcross the Bridge Room is another hallway leading to the next area, and two more Shadows.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Unfinished Business (Baldur's Gate II)&lt;/a&gt; mod in place, the ettercaps are replaced by fire breathing Hell Hounds, which is restored original Bioware content.\nThe Gas Chamber.\nThis circular room has a walkway around the edges to a single door at the far end of the chamber. A walkway extends out into the middle of the room, where you find a large wheel-valve, its function, as yet, unknown.\nAcross nearly all of the center of the room is an undetectable trap that is triggered if you try to cross to your right (north) or if you get too close to the wheel-valve in the center. It is possible to avoid the trigger if you cross the room on your your left, while hugging the wall. Otherwise the trap is sprung, and you see the following status message:\"As you near the center of the room, the doors clang shut and you hear the hiss of gas. An orange cloud begins to fill the now sealed chamber.\"Two &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Mist\"&gt;Vampiric Mists&lt;/a&gt;, capable of &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level Drain&lt;/a&gt;, also spawn on the far side of the chamber, flanking the door to the next area, and will attack even a stealthed thief. Further, a &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; is launched from the north wall of the room.\nClicking on the wheel-valve one time gives you a clue on how to escape:\"There is a wheel in the middle of this chamber. Perhaps turning it will reveal its function.\"Whether you use the wheel or not, once the duration of the Cloudkill has expired, the doors open, allowing passage to the other side.\nEntrance to the Cult Domain.\nThis small square room has a magic sigil on its floor. &lt;a href=\"Gaal\"&gt;Gaal&lt;/a&gt; and two of his &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Guard\"&gt;Elite Guard&lt;/a&gt; stand ready challenge and will try to convince you to join the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Eyeless\"&gt;Cult of the Eyeless&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs already outlined in the &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20and%20Destroy%20the%20Cult%20of%20the%20Eyeless\"&gt;Investigate and Destroy the Cult of the Eyeless&lt;/a&gt; quest walkthrough page, &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20and%20Destroy%20the%20Cult%20of%20the%20Eyeless%23Confronting%20Gaal\"&gt;Confronting Gaal&lt;/a&gt; by attacking him before he initiates dialog will result in losing &lt;a href=\"Gaal%27s%20Key\"&gt;Gaal's Key&lt;/a&gt; that allows access to the lower levels, closing off those areas permanently (same if you already killed him in the Temple District). Furthermore, his \"god\" will show up, perhaps forcing you to kill it as well. Doing so will permanently close off the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20the%20Faithless\"&gt;Bottom of the Pit of the Faithless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Town\"&gt;Ghoul Town&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Hideout\"&gt;Beholder Hideout&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, you will not be able to join the two parts to the Rift Device Rod that can free the Avatar of &lt;a href=\"Amaunator\"&gt;Amaunator&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"The%20Diseased%20One\"&gt;Diseased Ones&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention much loss of experience points and treasure.\nTalking to Gaal is not strictly necessary to complete the quest. Killing both him and his \"god\" will allow you to go back to the priest who gave you the quest in order to complete it and receive your reward. However, in so doing you lose much of the story, experience, and treasure that you would have gained otherwise.\nApproach Gaal and he will initiate dialog:\"Hold, you tread on sacred ground! Only those who serve the Unseeing Eye may enter. I am Gaal, High Priest of the One God.\"You can reply \"I'll go where I like, priest\" or ask him about the cult. He will want you to join, which requires losing your \"orbs and their poisonous sight\" by which he means your eyes. However, he also wants you to retrieve a \"Holy Artifact\" (a rod) from the \"Lower Places\" (the level below the Old Tunnels). Ask how to join the cult without becoming \"Eyeless\" and he will give you the key to the lower levels.\nChoosing the \"peaceful\" route allows you to talk to his followers and learn more about the Cult, the \"Lower Places,\" the \"Holy Artifact\" that the Unseeing Eye wants to retrieve, and the \"Pit of the Faithless.\"\nIf at any time you attack Gaal or his followers, the whole cult will turn hostile, and their \"god\" will appear in the Pit of the Faithless. Combat will also begin if you answer, \"I...am your death! I can take no more of this!\" to one of Gaal's &lt;a href=\"Cult%20Guard\"&gt;Cultist Guard&lt;/a&gt; who says, \"Hold! Identify yourself, Pilgrim!\"\nPit of the Faithless.\nIf you chose the \"peaceful\" option with Gaal, you may enter the chamber beyond him without his cultists attacking. Here you find the top of the pit where there are living chambers for the faithful.\n Another cut-scene ensues, where one &lt;a href=\"cultist\"&gt;cultist&lt;/a&gt; asks a second cultist if he is ready to \"revoke the weakness of the sighted... the false power of sight and embrace the true vision of Holy Blindness?\" After this scene, you will witness an Elite Guard executing and then casting the unworthy cultist down to his death at the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20the%20Faithless\"&gt;Bottom of the Pit of the Faithless&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou may explore the rest of the area, talk to the cultists, and if you like, raid their living quarters, which are accessed via stairs that lead up from the catwalk that encircles the pit.\nLair of the Cult Outcasts and The Lower Reaches.\nWhen you have received &lt;a href=\"Gaal%27s%20Key\"&gt;Gaal's Key&lt;/a&gt;, and finish exploring the Pit of the Faithless, head back to the Entrance Hall and open the Door to the Inner Chambers.\nAfter a trapped hallway you find a cult outcast, &lt;a href=\"Sassar\"&gt;Sassar&lt;/a&gt; in a strange hall dominated by a sarcophagus in the center. Sassar has a lot more to tell you about the cult, its god, and the rod Gaal wants. He agrees that you should retrieve the rod, but \"not\" for Gaal. For more detail on Sassar and the information he has for you, see the page for Sassar.\nIn the room to the right of Sassar are two more cult outcasts, &lt;a href=\"Zaelas\"&gt;Zaelas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garuk\"&gt;Garuk&lt;/a&gt;, who have been assisting him to \"research the rod below.\" They thank you for your help but have little else to say. There are also two locked chests in this room that you can pilfer.\nSassar warns the party not to disturb the sarcophagus, as he senses a &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Lich\"&gt;great evil&lt;/a&gt; emanating from it, and he wants he and his friends to remain safe. Beyond the sarcophagus is a trapped hallway with two &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Wraith\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fiend\"&gt;Shadow Fiend&lt;/a&gt;. A secret door to the right is locked with an unconventional lock and warded against simple spells.\nAt the end of the hall is another circular room, this time with a stairway down to the next level, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Reaches\"&gt;The Lower Reaches&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntrance to the Lair of the Unseeing Eye.\nAt the moment, prior to obtaining the first half of the Rift Device, this area is simply a small circular pit with a short walkway to the center, off to the west of the larger, Pit of the Unfaithful.\nAccess to the Bottom of the Pit of the Unfaithful will be closed until you return from The Lower Reaches with the first part of the Rift Device. Speak to Sassar and he will tell you who to speak to in order to proceed further."}

Proceed with clearing out the building as described above. When you are finished, exit the building and you will be approached by &lt;a href=\"Laola%20Axehand\"&gt;Laola Axehand&lt;/a&gt; who will admonish you for acting without first consulting Scar.\nGo speak to Scar in the Flaming Fist Headquarters and tell him everything that happened. He will not be too disappointed that you acted before consulting him, and will reward you accordingly:\nIf &lt;a href=\"Jhasso\"&gt;Jhasso&lt;/a&gt; is still alive:\nOtherwise:\nRewards.\nTo maximize your rewards on this quest, simply make sure all the Doppelgangers are dead and that Jhasso lives. If you do both of these things, whether you initially report to Scar or not you will receive the maximum possible reward.\nIf you intend to save Jhasso, all reporting to Scar does is split the rewards he gives you between the two visits.\nThe worst outcome is to abandon the quest after first learning about the Doppelgangers, and the second worst outcome is to kill everyone including Jhasso without reporting to Scar first, which will net you fewer XP, gold, and no reputation."}

Also, Garrick will come to his senses and will ask to join your party if you speak with him. If you turn him down, he will depart and further recruitment becomes impossible, so if there's a chance you'll desire his company in the future, merely don't initiate dialogue until the time is right, as he will remain standing outside the\u00a0Red Sheaf seemingly indefinitely or accept him and kick him off, you can recruit him later at any time.\nAlternatively you can attack Silke and then kill the merchants anyway, without talking to them, for a total of , a Quarterstaff +1, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Potion of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, 3x Potion of Defense, and the gems, with no Reputation loss \u2014 in this case, however, Garrick will not be available as a companion, even if not all three of the merchants are killed and one of them rewards you in the end. Garrick will say: \"You're no better than Ms. Silke! It will catch up with you one day, mark my words.\" and leave."}

One way to stop this from happening is to hit her with a guaranteed-damage spell or ability (such as &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Ram\"&gt;Ring of the Ram&lt;/a&gt; or a cleric's &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Bolt of Glory&lt;/a&gt;), shortly after she summons support, in order to disrupt her spell. She likes to cast &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, but a group of two or three high-level warriors hasted and using &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Greater Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; can cut through her defenses and take her down quickly. Worth noting: Amelyssan's Stoneskin spell is treated as a Spell Protection, mechanically, rather than a Combat Protection. That means Breach doesn't touch it, but do. \nAfter the first battle, you can lay &lt;a href=\"Set%20Spike%20Trap\"&gt;Spike Traps&lt;/a&gt; at the same spot she started at. A maximum of 4 will be enough to win the battle without a fight. If you don't have enough traps to survive all of the battles, have a &lt;a href=\"Exploits%23Clones\"&gt;Clone&lt;/a&gt; set the traps for you. If you don't have spike traps, you can use snares instead; they will still damage her, making the battle easier, but won't do enough damage to skip the battle entirely.\nIf you are in dire need of a rest, there is a way to regain spell slots and daily item abilities while in the final battle. Using the 9th level spell &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; (in conjunction with a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Insight\"&gt;Potion of Insight&lt;/a&gt; if needed), one can repeatedly wish until the &lt;a href=\"Wish%23Make%20it%20as%20if%20the%20entire%20party%20has%20just%20rested%20a%20full%20night%20and%20rememorized%20all%20their%20spells.\"&gt;option appears&lt;/a&gt; to have the party be restored as if they had rested for 8 hours. This option has a 20% chance to show up, so it is advisable to cast it multiple times from &lt;a href=\"Project%20Image\"&gt;Project Image&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, if possible with scrolls of Wish, in order to remove most of the randomness."}

Atop the steps is seen the &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Handmaiden\"&gt;Overseer Handmaiden&lt;/a&gt;, whilst below on the platform proper is a trapped Genie, and four drow mages (identified and labelled as \"Drow torturer\". These drow are periodically casting damage dealing spells at the poor creature, ostensibly as part of some kind of training exercise being administered by the Overseer. Occasional oathes and shouts of pain and protest are audible, as well as laughter and shouts of encouragement from the participating drow mages. This is some kind of organized activity and cruel indeed.\nChoices.\nIf the party has observed the torture lessons and the cruel plight of the tormented genie, then a decision is needed from the party. The first is to not get involved at all and press on with other business. The party has no obligation to do anything, and there is no pressing quest or timer to do any action.\nThe party could try and speak with the drow torturer mages, the Overseer Handmaiden or even Dola Fadoon the Genie wracked by pain from a cycle of damaging spells and healing. Perhaps the party wants more information about what exactly is going on.\nIf you speak with Dola he says:\n\"\"Do not torment me with your words, drow. You have no intent of releasing my spirit from this physical prison, I know.\"\nIf you speak with any of the four drow torturer mages, they will respond with various curt statements such as:\n\"The business of my House does not concern you. Go.\"\n\"Go away. You will cause no end of trouble if you incite the anger of my overseer.\"\n\"You may wish to tempt the wrath of my overseer, but I do not. Leave me be.\"\n\"Do not bother me. I must concentrate on the lessons of the overseer.\"\nIf you address the Overseer Handmaiden, she'll glare at you and initially spit out:\n\"Do not disturb our lessons! Benefit can be had from these simple torments.\"\nFurther dialogue choices are available to the party after this. Tread lightly, as a Handmaiden of Lolth the Overseer is not accustomed to being questioned by other drow, especially visitors from Ched Nasad and a drow not of her own house. Some dialogue options can lead to making the Handmaiden hostile, which in turn makes the entire city hostile as well. Or the party can have a polite and subservient tone, and back out of the dialogue entirely.\nActions.\nIf the party only observes and perhaps gathers some information by speaking with the drow or Genie, and not made anyone hostile, then this encounter can be safely left as is and it is over. The Genie will continue to be tormented.\nIf on the other hand, the party antagonizes the Overseer, then hostilities will commence, with the entire city as well. If the drow torturers are attacked, the same result will occur.\nOr, if the party decides to destroy Dola Fadoon's physical form (by dealing enough damage to the poor creature), then this will release the Djinni from being trapped and it will no longer be captive. The genie's spirit will return to the Elemental Plane of Air. If this is done, a text display will show:\n\"Freedom! My form crumbles, my spirit free!\"\nRepercussions of freeing the trapped genie.\nIf the party destroys the genie's physical form, they receive the XP reward from \"killing\" the creature, and the Djinni disappears. \nImmediately afterwards, the Overseer Handmaiden will react and demand accountability, she'll likely begin with:\n\"You dare! Foolish &lt;PRO_MALEFEMALE&gt;! Your clumsy attack has freed our target! What have you to say for yourself?!\"\"\nMore dialogue options will follow. The party must reply and select statements they choose to go with. The Overseer will make threats and demand recompence.\nFailure to meet any time limits leads to the drow city turning hostile towards the party.\nRefusal to make compensation also leads to hostilities. Paying the handmaiden awards 5,000 XP.\nBug.\nCertain dialogue choices won't display due to a coding error codice_1 in the Handmaiden's script. There is a dialogue path present in the files where another beast could be offered to her as compensation (instead of gold) but fails to trigger. This may be included for correction in the planned Enhanced Edition Fix Pack (EEFP). This hasn't been fixed for over twenty years, so there is no guarantee it will be."}

It can be obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20of%20Ulcaster\"&gt;Ghost of Ulcaster&lt;/a&gt; by bringing the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Armor\"&gt;Ancient Armor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Idol\"&gt;Idol of Kozah&lt;/a&gt; to him.\nGameplay.\nThe Vampire's Revenge is particularly useless for combat since it heals the target and injures the wielder. Typical healers such as Clerics and Druids cannot use the weapon since it is a sword.\nAn unorthodox play-style involves equipping the sword onto a sword-capable character with at least 20 &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; to heal wounded party members (a Constitution greater than or equal to 20 allows lost hit-points to naturally regenerate over time). By default, only &lt;a href=\"Kagain\"&gt;Kagain&lt;/a&gt; has 20 Constitution by his stats alone, although it is possible for &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; if the player rolls a sword-wielding class with high Constitution then further raises it to at least 20, using the &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Bodily%20Health\"&gt;Manual of Bodily Health&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Buckley%27s%20Buckler\"&gt;Buckley's Buckler&lt;/a&gt; (). Transfer of HP's is done by preferably removing the armor of the target then hitting them with the sword. Each successful hit drains 6 HP from the wielder and heals the target for 7 HP (regardless of critical hits, the transfer is always the same). Afterwards the sword can be removed by using a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Curse\"&gt;Remove Curse&lt;/a&gt; spell. Over time, the party member who had wielded the cursed sword will regenerate all their HP's from natural regeneration. Compare this healing method to a Cleric's 3rd level &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Medium%20Wounds\"&gt;Cure Medium Wounds&lt;/a&gt; spell which only heals 14 hit-points.\nTheoretically it can be more efficient to heal using The Vampire's Revenge since multiple characters can be healed this way instead of using multiple heal spells to heal each injured party member individually; furthermore healing is limitless thereby saving numerous heal spells and potions. The cost of this method is time to transfer HP's, time for the wielder to regenerate HP's, and a Remove Curse spell."}

Drinks can stimulate the collection of rumors, which in turn may provide information that may be interesting, helpful, or just idle gossip of no relevance.

If singing along, remember \"the second verse is the same as the first\".\nDrinks.\nIn order to pursue the goal of finding a way to get in to Spellhold and rescue Imoen, the party should speak with &lt;a href=\"Sanik\"&gt;Sanik&lt;/a&gt;. At some point after conversation with him, an unexpected assassination of the merchant will occur. Make sure you listen to what the Innkeeper tells you after the murder and pay attention to the information gleaned about &lt;a href=\"Claire\"&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt;. This is necessary to progress to Spellhold. If you are on the Island as an ally of the Shadow Thieves or Bodhi, there will be other information provided to the party to follow.\nLater on, if the party has elected to return to Brynnlaw from Spellhold, there will be another meeting taking place in the Vulgar Monkey to move the saga forward in the &lt;a href=\"Leaving%20the%20island\"&gt;Leaving the island&lt;/a&gt; plot."}

Speaking to him once begins the quest. No matter what you say, he will be too depressed to continue conversation and will need a moment to compose himself.\nWhen you speak to Jospil a second time, the resulting conversation will determine the resolution to the quest, based on how much you are able to brighten his mood. There are three topics to discuss. The questions you can ask him after discussing a certain topic do not affect anything and only provide additional background info. When you tell him \"I have another question,\" you'll be given an opportunity to cheer him up and return to the main conversation tree to talk about something else. Running through the same topic again will not give you another opportunity to cheer him up, so you will need to say the right thing the first time.\nWhen you tell him \"farewell,\" regardless of how many topics you have discussed, you will receive a reward based on your previous answers and the quest will be complete."}

Bodhi will immediately intercept the party as soon as they enter the graveyard. After dialogue and certain potential actions (covered in the walkthrough below), the player's Journal will update and officially register \"The final battle with Bodhi\" quest.\nGameplay.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt; area is reset during chapter 6 - especially the part of the map titled Bodhi's Hideout. The game has a trigger to spawn additional vampires within, which is influenced by the Bhaalspawn PCs accrued experience point total. It is unaffected by the game difficulty selection. If the PC has between 400K and 2M+ XP, then there are a few tiers of spawns - from two to six extra vampires will be present. The quality of the vampires goes from the fledgling and can include a few elder and ancient vampires as well. In the unmodded game the ancient vampire is actually much stronger than any of the named vampires except Bodhi. Reference SPWNVAMP.bcs.\nA player with a Cleric in their party can conceivably single-handedly destroy all the undead on this dungeon level using the &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; ability. For some reason, the creatures here are rarely over 9 Hit Dice. So, at the very least a cleric will be turning the undead easily, and at level 14-15 experience probably outright destroying them.\nAnother point that may occur in this scenario (in an unmodded game), is if the party opted to bring in allies to assist with this quest, such as Drizzt, Arkanis Gath and Eric Vanstraaten - these assistants can autonomously kill several of the vampires all on their own. This means that the dungeon level is less of a challenge than it already is, and potentially siphoning off experience point gains from the party. A first time or occasional player may desire this support, but a veteran player may not find it needed.\nEarlier in Chapter 6, &lt;a href=\"Elhan\"&gt;Elhan&lt;/a&gt; furnished the party with &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Elven Holy Water&lt;/a&gt;. This can be used in the Blood Bath Chamber, and later down below in Bodhi's Lair. Use the vial of Holy Water on a blood-filled font to initiate a weakening effect on the vampires in that area. One side note on this - the party doesn't have to use these in order to defeat the vampires, but Bhodi can't be killed without it due to her &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt; item. That item is removed from her with the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Elven Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; use in her lair.\nWalkthrough (abbreviated).\nEnter the Athkatla graveyard district.\nUpon entering the graveyard, Bodhi appears with several attending &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;. After a short dialogue, Bodhi departs and her vampires attack. If, however, the protagonist has a finished &lt;a href=\"Romance\"&gt;Romance&lt;/a&gt; with a certain core Bioware companion - and they are currently in the party, Bodhi will abduct that member. There will be different dialogue interjections from Bodhi and the party member to match up with the romanced member.\nFor players that are romancing a Beamdog Enhanced Edition companion - that abduction won't actually occur, although there will be some content about Bodhi attempting it.\nThe companions elgible for abduction are &lt;a href=\"Aerie\"&gt;Aerie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anomen%20Delryn\"&gt;Anomen Delryn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Viconia%20DeVir\"&gt;Viconia DeVir&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind an entrance to the catacombs.\nTo get into the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt; the party needs to find an entrance below. The party will find out that previous entry points used in Chapter 3 are now closed off, with a screen text display showing:\nKeep looking, and you'll eventually locate an open passage below in the southwestern part of the graveyard.\nDescend into the Lower Tombs.\nTransition the party below and all will emerge in a room explored previously during Chapter 3 - some kind of vampiric bedchamber.\nIf the player visited &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Wessalen\"&gt;Prelate Wessalen&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Noble%20Order%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt; and he agreed to provide assistance, then within this room will appear four paladins to include &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Vanstraaten\"&gt;Eric Vanstraaten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20William%20Reirrac\"&gt;William Reirrac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nerit\"&gt;Nerit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Branet%20Al-Thon\"&gt;Branet Al-Thon&lt;/a&gt;.

The group includes two vampires as well as &lt;a href=\"Salia\"&gt;Salia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meredath\"&gt;Meredath&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party had arranged to have support from &lt;a href=\"Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt; and his friends, they will be here as well, including &lt;a href=\"Bruenor\"&gt;Bruenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cattie-Brie\"&gt;Cattie-Brie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Regis\"&gt;Regis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wulfgar\"&gt;Wulfgar&lt;/a&gt; and the panther &lt;a href=\"Guenhwyvar\"&gt;Guenhwyvar&lt;/a&gt;. Drizzt may shout something here, about how they have already got started fighting. \nAfter the vampires are defeated, Drizzt will dismiss his comrades and only he will remain with the party.\nPlacing one of Elhan's &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Elven Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; vials into the disgusting blood pool (by interacting with the pool with the cursor and having the item in that character's inventory} will benefit the party. The Holy Water will purify the pool and will weaken the vampires in this dungeon level. The weakness effect is applied via each creature's file using SPIN818.spl. It implements a &lt;a href=\"Slow%20effect\"&gt;Slow effect&lt;/a&gt; and a -5 to their &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; attribute.\nIn the unmodded game, this is probably overkill, as the vampires are more fragile than some vampires faced in Chapter 2. But better safe than sorry.\nThe room with three sarcophagi.\nWhen the party enters this chamber there may be a &lt;a href=\"Fledgling%20Vampire\"&gt;Fledgling Vampire&lt;/a&gt; inside. That creature might also dart out from here and assist Del and Valen in the adjacent corridor.\nIn the chamber are three elaborate sarcophagus objects. When the vampires Del, Valen and Tanova are reduced to gas clouds, the vampires retreat here to heal and reconstitute.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Stake\"&gt;Wooden Stake&lt;/a&gt; at each one of these will permanently destroy the undead inside, awarding additional XP for each one.\nStaking and destroying the three vampires will unlock the door leading to the stairway down to &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Bodhi's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe eastern passage.\nFrom the central room with the mega table - take the eastern leading passage and see the &lt;a href=\"Guard\"&gt;Guard&lt;/a&gt; vampire. \nOnce detected, the vampire will voice a line of dialogue. He seems impressed with the bhaalspawn's audacity, but hostilities ensue.\nThe player can see the room of Blood and Blades beyond. Search the central blood-filled pentagonal font for any items.\nThe room of Blood and Blades.\nWithin this room are a large group of &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Mist\"&gt;Vampiric Mist&lt;/a&gt; creatures, ever aggressive and eager to drain the life from the living.\nOnce aggravated, be wary of party members outside of the room who may be attacked hundreds of feet away from the battle. They can turn invisible at will.\nWatch out for the hidden traps (which can't be detected or disarmed) in this room. Those traps can deliver a brutal amount of damage. A &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; spell could help.\nGo below into &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Bodhi's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter staking the defeated vampires in the three sarcophagi, the locked door is opened to transition down below. That passage is in the central room with the large table.\nOnce down below, as well as any of the allies, prepare for a fight with Bodhi ahead. When ready, move down the corridor, turn the corner and see a closed double-door leading to her inner sanctum, or lair. Don't forget to search for hidden traps in this passage.\nFace Bodhi in her lair.\nThe double door pulls open. Send whatever party members you wish to inside and keep any others out. The doors can be closed here, if the player wishes to bar any allies, such as Drizzt from entering (can be a bit tricky to do).\nBodhi stands within the chamber. The bloodbath fonts are brimming with uncongealed blood, and the ichor of sweat, fear and death pervades the air. Standing beside Bodhi will be the abducted vampire &lt;a href=\"Romance\"&gt;Romance&lt;/a&gt; companion if that is applicable to the player. Bodhi will commence dialogue with the bhaalspawn (or another party member if the PC stayed back in the corridor).\nA heated exchange of opinions, threats and promises is made by Bodhi, and various interjections from certain party members will occur. Eventually Bodhi ends the talk and attacks. The fluttering bats in the room will morph into vampires (at least three), and several &lt;a href=\"Grimwarder\"&gt;Grimwarder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grimward%20Archer\"&gt;Grimward Archer&lt;/a&gt; creatures enter the room and or just appear.\nBodhi can be forced into turning into a mist/bat and retreating to her coffin when her original HP drops to 0 or less. This also triggers her death cry. It is necessary to use the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Elven Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; in order to do this, as she is equipped with the &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt;. But if it is used, then Bodhi's MINHP1 item is removed, her regeneration ability is stopped, plus she is under a &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; effect, takes 20 HP of &lt;a href=\"Acid%20damage\"&gt;Acid damage&lt;/a&gt; and has a 2-point penalty to her strength and dexterity. That action will definitely ensure the party can put that final nail in her coffin.\nOnce Bodhi and her defenders are destroyed, use a &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Stake\"&gt;Wooden Stake&lt;/a&gt; at her coffin to seal the deal. An XP reward will be bestowed to the party and a Journal update occurs. \nUpon Bodhi's body crumbling to dust, &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Black%20Heart\"&gt;Bodhi's Black Heart&lt;/a&gt; is placed into the PC's inventory - Keep it - as that item will be needed later if a party member had been turned into a vampire.\nAnd as suspected, Bodhi did have the &lt;a href=\"Rhynn%20Lanthorn\"&gt;Rhynn Lanthorn&lt;/a&gt;, which will be added to your inventory as well.\nLocate the fallen vampiric party member's body and take it with you. A &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Holding\"&gt;Bag of Holding&lt;/a&gt; can be used for this.\nSearch all the containers in the lair and collect any valuables. \nPay attention to the three books found in the locked chest, for their texts will help guide and provide clues for the player to figure out what might be done to cure the vampirism on the companion's corpse and also provide a means to revive the stricken companion.\nExtra Lower Tombs event.\nIf the party ventures outside the vampire area into the lower tombs (near the previously encountered spider infested zone), an encounter with a single skeleton warrior who calls for two others of its kind for backup. \nApparently, this intrusion shall not go unpunished.\nResurrecting the protagonist's lover.\nIf the aforementioned abduction of the protagonist's lover and the killing of him/her occurred, the resurrection spell does not work here unfortunately. A special method is required to remove the vampirism from the person, and to make them live again. Collect the body from the ground where Bodhi stood \u2013 be it Aerie's, Anomen's, Jaheira's, or Viconia's Body. Pick up the body and place in the inventory of a party member (or &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Holding\"&gt;Bag of Holding&lt;/a&gt;) until needed later.\nRead through the three books found in the locked chest in Bodhi's Lair - don't leave them behind. Keep them in the party's inventory for reference. These books have clues and some guidance about reverting vampirism. Be sure to pick up the .&lt;br&gt;\nEither read these books to figure it out on your own, or if you can't figure it out then open the \"Spoiler\" section below.\nSpoiler.\nA \"spoiler\" reveal button is below for readers who want to be provided a \"How to\" - Don't read it if you desire to figure it out on your own as intended for a first-time player.\nOptionally, travel back to the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Temple%20at%20Underdark%20Exit\"&gt;Elven Temple at Underdark Exit&lt;/a&gt; area and ask &lt;a href=\"Elhan\"&gt;Elhan&lt;/a&gt; and his War Sages to help you revive your lover, but they just tell you to seek out followers of &lt;a href=\"Oghma\"&gt;Oghma&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnter the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Oghma%20%28Athkatla%29\"&gt;Temple of Oghma&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Athkatla Docks&lt;/a&gt; and talk with the Priest about the subject at hand.\nAdditional information may be had from the &lt;a href=\"Monk%20%28Oghma%29\"&gt;Monk (Oghma)&lt;/a&gt; there as well. \nThey direct you to the &lt;a href=\"Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt; and the village of &lt;a href=\"Imnesvale\"&gt;Imnesvale&lt;/a&gt; (which the books also mentioned as well).\nFind the &lt;a href=\"Book%20Merchant%20%28Imnesvale%20Inn%29\"&gt;Book Merchant&lt;/a&gt; that the party may have already met in the &lt;a href=\"Imnesvale%20Inn\"&gt;Imnesvale Inn&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeak with the man, who calls himself a book dealer there. Ensure you ask about a tome that is about curing vampirism.\nMuch (and somewhat amusing) dialogue from the long winded Biblio trader will be gleaned if the party hears him out and keeps the dialogue going.\nEventually, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Ruins\"&gt;Temple Ruins&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the place to go and put into action what has been learned and take the next step.\nTravel to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Ruins\"&gt;Temple Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and enter &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Temple\"&gt;the temple&lt;/a&gt; there.&lt;br&gt;\nInside the temple, make your way across the lettered tiles and into the room with the statue with outstretched hands. \nPlace both your lover's body and &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Black%20Heart\"&gt;Bodhi's Black Heart&lt;/a&gt; into the statue's hands. \nThe power of Amanuator and the offering of the heart has restored your lover to life, and cured the vampirism.\nThe companion will thank you profusely and asks to rejoin the party. Or maybe different wording depending on the character.\nAfterwards, a journal update will register and that should close \"The final battle with Bodhi questline\".\nAnd that's it! All that work for no experience points or gold. The things we do for love is its own reward.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod will fully utilize the \"Improved Vampires\" component in this dungeon. See the &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; article and Mod content section, or even better, the Mod's Readme file. If the \"Improved Bodhi\" component is installed, the player will face a version of Bodhi that much surpasses the unmodified game version in terms of abilities and staying power. As this is one of the game's \"boss fights\" - the mod raises the challenge level commensurate with Bodhi's importance. The battle should be test for the player, and not just another \"two rounds and it's all over encounter\" for a balanced party in chapter 6.\nThe mod responds to the player's game difficulty selection. On \"Hardcore\" and especially \"Insane\" difficulty you'll get this coven of blood suckers at their highest potency.\n&lt;a href=\"Tanova\"&gt;Tanova&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Guard\"&gt;Guard&lt;/a&gt; vampire are proper wizard spell casting vampires, capable of both spells and vampire abilities. The AI scripting is smart.\nEven the &lt;a href=\"Fledgling%20Vampire\"&gt;Fledgling Vampire&lt;/a&gt; creatures are now not so useless in this encounter and toughened up. Hit dice levels for all the creatures are a few steps higher than the unmodded game, so the vampires may be more resistant to &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn Bodhi's Lair she will have four or more vampire allies. Probably two &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Elder%29\"&gt;Elder Vampires&lt;/a&gt; and there may be two \"named\" vampires with her from the mod, as follows:&lt;br&gt;\nHazamaveth Male Level 16/14 Mage/Vampire (IMPBOD1.cre):&lt;br&gt;\nSTR 22, DEX 21, CON 20, INT 18, WIS 9, CHA 9; AL Chaotic Evil&lt;br&gt;\nHP 140, Final AC -4, Final THAC0 1, Saving Throws 7/6/7/8/6&lt;br&gt;\n3 Attacks Per Round, 1d6+9 Crushing Damage &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; or \"Blood Drain\" (3 CON)&lt;br&gt;\nSpecial:&lt;br&gt;50% Cold and Electricity Resistance&lt;br&gt;All usual vampire immunities&lt;br&gt;+3 Enchanted weapon needed to hit.&lt;br&gt;\nSpells:&lt;br&gt;A whole scripted spell book of level 1 - 8 wizard spells&lt;br&gt;Prepared Minor and Spell Sequencers, Spell Trigger.&lt;br&gt;\nManasseh Male Level 16/16 Mage/Vampire (IMPBOD2.cre):&lt;br&gt;\nSimilar stats as above, slightly different &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and Saving throws.&lt;br&gt;\nAssigned a random Mage Specialty Kit (Conjurer, Enchanter, Invoker or Necromancer)&lt;br&gt;\nA different spell book and sequencers/triggers assigned based on mage kit.\nFinally, Bodhi is also assigned some new scripting twists. She has remarkable staying power, and can heal herself completely during the battle, meaning the party will need to basically bring her HP down twice during the fight, as a &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; spell is cast upon her when her HP drops to 10. There are some other surprises she'll unleash if facing the Improved Bodhi component as well. Use of the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Elven Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; is necessary to prevent her regeneration ability and to remove her &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt; or she can't be killed.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20for%20BG2\"&gt;Unfinished Business for BG2&lt;/a&gt; mod installed, the fighter dualed to thief &lt;a href=\"Artemis%20Entreri\"&gt;Artemis Entreri&lt;/a&gt; is an ally of Bodhi is included as one of her defenders. The Player must have agreed to let Drizzt assist with this adventure for this to happen, but Drizzt doesn't need to be alive or in this area for Artemis to be included. Artemis will be invisible, and the party may not even know he's there until a backstab is attempted."}

It leads on directly from the quest &lt;a href=\"leaving%20the%20island\"&gt;leaving the island&lt;/a&gt; and itself leads on to the start of Chapter 5.\nAquisition.\nThis quest begins when the party is taken to the &lt;a href=\"Underwater%20City\"&gt;Underwater City&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"sahuagin\"&gt;sahuagin&lt;/a&gt;. It is introduced upon learning that some of the sahaugin believe the party's arrival might be part of a foretold prophecy of Sekolah. Not all sahuagin share this belief.\nWalkthrough.\nInitially, while the party was upon the stolen vessel captained by &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt;, and then was attacked at sea by the &lt;a href=\"Githyanki%20%28Race%29\"&gt;githyanki&lt;/a&gt; - who in-turn were boarded by the marauding sahuagin - has led to the sinking of the ship and being captured and taken to this strange Underwater city, a small civilization in an undersea cavernous void. When the party is finally able to get their wits about them, they are escorted by armed \"shark-like' creatures and are being held captive at the start of the adventure. The party is also spoken to in a language they do not understand - and one of the guards, a &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Feerlattiys\"&gt;Captain Feerlattiys&lt;/a&gt;, has taken them before &lt;a href=\"Royal%20High%20Priestess%20Senityili\"&gt;Royal High Priestess Senityili&lt;/a&gt;. The Captain bellows out strange words: \nThe Priestess also speaks to the assembled group in the shark tongue, but eventually performs a magic translation enchantment so that you, the surfacers, may now understand and communicate with the saguagin. The Priestess will say:\nVarious dialogue from the party will transpire here, including questions, and remarks from most of the core companions. Eventually if the party remains somewhat calm and promises not to be violent, will be allowed to remain with no bonds or fetters. &lt;a href=\"Edwin\"&gt;Edwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keldorn\"&gt;Keldorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt; have special dialogue. The Captain is eager to bring the party before the King.\nNext, the party is led to face &lt;a href=\"King%20Ixilthetocal\"&gt;King Ixilthetocal&lt;/a&gt;. The King, and his &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Sahuagin%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Sahuagin Guard&lt;/a&gt; and noble &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Thelokassyil\"&gt;Baron Thelokassyil&lt;/a&gt; await the party and accompanying &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Tlyysixxous\"&gt;High Priestess Tlyysixxous&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe King and all the assembled sahuagin entourage discuss the party, and views as to whether these surfacers are actually part of the Sekolah Prophecy or not. Baron Thelokassyil and High Priestess Tlyysixxous are not convinced they are, and advocate of making a meal of the party. The Royal Priestess argues that the prophecy is playing out and the party are indeed the saviors foretold. The King seems amused and indifferent one way or the other when hearing the mixed advice. The King does have some dialogue and seeks views from the advisors, and even from the party itself. The King eventually seeks to test the party in order to make a decision and says: \nRefusal will lead to hostilities, and result in a less-than-optimal outcome for the party (and certainly less potential adventuring) and loss of quest XP rewards.\nAccepting the challenge leads to an arena battle cutscene with an &lt;a href=\"Ettin\"&gt;Ettin&lt;/a&gt; and should be no serious opponent for a party at this stage of the game. The big beast will shout:\nOnce the party triumphs the king is impressed and says:\nNow that the King is convinced the party is most likely actually fulfilling Sekolah's prophecy, he sends Priestess Tlyysiouxxous off to sacrificial disposal to the Shark father, since her opinion of the party was wrong (wrong as determined by the King). The King explains what he wishes the party to undertake for him, this occurs with much dialogue, and the party can interject and answer questions and make statements. In the end, the party can agree to track down and kill the Rebel leader &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Villynaty\"&gt;Prince Villynaty&lt;/a&gt; and bring back his heart as proof of the deed. For that service, a great reward is offered, and then the party will be free to move on with their lives as desired.\nIf the party has so far convinced the king to allow the party to undertake helping with destroying the rebels, the player's Journal will register the following:\nIf the party refuses to do this, then hostilities will commence. The player's Journal will register the following:\nThis choice will reduce gameplay options, quest experience potential and could present a poorer outcome overall - the entire sahuagin city will be hostile (including the rebels). \nThe party is to speak with the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20High%20Priestess%20Senityili\"&gt;Royal High Priestess Senityili&lt;/a&gt; to get specific instructions to find the Rebel Prince. She'll be at the steps to the Shark-Father. \nIf the party agrees to pursue the Rebel Prince, the King sends you off to get some details before undertaking the task. He says:\nThe party will be directed to the Temple of Sekolah, where the new high priestess will tell the players that she believes the rebels are in the right. She begs them to at least talk to Prince Villynaty, and gives them a &lt;a href=\"Rebel%27s%20Orb\"&gt;Rebel's Orb&lt;/a&gt; as a sign of safe passage - this doesn't prevent the party from having to fight the bands of Sahuagin Rebels that wander the map, however.\nTo reach the rebel base, the player must first acquire the &lt;a href=\"Tooth%20of%20Sekolah\"&gt;Tooth of Sekolah&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; in the Drow Ruins, past the area with the side-quest &lt;a href=\"Riddle%20of%20the%20Imps\"&gt;Riddle of the Imps&lt;/a&gt;. This tooth is a key to open the \"doors\" in the North-eastern part of the city. Go down the stairs at and slaughter the rebels for XP and bolts if you must. At the end is the entrance to the rebel base.\nUpon arriving at the rebel base, if the player has the Rebel Orb, the &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin%20Chieftan\"&gt;Sahuagin Chieftan&lt;/a&gt; addresses the party and says:\nIt makes sense to agree to this, as the party may as well hear what the rebel Prince has to say. If the party is feeling blood thirsty and attacks the Chieftan - then hostilities with the remaining rebels are now locked in stone and can't be changed.\nAssuming the party has some restraint and doesn't attack the Chieftan, all are ushered into the prince's presence. The prince and his guiding advisor &lt;a href=\"Senior%20Priestess%20Sallinithyl\"&gt;Senior Priestess Sallinithyl&lt;/a&gt; will converse with the party, with some revealing and amusing dialogue. In the end, the Prince seems more focused on regaining the throne than to subscribe to some overarching theroy that Sekolah has sent the party to save the shark people from destruction. He eventually makes it clear that he wishes you to double-cross the king; he will give them a Sahuagin heart for the party to present as his own, and then launch a sneak attack on the king. The prince says:\nThe player must then make a choice as to which side they will fight for. Siding with the rebels grants more quest EXP (60,500 EXP vs. the 58,500 EXP for siding with the king), but Prince Villynaty carries the unique &lt;a href=\"Wave%20Blade\"&gt;Wave Blade&lt;/a&gt; item and killing him has the player receive the otherwise inaccessible &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20Crushing\"&gt;Gauntlets of Crushing&lt;/a&gt; from the King. However, siding with the prince gives the player the chance to pickpocket the Wave Blade from him before departing (or attacking and killing him after the quest is finished), and the Gauntlets of Crushing are only of major use to the &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; class, so it is arguably more profitable to side with the rebels.\nRegardless of which path is taken, the player will gain access to a &lt;a href=\"Magical%20Rope\"&gt;Magical Rope&lt;/a&gt; that can be used at an opening in the rebel's base to descend to the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;, ending Chapter 4 and beginning Chapter 5."}

{"id": "4111", "revid": "49135869", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4111", "title": "Thief", "text": "This page is specifically for the thief &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; in , , and .\nFor the version in and , refer to &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;Thief (Baldur's Gate)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntroduction.\nThieves are rogues who can open locks, steal items, hide in shadows, find and disarm traps. Given their skillset, thieves can't be lawful good. However, you'll run into many situations in game that require these thieving skills, making a thief party member essential for almost every playthrough.\nThieves can't wear any metal helmets, they wear leather, studded leather and hide armor and can only use bucklers as shields to protect themselves. Their array of weapons consists of lightweight weapons such as &lt;a href=\"long%20swords\"&gt;long swords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"short%20swords\"&gt;short swords&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"scimitars%2C%20wakizashi%2C%20ninjat%C5%8Ds\"&gt;scimitars, wakizashi, ninjat\u014ds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"throwing%20daggers\"&gt;throwing daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clubs\"&gt;clubs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quarterstaves\"&gt;quarterstaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"light%20crossbows\"&gt;light crossbows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shortbows\"&gt;shortbows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"darts\"&gt;darts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"slings\"&gt;slings&lt;/a&gt;. All of the above restrictions can be later overcome by the &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; high level ability, which grant rogues access to almost all items.\nAll races can become a thief as a profession.\nAbility scores table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, other Races have modified ability scores.\n^^ The Shadowdancer class kit has a different set of minimum ability scores, and has Strength and Charisma as prime requisites for Dual-classing in addition to Dexterity.\n&lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;Special abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nA thief gains a fixed +25 thieving skill points (numbers vary among kits) upon level up. Starting stats and subsequent play values in various thief skills are further modified by &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and race, with the exception of Detect Illusion, which isn't modified by dexterity or any other ability score. At no time may you put more than 250 skill points into a skill. Therefore the only way to raise the base skill higher is by raising dexterity after 250 points have been invested into that skill. Different potions and items may be stacked up to a bonus cap of 30 to each skill. Some thieving skills have no benefit over 100 points.\nIt's also worth noting that some values presented in in-game descriptions are incorrect. For example, the in-game description for Elves claims they get +5% to Move Silently and +10% to Hide in Shadows, but they actually get +15% to both (per the table below and the SKILLRAC.2DA file).\nPick Pockets.\nA thief can steal &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s from non-hostile characters (including &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; members and charmed enemies) by using the Thieving skill on them. The chance to steal an item depends on the thief's and the target's Pick Pockets level and the place of that item inside the target's inventory. Stealing from another thief (or any character that has skill points assigned to Pick Pockets) may require a skill level of over 100 to steal; this also applies to many merchants in the later parts of the game. 250 has been observed to have a slight chance of failure on some targets. In the \"Enhanced Editions\", there's also a \"critical failure\" possible for one attempt out of twenty (1 on a 1d20).\nPick Pockets is raised by 5 points for every point of Dexterity above 16, and lowered by 5 points for every point of Dexterity below 12 (up to -15 at 9 Dexterity, which is the minimum for a thief during character creation). \nAlso in the original \"Baldur's Gate II\", both Dexterity modifiers and racial bonuses affect the maximum value of Pick Pockets. A character without a Dexterity modifier or racial bonus may raise their Pick Pockets up to 265 with skill points alone (270 for Elf and 275 for Half-elf). Beyond this point, a Half-elf with 25 Dexterity and magical effects that boost Pick Pockets can reach the cap of 325.\nIn the \"Enhanced\" games, Dexterity modifiers and racial bonuses only affect the starting value of Pick Pockets. The maximum value which can be reached with skill points alone is fixed at 250, regardless of race or Dexterity. The absolute cap is still 325 which can be reached with magical effects that boost Dexterity and Pick Pockets.\nNot all items are stealable. Every item entry on a creature has a set of flags as seen in game file inspectors such as &lt;a href=\"Near%20Infinity\"&gt;Near Infinity&lt;/a&gt;. Having either the \"Not stealable\" or \"Undroppable\" flag will make the item unstealable. The \"Stolen\" flag will make the item unsellable to most vendors. Furthermore, the item will also be unstealable if the item file itself does not have the flag \"Droppable\".\nA failed Pick Pockets attempt is treated as an attack against the target, and will cause most neutral characters to become hostile.\nEach inventory slot is assigned a value which is the required level of Pick Pockets for a thief to steal from that slot. A value of 0 means the slot cannot be stolen from. The original games and the \"Enhanced\" games have different sets of values.\nIn the original \"Baldur's Gate\", the following inventory slots cannot be stolen from: \"Armor\", \"Belt\", \"Boots\", \"Cloak\", \"Gauntlets\", \"Helmet\", \"Shield\" and active \"Weapon\" (incl. \"Fists\") or \"Quiver\". All other inventory slots can be stolen from even with a very low Pick Pockets level (e.g. 4).\nThe \"Enhanced\" games assign more dynamic values to various inventory slots, which are shown in the table to the right.\nFinally, although pickpocketing will break Invisibility, it does not break Sanctuary, meaning that Cleric/Thieves can safely pickpocket from charmed enemies in the middle of combat, for example.\nOpen Locks.\nA thief can pick the locks on doors and containers to open them. The chance to open a door/container depends on the difficulty of the lock and works on a threshold system \u2014 if you are more than 8 points below the target lock's difficulty you have no chance of picking it successfully, while if you're strictly above the lock's difficulty, success is guaranteed. Chances are increased by &lt;a href=\"luck\"&gt;luck&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe highest lock difficulty is 95 in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;BG1&lt;/a&gt; and , and 99 in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II\"&gt;BG2&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it is not necessary to have more than respectively 87 and 91. \nMove Silently / Hide In Shadows.\nThese skills allow the thief to effectively become invisible. See the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; article for more information. If both are set to 200, it will always succeed.\nDetect Illusion.\nThieves may attempt to dispel non-friendly illusion spells within 15 ft whenever their Find Traps skill is active. Does not receive any modifier from a thief's dexterity score. Does not benefit from scores higher than 100.\n&lt;a href=\"Find%20Traps%20/%20Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;Find Traps / Detect Illusion&lt;/a&gt; is the modal skill used by players and some enemies. It is unblockable. Other enemy thieves use &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Illusion%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Detect Illusion (enemy)&lt;/a&gt; instead, which can be defended against.\nSet Traps.\nAllows thief to lay a trap when outside an enemy's line of sight, also required to use traps gained by high level thief abilities. Laid traps are triggered by enemies within a fireball spell range. A maximum of 7 traps can be set in one map area. Thieves can set one trap at level 1, plus one for every 5th level thereafter (per rest). The rank in the skill determines the chance (in %) to succesfully set a trap. Thieves with a &lt;a href=\"Traps\"&gt;Set Snare&lt;/a&gt; score lower than 100 have a 25% chance of being hurt by their own trap IF they fail to set it. Does not benefit from scores higher than 100.\nBackstabbing.\nThe\u00a0backstab ability\u00a0allows attacks a thief makes\u00a0while concealed\u00a0and behind a target to perform additional damage. The additional damage is substantial enough to often kill targets in a single blow. See the &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; article for more details.\nXP gains for Unlock and Disarm.\n introduces &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;XP gains&lt;/a&gt; for disarming traps and unlocking doors and containers. This system was carried over into Baldur's Gate I with the , though with drastically reduced numbers. Below are listed Unlock and Disarm XP gains for each level.\nMulti and Dual Class thieves will use the average level of active classes, rounded up.\nClass kits.\nThief.\nTo accomplish one's goals, for good or ill, the Thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are a thief's hallmarks.

The array of weapon for a thief consists of lightweight weapons such as and throwing daggers, &lt;a href=\"shortbows\"&gt;shortbows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"short%20swords\"&gt;short swords&lt;/a&gt;, , , and . A thief can't wear any metal helmets.\nAbility Scores.\nNote: For the information of this table the human race was used, because they have no character bonuses/penalties related to race and therefore act like a 'neutral'. For other races this may be slightly different. See &lt;a href=\"Ability%20Scores\"&gt;Ability Scores&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;Thieving Abilities&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nAbilities of the Thief.\nThey gain +20 thieving ability points when they level up (+30 at level 1). The race of the thief determines how many points are gained as a bonus. Halflings have the best overall bonus to thieving ability points. For more information about how race affects thieving, see &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;Thieving Abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nDexterity determines how many points are added to each skill during the game as well. For more information about how dexterity affects thieving, see &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;Thieving Abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind/Disarm Traps.\nA thief can find traps if they activate their find traps mode. Any found traps can then be disarmed if the find/disarm trap percentage is high enough.\nStealth (Move Silently and Hide in Shadows).\nAll &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s and thieves can hide in shadows if they wear studded leather armor or lesser armor. A thief who is hidden in shadow can attempt to perform a backstab, which does increased damage. The modifier increases with the level of thief. The chance to hide successfully in the shadow depends on the time, at night this is much easier to than at daylight, whether the thief is standing in a shadow or not and the chance in percentage to hide in shadow from the character self.\nPick Locks.\nA thief can lockpick locks from doors and containers to open them. The chance to open a door/container depends on the percentage of the character.\nPick Pockets.\nA thief can steal items from non-hostile characters (including party members) by using the Thieving skill on them.\nPick Pockets is raised by 5 points for every point of Dexterity above 16, and lowered by 5 points for every point of Dexterity below 12 (up to -15 at 9 Dexterity, which is the minimum for a thief during character creation). \nAlso in the original \"Baldur's Gate\", both Dexterity modifiers and racial bonuses affect the maximum value of Pick Pockets. A character without a Dexterity modifier or racial bonus may raise their Pick Pockets up to 115 with skill points alone (120 for Elf and 125 for Half-elf). Beyond this point, a Half-elf with 25 Dexterity and magical effects that boost Pick Pockets can reach the cap of 325.\nNot all items are stealable. Every item entry on a creature has a set of flags as seen in game file inspectors such as &lt;a href=\"Near%20Infinity\"&gt;Near Infinity&lt;/a&gt;. Having either the \"Not stealable\" or \"Undroppable\" flag will make the item unstealable. The \"Stolen\" flag will make the item unsellable to most vendors. Furthermore, the item will also be unstealable if the item file itself does not have the flag \"Droppable\".\nIn the original games, the following inventory slots cannot be stolen from: Armor, Belt, Boots, Cloak, Gauntlets, Helmet, Ring (both), Shield, Fist, and Equipped (currently equipped weapon or currently selected ammo slot). All other inventory slots can be stolen from even with very low Pick Pockets level (e.g. 4).\nA failed Pick Pockets attempt is treated as an attack against the target and will cause most neutral characters to become hostile.\nBackstabbing.\nWhen thieves are invisible, a thief can try to execute a &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; upon an enemy, which inflicts more damage than a normal hit, but it makes the thief visible once again.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a number of gameplay revisions and changes to all Rogues, including their kits. It is a comprehensive modification to nearly all aspects of the Rogues (Bards and Thieves) abilities and strives to bring them closer to their Pen and Paper AD&amp;D counterparts. New and revised abilities are included, as well as new equipment and rogue specific items. Separate user installed components are available to customize selection of content and changes.

The whole group is hostile to any intruders that are detected.\nThe thief is invisible on the map. He's actually positioned a bit further south of the main group. \nArmed with an enchanted dagger, the thief will attack from invisibility with a &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; attack, unless he is exposed by divination.\nAfter attacking, he'll quaff a potion of invisibility and repeat the same tactic. From a hidden state he'll have an adjusted THAC0 of 7 - still fairly mediocre. Even with a successful backstab the damage done will be moderate at most.\nIf the thief is wounded, he can imbibe a potion of healing.\nThe creature is scripted to use the &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;Detect Illusion&lt;/a&gt; ability in a narrowly defined way, but the only thieving skill it has any skill points is &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, so it is unlikely to achieve any illusion detection results.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod assigns a new default Thief AI script for potion use, and smarter backstabbing. Weapon proficiencies are redesignated to 1 pip in dagger and 1 in single weapon fighting style.\nThis thief may be able to pull off three backstabs from invisibility."}

She quite quickly tells you that it was Kiser behind everything, who has kidnapped her son and the only way to get him returned was to turn on Mateo like that.

The reason for this is that his level 6 version got very low health rolls between levels 2 and 6. Assuming maximum rolls each level it is quite possible to have Kagain with 90 health at level 6 if you pick him up at level 1. This is a huge difference compared to the 60 health he would normally have if you get his level 6 variant. \u00a0\nPersonality.\nUnlike most evil companions in Baldur's Gate, Kagain does not show any signs of psychotic behavior. Instead he is depicted as a cold-hearted and pragmatic mercenary who only cares about money and profit."}

Leave the party behind, take one character (preferably wearing the &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Boots of Speed&lt;/a&gt;) and slowly approach Carsa's location until she appears at the edge of the fog of war and initiates conversation. Then, once Kahrk appears and ends conversation, quickly retreat to the party's location. \nDrinking a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;Potion of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and retreating also works.\nIf done correctly, the ogre mage will not follow. Then wait for around 5 minutes real time or sleep for 8 hours ingame and Kahrk's protective spells should have worn off. He cannot recast them, so slay him any way you want.\nDistraction.\n&lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Monster%20Summoning\"&gt;Wand of Monster Summoning&lt;/a&gt; can provide targets for Kahrk's spells.\nMinor Globe of Invulnerability.\nKahrk's &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; protects him from spells of level 1, 2, 3 and &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;power levels&lt;/a&gt; 1, 2, 3.\nHe is protected from damage sources (Magic Missile, Fireball, Skull Trap, Call Lightning, Wand of Fire, Wand of Frost, Wand of Lightning) and debuffs (Blindness, Spook, Doom, &lt;a href=\"Silence%2C%2015%27%20Radius\"&gt;Silence 15' Radius&lt;/a&gt;, Web, Glitterdust, Horror, Slow, Summon Insects).\nMost debuffs above level 3 are unlikely to succeed because his saving throws are strong (Emotion:Hopelessness, Contagion, Confusion, Chaos, Feeblemind, Domination, Hold Monster, Mental Domination, Poison).\nThe following effects pass through Minor Globe and are useful against him.\nAfter firing &lt;a href=\"The%20One%20Gift%20Lost\"&gt;The One Gift Lost&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Victor\"&gt;The Victor&lt;/a&gt;, they can be quickly passed to other party members and fired again.\nKahrk's Minor Globe expires after 12 rounds but may be recast.\nMinor Globe of Invulnerability can be removed with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt;. Then &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; can remove his Mirror Images.\nNone of Kahrk's offensive spells (as listed in Infobox) are above level 3, so Minor Globe of Invulnerability may protect a mage from his magic.\nWand of Paralyzation.\n&lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Paralyzation\"&gt;Wand of Paralyzation&lt;/a&gt; can be found at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Lighthouse\"&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; or purchased at Sorcerous Sundries.\nEach firing of the wand has a 30% chance of paralyzing Kahrk for 10 rounds.\nWhen paralyzed, all melee attacks land so mirror images disappear quickly.\nKahrk should die without much trouble.\nPolymorph Self: Mustard Jelly.\n&lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20Self\"&gt;Polymorph Self&lt;/a&gt; can be prepared before speaking to Carsa.\nA mage in Mustard Jelly form can't be harmed by Kahrk's magic but can still fire a Wand of Paralyzation every round.\nEnchanted Missiles.\n&lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection from Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt; does not affect &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20%2B1\"&gt;enchanted arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20%2B1\"&gt;enchanted bolts&lt;/a&gt; and enchanted thrown weapons (of +1 or better quality). It also does not affect elemental damage done, so an &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Arrow of Ice&lt;/a&gt; can still do cold damage. Use this to pelt Kahrk with missiles.\nHis Armor Class vs missile is -8 and he has many Mirror Images so it will take many missiles to kill him.\nArrows of Dispelling.\n&lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Dispelling\"&gt;Arrows of Dispelling&lt;/a&gt; need to overcome Armor Class vs missile of -8 but can dispel Kahrk's Haste effect and Mirror Image. They don't dispel Minor Globe of Invulnerability. \nArrow of Slaying.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Slaying\"&gt;Arrow of Slaying&lt;/a&gt; is the ultimate anti-ogre mage weapon. A one-shot kill. There's only one of it in the entire game, though, so plan carefully against whom to use it. Kahrk is among the most dangerous ogre mages (if not the most powerful), so it might be wise to use it against him. Just make sure that Mirror Image is not active when you do.\nArrows of Detonation.\n&lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Detonation\"&gt;Arrows of Detonation&lt;/a&gt; always hit - they ignore AC and Mirror Image so can quickly damage Kahrk.\nProtection from Magic Scroll.\nA fighter can use a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection From Magic&lt;/a&gt; scroll on himself to get immunity to magic but any buffs may also be dispelled."}

If the player doesn't deal with her too harshly, she will give them the lamp that she recovered from Kalah's former room, and tells them both that she can't make it work, and that Jafir is staying at the Crooked Crane Inn.\nWhen the player approaches him, Jafir makes no bones of the fact he is responsible, revealing himself as a rakshasa and offering the player the same bargain he gave Kalah; the command word to summon the genie in exchange for 500 gold pieces. If prompted, he explains he \"loans out\" the lamp and genie to mortals because it amuses him to see the chaos that ensues.\nIf the player agrees, they are told the genie may be summoned by the word \"Markesh\" and teleports away.\nIf the player tries to fight, Jafir is not as tough as he makes himself out to be. Being a rakshasa, he cannot be hit by mundane weapons, but is otherwise quite ineffective and the party won't find him too great a challenge. When reduced to near-death, he interrupts the fight, tells them the command word, and then teleports away in anger.\nWhen summoned, Markesh explains that he can only grant the player one wish; he is part of an elaborate scam that Jafir is running, and as part of that, he can only grant three wishes total. He is then transported back to the rakshasa's lair, where he is reimprisoned under a new command word and given back again. He explains that Kalah used up the first two wishes; the first was for the ability to command the respect of others, to which Markesh gave the Gnome the Ring of Human Influence you found on his body, whilst the second wish was sorcerous power to equal an Ogre Mage's, to which the genie gave him the power and the body alike.\nThe player is then presented with their list of wish options:\nHowever they choose, once their wish is made, the quest is ended."}

While initially met as just a golden skull, he can be reconstructed in the &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Kangaxx%27s%20body\"&gt;Restore Kangaxx's body&lt;/a&gt; questline. His body has been dismembered by his enemies, with the pieces concealed in secret tombs found around the city of &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these tombs is guarded by a lich that must be defeated in order to retrieve Kangaxx's &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Torso\"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Arm%20and%20Leg\"&gt;parts&lt;/a&gt;.\nKangaxx the Lich.\nWhen Kangaxx first arises from his tomb, he is a fairly standard &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, albeit more powerful. He wears the mighty &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Gaxx\"&gt;Ring of Gaxx&lt;/a&gt; which grants him moderate regeneration, bonuses to his &lt;a href=\"armor%20class\"&gt;armor class&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt; values, and provides some &lt;a href=\"magic%20resistance\"&gt;magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Kangaxx the Lich also has a unique ability to &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; and stealthy creatures. No form of invisibility will prevent Kangaxx from detecting or 'seeing\" a creature in its visual range. The statistics given in the info box factor in the final adjusted values provided by the equipped &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Gaxx\"&gt;Ring of Gaxx&lt;/a&gt;. If the ring is \"pickpocketed\", which is only possible in the original BG2 game, then the stats will be different. See the Ring description for values.\nBe advised to have at least one party member not under the effects of the &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Undead\"&gt;Protection From Undead&lt;/a&gt; scroll because, once Kangaxx is down to 1 &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, he stops fighting and speaks to the party before revealing his true form. This is fixed in the Enhanced Editions, however there are still reports of bugs with this change. \nGameplay.\nThe goal in this battle is to get Kangaxx the lich down to 1 hit point so it triggers the dialogue and form change to Kangaax the Demilich. Then, defeat the Demilich form.\nThe first form is equipped with the &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt;, so it can't actually be killed (such as from the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Disruption\"&gt;Mace of Disruption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azuredge\"&gt;Azuredge&lt;/a&gt; or similar), and it has many immunities in addition to the usual lich immunities. Focus on dealing hit point damage to the lich form. \nOnce the lich has finished his opening dialogue, he'll apply his instantly cast protective spell chain, and then the battle is on. See the InfoBox for a listing of scripted spell usage by the lich, and the general conditions for certain spells to be attempted.\nKangaxx has some staying power by way of his uninterruptible spell triggers, but only for so long. As it is immune to &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; 1 through 5 spells, a &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; spell won't work, so taking down its Stoneskin or Protection from Magical Weapons defenses can only be done via a powerful &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect. Alternatively, the player can just wait for the &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; spell (he'll have two of these) to expire.\nAs long as a party member can survive its spell attacks, then the character can occupy its attention and just accumulate enough damage to trigger the form transition.\nKangaxx the lich is probably most dangerous if it can cast its &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;. Just before or during the pause in time, it will probably apply one of its Spell Triggers with a &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;. The Remove magic can probably dispel anyone in the area of effect if they aren't protected with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Abjuration&lt;/a&gt;.\nKangaxx's artificial intelligence has almost no ability to recognize any protections, or immunities present on any party members. The undead mage will just try and perform its scripted actions without any evaluation or assessment functions shaping their use or targeting. Typically, the closest enemy to the undead will bear the brunt of its attacks.\nKangaxx only has a single Remove Magic available to take down any party magic. It uses no spell removers or Breach. The player should be able to get one or more party members completely immune to everything the lich can possibly attack with and just outlast it while damaging the undead being down to 1 hit point. \nKeep vulnerable party members away from the lich, and protected characters up close. \nIf in the unlikely event that Kangaxx the lich has run out of spells, yet is still functioning, it will try and close and then attack with its melee touch attack. \nWhen Kangaxx is reduced to 1 hit point, this should trigger a form change as well as a screen shake animation. A few moments later new dialogue will be presented:\nMod content for Kangaxx the lich.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises Kangaxx the Lich, and especially if you have installed the \"Smarter Mages\" component. The game difficulty setting will determine some of the challenge level abilities used by the Lich. Kangaax has the of the unmodded lich's statistics, equipment and protections. The mod raises the lich's level to 30 and assigns a &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; kit. SCS revises the memorized spell selection and a new default AI to provide it with smarter tactics. It will also have recognition capabilities to assess its enemies' protections and vulnerabilities for more intelligent offensive and defensive behavior.\nSCS has provided the following changes from the unmodded creature:\nKangaxx will near instantly be able to get several spells off in only 1 or 2 seconds, including &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Magic Energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and the \"Fear Aura\" and so forth. \nSoon after, it will deploy a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; and several magic stripping casts like &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; and probably a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt; and or an &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;. The party will be on the defensive very soon. \nKangaxx has five level 9 spells memorized including &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;. Kangaax also uses &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blades%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Energy Blades (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; as missile weapons in between spell casts. If the party leaves the lich's chamber and rests, then Kangaxx will be fully healed and rested as well. \nIn SCS, a &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt; will take down a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection From Magic&lt;/a&gt; scroll. Kangaxx also uses &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt; to strip protections based on what an opponent is evaluate to be protected from. The lich will not waste time or spell casts on an opponent invulnerable to one of its attacks or spells - and try another tactic or select another target.\nKangaxx the Demilich.\nOnce Kangaxx transitions into his demilich form \u2013 which is essentially just a floating skull \u2013 the party is in for a potentially difficult fight. Kangaxx the Demilich is immune to level 1-9 spells, 90% resistant to all &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt; and he can't be hit by any weapon with less than a +4 enchantment. On top of that, his &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt; values are all 2 steps better than in his lich form, except save vs. spell, which is worse. All values in the info box reflect the Ring of Gaxx's passive benefits.\nSince Kangaxx the Demilich is still wearing the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Gaxx\"&gt;Ring of Gaxx&lt;/a&gt;, he regenerates hit point damage at a moderate rate.\nGameplay.\nOpening moves and how the demilich will attack you:\nThe demilich AI has a simple and basic combat script. It actually only does three things. It looks for target in sight, then automatically and uninterruptedly force-casts either the demilich howl or the trap soul innate spells. It begins the battle with a demi-lich Howl. There are timers between each use of the innate spells, and when the timer is at zero, the cycle repeats. This cycle will continue until the creature is destroyed, or the party is dead. \nThe script is so basic, that the Demilich will not evaluate or recognize any spell protections up and running. It will attack without any adjustments or other refinements. It will not know if you are protected from imprisonment or instant death effects, or if you have Spell Turning up. So, take that into account in your planning, and you should be able to win this contest. \nAbout the two attack methods:\nFrom an offensive standpoint, the demilich form can and will cast an Imprisonment or Demi-Lich Howl - these are innate abilities and cannot be disrupted.\n&lt;a href=\"Imprisonment%20%28Trap%20the%20Soul%29\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;: With a range of 10 feet and a casting time of 1, this level 9 spell power ability from the abjuration school and disabling type - will imprison one creature. The imprisonment effect is unaffected by magic resistance and cannot be dispelled. There is no saving throw. The ability works on all summoned and gated creatures, who do not get a saving throw either. The creature has a limitless supply of this innate spell (reference SPIN788.SPL and referenced in the AI script as \"DEMILICH_TRAP_SOUL\").\n&lt;a href=\"Demilich%20Howl\"&gt;Demilich Howl&lt;/a&gt;: This level 9 innate spell power effect will instantly kill any creature not protected from Instant Death upon a failed saving throw vs. Death/Poison (similar to &lt;a href=\"Wail%20of%20the%20Banshee\"&gt;Wail of the Banshee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death&lt;/a&gt;). This ability has a speed of 9 and is a Necromancy Spell School Offensive Damage type. The ability can be blocked by magic resistance. The area of effect for the Howl is basically anyone in earshot of the Demilich, and that's about half of the entire crypt area where the Demilich is found. This Howl cannot be blocked by Spell Protections such as Spell Turning or Spell Trap. The demilich has a limitless supply of this innate spell. (Reference SPIN789.SPL and referenced in the AI script as \"DEMILICH_DEATH\").\nThe demilich's defensive abilities.\nThis creature receives passive \"always on\" and non dispellable powers from items equipped in certain slots. The items are not droppable or stealable (except for the Ring of Gaax in the basic BG2). These items are:\nThe info box above lists all of the immunities and specific spell it has protection from, which are in most cases as stringent and protective as his initial Kangaxx Lich form. There are a few differences however:\nMod content regarding Kangaxx the Demilich.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises Kangaxx the Demilich, and is now a fully capable spell-casting Necromancer. The power of this creature is especially seen if you have installed the \"Smarter Mages\" component. The game difficulty setting will determine some of the challenge level abilities used by the demilich. SCS revises the memorized spell selection and a new default AI to provide it with smarter tactics. It will also have recognition capabilities to assess its enemies' protections and vulnerabilities for more intelligent offensive and defensive behavior.\nSCS has provided the following changes from the unmodded creature:\nFear Aura ability (DW#LICFI.SPL) instantly casts in a 30' radius from the demilich. It causes a short-term &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; effect reaction. It is a &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;level 0&lt;/a&gt; innate ability. A save vs. Spell negates. It is unaffected by magic resistance. This Fear Aura is deployed almost immediately after the first battery of contingency protections are implemented. As the effect is not magical, it cannot be dispelled. This fear aura is a 2nd edition D&amp;D power added to all SCS Liches.\nInstead of Imprisonment, it can attack with Demilich Soul Trap: Rather than a permanent Imprisonment, the target is under a &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; Spell Effect. It also drains the target of 4 Energy levels. It bypasses magic resistance. A save vs. spells at -4 penalty will prevent the maze effect, but there is no save against the level drain. Standard spell protections are advised to prevent this level 9 spell from getting through to a party member, or protection from energy drain. It is an Abjuration school spell effect. This spell is not a touch range spell but ranged at 60 feet. (reference SPIN788.SPL but re-done by SCS)\nA new version of Demi-Lich Howl can be cast in a 30-foot radius around the Demilich. Any enemy creature will be instantly killed failing a save vs. Death with a -4 penalty. The innate level 9 spell power ignores magic resistance. Spell protections will not prevent exposure, however boosting saving throws or &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt; would be good counters. This is a Necromancer School spell effect. Note that Kangaxx is a Necromancer, so the saving throw penalty will be at -6 for non-Necromancer party members. (reference SPIN789.SPL but re-done by SCS).\nKangaxx the Demilich will near instantly (via a contingency) be able to get several spells off in only 1 second, including &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Magic Energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and the \"Fear Aura\" and so forth. \nSoon after, it will deploy a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; and several magic stripping casts like &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; and probably a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt; and or an &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;. \nKangaxx has several level 9 spells memorized including &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; . It also uses &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blades%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Energy Blades (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; as missile weapons in between spell casts. If the party leaves the lich's chamber and rests, then Kangaxx the Demilich will be fully healed and rested as well. \nIn SCS, a &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt; will take down a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection From Magic&lt;/a&gt; scroll. Kangaxx also uses &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khelben%27s%20Warding%20Whip\"&gt;Khelben's Warding Whip&lt;/a&gt; to strip protections based on what an opponent is evaluated to be protected from. The demilich will not waste time or spell casts on an opponent invulnerable to one of its attacks or spells and try another tactic or select another target.\nSCS's More Consistent Breach module allows a &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; Spell to affect any Lich, or Demilich. SCS also implements blocking Breach Spells using spell protections that deflect or turn level five (5) spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Archons\"&gt;Shield of the Archons&lt;/a&gt;.\nSCS Changes the Enchantment Level of &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteors&lt;/a&gt; from +6 to +2, which means they cannot strike a Demilich. This is done to align with the D&amp;D 2nd Edition Ruleset for this Spell. This is a component choice to install or not. It isn't a core change; in case you don't want it.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed, most of the demilich's memorized spells will the SR versions.\nNote that since Demilich creatures with SCS have 100% Magic resistance and are mostly protected from &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; spell effects 1 through 9, the spells &lt;a href=\"Sunray\"&gt;Sunray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Bolt of Glory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"False%20Dawn\"&gt;False Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, which are usually terrific against Undead - will probably not affect a Demilich. This means that the &lt;a href=\"Daystar\"&gt;Daystar&lt;/a&gt; sword or the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Brilliance\"&gt;Helm of Brilliance&lt;/a&gt; will not be viable attack options. The Monk's &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Soulray\"&gt;Sun Soulray&lt;/a&gt; will only be able to do a small quantity of elemental fire damage, and the bulk of the spell will be blocked. &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Soulbeam\"&gt;Sun Soulbeam&lt;/a&gt; can be affected by magic resistance as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Restore%20Kangaxx%27s%20body\"&gt;Restore Kangaxx's body&lt;/a&gt;.\nSearch Athkatla for the hidden pieces of Kangaxx's body so the lich can finally be destroyed.\nFor further player thoughts, strategies or tactics, see the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Talk%3AKangaxx\"&gt;Kangaxx - Talk page&lt;/a&gt;\nAchievements.\nA Battle for the Ages.\nDefeat Kangaxx the Demilich."}

Sometimes the party exits the area before the messenger can fulfill its role.\nIf the player believes that this may have occurred, as a long time has passed and the stronghold quests aren't progressing - then consider first to speak with Major Domo, and if that doesn't move things along, try spawning the keep messenger using the &lt;a href=\"Console\"&gt;Console&lt;/a&gt;.

The damage seems minor, but it's able to bypass most defenses thus can be useful against tough enemies with high resistances, such as &lt;a href=\"Demogorgon\"&gt;Demogorgon&lt;/a&gt;. In recent versions of Enhanced Edition, striking a caster protected by Fire Shield with Hallowed Redeemer will cause an infinite loop of retaliation damage between the striker and struck until either are dead. Granting Keldorn 100% or greater resistance to Fire/Cold allows him to slay casters protected by Fire Shield in one swing, unless they too have 100% resistance.\nYou may want to give him &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20Dexterity\"&gt;Gauntlets of Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; to boost his armor class, or utilize his two-handed weapon reach to let him attack from behind a tanker, saving the gauntlets for another member in need.\nPersonality.\nHis long service has made him an experienced, wise character and he may act as a father figure. He has guided many knights-to-be, including &lt;a href=\"Ajantis%20Ilvastarr\"&gt;Ajantis Ilvastarr&lt;/a&gt; and he is currently guiding &lt;a href=\"Anomen%20Delryn\"&gt;Anomen Delryn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn general, he can get along with good aligned and neutral aligned characters, with the exception for &lt;a href=\"Nalia%20de%27Arnise\"&gt;Nalia de'Arnise&lt;/a&gt;. At the start, his relations with Anomen are strained, but if he manages to get knighted, he and Keldorn get more cordial. His relations with evil aligned characters are rather hostile, he may even come to blows with some of them.\nTrivia.\nRoughly a hundred years later, Keldorn's memory is still referenced in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20III\"&gt;Baldur's Gate III&lt;/a&gt; by a depiction of a mailed fist that the cult of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Absolute\"&gt;The Absolute&lt;/a&gt; keeps near &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nKeldorn can be romanced with Berelinde's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.gibberlings3.net/mods/npcs/keldorn/\"&gt;Keldorn Romance&lt;/a&gt; mod."}

This class kit has some major disadvantages and advantages, as they cannot wear any &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; or , &lt;a href=\"helmets\"&gt;helmets&lt;/a&gt; (but they can wear other &lt;a href=\"headgear\"&gt;headgear&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"ioun%20stones\"&gt;ioun stones&lt;/a&gt;, although in EE these do not provide protection from critical hits), &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; and they can't use any ranged weapons except throwing axes, daggers and hammers.\nTheir only character ability is Strength, but you should obviously try to max out Dexterity and Constitution to increase their survivability. The advanced weapon specialisation allows them to spend over two points on weapons skills, which only single- or dual-classed fighters may do. The major advantages of this class are that they gain every three levels, a bonus to damage and THAC0\u00a0of +1 and -1 speed factor bonus for weapon every four levels. They also have -2 armor class bonus right from the start. Also, they can use the ability &lt;a href=\"Kai\"&gt;Kai&lt;/a&gt;, which temporarily maxes their weapon damage.\nThe inability to wear armor or use shields makes Kensai very similar to &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, but the Kensai has more health due to a better hit dice and extra hitpoints with a 17+ constitution and becomes steadily more accurate and damaging with his melee weapons.\nThe Kensai is perhaps the most popular choice for dual-classing into a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; since they have some of the highest damage in the game but lack the ability to equip armor. This works well with mage dual-classing as magic will provide most of the protection and immunities the Kensai lack. Their disadvantage is that they don't become particularly powerful until fairly high level. At higher levels and with the increased level cap in , you can wait longer before dual-classing, giving the Kensai much higher damage without relying on a limited-per-day ability like Enrage, which also have some negative effects. They can also further increase their damage with Kai. Furthermore, they will now have access to all the magic they need for almost absolute protection, especially with the right equipment.\nA Kensai dual-classed into a Thief becomes deadly at high levels, as his Kai ability works well with &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; attacks and the &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; high level thief ability allows you to override all of a Kensai's armor and weapon restrictions. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Amulet\"&gt;Shield Amulet&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular item used to improve the Kensai's defenses.

For all other races, these numbers will be slightly different.\nAdvanced Weapon Specialization.\nAdvanced Weapon Specialization raises the number of points that can be invested into a specific proficiency from one point to five points. As a result, fighters may do more damage and hit more often with weapons from the specific proficiency. For more information on proficiency points, see &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20proficiency\"&gt;Weapon proficiency&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kai\"&gt;Kai&lt;/a&gt;.\nKai allows the Kensai's weapons to do maximum damage for ten seconds after the activation of the ability.

For all warrior classes and &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s, the pool of abilities consists of abilities which can be accessed from the special abilities menu which can be used during battle.

Hmm, it's not often I get people barging into my shop. It's the reason I chose such a remote locale for my research, after all\". You many now inquire about his smithing, research and purpose, but Kerrick isn't very forthcoming. At some point you may ask him if he could make you some armor or weapons. He says he could with the appropriate materials. You may ask him \"Do I have the appropriate material you need?\" and the gnome responds \"Well, let me see your belongings.

It is mostly similar to &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Word\"&gt;Secret Word&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of its utility, it can remove one of the listed spell protections each round, for the duration of the spell - a total of three rounds and three spell protections.\nWhen the spell is cast on a target, a spell removal animation graphic is played over the target, and a text message is displayed on the combat log reading: \"Spell Protections Removed\". This text appears even if the target had no spell protections present, and even if there were multiple spell protections active. Only one spell protection will be removed (from the list in the spell description above) each round. \nA &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; will block this spell, and then the shield will be consumed.

The party mage casts Khelben's Warding Whip which connects with the enemies Spell Shield. The shield is consumed, and the warding whip is finished as well. Only the Spell Shield was removed, and the Warding Whip spell is done with.\nExample 2: - A creature protected by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; is struck by Khelben's Warding Whip. The initial hit removes the Spell Deflection. The next round it might be either Minor Globe or Spell immunity (random), and on the third round, whichever spell protection remains will be removed.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its Spell School, effects, and description.

Every round thereafter, until the duration of the spell expires, another spell protection will be removed from the target. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. The target\u2019s magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.\nThe spell protection spells dispelled by Khelben\u2019s Warding Whip are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, and Mind Blank.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod Khelben's Warding Whip can't target invisible or hidden creatures (with SCS or SR or both mods) without first exposing or revealing the target creature."}

Vorpal weapons rely on this effect to sever an opponent's head in a single blow. \nNote: It is not the only status effect that kills a creature instantly -- other contenders are &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate%20effect\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill%20%28effect%29\"&gt;Power Word Kill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slay\"&gt;Slay&lt;/a&gt;. The party should be immune to them in Story mode.\nGameplay.\nAs is true with all status effects, application details vary depending on source -- what is causing the effect. The source sometimes allows a saving throw, applies Kill target only to &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures, or through a weapon on-hit effect. Check the source you're interested in for such details. It is likely to help find ways to prevent Kill target from being applied to party members, so they don't have to resist it explicitly using one of the means described in this article.\nIn addition to the death effect on the creature, the Kill target status effect provides several \"Death Type' values that can be coded into the item, spell, or ability that is causing it. the status effect also allows a Text notification. See below:\nInstantly kills the targeted creature(s), in the style specified by the 'Death Type' value.\nKnown values for 'Text Notification' are:\n0 Show death message\n1 Don't show death message\nKnown values for 'Death Type' are:\n0 Acid death\n1 Burning death\n2 Crushed death\n4 Normal death\n8 Chunked death\n16 Stoned death\n32 Freezing death\n64 Exploding stoned death\n128 Exploding freezing death\n256 Electrified death \n512 Disintegration death\nSome of these death types will permanently destroy the creature, as well as carried loot (except items flagged as 'Critical'). Party members that are killed in the Death Types of \"chunked\" or \"exploding\" are typically not revivable via &lt;a href=\"Harper%27s%20Call\"&gt;Harper's Call&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Dead\"&gt;Raise Dead&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Resurrection\"&gt;Resurrection&lt;/a&gt; type magics.\nGeneral Prevention.\nResisting &lt;a href=\"Opcode\"&gt;Opcode&lt;/a&gt; 13 from a player's standpoint can be done with the spell &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt;. Often times an Opcode 13 instant death status effect allows a saving throw versus Death, so boosting saving throws can help. Some spell effects that include instant death may be defended against with magic resistance, and some may not, such as Vorpal Hits from a Planetar's Weapon. The &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Shielding\"&gt;Potion of Magic Shielding&lt;/a&gt; adds +20 bonus to all saving throws, so you essentially will (almost) certainly not miss a saving throw.

The monster might appear to be a chest or similar container at first view. It is only later, when an unwary creature nears the innocuous looking object (perhaps seeking to open the container) that the monster is revealed as a hostile attacker.\nWhile typical mimics use a strong sticky secretion to immobilize their prey while further restraining them with their pseudopods, the Killer mimics encountered herein only utilize innate spells as a method of restraining and attacking their prey. Although these killer mimics possess a melee attack capability that inflicts 3d4 &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt; with a +2 &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; bonus, the ability hasn't been activated for use by the dungeon masters. Instead they're given \"mimic spells\", some of which are ranged spell attacks that attempt to &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; the victim before attacking with a ranged, acid-based spell. Other killer mimics will only attack with a definitive ranged spell with no initial attempt at paralysis first.\nGameplay.\nAll Killer Mimics are stationary and remain within the container it has imitated - mimics have poor defenses, and no special immunities. The mimics from \"Dead Man's Pass\" and the \"Umar Hills Cave\" are slightly weaker than those encountered in \"Watcher's Keep\"."}

The InfoBox makes some notes regarding each version's values.\nIf for any reason the party has caused the city to become hostile (such as by refusing to help the King) or by attacking the sahguagin loyal to the king, then the initial version of the creature will be the opponent faced. \nThe initial version of the King attacks the nearest opponent with its equipped slashing weapon, which it wields with five &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;. That's all the King can do in battle.\nIf the party sided with the rebels and is in combat with the King, it will be the other creature version, who is armed with the &lt;a href=\"Impaler\"&gt;Impaler&lt;/a&gt; - but only gets two Attacks per round.\nNotes.\nIn the King's possession is the &lt;a href=\"Magical%20Rope\"&gt;Magical Rope&lt;/a&gt;, an item required for the party to leave the Underwater City. Resolving the sahuagin conflict is one way for the party to acquire the rope, but they can also simply pickpocket it from the King or kill him for it.\nThe King also has the &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin%20Treasury%20Key\"&gt;treasury key&lt;/a&gt;, which can also be pickpocketed from him. This key allows the party to pillage the treasury, which contains another copy of the Magical Rope, the &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Lordly%20Might\"&gt;Rod of Lordly Might&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin%20Scribe%27s%20Notes\"&gt;Sahuagin Scribe's Notes&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party helps King Ixilthetocal kill &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Villynaty\"&gt;Prince Villynaty&lt;/a&gt;, he will reward the party with the Magical Rope, the Rod of Lordly Might, and the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20Crushing\"&gt;Gauntlets of Crushing&lt;/a&gt;, before leaving the area for good.\nBugs.\nThere are some less than optimal scripting issues regarding various items that can be obtained in this area. They do not generally result in any game crashes or broken scripts, however there may be multiple identical items (when there are supposed to be just a single instance of the item). \nThis can be manifested if the party performs pickpocketing of items from key figures (like the King or Prince). The party might end up with two &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Lordly%20Might\"&gt;Rod of Lordly Might&lt;/a&gt;, or multiple &lt;a href=\"Magical%20Rope\"&gt;Magical Rope&lt;/a&gt;, or even two &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Key\"&gt;Treasure Key&lt;/a&gt; items. Just be aware that this can occur. The party can always just dump any duplicates on the ground before they depart this area to \"self-correct\" unnecessary duplicate items cluttering up the backpack.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes some changes. The King is assigned a Fighter Class, and has five pips in Spear Weapon proficiency and 2 pips in two-handed fighting style. The creatures strength is increased to 24. The initial version of the King no longer uses the slashing attack but wields an undroppable +2 Spear that can inflict a &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; effect unless a save vs. Death is made, dealing 2 damage per second for 15 seconds. The King also gets one use of &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Whirlwind Attack&lt;/a&gt; at the start of battle. There are random potions available for the King to quaff during battle for boosting abilities and for healing damage.\nThe second King version is similar to the first with SCS. if siding with the rebels the King uses the Impaler and allows a &lt;a href=\"Power%20Attack\"&gt;Power Attack&lt;/a&gt; use by the King. Potions are also scripted for quaffing.\nThere may be some SCS random treasure in the King's inventory, and with the Icewind Dale spells component installed, an IWD scroll."}

You can quite easily walk right past him on the path in that area without noticing him being there.\nGameplay.\nKivan is a good archer, not as good as &lt;a href=\"Coran\"&gt;Coran&lt;/a&gt;, but better than\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Khalid\"&gt;Khalid&lt;/a&gt; (*). His high &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; score lets him equip composite longbows by default, it can also be put into good use by making him a melee candidate as the damage output of most range weapons don't &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Class\"&gt;scale with&lt;/a&gt; strength except slings, throwing daggers or axes.\n(*) Khalid is a superior archer if you cast strength on him to equip a composite longbow, specially the composite longbow +1 from Beregost. As a fighter he levels up faster and his extra pips in longbow will make him shoot faster and hit harder, with no silly timers.\nHe starts with Stealth at 41, the special ability &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Animal\"&gt;Charm Animal&lt;/a&gt; (x1), his racial enemy is &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;."}

Some of its modules are dependent on yet other mods and might break the game if those are not installed beforehand. Read the readme carefully before installing.\nThe following text is copied from the mod page.\nContent Changes.\nThe Gloves of Goodman Hayes.\nWith this component, &lt;a href=\"Cromwell\"&gt;Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; can transform those awful &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Goodman%20Hayes\"&gt;Robe of Goodman Hayes&lt;/a&gt; into a much more useful pair of . While the robes are an interesting choice for a&lt;a href=\"%20Wild%20Mage\"&gt; Wild Mage&lt;/a&gt; they simply cannot compete with the many overall better alternatives. At least now they do not become obsolete quite as quickly.\nThe Manual of War.\nIntroduces an ancient magical tome that, with some effort (HINT: and some WISDOM), can grant the reader extraordinary powers. The book can be found in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ulcaster\"&gt;Ulcaster&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irenicus's Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; Dungeon (if the player has it in their possession on import) or in the depths of &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt; (if it was not already found earlier). But simply finding it is not enough. Try talking to the local scholars and mages to unlock its powers.\nPrepared Wishes.\nAllows extra-ordinarily talented spell-casters to prepare &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; spells with a predictable outcome. Which wishes can be prepared depends on the caster's &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wisdom\"&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt; scores. But no wish is reliable without experience. Spellcasters below level 31 will have an increasing chance to mess up and might cast a random wish instead. However, for high-level &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;wizards&lt;/a&gt; this can strip away a lot of the tedium usually required for wishing. Just cast a regular Wish spell and ask the &lt;a href=\"Djinni\"&gt;Djinni&lt;/a&gt; for a special contract to get started.\nRomance Cheat: Isra will Romance Neutral Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Isra%20NPC%20for%20BGII\"&gt;Isra NPC for BGII&lt;/a&gt; will no longer miraculously divine your true alignment without even trying. Maybe you have a reputation of 20, but are not a \"good\" person... How would she know this? Unless she secretly used divine powers on you, which is a big taboo in most parties. Now she is no longer quite as picky.\nWarning: This component requires external mod.\nGive Hexxat an Inactive Fighter Class.\n&lt;a href=\"Hexxat\"&gt;Hexxat&lt;/a&gt; gains an inactive &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; class of level 13, complete with weapon specializations. This makes her very powerful and might be considered a cheat.\nAppropriate XP Rewards for Cowled Enforcers.\nUsually, killing &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizards&lt;/a&gt;] nets you very meager XP values. Each one of them should be worth a few thousand XP at least.\nCtB: Skip Candlekeep Chores and intro cutscenes.\nThe Mega-Mod Check the Bodies adds a lot of content to the game, some of it of questionable quality. For instance, Candlekeep Chores and the retrospective cutscenes at the start of the game are simply dull and annoying and kill the pacing. This component removes both from the game. You're welcome.\nWarning: This component requires external mod\nCtB: Remove Venereal Disease.\nCheck the Bodies can punish female player characters by giving them a disease for having a consensual sexual encounter with an unsavoury individual. From a roleplaying perspective, this might be an OK thing to include if you could get rid of it again. And if it was actually funny instead of creepy. None of these caveats apply, because it's it happens without warning and because it doesn't work like any other disease in the game. This kind of thing is just generally a bad idea and not something a lot people want to see in their game. This component removes this disease, as well as its implicit slut-shaming, from the game.\nWarning: This component requires external mod\nCtB: Fixed Harp of Myth Drannor.\nThe item is currently completely broken and non-functional. This component fixes that.\nWarning: This component requires external mod\nRoT: Remove cutscenes from Chateau Irenicus.\nBefore you can even start playing the game proper, Region of Terror bombards the player with far too many tedious and annoying cutscenes that have nothing to do with the actual story of the game, which hurts the pacing a lot. This component removes at least the cutscenes in Irenicus' dungeon.\nWarning: This component requires external mod\nGameplay Tweaks and Fixes.\nThese components attempt to change the way in which existing effects are applied.\nStreamlined Wizard Spell Progression.\nAttempts to streamline and extend &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; spell progression. As a result the progression will be less arbitrary and continues up to level 50.\nPlease check the packaged \"readme\" for details.\nStreamlined Sorcerer Spell Progression.\nAttempts to streamline and extend &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; spell progression. As a result the progression will be less arbitrary and continues up to level 50.\nPlease check the \"packagedreadme\" for details.\nNo Item &lt;a href=\"Depreciation%20rate\"&gt;Deprecation&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\nWith this component, it's no longer necessary to hoard your treasure before you sell it. Whether you sell that &lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Long Sword +1&lt;/a&gt; now or later (in bulk) no longer makes a difference. The selling prices of items never degrade.\nIdentify all store items.\nIn heavily modded games, it can sometimes happen that sell unidentified items. This component corrects any such oversights.\nFix Wild Mage Items and Spells.\nSome of the &lt;a href=\"wild%20mage\"&gt;wild mage&lt;/a&gt; items and spells, especially in heavily modded games, can be implemented incorrectly. They don't grant a bonus to &lt;a href=\"wild%20surge\"&gt;wild surge&lt;/a&gt; rolls, but instead limit them to a specific value. This component ensures that all known wild mage items and spells function as expected.\nPrevent Wish Spells from Interrupting Caster.\nNormally, Wish spells take effect by being cast through the djinni's summoner. If the summoner has started casting another spell in the meantime, this may interrupt them. This component ensures that the actual Wish effects happen independent of the caster, thus solving the problem. The actual Wish effects are not modified and will remain in their current (possibly already modded) form.\nStandardize Poison Immunity.\nAscertains that any , or with poison damage resistance also has immunity to any poison effects, and vice versa.\nFree Action does not prevent Haste or Movement Rate Bonus.\n&lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Free Action&lt;/a&gt; items and spell will no longer disallow &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; spells or movement rate bonuses. Note that item descriptions are not updated.\nDrop Equipment on Disintegration.\nForces all spells that cause &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;disintegration&lt;/a&gt; to first drop the victim's equipment.\nDrop Equipment on Petrification.\nForces all spells that cause &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20to%20Stone\"&gt;petrification&lt;/a&gt; to first drop the victim's equipment.\nDrop Equipment on Imprisonment.\nForces all spells that cause &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; to first drop the victim's equipment. Unlike disintegration or petrification, however, this cannot be done instantaneaously. Therefore equipment will only be dropped if the imprisonment effect is not immediate. In other words, this will make NPCs drop their equipment in more than 99% of all cases.\nTreat all Innate Abilities as Non-Magical (Unaffected by Wild/Dead Magic and Silence).\nEnsures that innate abilities are not affected by dead/wild magic zones or &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge\"&gt;surges&lt;/a&gt;. In Ehanced Editions or if TobEx is installed, these abilities will also work for silenced creatures. This means that changing into the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Whirlwind Attack&lt;/a&gt; can no longer trigger wild surges or be surpressed by Silence spells.\nTreat all &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; types as Non-Magical (Unaffected by Wild/Dead Magic and Silence).\nEnsures that psionic abilities are not affected by dead/wild magic zones or &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge\"&gt;surges&lt;/a&gt;. In Ehanced Editions or if TobEx is installed, these abilities will also work for silenced creatures. This mostly means that &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;mindflayers&lt;/a&gt; can use their abilities when silenced and without causing wild surges.\nTreat all Bardsong Effects as Non-Magical (Unaffected by Wild/Dead Magic).\nEnsures that bardic abilities songs are not affected by dead/wild magic zones or surges.\nAllow Arcane Spellcasting in Armor.\nAllows unhindered casting in any . Basically a cheat.\nAllow Thievery in Armor.\nAllows unhindered thieving skill in any . Basically a cheat.\nRemove Delay from Improved Haste Spells.\nRemoves that pesky 1-second delay from all &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nReputation has no Effect on Store Prices.\nYour &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; no longer has any influence on the prices in stores.\nCharisma has a stronger Effect on Store Prices.\nIn an a &lt;a href=\"Charisma\"&gt;Charisma&lt;/a&gt; score of higher than 18 has no effect whatsoever in dialogues and a score of higher than 20 has no further effect on store prices. This component aims to give Charisma a bit more impact by increasing the effect it has on store prices, granting ever-growing discount rates for Charisma values of up to 25 (up to 40% discount-rates).\nModal Buff AI Script.\nAdds an AI script that makes pre-combat buffing extremely quick and convenient. Works best with the EEs and in older game versions with &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.shsforums.net/topic/53579-detectable-spells/\"&gt;Detectable Spells&lt;/a&gt; installed (comes with many mods, including SCS).\nFamiliars can sort magical scrolls (Enhanced Editions only).\nYour &lt;a href=\"Find%20Familiar\"&gt;Familiar&lt;/a&gt; can help you sort more than 500 from all EEs and a large variety of mods. Simple talk to them and have a little patience. The scrolls will be taken from your inventory and dropped at the familiar's feet in a single pile.\nNote that stolen scrolls will be marked as unstolen by this process and that it can sometimes happen that a few too many scrolls are placed.\nCosmetic Changes.\nMute Kelsey's Romance Music.\nMutes &lt;a href=\"Kelsey\"&gt;Kelsey's&lt;/a&gt; romance score.\nWarning: This component requires external mod.\nMute Xan's Romance Music.\nMutes &lt;a href=\"Xan\"&gt;Xan&lt;/a&gt;'s romance score.\nWarning: This component requires external mod.\nMute Adrian's Romance Music.\nMutes &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20NPC\"&gt;Adrian NPC&lt;/a&gt; romance score.\nWarning: This component requires external mod.\nMute Isra's Romance Music.\nMutes &lt;a href=\"Isra%20NPC%20for%20BGII\"&gt;Isra NPC for BGII&lt;/a&gt; romance score.\nWarning: This component requires external mod.\nMute &lt;a href=\"Kivan\"&gt;Kivan&lt;/a&gt;'s BG2 music tracks.\nMutes all music from the mod Kivan and Deheriana Companions for BG2.\nWarning: This component requires external mod.\nMute BG1 NPC Project music tracks.\nMutes all music from the &lt;a href=\"BG1%20NPC%20Project\"&gt;BG1 NPC Project&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarning: This component requires external mod.\nCtB: Mute the Cowled Wizard.\nMutes the &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizard\"&gt;Cowled Wizard&lt;/a&gt; from Check the Bodies. What he has to say is bad enough. But having to actually listen to him is somehow even worse.\nWarning: This component requires external mod.\nRemove Chaos Shield icons from all items.\nRemoves any and all &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Shield\"&gt;Chaos Shield&lt;/a&gt; icons from all items. This makes it easier to tell whether a Chaos Shield spell is in effect while such items are equipped.\nChange Appearance of &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Good%20Archmagi\"&gt;Robe of the Good Archmagi&lt;/a&gt;.\nChanges the general appearance of the robe to another one (Plate, Chain, Leather, Robe variations).\nChange Appearance of &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Neutral%20Archmagi\"&gt;Robe of the Neutral Archmagi&lt;/a&gt;.\nChanges the general appearance of the robe to another one (Plate, Chain, Leather, Robe variations).\nChange Appearance of &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Evil%20Archmagi\"&gt;Robe of the Evil Archmagi&lt;/a&gt;.\nChanges the general appearance of the robe to another one (Plate, Chain, Leather, Robe variations).\nChange Appearance of &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Vecna\"&gt;Robe of Vecna&lt;/a&gt;.\nChanges the general appearance of the robe to another one (Plate, Chain, Leather, Robe variations)."}

He is an invaluable aid against the many basilisks in the area, being undead and therefore immune to their petrification attacks, for as long as he remains friendly. He will, however, eventually turn hostile after 10 turns (2 hours game time, 10 minutes real time). He will also turn hostile if attacked by the party or their allies.\nHe doesn't truly \"join\" the party, so much as accompany and help. The dialogue pane gives the message \"Korax the Ghoul: Dire charmed\" when you accept his offer of help. So long as the charm holds, he is an ally.\nThat he will eventually turn hostile should come as no great surprise, given some of the very unsubtle hints he gives before he turns on you:\nYou must accept his offer when it is first made. Depending on your response, he will be either dead, permanently gone from the game, or a temporary ally.\nGameplay.\nSince Korax is a (unusually sentient) &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;, he shares their racial immunities to sleep, unconsciousness, and poison. Thus, it's possible to use the &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; scroll that Mutamin drops on &lt;a href=\"Lindin\"&gt;Lindin&lt;/a&gt;'s party in the same map, then Korax can enter the cloud and attack, basically clearing the entire map of all enemies and basilisks in one go (although you do need to be quick and not dilly dally before Korax flips his lid). The downside to this approach is you can't memorize Stinking Cloud to your spellbook, but it is possible for &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerers&lt;/a&gt; or challenge runs. \nDialogue.\n\"Wait, me no want fight, me Korax, me friend!\""}

Since he's a dwarf, he can further boost his Constitution up to 21 with the &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Dumathoin\"&gt;Helmet of Dumathoin&lt;/a&gt;, which grants an additional +1 to his hit points up to level 9 and grants slow health regeneration at a rate of 1 hit point every 50 seconds, similar to &lt;a href=\"Kagain\"&gt;Kagain&lt;/a&gt;. \nWith his high &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, he can equip any armour up to full plate, and use any shields up to large shields. As such, if the player &lt;a href=\"Importing\"&gt;imports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fallorain%27s%20Plate\"&gt;Fallorain's Plate&lt;/a&gt; from the first game, he can use it right away. \nHis &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt; ability is invaluable when fighting liches as it grants him 60 seconds of immunity to &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;, which liches use a lot.\nAs the only dwarf companion in the game, Korgan is the only character who can use the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Thrower\"&gt;Dwarven Thrower&lt;/a&gt; warhammer without &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; also being a dwarf (or a thief with the &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"high-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;high-level class ability&lt;/a&gt;). It makes a useful ranged weapon since his high Strength grants throwing weapons increased damage and his class kit prevents him from specialising in crossbows, long/shortbows or slings. Players who complete Neera's personal quests in \"Shadows of Amn\" can also give him &lt;a href=\"The%20Brick\"&gt;The Brick&lt;/a&gt;, which is useful for fighting enemy mages. \nAs Korgan is one of the only recruitable companions who can't cast spells or use scrolls, he should generally be given priority when it comes to armor and shields, especially magical ones, and is an ideal choice for spells like &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; to keep him alive as the party's primary tank. \nKorgan has the following items when he joins: a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe%20%2B1\"&gt;battle axe +1&lt;/a&gt;, 20 &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Axe\"&gt;Throwing Axe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Splint%20Mail\"&gt;splint mail&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Helmet\"&gt;Helmet&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Small%20Shield\"&gt;Small Shield&lt;/a&gt;.

However, there are certain conversations that can reveal a slightly more thoughtful, sophisticated, and even soft side to him (some of the later conversations he can have with &lt;a href=\"Mazzy%20Fentan\"&gt;Mazzy&lt;/a&gt;, for example). His desire to kill largely overshadows this other side of him, however."}

He enjoys exchanging banters with his companions, and shows quite the sharp tongue for it, with little respect for the faith or beliefs of others. His skill with an axe is admired by everyone, and Korgan himself is quite fond of other fighters in the party, particularly of Mazzy. He is somewhat dismissive of mages, as expected from a berserker dwarf, and despises weakness, being thus completely adverse to Aerie's presence in the party. Despite his uncouthness, Korgan still shows occasionally some sense and sensibility, even disarming the proud and noble warrior Mazzy with sudden bouts of poetry.\nSurprisingly, while Korgan is Chaotic-evil he gets along rather well with everyone else in the party, only getting in conflict with Aerie, who'll eventually leave the party to flee his relentless bullying.

It seems as though the githyanki are still tracking down their holy of holies - the Silver Blade.\nKruin's odd and amusing manner of speech will lead to a back and forth. In the end, the player must decide if they will give up the blade to the gith's or refuse and keep it. They clearly really, really want to get it back. The choice is yours.\nIf returned, Kruin departs with some final words, and turns invisible and disappears, but no reward.\nIf the party refuses or threaten the gith's then Kruin triggers a manifestation of his allied group, who will appear with a teleport animation in a somewhat random grouping in the local area.

The monitor moves at hyper accelerated speed and will rush up to the party members to attack.\nExpect the Kuo-toan wizard and priest creatures to initiate their opening preparatory spell buffs which are \"force cast\", and not usually interruptible.\nThe kuo-toa are actually divided into two groups. The initial one is basically on the bridge, while the second is across the bridge eastward.

It is also an area where some &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toa\"&gt;Kuo-toa&lt;/a&gt; reside, including a &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Prince\"&gt;Kuo-toan Prince&lt;/a&gt;. There are also some other encounters and an unexplored shrine to &lt;a href=\"Demogorgon\"&gt;Demogorgon&lt;/a&gt;. \nDescription.\nUpon entry into the Western Tunnels the party is able to observe a system of caverns with tall ceilings and vertical stone stalagmites and natural stone columns stretching from the cavern floor all the way up to the shadows above. Mineral infused water drips from above in many places. Various crater shaped sunken pools exist throughout, with soft light emanating from below. The source of the illumination is unknown but might be fungal phosphorescence or perhaps magma flows. Warm air can be felt if looking down within them. \nAmidst the natural features of the tunnels can be seen unknown rune carvings on the stone floor bed. Old hand-hewn stonework by previous civilizations is noted, expanding and shaping the natural tunnels with archways leading to chambers. Perhaps these are the work of the Kuo Toa, or maybe some other society.\nGameplay/abbreviated walkthrough.\nExploration of the Western Tunnels can be performed by the party at any time once in the Underdark. There is no required key or quest item to travel into the tunnels. However, it is most probably best visited and fully explored with the party under active disguise as drow from &lt;a href=\"Adalon\"&gt;Adalon&lt;/a&gt; - and with the &lt;a href=\"Recover%20the%20Silver%20Dragon%27s%20Eggs\"&gt;Recover the Silver Dragon's Eggs&lt;/a&gt; questline active. \nVisiting this area before getting the illusionary disguise enchantment from &lt;a href=\"Adalon\"&gt;Adalon&lt;/a&gt; will result in causing hostilities with the drow guardians before the exit gate. Although that won't prevent you from entering Ust Natha later, be aware that the fight with the drow can be a tough one (especially with &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;SCS&lt;/a&gt;), and later on there is an opportunity to get some assistance from Adalon.\nBeholder chamber.\nThe closest inhabited area to the Western Tunnel entry is a formed round chamber with a circular \"mote\" of water around the circumference. Cut stone makes up the floor, and unusual rectangular stones are positioned all around the perimeter. Carved etchings and round portals are seen on the walls. \nFloating above the floor are two &lt;a href=\"gauth\"&gt;gauth&lt;/a&gt; creatures and a &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholder&lt;/a&gt; - these monsters are not welcoming and will attack any detected party member. Their presence and purpose here is a mystery. If destroyed, no found items are available, and a search of the chamber reveals nothing that may be taken.\nCorrupted Tadpole chamber.\nTraveling further into the tunnels shows signs of recent activity, including webbed amphibious footprints, discarded bones, offal, scraps of unusual clothing, broken bolts and excrement. \nA tunnel leading to a formed round chamber (with only one point of ingress) is discovered. The chamber is bathed in a soft glow of light emanating from four formed stone pools or basins. The decor of the room indicates telltale signs of the Kuo-toa.\nWithin will be found a group of Kuo toa - the number and mix are determined by a spawn script that looks at the PC's experience point level and game difficulty selection (ref: SPWNTOA.bcs).\nThere could be just three &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Warrior\"&gt;Kuo-toan Warrior&lt;/a&gt; creatures, or up to two &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Warrior\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Kuo-Toa%20Monitor\"&gt;Monitors&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Whip\"&gt;Whip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. These hostile creatures will aggressively attack, and any spell casters in their group will launch opening pre-buffs and then go on the offensive at any detected party members. The kuo-toan monitors move at very fast speeds and will race after and follow party members. The &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Whip\"&gt;Kuo-toan Whip&lt;/a&gt; will be invisible at this time. Hidden party members will be exposed almost immediately by the creatures &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; and innate &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Invisibility\"&gt;Detect Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; powers.\nAfter these enemies are dispatched, their bodies can be looted for equipment and various treasures. Within the chamber are four pools in which swimming and wriggling tadpoles are visible, a cursor hovered over the pool displays a text: \"Tainted tadpoles swim in this pool. You may take some if you wish.\" Clicking on the pool will place an item in the party member's inventory/backpack labelled as Corrupted Tadpoles.\nNote that it is possible that additional kuo toa creatures, including the &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Prince\"&gt;Kuo-toan Prince&lt;/a&gt; may move out from their chamber and join the battle, before a party member can use the Corrupted Tadpoles. Some tactical speedy deployment of these tadpoles can mitigate having to face the fully-powered Prince.\nSea Mother's briny shrine and Kuo-toan Prince's tadpole pool.\nThe party can venture down another tunnel, passing more rune markings on the tunnel floor and this leads through an arched opening into another round chamber with etched marking on the floor, stagnant mini-moat, and two exits leading elsewhere. Within are another group of Kuo-toans. As before the numbers and composition of the group is determined by the game difficulty setting and the PC's experience point total. Expect six or seven opponents within - perhaps a Wizard and a Priest in the mix. Preparatory buffs will be cast, and all Kuo-toan will attack with melee weaponry and their &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Bolt\"&gt;Kuo-toan Bolt&lt;/a&gt; firing crossbows.\nTo the west in another chamber are three more opponents; a &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Whip\"&gt;Kuo-toan Whip&lt;/a&gt; and two warriors. \nA map note will display the following text: \"This briny pool is a place of worship for the kuo-toa. Here they make offerings to the Sea Mother.\"\nNo found items or additional events occur here.\nTo the east is a passage that leads to an area with four pools, teeming with healthy and non-corrupted tadpoles. Within the chamber are two Kuo-toan monitors and the &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Prince\"&gt;Kuo-toan Prince&lt;/a&gt;. All will attack and seek to destroy any intruders. If the player hovers their cursor over one of the four pools, a text message will display: \"Fresh tadpoles swim in the pool. These tadpoles give strength to adult kuo-toa.\"\nWhichever party member who possesses the \"Corrupted Tadpoles\" can attempt to interact with one of the pools and add those tainted tads to the fresh ones. If so, a text display reads: \"You add the tainted tadpoles... which destroy the kuo-toan tadpoles in the pool.\"\nIf this task is performed, an animation will play over the Prince in the immediate area, and he'll be affected by a low-key series of penalties to his blur effect and magic resistance. In the unmodded game this exercise isn't absolutely necessary, as the vanilla game Prince is only a moderate threat to begin with (he is underpowered for a balanced party at this stage of the saga). \nWhen the last of the enemy are felled, don't forget to examine the fallen for loot, especially the Prince.\nShrine to Demogorgon.\nThe tunnels lead to the east, where a large pool of water is split with a rocky land bridge across it. \nWhen the party crosses, a hidden trigger will initiate exposing the first to cross with a unique magical attack called a \"Lava Burst\", which exposes the member to a 14d6 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; attack. It is a &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; 0 effect and will bypass spell protections like &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, however &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; can block it. \nA saving throw vs. spells will half the damage. When the spell initiates, the Window will shake violently, and a lighting effect animation will play. \nCarry on past this unexpected event towards an ajar door of iron and old timber. Passing within the next room, is a strange shrine or temple of sorts. Sculpted stone figures are placed about the room - representing various abyssal beasts and gargoyles. At the far end of the chamber is a great statue of an imposing demonic being.\nIf examined, a text display is shown: \"An inscription on the demonic statue reads:\" \n\"Place an animal sacrifice before great Demogorgon, and awaken his children from their long sleep\".\"\nA smaller inscription is found at the base of a smaller statue that says: \"To free the five and receive your reward, place a sacrifice before Demogorgon.\"\nIf the party wishes, they may attempt to summon a creature near the statue of Demogorgon and see if that inscription is for real. The party are \"adventurers\", after all.\nIf the sacrifice is made, a few seconds later will play an animation and gate in five &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Knight%20%28underdark%29\"&gt;Demon Knight (underdark)&lt;/a&gt; creatures. Instead of being grateful, they attack any detected party members, to the death. These abyssal beings appear in a scattered fashion in the chamber. Note that the Demons are different than any other the party may have encountered in BG, although they share the same animation.\nHave a read on the Creature page for their abilities, mod content abilities and treasure drops. There is some very nice plunder available.\nNote that there are some shelves in the area that can be examined for items as well.\nExit Gate Area and guardians.\nIf the party meanders down a winding tunnel it will eventually empty into a cavern with a tall ceiling that is higher than infravision can see. Ahead of the party is a group of drow and other guardians, who are currently neutral. They are positioned in front of a huge and sturdy looking gate.\nIf any in the party get close enough, the drow leader will initiate dialogue. If the party is not under the illusory disguise from Adalon, the drow shouts:\nFurther drow language demands are shouted. Even with Viconia in the party the dialogue seems headed to conflict. The drow are not the party's friends, and clearly aren't wanted here. Regardless what the player's group says - the drow decide you should be destroyed and hostilities commence.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Drow%20gate%20guardians\"&gt;Drow gate guardians&lt;/a&gt; will attack. The guards are the only ones who can open the gate (unless the party has assistance from Adalon, or the party is in possession of a certain note - also from Adalon) and killing them will not unbar the magically sealed door. There is no key or special item on their person.\nIf the party is under the illusory disguise from Adalon, then the drow will initiate dialogue, but the party will understand it. The leader will say:\nThere is dialogue available to pursue what the party would like to happen here. If the party just wishes to leave this area and return to adventuring, then this can be easily done via the correct dialogue choice.\nIf the party is interested in leaving the Underdark, then that \"might\" be possible via dialogue. Basically, the party can try to bluff their way through the guards with a false pretense or attempt to bribe the gate guard leader to let you pass. Note that Viconia has some interjections if she's a companion. In short, the drow guard leader can be swayed with the correct dialogue and there are two different paths:\nIf the party is visiting this area after killing Adalon and taking her Note - then these guardians will have to be destroyed before the gate can be magically unsealed.\nIf the party was transported to this area after completing Adalon's &lt;a href=\"Recover%20the%20Silver%20Dragon%27s%20Eggs\"&gt;Recover the Silver Dragon's Eggs&lt;/a&gt; questline, then she will unlock the gate, and also cast a spell upon the gate guardians to weaken them - but it is up to the party to finish off the guards.\nFinal Note.\nA player may wish to know if they may return to the Underdark (for whatever reason) if they have already left through the gate and even travelled to the surface. The answer is yes, however, the city of Ust Natha's gate will be sealed.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Quest Pack&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a secret passage that can be transited through somewhere in this Western Tunnel complex. There is a on screen text message clue displayed if a party member is close to the hidden passage. Within the secret area will be an unusual encounter fraught with danger and adventure.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod adds revisions to all creatures in this area. These are mentioned on the individual creature pages. An obvious change will be noticed immediately with the composition and numbers of creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Drow%20gate%20guardians\"&gt;Drow gate guardians&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if the \"better calls for help\" component has been installed, the Kuo-toa enemies often come to the aid of different groups. It can get chaotic and large numbers of enemies will move toward the first group attacked by the party. Beware.\nThe numbers and type of &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toa\"&gt;Kuo-toa&lt;/a&gt; creatures in this are influenced by the SCS revision to the Spawn scripts. The higher the difficulty setting of the game, the more enemies will be present. \nWith SCS, the &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Prince\"&gt;Kuo-toan Prince&lt;/a&gt; has the probably the greatest staying power of any creature in . His amazing regeneration rate, physical, elemental, and magical energy damage resistance is formidable. In the unmodded game it is not essential to use the \"Corrupted Tadpoles\" to kill this creature - with SCS it will make a huge difference. "}

Depending on your world view, perhaps Lagole deserves some retribution and has it coming. \nGameplay.\nOnce made hostile (which is optional and not a foregone conclusion) the Lich will by applying a preparation of protective buffs including &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and then immediately thereafter another Spell trigger with &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.

Another protective contingency is prepared for instant release wit &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;.\nOffensively the Lich can cast &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, and then several symbols. If not disrupted with damage, the spellcasting can be very lethal to the party. See the InfoBox for available spells, which are all scripted for use.\nBugs.\nLagole Gon has two levels specified in the .cre file - 29/30 - however he is a single class unkitted Mage. For gameplay purposes, the creature is not provided with any of the usual immunities that the Undead or a Lich typically possess. In this sense, Lagole is only a mage with a Lich appearance.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod will make changes to Lagole Gon.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod will change the lich's spellbook to the SR versions. This Mod is compatible and designed to work with SCS. Instead of Spell Immunity he will apply \"Dispel Shield\", for example."}

After a brief conversation with &lt;a href=\"Mook\"&gt;Mook&lt;/a&gt;, where he says \"Mook... I've been looking for you\", he'll turn hostile and attack, killing Mook and then concentrating on Gorion's Ward if the Ward is within sight. However, this is only an exploratory attack and once the vampire reaches a certain hit point threshold, he'll revert to his gaseous form and disappear.\nHe reappears when Linvail has Gorion's Ward attack &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;'s hideout in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Graveyard District&lt;/a&gt; as the final task to receive the Shadow Thieves' help in finding &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;. Once &lt;a href=\"Haz\"&gt;Haz&lt;/a&gt; and his Golem Fleshy have opened the complex doors, Lassal will be waiting near the main doors to the hideout and will jeer \"Fools! The mistress knew you would come! Fight then, and know you die for nothing!\" before &lt;a href=\"Dimension%20Door\"&gt;vanishing&lt;/a&gt;. \nHe'll taunt the party again inside the hideout, saying \"Come then, come to your doom! Dare you breach the inner sanctum? I think not!\" before escaping down into &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Bodhi's Lair&lt;/a&gt;. \nDown in the lair, he'll be found waiting inside Bodhi's inner sanctum and will once again taunt the party and dare you to face him upstairs in the \"room of blood and blades\" - before vanishing from view. The party can then find him in that ominous sounding room, which is where is where the final showdown with Lassal takes place. Once located in the room Lassal has some back and forth with the lead attacker in your party before saying \"For Mistress Bodhi, I will eviscerate you! She shall have tapestries of your sinew and bone! Come! Come to your end!\", and the fight will commence.\nAssuming he's \"killed\" the creature will revert to his gaseous form and drift back to his coffin where he needs to be &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Stake\"&gt;staked&lt;/a&gt; to be permanently put to final death.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; and the \"Improved Vampires\" component makes some revisions to Lassal. The mod assigns a new default script for the vampire, to recognize party member immunities to level drain and other protections for better targeting and tactics. Lassal is now a level 12/12 Fighter/Thief class, with 20 STR, 20 DEX, 19 CON, 145 HP, an adjusted &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt; of 2.5, THAC0 2, and Armor Class -5. He can only be struck with +2 enchanted weapons or greater. He may use any of the SCS standard vampire innate abilities such as Vampire Domination, shapeshift to bat or wolf, and has the CON draining melee attack to go along with the level drain.\nWhen Lassal is in the room of blood and blades, if not destroyed quickly he may attempt to shapeshift into a bat form, and fly around the chamber regenerating from damage. He moves at 288% of normal speed while in this form. If you try and chase the vampire in the room, you most likely will be struck by the piercing damage traps throughout the horrible chamber. Lassal may summon a host of giant rats as well, that can cause a poisonous disease effect on a hit and block your foot movement."}

He is a relative of &lt;a href=\"Valygar%20Corthala\"&gt;Valygar Corthala&lt;/a&gt; and resides within &lt;a href=\"The%20Planar%20Sphere\"&gt;The Planar Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently \"parked\" in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Slums\"&gt;Slums District&lt;/a&gt;, having 'phased' into several homes in the district.\nGameplay.\nWhen Lavok detects intruders, a series of dialogue exchanges is likely (unless the party initiates attacks from invisibility or similar). No matter what is said or unsaid, the result ends in battle for the party, who are viewed as a threat to Lavok's plans and also as intruders in the sphere.\nLavok is located up a staircase, and will attempt spell casting from this elevated position, which has a commanding view of the entire chamber. He'll start out with some near instantly cast self-buffs for protection (won't be able to disrupt these), including &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI: Invocation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mantle\"&gt;Mantle&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpell casting combat will continue, and if not disrupted, as soon as any enemy is detected (typically the closest or second closest) will be subjected to an &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Hold Person (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Silence\"&gt;Power Word, Silence&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards a combination &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; will be next.\nFurther along another triple style sequencer will apply a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Electricity%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Protection From Electricity (spell)&lt;/a&gt; to itself, and a &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; to a party member.\nExpect a &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word, Stun&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; if the party summons any creatures, and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nWhen Lavok's hit points are reduced to 10% of original, then a transition will be scripted to cause the creature to morph into a mortally wounded state. The wizard will be prone and laying on the floor with a new series of dialogue. The party will need to listen to the dying mage's statements (as this is the only way to eventually be able to leave the sphere), as well as to potentially grant a last request for the mage.\nPickpocketing Lavok.\nLavok wears the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Acuity\"&gt;Ring of Acuity&lt;/a&gt; when first encountered in a ring slot. It's possible to pickpocket this item as long as he doesn't detect the party. Once the necromancer has been damaged sufficiently a second form of the creature (who is lying prone on the ground) also is spawned with another Ring of Acuity - this time the ring in the general inventory slot. This can also be pickpocketed. In the Enhanced Edition if the party already possesses the Ring of Acuity - then Lavok will not issue another one during his reward phase with a party mage. This item duplicate coding faux pas has been identified to Beamdog - but as of version 2.6 nothing has been changed. It is most likely an exploitable error - not some hidden bonus the developers intended for the player to get two of the same items from the same creature.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises this creature with a new default AI script, and especially with the \"Smarter Mages\" component installed. An entire reworked spell book is memorized, and spell choices are changed as well. The mage is now assigned a Necromancer kit, and spell casting choice will naturally be favoring that school.\nLavok will open up with a group of (previously cast) protective buffs including: &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI: Invocation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Cold\"&gt;Protection From Cold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; then \"Spell Turning\" will be \"\"Greater Spell Deflection\" and \"Spell Immunity\" will be \"Dispelling Screen\"\". Almost instantly afterwards, he'll be able to add an &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt; on top of himself, in case an invisible adversary was undetected and close by. Normally A &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; is also at the tail end of the initial spellcasting spree.\nWill then launch &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt; bringing forth a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; next to the closest party member, and a contingency will automatically provide Lavok with either a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; this will be a PFMW and \"Moment of Prescience\".\nThe mage will now respond with offensive and disabling spells, perhaps even more Undead summons, based up the AI's threat assessment scripting. It will be variable depending on the party's actions and their protections. If the player's difficulty settings are on \"Hardcore\" or \"Insane\", then Lavok will use its mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; which includes &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt;. Also, expect a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; at some point in the battle, and the mage may provide itself with &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteors&lt;/a&gt; as a means to hurl missiles in between spell casts. On Insane difficulty a &lt;a href=\"Wail%20of%20the%20Banshee\"&gt;Wail of the Banshee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; spells are likely.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed, Lavok's spell use will the SR versions. Summoned help will likely be a gated \"Death Knight\". "}

For example, a creature with only 5 strength ability will still be able to wear plate mail and wield a two-handed sword - where a player character would not.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Wizard spell \"Ray of Enfeeblement\" differentiates between if the target is a human/demi-human size, and others that are larger. It seems that this spell wouldn't be allowed to reduce a storm giant's strength to 5 for instance - so it instead will reduce attack rolls and lowers damage slightly for those sorts of creatures. This isn't the case with the BG game's version, where this spell could potentially make a dragon's strength be set to 5.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects, saving throw and school. See below for description:\nRay of Enfeeblement\nLevel: 2\nSchool: Necromancy\nRange: Long\nDuration: 1 turn\nCasting Time: 2\nArea of Effect: 1 creature\nSaving Throw: Spell negates\nBy means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard weakens an opponent, reducing its strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it.

In return she will help you escape the underdark and offer a reward from her treasure trove.\nGameplay.\nIn order to complete this task, Adalon has given the party a plausible story to go along with a powerful illusion to obfuscate their actual identity. They will pretend to be from the drow city of Ched Nasad, and will appear to be drow. Additionally, drow speech and accent will be included, so that the party will seamlessly speak the tongue, and understand it as well. This is a very powerful enchantment indeed. Under this illusion, they may enter and explore &lt;a href=\"Ust%20Natha\"&gt;Ust Natha&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther, Adalon has made it clear that her eggs are somewhere within the drow city. She cannot leave her lair, for fear that the eggs will be destroyed, so the party will have to do it for her. No other clues are given as to exactly where the eggs may be. It is up to the party to investigate and retrieve the eggs. A warning is given that the party should use restraint and not draw attention to themselves as surfacers, or this could jeopardize the mission and make the city residents hostile, thus ruining any chance of recovering her precious eggs.\nWalkthrough.\nMake entry into Ust Natha.\nThis is the first step. Disguised as drow, the party can make its way to the gates of the drow city and try and get within. This is covered in the main Ust Natha article page.\nComplete all of Phaere's Tasks.\nOnce inside the city follow the gate guard's commands, and find &lt;a href=\"Solaufein\"&gt;Solaufein&lt;/a&gt;, then follow his advice/commands.\nComplete \"The Drow Summoning Ritual\"' questline.\nInitiated by Phaere and then assigned by &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt;, get the next quest assigned and associated journal entries.\nResolve the Dragon Eggs possession.\nAfter The Drow Summoning Ritual - the party will either possess Adalon's real eggs or not. This fact will determine the endgame in the Recover the Silver Dragon's Eggs quest.\nIf the party has allowed the destruction of the real dragon eggs, then visiting Adalon will result in hostilities. Additionally, the party must figure out how to exit the Underdark without her assistance. This eventuality is discussed on the &lt;a href=\"Adalon\"&gt;Adalon&lt;/a&gt; page.\nIf the party has the real eggs and is able to escape Ust Natha - then when ready return to the Silver Dragon for a reward, or perhaps a confrontation depending on the party's desire for blood.\nIf the real eggs are returned to Adalon, the party will receive a reward as she promised. &lt;a href=\"Necaradan%27s%20Crossbow\"&gt;Necaradan's Crossbow&lt;/a&gt; is bestowed to the PC.\nAdalon will now fulfill the last action, and she'll turn into human appearing form and transport the party to the &lt;a href=\"Kuo%20Toa%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Western Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, assist with a powerful enchantment to weaken the &lt;a href=\"Drow%20gate%20guardians\"&gt;Drow gate guardians&lt;/a&gt; and ensure the exit from the underdark gate is unsealed.

He will ask you to retrieve the dagger and offer some compensation in return.\nHe\u2019ll reveal the real reason why he wants the dagger and what actually took place those many years ago. He will then ask you to get it back from the cultists so he can destroy it.\nReturning to Ulgoth's Beard.\nThe first time you return to Ulgoth's Beard with \"Soultaker\" in your inventory, a group of cultists will immediately surround you and demand that you give them the dagger. Regardless of the dialogue option chosen, a &lt;a href=\"Cult%20Enforcer\"&gt;Cult Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; will take it (removing it from your inventory) and teleport away. The rest of the cultists, two &lt;a href=\"Cult%20Guard\"&gt;Cult Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Cult%20Archer\"&gt;Cult Archer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20Assassin\"&gt;Cult Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s (that are invisible) and a cult enforcer (who is hasted), will attack.\nAfter defeating this first group of cultists, talk to Hurgan in the inn and tell him what happened. He'll direct you to find the cultists.\nCultists.\nThe cultists' base is located in &lt;a href=\"Shandalar%27s%20Home\"&gt;Shandalar's Home&lt;/a&gt;. A cult guard is standing in front of the door to the house. You can talk to him, but more fighting may be the end result, or you can walk right past him into the house . In it is no longer possible to walk past the guard as his positioning has been slightly altered. Regardless, when he eventually turns hostile, five more cult guard's and two cult archers will appear and join the battle.\nInside there is a second group of cultists. This group includes an archer, two guards, two assassins, the enforcer (hasted) plus a &lt;a href=\"Cult%20Wizard\"&gt;Cult Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. After a brief dialogue with the wizard, more fighting will commence. One strategy is to drag them outside so there's more room to fight. And &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;pay extra attention&lt;/a&gt; to the assassin and enforcer cultists, who are all invisible and will do some serious backstab damage.\nAfter defeating this group of cultist, travel down into the basement of the house. There you will find six cult guards and a woman named &lt;a href=\"Tracea%20Carol\"&gt;Tracea Carol&lt;/a&gt;. These cult guards are a little different than the cult guards encountered earlier. They look like monks instead of fighters, but still carry a long sword and large shield. And they don\u2019t engage in combat. Tracea will talk to you and provide some additional background on the cult, then break the dagger and release the demon.\nAec'Letec.\nBreaking the dagger summons forth a powerful &lt;a href=\"Tanar%27ri\"&gt;Tanar'ri&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Aec%27Letec\"&gt;Aec'Letec&lt;/a&gt;. It is the final boss that must be defeated for the Durlag's Tower quest line.\nFirst take out Tracea Carol, and then the cult guards. If you do not take out the guards, every time Aec'Letec is presumed killed, he will just re-incarnate himself (at full HP) with one of the guards, until there are no guards left.\nAlso be wary of Aec'Letec\u2019s attacks. He uses &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Touch\"&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/a&gt; to heal himself and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gaze\"&gt;Death Gaze&lt;/a&gt;, which can paralyze your characters, give them a 'dying' modifier that will kill them after thirty seconds if it is not countered, and will then turn them into a ghast. This will be considered a 'permanent death' to anyone who endures it. There are many strategies for taking down Aec'Letec as detailed on his creature page under Strategies and Gameplay.\nAfter killing the demon, go back and talk to Hurgan again for your reward and to close out the quest."}

This innate ability is initiated via internal creature scripting during combat. The purpose of the spell is to apply &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; in an Area of Effect to the dragon's enemies.\nEffects.\nThe ability is uninterruptible and takes almost no time to deploy. The scripted targeting will fire over a selected target area, which is typically within the creature's sight detection range. All creatures in the area of effect are subject to the effects. Rather than a cone of fire spreading forth from the dragon, this projectile will burst (similar to a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;) and spread in a ring of blazing destruction. \nWhen a dragon deploys a Red Dragon Breath, a blast explodes upon enemies within the AoE who are then subjected to 24d10 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt;. A quick reaction &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; vs Breath will apply, and a successful save will reduce the damage by half. Perhaps the victim was able to dive aside, roll away from the burst, or raise a shield up to deflect some of the flames. \nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mods reclassify Dragon Breath attacks as having no Spell School or \"Secondary Type\".

You may convince him to open the door, and he will give up his post and depart, with a brief period to kill him if you wish (with no repercussions).\nMerchant Area.\nInside, &lt;a href=\"Gul%20Dukeem\"&gt;Gul Dukeem&lt;/a&gt; has some nice items for sale such as &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Neutral%20Archmagi\"&gt;Robe of the Neutral Archmagi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20of%20Venom\"&gt;Dagger of Venom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Striking\"&gt;Staff of Striking&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Tunic%20of%20Blindeye\"&gt;Tunic of Blindeye&lt;/a&gt; etc, so don't pick up hostile dialogue options when he starts the talk, #2, #2, #3, #2, #2 will calm everyone down, and his shop will remain open rest of the game as long as he's alive. \nCAUTION: the party leader's charisma score may influence Dukeem's reaction and dialogue choices. If it is too low, then there is no chance of Gul Dukeem combined with Neera's interjections and objections - from moving towards a dialogue path that does not lead to a hostile reception. This limited outcome can be mitigated by choosing a high charisma party leader, or raising your spokespersons charisma, or removing Neera from your party (temporarily or not) before entering the Enclave. \nBehaving diplomatically also let you access the three other shops here, the merchants sell scrolls, wands and potions. Consider spending your gold on items desired now as they will soon be unavaialable. The same goes for attempts to pilfer them with a rogue. However, Gul Dukeem cannot be robbed. If you succeeded in this, then your journal will update: \nWhen you're ready, you have two main choices:\nTavern.\nBehind the Merchant Area turns out to be a tavern or bar area, where both hired &lt;a href=\"Thayan%20Mercenary\"&gt;Thayan Mercenary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thayan%20Fighter\"&gt;Thayan Fighter&lt;/a&gt;s as well as &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wizard\"&gt;Red Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s reside. You may either choose to attack them all at once or take a more subtle approach by turning the hired Thayan mercenaries against their employers. If you choose the more subtle approach, then after being pestered by &lt;a href=\"Fadell%20Ironeye\"&gt;Fadell Ironeye&lt;/a&gt; the mercenary leader, witness the cage fight in Slave Pens. The Red Wizard closest to its door has the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Pen%20Key\"&gt;Slave Pen Key&lt;/a&gt;, which you'll need to free &lt;a href=\"Ghallus\"&gt;Ghallus&lt;/a&gt;. The key also has two other copies, held by Gul Dukeem and Lanneth, but for now just talk to Ghallus and agree to help him out. Go to the Mercenary Quarters and loot the chest in south room for &lt;a href=\"The%20Journal%20of%20Fadell%20Ironeye\"&gt;The Journal of Fadell Ironeye&lt;/a&gt;. Read the journal for clues as to the Mercenary morale and current employment satisfaction.\nNow you have two ways of turning the mercenaries on Red Wizards. You may buy three rounds of drinks from Mironda if you completed her quests earlier, for each round - to get them drunk and riled up; this money will be returned to you later after freeing her. Alternatively, speak to Fadell again and choose \"Stream-Near-The-Hollow\", \"Ellis and Warwick\", \"Alinda\" (then \"revolt\") in the exact order, causing her to revolt.\nAfter the hired mercenaries are either dead or have departed the enclave, pick up the Slave Pen Key while cleaning up the battlefield, talk to Mironda for 10000xp, and free Ghallus, receiving 1,500 XP for each of the 5 slaves you freed from the cages in the pen.\nRed Wizard Quarters.\nGo deeper through a passageway and you'll find &lt;a href=\"Lanneth\"&gt;Lanneth&lt;/a&gt;, along with a pair of &lt;a href=\"Thayan%20Fighter\"&gt;Thayan Fighter&lt;/a&gt;s, and an additional two other fighters and Red Wizards lurking in the side rooms. If you got Fadell drunk &amp; non-hostile, she'll show up ranting a bit before wandering out. If you freed Ghallus, he'll return along with 4 &lt;a href=\"Amnian%20Legionary\"&gt;Amnian Legionaries&lt;/a&gt; to provide a bit of muscle. Lanneth, for her part, isn't really seeking a direct engagement in this round, her tactics are to go invisible by using one of her three &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;Potions of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, then attempt to summon a pair of &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt;s. Prevent her castings by disrupting the spell casts, such as poisoning her, or launch a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; to banish the magical swords. Lanneth can be killed here (although difficult), but she's intended by script to dimension door away.\nFollow Lanneth into the laboratory, she'll try to buy herself some time (and life) by threatening to kill &lt;a href=\"%22King%22%20Gramm\"&gt;\"King\" Gramm&lt;/a&gt; who is in a cage in the center of the lab, but by keeping Neera in the party and sticking to the 1st option you will actually save Gramm\u2019s life. This time, Lanneth is joined by two more Thayan Fighters plus one Red Wizard. It is now up to you to defeat them all. Afterwards, loot her corpse for the &lt;a href=\"Laboratory%20Key\"&gt;Laboratory Key&lt;/a&gt;, Slave Pen Key, &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Invocation\"&gt;Robe of Invocation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20to%20the%20Death\"&gt;Bracers to the Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Protector\"&gt;The Protector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quarterstaff%20%2B2\"&gt;Quarterstaff +2&lt;/a&gt;, 40 &lt;a href=\"Dart%20of%20Wounding\"&gt;Dart of Wounding&lt;/a&gt;, 3 &lt;a href=\"Potions%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potions of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt;, 3 &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;Potion of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Paralyzation\"&gt;Wand of Paralyzation&lt;/a&gt; and . Finally, talk to \"King\" Gramm for 5,000 XP.\nWild Mage Cages.\nThe Laboratory Key will open the southeast door. The northwest door is trap &amp; locked, it leads to Lanneth's Personal Quarters where you'll find:\nLanneth's Journal tells you which order to unlock the first four cages: the Letter is from her superior in the Order, and the Contract tells you who sold out the Refuge.\nWild Mages are in the cage room, although Barad Ding will kill himself if you didn't rescue his cats, Reginald will be dead if you didn't teach him rage control, Amanis dead if you didn't find her son, Daxus too If you let him walk away with Hayes instead of teleporting. Knocktor and Zaviak should survive, and there is one more unnamed female Wild Mage alive in one of the cells - and a dead one in the one next to her.\nThe remaining Wild Mages are held in cages as numbered slaves; you need to open each cage in the correct order by their number. The order is 55 (Amanis), 13 (unnamed female Wild Mage), 11 (Barad Ding), and 42 (Zaviak). After Zaviak, the remaining numbered captives (Reginald, Knocktor and Daxus, if still alive) may be freed in any order. Talking to a Wild mage after their cage is opened will dismiss them and they'll travel back to the Hidden Refuge; each escaping Wild Mage is worth 5,000 XP.\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

Red Wizards signify their membership with exotic tattoos and crimson robes.\nIn the first &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, a small group of them can be found in &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Wood\"&gt;Spider Wood&lt;/a&gt;. Also, in both Baldur's Gate games, the Red Wizard &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Odesseiron\"&gt;Edwin Odesseiron&lt;/a&gt; may be recruited as a companion.\nIn both and , you will find a group of Red Wizards attempting to kill and then dissect another potential companion &lt;a href=\"Neera\"&gt;Neera&lt;/a&gt; in order to investigate the cause of wild magic."}

The image performs all of the actions that the wizard does, and seems to react normally to both physical and magical damage (such as appearing to be burned when hit by a fireball) so that if any enemies are trying to attack the wizard they will not know which one is real. There is a 50% chance that an attacker will attack the image and a 50% chance that he will attack the caster. The image is immune to all forms of damage, but will disappear if a dispel magic or a detect illusion spell is cast upon it, or when the spell duration runs out. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is under the effects of a Mirror Image spell, and multiple castings of this spell will not create additional images."}

(\"Ward\" in the center-right part sells generic weapons and armor.)\nWhen you're ready, talk to \"The Highest\" north of the map center. Agree to be tested for your worthiness to join the cult.\nYour protagonist is isolated from the rest of the party, and an invisible \"Voice\" makes you declare your allegiance.

Report to The Highest.\nYou take part in a ceremony in which cult members drink blood from a bleeding statue. When it's your turn, drink from the cup (or merely pretend to \u2013 it makes no difference).&lt;br&gt;\nYou receive 4000 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt; per party member.\nTest 4: Winning duels.\n3+ days later, the symbol vibrates again.

Do so.\nThe room then fills up with unholy water, and The Highest orders you to bathe in it. Do so (either naked or with clothes \u2013 your choice).\nTest 6: Mass murder and torture.\n5+ days later, the symbol vibrates again. Report to The Highest.\nYour protagonist is placed in a room with 10 civilians (men, women, and children). To pass the test, you must murder them all.\nAfter that is done, The Highest summons \"another\" batch of 10 civilians for you to kill.\nAfter that, The Highest summons 4 human sacrifices. For each one, click to interact with them and select 5 torture methods plus one execution method in the dialog window that pops up.\nWalk up to The Highest again (ignoring the non-hostile skeletons that spawn and explode again). He gives you a cup containing the Beast's blood mixed with your own. Drink it.\nYou are now considered a full member of the cult.

(These rituals are just cut-scenes at the end of which your party automatically rests.)\nBack on floor 1 of the cult compound, you can now go to the weapons rack on the left side of the maze, and take \"one\" of the four weapons from it (as the Cult Member standing in front of it explains to you). Taking \"more than one\" still turns the entire cult hostile though!\nDestroying the cult.\nIf you turn the cult hostile \u2013 either immediately on arrival, or by for example failing a test during &lt;a href=\"%23Joining%20the%20cult\"&gt;#Joining the cult&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 you have a fair amount of combat on your hand.\nFloor 1.\nThere are 18 cult member scattered around the maze, who attack on sight (and summon additional creatures):\nThe Cult Members and Cult Priests can instantly summon one or more of the following creatures to their aid:\n\"Combat advice:\"\nWhile most containers only hold minor potions, one has unique weapons:\nIn order to reach the second floor of the cult compound, you have to activate the 6 blue stones found on the walls of the maze.&lt;br&gt;\nTo activate a blue stone, select a party member, stand as close as possible to the stone, and then click it.&lt;br&gt;\nOnce you have activated all six blue stones, you are automatically teleported to floor 2:\nFloor 2.\nMostly the same deal as the previous floor: Hostile cult members scattered about.\nHowever, the cult leader (\"Highest One\") presents an especially difficult fight:\nThey instantly summon a &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu\"&gt;Glabrezu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cornugon\"&gt;Cornugon&lt;/a&gt; when combat starts, followed by additional monster summoning and other spellcasting.\n\"Combat advice:\"\nThere is no loot on this map other than what is dropped by the enemies.\nIn the room where you arrived on this map, you can click one of the two wall platforms to be teleported back to the previous map.&lt;br&gt;\nThere, you can click the shimmering portal to be teleported back to Matthew's house in &lt;a href=\"Region%20of%20Terror%20walkthrough/Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nSee &lt;a href=\"Region%20of%20Terror%20walkthrough/Bremen%23What%20is%20Matthew%20up%20to%3F\"&gt;Bremen \u25b8 What is Matthew up to?&lt;/a&gt; for the conclusion of the quest."}

They, and the several groups of hostile mushrooms you encounter when exploring further, constitute the \"minor monsters\" of this map:\n\"Combat advice:\"\nWARNING: Do \"not\" yet explore further right than the mushrooms, because the two \"Idols of Forgetfulness\" who guard the right map edge cast &lt;a href=\"imprisonment\"&gt;imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; on your party via cutscene if you come near them.\nInstead, find the friendly Divine Guardian in the bottom-left corner of the map.

While you can interact with the piles, nothing comes of this.\nTo progress, you must reach the intersection in the bottom-left corner. From here, two paths lead straight right.\nTake the upper path first (through a locked &amp; trapped door and 5 floor traps), and you reach a little side room containing the \"Monk's Spirit\". Talk to him to learn that this was once a good-aligned monastery that has been taken over by evil, and that he can unlock the temple entrance for you \u2013 but that you will have to defeat some guardians first.\nReturn to the bottom-left intersection, and this time take the lower path rightwards.&lt;br&gt;In the bottom-right portion of the map, optionally enter a little side-corridor to fight the Salamander King and his 10 minions:\n\"Combat advice\":\nContinue around the bottom-right corner.\nBoth the side-passage blocked by the passphrase-protected door, and the room next to it, have containers with magical items:\nContinue the main passage to the end. There, two ramps lead up to the actual temple entrance. It is guarded by Tezz and her minions \u2013 these are the guardians that the Monk's Spirit spoke of. Defeat them:\n\"Combat advice\":\nIf you promised the Monk's Spirit earlier to defeat the guardians, he approaches you after this battle and unlock the temple entrance. (Otherwise, you have to go to \"him\" to get him to unlock it.)\nEither way, once the temple entrance is open, go inside:\nLevel 1.\nYou start in the hallway in the bottom-left corner of the map.\nEntrance rooms.\nThe entrance hallway has rooms with enemies on both sides of it. The right room contains a secret door to an optional boss fight:\n\"Combat advice\":\nOuter ring.\nStepping out of the entrance hallway, you find yourself on a perpendicular hallway which (when followed left) forms a ring around most of the level.\nThe ring's first hallway segment to the left contains some lootable shelves:\nThe rest of the outer ring has nothing of interest, unless you want more combat \u2013 including two Sapphire Golems.&lt;br&gt;\nPrison cells.\nFrom the hallway segment with the shelves, take the top-right side door to enter the prison.&lt;br&gt;\nThere are three prison cells here, with seemingly-non-hostile \"Monks\" inside. They plead with you to free them.\n1) When you open the bottom-left cell, the monk inside turns into the hostile Shadow Samurai boss \"Chxzar\" and attacks:\n\"Combat advice\":\n2) When you open the top-left cell, the 4 monks inside turn into hostile mists and attack.\n3) When you open the cell on the right, the monk inside thanks you and leaves, and you get 2500 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt;.

Clicking the altar brings up its inscription:\nLet one party member stand inside the floor rune in the center of the room. After a few seconds, the \"Dark Guardian\" spawns and attacks. Defeat him:\n\"Combat advice\":\nThe key he drops unlocks the door to the &lt;a href=\"%23East%20staircase\"&gt;\u2193\u2009East staircase&lt;/a&gt;, and thus presents one of the two ways to get down to level 2.\nNorth staircase.\nContinuing north from the chapel, the hallway has little side rooms with lootable containers:\nThese side-rooms also contain some notable optional combat: Another High Monk's Spirit (turns hostile through dialog), and another Sapphire Golem.\nAt the end of this hallway lies the room with the \"north staircase\". However, the staircase is closed and guarded by a non-hostile \"Monk's Spirit\".&lt;br&gt;\nTalk to the spirit, and and it gives you a puzzle that you must solve in order to unlock this staircase down to level 2.&lt;br&gt;\nThis puzzle plays out in the puzzle room:\nPuzzle room.\nThis is the room in the bottom-right corner of the map.\nIt contains ten beds, each of which holds one gem.

If you got the puzzle right, he unlocks that staircase for you, grants you 50,000 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt;, and disappears.\nEast staircase.\nThis staircase is behind a locked door in the center-right part of the map.&lt;br&gt;\nThe lock can only be opened using the key dropped by the \"Dark Guardian\" in the chapel \u2013 see the &lt;a href=\"%23Chapel\"&gt;\u2191\u2009Chapel&lt;/a&gt; section above.\nLevel 2.\nThe goal of this level is to gain access to the \"sanctuary\", which is the large central room in the bottom part of the map.&lt;br&gt;\nIts locked door can be opened in two ways (you can do one or both):\nUnlocking the sanctuary using the tile puzzle.\nIn the left-of-center part of the inner section of this level, is the \"rock room\" \u2013 a store room with four lootable chests that contain 10 \"Rock\" items in total.

There's a secret door on the inner wall, opening a room which in turns has a door to another room, with a trapped altar that contains the \"Bedroom Key\".&lt;br&gt;\nAs soon as you loot this key, the malarchite boss Trezz and her minions spawn and attack you:\n\"Combat advice\":\nThe \"Bedroom Key\" opens the four previously inaccessible rooms in the north section of the map. This means that you now have access to all rooms on this level except for the sanctuary.&lt;br&gt;\nExplore them to find six scrolls with clues for the tile puzzle \u2013 and various other treasure:\nThen enter the \"tile room\" in the bottom-right corner of the map, and solve the puzzle by placing rocks on the correct tiles:\nThese are the clues given to you by the six scrolls:\nPlace one rock on each of the 5 floor tiles marked on the image below (or rather, into the tiny \"container\" in the middle of each of those tiles), while leaving the other 4 tiles empty:\nIf you do it correctly, the door to the &lt;a href=\"%23Sanctuary\"&gt;\u2193\u2009Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; silently unlocks.\nUnlocking the sanctuary using a key.\nIn the large room in the center of the map, click the central contraption to cause the &lt;a href=\"Demilich\"&gt;demi-lich&lt;/a&gt; Gregorraxx to spawn and attack you with his minions:\n\"Combat advice\":\nThe \"Key of the Death\" dropped by the demi-lich lets you enter the &lt;a href=\"%23Sanctuary\"&gt;\u2193\u2009Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; directly, without having to bother with exploration and puzzles.\nSanctuary.\nUpon entering this room in the center of the bottom map portion, your party is confronted by Zatac, the end-boss of the ice temple, who calls herself a goddess. She attacks together with her minions, which includes the corrupted spirit of the temple's former abbot:\n\"Combat advice\":\nYou can leave the ice temple compound the way you came in."}

When you have defeated each monk's monsters, talk to the riddle-master again to collect your prize.\nIf, on the other hand, you want to win the intellectual way, read on.&lt;br&gt;\nThe riddle is actually a bit underspecified, but makes sense with the following assumptions:\nThe riddle-master already gave you two pieces of information, and when you question the 6 other monks, they make the following claims:\nFrom this, you can deduce the following information:\nIn other words, the logical conclusion is that \"none\" of the monks A to E hold the Mark.

Approach him, and he initiates conversation and teleports \"only\" your protagonist to another map:\nSolo detour: Cemetery.\nYour protagonist arrives here alone, without the other party members, after being teleported by the demilich.

Step through it to get to:\nCrystal Shard room.\nHere you finally face Drizzt's arch-enemies Jarlaxle and Artemis Entreri, who you've been hunting for the entire \"Region of Terror\" main quest. Their \"Crystal Shard\" floats in the center of the room.\nThey initiate dialog, and Entreri and Drizzt leave the cave to fight a duel. Once they are gone, Jarlaxle explains to your protagonist why he and Entreri did all the things they did to bait Drizzt. When you tell him you have no more questions, two possible paths open up:\nDepending on which path you chose, the rest of the encounter plays out differently:\nGood path.\nThe game switches to the small outdoors map where you control Drizzt in his duel against Entreri:\n\"Combat advice:\"\nAlas, Entreri has rigged the duel. You cannot kill him \u2013 instead, you must bring his &lt;a href=\"hit%20point\"&gt;hit point&lt;/a&gt;s down to near-death, whereupon he springs a trap that knocks Drizzt unconscious.

He starts off by spawing three copies of himself (and randomly switching places with one of them), and proceeds to summon more minions during the battle.

Regis can't &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; with his mace.\nRegis is a bit of an anomaly as a thief class, using a mace with grandmaster proficiency and wearing a helmet. AI NPCs don't have to follow the rules that PCs do.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod changes the AI scripting used by Regis, to improve tactical behavior and item usage.\nSCS adds 1 pip in single-weapon fighting style to the rogue.\nAn additional potion is added to Regis for use."}
