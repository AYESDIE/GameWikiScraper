If you enter her dwelling at the behest of the &lt;a href=\"Aboleth\"&gt;Aboleth&lt;/a&gt; then you are most likely trying to complete a task to retrieve her brain. This can only be accomplished by violence. As soon as the party enters the home, all denizens will be hostile and attack.\nGameplay.\nQilue can melee with her enchanted drow armor, shield and flail. This creature will cast a self-defensive buff and then offensive/disabling spells in combat, if not disrupted.\nAt the start of hostilities, she will instantly (and cannot be interrupted) launch &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Harmony\"&gt;Defensive Harmony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Magic\"&gt;Righteous Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strength%20of%20One\"&gt;Strength of One&lt;/a&gt; in the area, which will buff herself any allied creatures close by.\nShe will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic (priest)&lt;/a&gt; at a party member. A &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt; will be attempted as well. She will probably try and conjure in some help with an &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt; spell. Further spell attacks include &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Hold Person (priest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mental%20Domination\"&gt;Mental Domination&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Person%20or%20Mammal\"&gt;Charm Person or Mammal&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf damaged to certain thresholds she will attempt &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Serious%20Wounds\"&gt;Cure Serious Wounds&lt;/a&gt; on self, and &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Cure\"&gt;Mass Cure&lt;/a&gt; on allies and self.\nThis is all she is scripted to do other than close quarters melee combat.\nGame note.\nIn the original game, Qilue's script contained a global setting launch of three other Drow Servant Wizard's who would use the &lt;a href=\"Dimension%20Door\"&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/a&gt; animation to come to assist against the intruding party. Because the spell caused game errors, Dimension Door is now deprecated from the game, and the Drow Servants are just added to the area instead.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a few changes to this creature. Her weapon proficiencies are corrected to 1 pip in flail and 1 pip in sword and shield style. She is now a level 20 Cleric, with adjusted saving throws and a better THAC0. A complete compliment of divine spells is memorized from levels 1 through 7. Some of the spells are different than the unmodded creature. A default SCS cleric AI script is installed for \"Smarter Cleric\" behavior. An SCS random treasure is in the creature's inventory as well. Qilue will now aggressively cast as many spells as possible unless disrupted or killed. She will heal herself, cast True Seeing and self-buffs, and summon creatures.\nShe will open with the following (previously cast) instantly applied buffs: &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Regeneration (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire (priest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Mirror\"&gt;Physical Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Free Action (spell)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn Animate Skeleton warrior spell will follow. From then on, further spell casting will be determined by the AI's threat assessment and opponent vulnerability evaluations. This includes more summoned creatures, offensive spell casts and disabling type spells. Healing spells are also available to mitigate damage on self and allies.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod is installed, the drow's memorized spells will be the SR versions."}

As such, they are optional but nevertheless an important part of the game. Side quests represent a major means of exploring the landscape, of equipping characters and advancing levels, and of \"having fun\".\nWhich side quests you pick up depends on the choices you make as you explore the countryside and talk to, fight with and/or run away (strategically retreat, if you prefer) from characters and creatures in the game. Some side quests are added to your journal automatically when you \"discover\" them from actions as simple as entering an area for the first time or interacting with a character. Other times you will be given the option of accepting a side quest or not.\nWhile their completion is optional to the overall goals of the game, it should be noted that the completion, incompletion, or manner of completion of side quests can have important effects upon your playing experience. Failure to complete a quest given by a party member, for example, can lead to them leaving your party unexpectedly. (See &lt;a href=\"%23Companion%20quests\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.)\nStronghold quests.\nStronghold quests are a special type of quests that might result in periodic income and require periodic attention. The tasks that need to be performed tailor to the skills and competence of your active &lt;a href=\"Class\"&gt;Class&lt;/a&gt;. \nThese quests are usually applicable to &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; only, but with optional game Modifications installed, , these may be available to companions as well.\nCompanion quests.\nCompanion quests are introduced by a companion, and typically needed to be completed in order to satisfy and maintain a companion in the party. There are exceptions.\n\"Baldur's Gate\".\nIn the original \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" and its (see &lt;a href=\"%23New%20in%20Tales%20of%20the%20Sword%20Coast\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;), quests are neither named nor ordered in the player's &lt;a href=\"journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;, other than by ; relevant entries are simply added by the time they are obtained and will not be removed from the journal again when the quest is solved.\nThis is changed in the \"\", where most quests get a name and sometimes a subtitle, the latter not always shown in the journal. They are ordered roughly alphabetically in a specific \"Quests\" section, while \"Journal\" keeps some entries by date. After solving a quest, relevant entries are in most cases either removed or updated.\nThe following list uses the \"Enhanced Edition\" names \u2013 player's of the original game unfortunately can only guess. Some entries might appear familiar, however, for player's of the \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20Trilogy\"&gt;Baldur's Gate Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;\".

Each race grants specific weapon armor, and skill proficiencies, as well as race and subrace features. Selecting a race is permanent, including subraces, after character creation!\nElf.\nWith ethereal countenance, and long lifespans, elves are at home with nature's power, flourishing in light and dark alike.\nHigh Elf.\nHeirs to the mystical Feywild, high elves value magic in all its forms, and even those who do not study spellcraft can manipulate the weave.\n&lt;br&gt;High Elf Cantrip: Fire Bolt \n&lt;br&gt;You may change your cantrip by selecting another one from the Wizard Spell list below. This cantrip doesn't use spell slots and can be cast at will. It uses your Intelligence as its modifier.\nWood Elf.\nThese elves spend their reclusive lives in Faer\u00fbn's forests. Decades of training in archery and camouflage are enhanced by an otherworldly swiftness.\nTieflings.\nDescended from devils of the Nine Hells, tieflings face constant suspicion in Faer\u00fbn. Thankfully, their arcane abilities make them natural survivors. \nAsmodeus Tiefling.\nBound to Nessus, the deepest layer of the Hells, these tieflings inherited the ability to wield fire and darkness from the archdevil Asmodeus' infernal bloodline.\nMephistopheles Tiefling.\nDescended from the archdevil Mephistopheles, these tieflings are gifted with a particular affinity for arcane magic. \nZariel Tiefling.\nTieflings from Zariel's bloodline are empowered with martial strength, and can channel searing flame to punish their enemies.\nDrow.\nDriven to the Underdark, most drow have adopted a ruthless pragmatism. While the Lolth-sworn delight in the goddess's evil tenets, the Seldarine reject Her attempt to overthrow the leader of the elven pantheon.\nLolth-Sworn Drow.\nRaised by Lolth cult in the city of Menzoberranzan, these drow embody the virtues of their corrupt and merciless goddess. Lolth marks Her followers with bright red eyes so those in the Underdark will learn to fear them on sight. \nSeldarine Drow.\nSeldarine drow can be found seeking allies from all over Faer\u00fbn, aiming to settle their conflict with Lolth - and each other - by any means neccessary.\nHuman.\nThe most common face in Faer\u00fbn, humans are known for their tenacity, creativity, and endless capacity for growth.\nGithyanki.\nWith a ruthlessness borne from mind flayer enslavement, githyanki ride the Astral Sea atop red dragons, bringing their silver swords and psionic might to bear against any trace of the illithid menace.\nDwarf.\nAs durable as their home of stone, dwarves are some of the most finest warriors, miners, and smiths of Faer\u00fbn.\nGold Dwarf.\nThese dwarves are known for their confidence and keen intuition. The culture of their Deep Kingdom values family, ritual, and fine craftsman. \nShield Dwarf.\nGreat losses in ancient wars against goblins and orcs have led these dwarves to adopt a cynical mindset, but they will endure anything to restore their ancestral homeland. \nDuergar.\nOnce enslaved by the eldritch mind flayers, duergar adapted to freedom with harsh practicality. Their cold demeanours and gift of stealth are well known throughout the Underdark.\nHalf-Elf.\nCurious, ambitious, and versatile, half-elves are welcome everywhere, but struggle without a community to call their own. \nHigh Half-Elf.\nA touch of the Fey Wild remains in half-elves with this bloodline, and even those untrained in magic possess a hint of wild power. \n&lt;br&gt;High Elf Cantrip: Fire Bolt \n&lt;br&gt;You may change your cantrip by selecting another one from the Wizard Spell list below. This cantrip doesn't use spell slots and can be cast at will. It uses your Intelligence as its modifier.\nWood Half-Elf.\nLike their wood elf parent, these half-elves have a quickened stride and an eye for stealth. Yet many break away from isolation in Faer\u00fbn's forests to explore the rest of the realms.\nDrow Half-Elf.\nMost half-drow result from liasions between Seldarine drow and surfacers. While half-drow inherated a few magical gifts, they aren't usually raised in the Underdark. \nHalfling.\nSmall yet capable, halflings prefer the comforts of home and hearth - but their natural luck and dexterity makes them fine adventurers. \nLightfoot Halfling.\nStealthy but social, these halflings travel all over Faer\u00fbn to make a name for themselves. \nStrongheart Halfling.\nLegend has it that dwarven blood gave stronghearts their hardness. Resistant to poison, and wellsprings of endurance, these halflings easily hold their own. \nGnome.\nSmall, clever, and energetic, gnomes use their long lives to explore Faer\u00fbn's brightest corners and darkest depths.\nSubraces:\nDragonborn.\nA proud race that values clan and skills above all else. Once enslaved by dragons, they strive to be self-sufficient, not wanting to be beholden to anyone, not even the gods.\nSubraces:\nHalf-Orc.\nCreatures of intense emotion, half-orcs are more inclined to act than contemplate - whether the rage burning their bodies compels them to fight, or the love filling their hearts inspires acts of incredible kindness."}

The play is curtailed early due to poor performance issues stemming from unprepared actors, mainly Biff. Raelis will apologize to the audience and offer a full refund. She also takes the opportunity to ask for assistance, as follows:\nAfter this message, a Journal Entry display as follows:\nVisit her at the rear of the theater, and initiate conversation. A number of dialogue options are available. In the end, if you accept the quest to assist the Actor Troupe, and agree to &lt;a href=\"Free%20Haer%27Dalis%20from%20Imprisonment%20by%20Mekrath\"&gt;Free Haer'Dalis from Imprisonment by Mekrath&lt;/a&gt;, Raelis will wish you well with a promise of a reward.\nIf you are able to rescue Haer'Dalis, and visit her again (whether if he's a companion now or not), she's going to reward the party and check if the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Gem\"&gt;Portal Gem&lt;/a&gt; was recovered as well. That gem is needed by Raelis (and Hae'rdalis will attest to that if a companion or not).\nIf the party is not going to return it, or tries to extort a better reward, then a different dialogue path will present. This could lead to a poor reaction and cutting off the &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Raelis%20and%20Haer%27Dalis%20from%20the%20Planar%20Prison\"&gt;Rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the Planar Prison&lt;/a&gt; quest - which is a fun adventure with much loot and potential experience.\nIf the party is reasonable, and provides the Portal Gem, she will then ask for one more favor after attempting to open a planar tunnel to transport away. She needs help in case something comes through the open portal until the correct tunnel form. The party can refuse to help, ask what kind of payment you'll receive, or just agree to help by saying:\nIf the party doesn't wish to help or be involved, then a final statement is said by Raelis, and she'll wait for the party to depart before undertaking their travel to the planes alone (and the whole Troupe will be gone from the game for good and the associated quest is also shuttered). If the protagonist is a bard, then she will also leave the player the &lt;a href=\"Playhouse%20Deed\"&gt;Playhouse Deed&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd finally, the party will be able to converse with Raelis a last time if they are rescued from the Planar Prison, along with an experience point award.\nNotes.\nRaelis has different dialogue available if Haer'Dalis is dead and his corpse is lost/left behind/chunked. Or if he is dead and still part of the party (not resurrected yet). She will be able to bring him back to life.\nThere is also a number of angry and disappointed dialogue quips if the party is trying to extort more money or not live up to their bargain.\nIf at any time the party attacks, or is caught stealing from, anyone in the Playhouse, including the &lt;a href=\"Receptionist\"&gt;Receptionist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Usher\"&gt;Usher&lt;/a&gt;s or theatergoers, Raelis and her Troupe will turn hostile and attack the party. Effectively, this makes the Sigil Troupe the Authority for the playhouse up until they are abducted by bounty hunters through the extra-planar portal that opens up in the archway, stage-right (from the performers' perspective). Therefore, it is also possible to close off access to the &lt;a href=\"Planar%20Prison\"&gt;Planar Prison&lt;/a&gt; and the quest to rescue the Troupe, thereby missing out on much experience, treasure, a valuable &lt;a href=\"Companions\"&gt;Companion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Haer%27Dalis\"&gt;Haer'Dalis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Running%20the%20Five%20Flagons%20Playhouse\"&gt;ownership of the Playhouse&lt;/a&gt; as a potential &lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; (assuming the protagonist is a &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt;)."}

Where \"second facet\" corresponds to a west to east (or left to right) orientation if facing the device.\nUpon being released from the device, he seems severely mentally challenged, making only incoherent broken sentences and noises and then attacking you after a few rounds. This is the likely outcome for a first-time player who has no knowledge of the encounter ahead of time and who didn't do on-line research ahead of gameplay - such as this wiki article - to instead attempt a different course of action.\nThe game gives no clues or helpful hints that this mental condition might be curable. However, setting aside the extremely low probability that a player without any foreknowledge would actually attempt to cast a &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; spell upon this creature - then doing that exact action (if done successfully) will open up more gameplay options. \nOnly the spell Heal cast upon him will cure his ailments. A &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Disease\"&gt;Cure Disease&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Restoration\"&gt;Greater Restoration&lt;/a&gt; won't suffice. The mental illness is most likely caused by prolonged imprisonment in a subterranean void. There is a short period to be able to do this action. The Heal spell will revert the mage from being hostile and to initiate meaningful dialogue.\nIf the mage isn't affected by the Heal spell, he'll eventually turn hostile and self-buff with &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;. All the spells listed on the InfoBox are scripted for use, so beware the &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; spell cast and other attacks.\nAfter curing his mental ailment, Raevilin will speak. Should the party be currently under the drow disguise enchantment, then different dialogue will present. \nAfter questions by the party are asked and answers given in an understanding and empathetic way then an award of is bestowed, as well as a gift of the &lt;a href=\"Albruin\"&gt;Albruin&lt;/a&gt; bastard sword. \nIf the party wishes him well and accepts his thanks for a good deed well done, the mage will eventually leave on his own accord. A journal entry will display:\nAnother option available through initial dialogue once he has had the Heal spell applied, is to select the dialogue choice to demand that he must make payment for his rescue. This will lead to a response from the mage, as follows:\nThis dialogue track leads to hostilities. There will be no quest reward XP or the sword Albruin item granted. Killing him nets only his death award and the carried scrolls in his inventory - &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Earth%20Elemental%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Conjure Earth Elemental (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Efreeti\"&gt;Summon Efreeti&lt;/a&gt;.

Raevilin is granted one pip in quarterstaff weapon proficiency. Two additional Icewind Dale Wizard spell scrolls are added if you have that SCS component installed, and two SCS random treasures are in the creature's inventory.\nWith this mod installed, there is almost no chance of getting a Heal spell applied to Raevilin before he goes hostile and gets up his spell buffs. The party will then be faced with taking down his protections/invisibility, and surviving his spell attacks, without killing the mage, and then getting a Heal spell applied to end his hostility. This will take some micromanagement and a bit of luck/tactics to do. Depending on the player's party it might be very difficult or frustratingly impossible.\nRaevilin, after a few moments (and if not cured of his mental afflictions) will initiate a group of (cast previously) protective buffs to include &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI: Divination&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Dispelling Screen\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Cold%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Protection From Cold (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this, if able to function and not impaired he may attempt further protections from his Spell Trigger, such as &lt;a href=\"Mantle\"&gt;Mantle&lt;/a&gt; (or {\"Prismatic Mantle\" with SR) and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. After that, offensive spells casts and summoned help. The mage can employe a few prepared sequencers in the thick of combat.\nInstalling &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; will change all memorized spells to the SR versions."}

She often begins with a fast casting of &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Mirror\"&gt;Physical Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Good\"&gt;Protection From Good, 10' Radius&lt;/a&gt; (which boosts her attending spiders). The spiders move quickly and will try and engage in melee attacks to whomever is closest. The script for Raffiyah provides her with a casting speed modifier bonus of 5. She is also given a hidden spell power by her script to &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Spawn\"&gt;summon spiders&lt;/a&gt;. The script allows her to continually summon a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; once every 2 rounds. If you don't dispose of her quickly, Raffiyah will try &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Confusion%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Confusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Finger of Death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Bolt of Glory&lt;/a&gt;. She can be overwhelmed by multiple physical attacks, even with her formidable physical attack damage resistance.\nRaffiyah can melee attack if you are next to her. Her &lt;a href=\"SPSPID3.ITM\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; has a range of 1, speed 3, is a +2 enchanted piercing attack inflicting 2d4+2 damage, with a +2 THAC0. A save vs. Death at -3 penalty is needed to avoid 5 poison damage per second for 30 seconds. She can attack twice per round.\nOnce defeated, get the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20the%20Unproved\"&gt;Shroud of the Unproved&lt;/a&gt; from the sarcophagus in the lair. Hexxat will then ask if you are ready to travel back to the Athkatla Graveyard via the Tomb Walk ability provided by the &lt;a href=\"Casque%20of%20Dragomir\"&gt;Casque of Dragomir&lt;/a&gt;. \nParty banter quotes when first seeing Raffiyah.\nJan Jansen\nViconia DeVir"}

When he sees you he decides that he also wants to kill you so he can get the full bounty reward.\n\"The Undercity Mercenaries\".\nThe Undercity mercenaries are sent by the Sembia division of the Iron Throne, to learn about the events troubling their operations in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and hunt down Sarevok.&lt;br&gt;The mercenaries consist of:\nCombat.\nRahvin is an exceptionally tough opponent because of his arsenal; a skilled archer who can launch multiple attacks per round, he is outfitted with a number of &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Detonation\"&gt;arrows of detonation&lt;/a&gt;. This essentially allows him to produce multiple &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;-style explosions per round, which can be absolutely devastating to a player's party.\nThe easiest way to defeat Rahvin is to force him into melee as soon as possible, preventing him from making his deadly area attacks. The most optimal strategies are to either swarm him with cannon fodder via spells like Monster Summoning &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Summoning%20I\"&gt;I&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Monster%20Summoning%20II\"&gt;II&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Monster%20Summoning%20III\"&gt;III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt;, use &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt; to get your toughest fighters into melee with him, or both.\nAnother working strategy is to make the player's melee fighters immune to fire (via &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire\"&gt;Protection From Fire&lt;/a&gt; spells stacked with fire resistance from items or potions) and send them forward to draw Rahvin's arrows and melee fighters, while the rest of the player party retaliates with a fireball volley of its own. As the player's melee fighters are immune to fire, they won't take damage from friendly or hostile fireballs, whereas Rahvin's party will take damage from both.\nInvisibility can allow a mage to move to the center of the enemy party. Mustard jelly form (&lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20Self\"&gt;Polymorph Self&lt;/a&gt;) is immune to magic and arrows of detonation, so the jelly could serve as a tank.\nTreasure.\nWhen defeated, Rahvin drops the following items. As with all archers, the amount of ammunition he drops depends on how many ranged attacks he is allowed to make before being defeated."}

Because of that, they must be strong, wise, tough and agile to survive.\nIn gameplay, they can use nearly every weapon and piece of armor, just like the &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike fighters, they can only invest a maximum of two points into &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;weapon proficiency&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of bows and crossbows for &lt;a href=\"Ranger%23Archer\"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;. Rangers have racial enemies, plus &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Animal\"&gt;charm animal/mammal&lt;/a&gt; and stealth as special abilities.\nBecause they have &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wisdom\"&gt;Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; as their primary ability scores, and have a high minimum in each of them, rangers have the tendency to get 90 or more ability scores easily.\nIf a ranger protagonist falls below 7\u00a0&lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; (or due to possible story-related reasons at the end of BG2(EE)), they will become a Fallen Ranger, which is a ranger without the special abilities, and they will lose a lot of experience points. Only in \"Shadows of Amn\" campaign at the end of &lt;a href=\"Ranger-Protector%20of%20the%20Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Ranger-Protector of the Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt;, can they become normal rangers once more. Multi and dual-classed rangers can't fall, and neither can ranger &lt;a href=\"companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; (but since all ranger companions have good &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt;, they will start leaving the party at low reputation). \n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; may become rangers. \nThe only multi-/dual-class option for rangers is with &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter abilities table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;, other Races have modified ability scores.\n^ Rangers have access to percentile Strength.\nSpecial abilities of the ranger.\nRacial enemy.\nRangers tend to focus on a particular enemy race, gaining +4 bonus to hit and damage rolls versus the racial enemy. Some of these are not available in original Baldur's Gate or Tales of the Sword Coast and were added when Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal were released. Several low-level groups are only available in the first Baldur's Gate games. When importing a character from BG1 into BG2, you can choose a new racial enemy when you start a new game. The player chooses one of the creature types listed below.\n &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Crawler\"&gt;Carrion Crawler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ettercap\"&gt;Ettercap&lt;/a&gt;, , , , &lt;a href=\"Hobgoblin\"&gt;Hobgoblin&lt;/a&gt;, , , , , &lt;a href=\"Trolls\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;, , , , , \n &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Crawler\"&gt;Carrion Crawler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demonic Fell Creature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ettercap\"&gt;Ettercap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamadryad\"&gt;Fairy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Djinni\"&gt;Genie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gibberling\"&gt;Gibberling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnoll\"&gt;Gnoll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hobgoblin\"&gt;Hobgoblin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kobold\"&gt;Kobold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuo-Toa\"&gt;Kuo-Toa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lycanthrope\"&gt;Lycanthrope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephit\"&gt;Mephit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Otyugh\"&gt;Otyugh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rakshasa\"&gt;Rakshasa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin\"&gt;Sahuagin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slime\"&gt;Slime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spiders\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trolls\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;Umber Hulk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;\nCharm animal.\nRangers can &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Animal\"&gt;charm animals&lt;/a&gt; to prevent fights or to gain advantages, starting from level 3.\n&lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt;.\nRangers can &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Hide In Shadows&lt;/a&gt; when not wearing heavy armor. Rangers get a bonus to their stealth skills based on level, starting at +15 for both Move Silently and Hide In Shadows at level 1 (maxing out at 99 for both at level 13). These skills are further modified by race selection, &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; score, and increase with level. With the exception of Stalkers, Rangers may not Backstab like &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, but they still receive the -4 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; bonus when they strike while hidden.\n&lt;a href=\"Druid%23Druid%20spells\"&gt;Druid spells&lt;/a&gt;.\nRangers unlock druid spells at level 8, may learn up to spell level 3. The caster level for these spells is calculated as 7 levels less than the current Ranger level, but maxes out at level 9 in classic versions. In the Enhanced Editions, the caster level continues to increase normally with the penalty (up to a max of 27 at level 34). Lower caster level means that many spell effects are weaker or last a shorter duration, and they can more easily be &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;dispelled&lt;/a&gt;.\nSingle class rangers do not gain &lt;a href=\"wisdom\"&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt; based bonus spell slots; cleric &amp; ranger combinations gain additional slots like single class clerics. In Classic Versions, rangers multi or dual with cleric may learn lv4+ druid spells when the higher spell level slots are unlocked by cleric. In the Enhanced Edition, this has been turned into an option in the external configuration file called \"baldur.lua\". For more information, see the &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Ranger\"&gt;Cleric / Ranger&lt;/a&gt; page.\nClass Kits.\nRanger.\nThe ranger is a warrior and a woodsman who is skilled with weapons and is knowledgeable in the ways of the forest. The Ranger often protects and guides lost travelers and honest peasant-folk. A Ranger needs to be strong and wise to the ways of nature to live a full life.\nClass features:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Archer\"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Archer is the epitome of skill with the bow - the ultimate marksman, able to make almost any shot, no matter how difficult. To become so skilled with the bow, the Archer has had to sacrifice some of the proficiency with melee weapons and armor.\u00a0\nAdvantages:\u00a0\nDisadvantages:\u00a0\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Stalker\"&gt;Stalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nStalkers serve as covert intelligence-gatherers, comfortable in both wilderness and urban settings. They are spies, informants, and interrogators, and their mastery of &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; makes them deadly opponents.\u00a0\nAdvantages:\u00a0\nDisadvantages:\u00a0\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Beast%20Master\"&gt;Beast Master&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeast Masters are wanderers and are not comfortable in civilized lands. Therefore, they maintain a natural affinity for animals; who are the Beast Masters' friends and comrades-in-arms, and the Beast Masters have a limited form of telepathic communication with the animals.\u00a0\nAdvantages:\u00a0\nDisadvantages:\u00a0\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh level class abilities are added in expansion. For all warrior classes and\u00a0Monks, the pool of abilities consist of abilities which can be accessed from the special abilities menu. These HLAs are available once they reach levels beyond 3,000,000 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;xp&lt;/a&gt;, exact level varies by class.\n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Protagonist ranger serves as &lt;a href=\"Ranger-Protector%20of%20the%20Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Ranger-Protector of the Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt; once the &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20the%20deaths%20in%20the%20Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Investigate the deaths in the Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt; side quest is completed.\nCreative origins.\nThe ranger was primarily based on the exiled king , and the of mythos, as warriors who use tracking and other wilderness skills to hunt down their enemies. The \"AD&amp;D\" second edition handbook mentions several other inspirations from myth and legend, such as , , the huntresses , and the Greek hero .\nAlthough it is commonly thought that the ranger character &lt;a href=\"Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt; may also have influenced the development of the class, particularly with regard to the second edition inclusion of the ability to fight with two weapons, this notion has been rejected by the lead designer of that rule set, David \"Zeb\" Cook, and the lack of provision for players to be able to emulate Drizzt using the ranger class as it appears in the PHB seems to support his assertion. More likely, the Drizzt character was influenced by \"Unearthed Arcana\", which introduced the drow as a player character race and contained somewhat ambiguous wording that allowed them to use a secondary weapon not normally permitted in \"AD&amp;D\". Drizzt appeared as a first edition character in the 1988 release \"FR5 \". Interestingly, few \"AD&amp;D\" computer games based on the second edition rule set included provision for fighting with two weapons, and those that did seem to have not have included the ranger class ability (most notably, \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Dale\"&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/a&gt;\" , which provided rangers with an extra attack when not using a shield.)\nOther notable rangers in the literature of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" include Hank from the , King Tristan Kendrick from Forgotten Realms, and Ren from Pool of Radiance.\nAchievements.\nOathbreaker BG1.\nBecome a Fallen Paladin or a Fallen Ranger during or .\nOathbreaker BG2.\nBecome a Fallen Paladin or a Fallen Ranger during .\nCabin In the Woods.\nAcquire the ranger stronghold during .\nEpic Warrior.\nReach level 30 with a Fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Monk, or Barbarian during .\nGameplay (community).\n~Write your insights below, different from the Gameplay section above, you may use your signatures here,\u00a0~\nAlignment exploits with certain items.\nDespite the alignment limitation at character creation, it must be noted that it's possible for a party to have a non-Fallen evil Ranger in BG(EE) and Siege of Dragonspear, as the &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Opposite%20Alignment\"&gt;Helmet of Opposite Alignment&lt;/a&gt; does not cause Rangers to fall. This can be of particular interest to &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Master\"&gt;Beast Masters&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"Find%20Familiar\"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt; choice is determined by their alignment, or any Ranger who would like to make use of the &lt;a href=\"Cornugon%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;Cornugon's Revenge&lt;/a&gt; armor during SoD. Moreover, although of little practical use to most players, it's also possible to keep said Ranger as evil by skipping the Shadows of Amn portion of BG2(EE) and importing the BG(EE) character with the Helmet of Opposite Alignment straight into Throne of Bhaal (as the helmet still exists in the code and ToB doesn't remove items from the player's party). Finally, it's also possible to keep a Ranger as evil after removing the Helmet of Opposite Alignment through the use of &lt;a href=\"exploits\"&gt;exploits&lt;/a&gt; (check the Helmet of Opposite Alignment section), which allows the Ranger to use many non-good or evil-exclusive items when they reach BG2(EE), such as the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Flesh\"&gt;Human Flesh&lt;/a&gt; armor, the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Dragon%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Dragon Scale&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Visage\"&gt;The Visage&lt;/a&gt;.

She will be surprised if you ask about a reward; so either accept or deny her plea.\nLord Tombelthen.\nThe group is located southwest of the Altar. When the party approaches, they encounter &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Igen%20Tombelthen\"&gt;Lord Igen Tombelthen&lt;/a&gt;, who, if given the chance, will explain that he is looking for a cache of Mithral hidden in the area by an ancestor of his, and he refuses to leave without it. He gives you a &lt;a href=\"Tombelthen%27s%20Journal%20%28first%20half%29\"&gt;torn journal&lt;/a&gt; containing information about the location of the mithral.\nFinding the Mithral.\nThe second half of &lt;a href=\"Tombelthen%27s%20Journal%20%28second%20half%29\"&gt;Tombelthen's Journal&lt;/a&gt; that the party may have already found in the &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Temple\"&gt;Ruined Temple&lt;/a&gt; informs the player where the Mithral is located. However, it can also be found by exploring the area east of Lord Tombelthen's location, where a number of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s led by a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; (4000 &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;) surround a rock outcropping. Once the undead are dealt with, the &lt;a href=\"Mithral%20Medallion\"&gt;Mithral Medallion&lt;/a&gt; can be found hidden in a crack in the rock.\nOutcomes.\nUpon returning to Lord Tombelthen he offers for the medallion. The player has several options:\nNote that after you give the medallion you can still kill Lord Tombelthen (and possibly his &lt;a href=\"Tamorlin%20%28Temple%20Ruins%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;) as he's trying to leave the game which gets you the 6,000 kill XP, his gear, and the medallion back.\nReward.\nReturn to the Ranger Cabin, where Mairyn is waiting outside. Upon confirming their departure or deaths to Mairyn, the party splits 21500 XP.\nQuest #2: Orog Attack.\nThree to four days after completing the previous quest, &lt;a href=\"Delon\"&gt;Delon&lt;/a&gt; approaches the party looking for help, which begins this quest. He begs you return to Imnesvale and talk to Minister Lloyd. Once the party is notified, they have three days to return to Imnesvale and speak with Minister Lloyd before they fail this quest.\nMinister Lloyd explains that a number of &lt;a href=\"%23Trivia\"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt; raiders have attacked, and they have pinned &lt;a href=\"Madulf\"&gt;Madulf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atta\"&gt;Atta&lt;/a&gt;, one of the village's shepherd boys, inside a nearby &lt;a href=\"Umar%20Cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;. The party will need to dispatch the raiders that include several &lt;a href=\"Orog\"&gt;Orog&lt;/a&gt;s backed by &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Archer%20%28Umar%20Hills%E2%80%94Ranger%29\"&gt;Orc Archers&lt;/a&gt;.

After the battle, check on Madulf and Atta inside the cave.\nThe party will receive 21750 XP for speaking to Madulf, and another 25000 XP when they return to Minister Lloyd and tell him the story that Madulf shares with them.\nQuest #3: Umar the Witch.\nFour days after the completion of the second Ranger Stronghold quest, you will again meet Delon. He asks you to return to the Umar Hills again and speak to Minister Lloyd. This time, the &lt;a href=\"Umar\"&gt;Umar Witch&lt;/a&gt; has returned!\nThe finale of this quest sees the party directed to the entrance of the Shadow Dungeon in the Temple Ruins, where Mairyn appears and begs them to do something about the witch, \"who has threatened your village... her dark and foul magics have also begun to poison the woodland!\" Enter the Temple (AR1401) once again to seek out, find and destroy Umar.\nUmar's battle party is as follows:\nDepending on the PC's experience level at the time of this encounter, there will be additional allied creatures to support Umar. \nUpon her death (4000 XP), loot her for a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Wand of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; \"\" and other gear. Return to the surface and confirm her death to Mairyn. The party is rewarded with +1 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt;, 26750 XP, and a &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Dog%20Figurine\"&gt;Moon Dog Figurine&lt;/a&gt;. There's no need to go back and speak with Minister Lloyd again.\nMod content.\nMods.\nIf you are using a mod that permits you to revisit the areas of &lt;a href=\"Shadows%20of%20Amn\"&gt;Shadows of Amn&lt;/a&gt; content after reaching the extension, then you can of course also use this quest to restore your Ranger status after falling in the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tears of Bhaal tests&lt;/a&gt;. This constitutes a second way to acquire an evil Ranger in a modded game (the first, available without mods, being the use of the &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Opposite%20Alignment\"&gt;Helmet of Opposite Alignment&lt;/a&gt; in BGEE and, beyond that, the use of exploits to make the change permanent). If you plan to do this, then you would be well advised to finish the &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20the%20Deaths%20in%20the%20Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Investigate the Deaths in the Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt; quest during the Shadows of Amn part of the game, but then not report your success to the mayor. This will allow you to recruit &lt;a href=\"Mazzy%20Fentan\"&gt;Mazzy&lt;/a&gt; (who would be gone from her prison cell if you delayed the quest until ), while avoiding getting into trouble with the timers that the stronghold quest lies under."}

More likely, the Drizzt character was influenced by \"Unearthed Arcana\", which introduced the drow as a player character race and contained somewhat ambiguous wording that allowed them to use a secondary weapon not normally permitted in \"AD&amp;D\". Drizzt appeared as a first edition character in the 1988 release \"FR5 \". Interestingly, few \"AD&amp;D\" computer games based on the second edition rule set included provision for fighting with two weapons, and those that did seem to have not have included the ranger class ability (most notably, \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Dale\"&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/a&gt;\" , which provided rangers with an extra attack when not using a shield.)\nOther notable rangers in the literature of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" include Hank from the , King Tristan Kendrick from Forgotten Realms, and Ren from Pool of Radiance."}

This is an abbreviated breakdown, and leaves out minor details, some dialogue options and other variable plot elements with only minor repercussions.\nShadows of Amn.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20City%20Gates\"&gt;City Gates&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Rasaad%20yn%20Bashir%23Recruitment%203\"&gt;recruiting&lt;/a&gt; Rasaad in &lt;a href=\"Trademeet\"&gt;Trademeet&lt;/a&gt;, travel with him to the City Gates of Athkatla (AR0020), the &lt;a href=\"Cloaked%20Figure\"&gt;Cloaked Figure&lt;/a&gt; will appear and speak to you, allowing a few options:\n&lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Amphitheater\"&gt;Abandoned Amphitheater&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveling to the secret Abandoned Ampitheater on your World Map has the party entering a new area, with a meandering forest pathway ahead of you. Continue north along the forest path and you'll see a human male figure identified as &lt;a href=\"Geld%20Quickblade\"&gt;Geld Quickblade&lt;/a&gt; (x=1260, y=2330), who demands compensation for the information he has gathered of the scouted route ahead. He demands , which you may bargain down to . If you don\u2019t pay him,\u00a0four large traps (x=800, y=1100) (x=900, y=1050) (x=1000, y=1000) (x=1000, y=900) will appear on the forest pathway further to the north. Beyond the traps several hundred feet away, Geld will confront the party, where he has prepared an ambush. He has command of a pack of wolves that enter the map at coordinates (x=2240, y=1970). You must defend yourself from attack.\nFurther along, and emerging from the forest path, you'll find the Abandoned Amphitheater where various monks gather in hope to join the so called \"Twofold Faith\", which can also be referred to as the \"Twofold Trust\" and is generally associated with members who are titled as a \"Heretic\". It might be confusing as the titles and dialogue aren't always consistent, just like real life.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Amphitheater%20Guard\"&gt;Amphitheater Guard&lt;/a&gt; will speak to you and demand a to know the party's purpose. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Fenuku\"&gt;Fenuku&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kelner\"&gt;Kehlner&lt;/a&gt; until your journal updates. When ready, head to where &lt;a href=\"Hammerhelm\"&gt;Hammerhelm&lt;/a&gt; is (x=4070, y=750), but his speech will only trigger if you have Rasaad in your party. Several options for the various dialogue choices are:\nLearn the temple's location, either from Hammerhelm himself through specific dialogue options, or by reading the &lt;a href=\"Note\"&gt;Note&lt;/a&gt; looted (or pickpocketed) from his possession (everyone gets 3000XP). If Viconia is in your party, she will respond strongly to the heresy against Shar and will question your choices throughout the scenes.\u00a0\nYou're not done with this area yet, head south on the continuing forest pathway, and eventually spot a group of adventurers calling themselves the \"&lt;a href=\"Vagrant%20Blades\"&gt;Vagrant Blades&lt;/a&gt;\", they're debating who's the rightful owner of the &lt;a href=\"Belt%20of%20Minor%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Belt of Minor Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, a treasure they just found, and your opinions regarding the belt influence the encounter:\u00a0\nThe Wilderness.\nThe next time you travel between areas on the World Map, you\u2019ll encounter the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Sel%C3%BBne\"&gt;Tears of Sel\u00fbne&lt;/a&gt; in a rainy wilderness clearing. A somewhat complicated dialogue exchange will be presented to the party, you may wind up with the following results:\n&lt;a href=\"Heretic%20Temple\"&gt;Heretic Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nExterior.\nSouth down the road from where you arrive\u00a0is &lt;a href=\"Herath\"&gt;Herath&lt;/a&gt;, a distressed and wounded Monk\u00a0who has failed initiation in the Heretic Temple.\u00a0If Rasaad is in party, he\u2019ll attempt to help her; you\u00a0may:\nIf Rasaad is not in the party, Herath will wait indefinitely at the entrance of the map until Rasaad is in the party. A reminder - You should have Rasaad in your party to do this questline, as the content and rewards are tilted significantly toward him in your group. Rasaad not in your party will significantly reduce the experience gain and limit dialogue and other options for you.\nFurther south you may encounter a pack of wolves. After defeating them, go further south and observe a Monk standing at the entrance to a bridge or causeway leading to the Heretic Temple proper. The Monk is Heretic Guard who will challenge the party when close enough, and if visible to him.\u00a0You may:\nBy the main Heretic temple door\u00a0another Heretic Guard will challenge and question your purpose;\u00a0you may:\nStill outside, observe a cut-scene featuring &lt;a href=\"Heretic%20Blynnyk\"&gt;Heretic Blynnyk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Soul%20Horvat\"&gt;Sun Soul Horvat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heretic%20Coren\"&gt;Heretic Coren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Soul%20Lara\"&gt;Sun Soul Lara&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0This scene shows a training and testing-evaluation event with Monks versus beasts in unarmed combat. Next to them is &lt;a href=\"Jolstead\"&gt;Jolstead&lt;/a&gt;, the Beastmaster who's involved in the &lt;a href=\"Where%27s%20Wilson%3F\"&gt;Where's Wilson?&lt;/a&gt; quest.\u00a0 \"Talk\" to the caged bear &lt;a href=\"Wilson\"&gt;Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, who you may free for a 5000 XP reward. You may also:\nContinue east you\u2019ll encounter three bound Sun Soul Monks tethered and staked to the ground, they say they\u2019re undergoing a \u201ctrial\u201d of some sort, a trial of pain. This is apparently part of the heretic initiation process. There are several options here:\n&lt;a href=\"Lemzenn\"&gt;Lemzenn&lt;/a&gt;, is a mysterious figure lurking in the tall grass to the east of the slope. He is immune to charm, so follow the dialog tree 3,4,3,2,1,1 to let him reveal himself as a Dark Moon Monk spy (each party member gets 1000 XP). If you wish, kill him afterwards (4000 XP). All other options either send him away or directly force him to turn hostile.\nHeretic Temple Interior.\nFirst off, it is recommended that Rasaad be in your party. If he isn't, many quest options and dialogue trees will not be present. You could limit your experience gains and reduce the playability of the scenario. There may be bugs and glitches introduced as well. You can always release Rasaad later if you wish to, right after the Heretic Temple quest. In short, it is better to have Rasaad for this quest sequence, than not. \nOnce Inside the &lt;a href=\"Heretic%20Temple%20Interior\"&gt;Heretic Temple Interior&lt;/a&gt;, send at least one party member forward near the center of the area. This will trigger the opening speech from &lt;a href=\"Collus%20Darathon\"&gt;Collus Darathon&lt;/a&gt;. There are numerous statements, potential replies, questions and talk that will form the direction of what will transpire from this quest. It could end in immediate hostility, or you may choose to further infiltrate and learn the inner workings of the Heretic \"Two-Fold Trust\". Several unique and useful items can be gained for the party if you participate and complete the four tests of initiation. It is recommended that you take this path for maximum reward and access the available content. Initiation is the longer and much more rewarding path to take. There are basically two results of the path you take. The first is open hostility from the Heretics, and the second is the Initiation course.\nHostility Path: You'll make\u00a0all non-party Heretic Temple occupants hostile. Blood will be shed, and eventually after a certain point the &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Combat\"&gt;Master of Combat&lt;/a&gt; will intercede and implore you to cease the pointless fighting and to stop the madness. You may ignore him and continue the fight. Furthert on as the battle continues, a temple scout will enter the fray, and announce that the followers of Shar, the Sharran's, are nearly at the temple gates and intend to destroy the Heretic Temple and all involved (including your party). More dialogue and choices follow. The most rewarding choice is to choose to fight the Sharrans with the remaining Heretic Two-Fold members. The master of Combat will exit the temple (to see what is going on) outside the temple. You may follow when you are ready. You could buff, or even rest and continue if you wish. In the end you will have to leave the temple anyway.\nInitiation Path: If you choose\u00a0initiation, there are four trials, or tests to complete. Your main character will be the only person allowed in each testing chamber. A brief description of each is as follows:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Combat\"&gt;Master of Combat&lt;/a&gt; appears after the trials. Go speak with him near the center of the temple to advance the quest.\nAfter the fourth trial, \nNormally the Master will lead the troops against the siege, but if you can manage to convince Rasaad to stand out, he\u2019ll be in charge of the heretic monks. The dialogue with Collus Darathon will also be slightly different (everyone gets 10000 XP for completing this quest section).\nWhen ready, exit the temple to face the Sharrans.\nBattle with the Sharrans.\nThere are a significant number of allies and enemies present.\u00a0If you do not have Rasaad in the party, the pre-battle chatter will be very short. If Rasaad is in the party, it will be longer and you will discover the plot, including that Alorgoth is really Collus\u00a0Darathon.\nBattle Aftermath.\nIf the Master of Combat lives, there will be extra dialogue from him. Of the dialogue options presented, you may choose option 3 indicating \"temporary setback\" which can lead to Rasaad rebuilding and leading the Trust (likely if he led the battle). He will leave the party for the remaining SoA, transferring to you his inventory items (even those exclusive to him). Don't forget to check the bodies for their loot and treasures.\nAfterwards, you can go back inside and talk to the surviving monks or depart the Map and press on with your campaign. This ends the Rasaad Journey portion in SoA. If you have Rasaad in your party for Throne of Bhaal, there is further plot to explore.\nThrone of Bhaal.\nThis part of the quest begins much with a good old fashioned ambush as you traverse the &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;world map&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 Sharran assassins will attack you; after they are dead, a note on one of them adds Deepstone Clanhold to your map, which is where the rest of the quest takes place. &lt;a href=\"Viconia%20DeVir\"&gt;Viconia&lt;/a&gt; will leave party permanently if you would like to proceed this quest.\nThe dwarven Deepstone clan has had its mines and fort taken over by &lt;a href=\"Alorgoth\"&gt;Alorgoth&lt;/a&gt; and his Sharran followers.\u00a0 Upon entering the map, a dwarf named Lemp Coldhearth will ask you what your business here is.\u00a0 If you indicate to him that you are an enemy of the Sharrans, he will take you to a camp to speak with Meems Dugdeep, who asks you to free some of her fellow dwarves from their Sharran captors in the northeast part of the map.\nThere are three ways to get into the fort from here: You can rescue the captive dwarves and take one of them up on his offer to use a downstream entrance; you can use Meems' idea of a tunnel; or you can simply barge through the front gate.\u00a0\nOnce inside the mines be sure to pick up the dwarf named Bentaxe for a gold reward at the end of the quest.\u00a0 No matter which method of entry you use, Alorgoth will be waiting on the bottom floor of the fort, in the mine area.\nUnfortunately, as soon as he spots you, he flees to the Shadow Plane along with his subordinate &lt;a href=\"Yxtrazzal\"&gt;Yxtrazzal&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 Follow him through the portal he creates, and corner him in the southern part of the map.\u00a0 Undaunted, Algoroth reveals Yxtrazzal to be a Shadow Dragon, and both attack, along with several Shadow Creatures.\u00a0 During this battle, Alorgoth cannot be killed, so focus your attacks on Yxtrazzal and the Shadow Creatures instead.\nOnce Yxtrazzal is dead, she drops an item called the &lt;a href=\"Wheel%20of%20Obliteration\"&gt;Wheel of Obliteration&lt;/a&gt;, and the Shadow Plane begins to deteriorate.\u00a0 You must return to the crystals near where you appeared in the Shadow Plane and use the Wheel of Obliteration (via quick item slot) to create a new portal home.\u00a0 Before you enter this portal, Alorgoth appears, only to fall at the hands of many Shadow Creatures.\u00a0 The Wheel is destroyed when you step through the portal.\nUpon returning to the mine, a dwarf named Bentaxe will reward you with 7,500 gold.\u00a0 Finally, Rasaad declares his revenge to be complete at long last, which ends the quest and grants 20,000 XP.\nOn your way back outside make sure to check the ground floor of Deepstone again. If you have not cleared the place before now all the enemies will be dead and you can loot their bodies. Also, in the northeast corner in Alorgoth's Quarters you can find three very interesting unique items - &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Dark%20Moon\"&gt;Cloak of the Dark Moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Headband%20of%20the%20Devout\"&gt;Headband of the Devout&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Walkers\"&gt;Night Walkers&lt;/a&gt;."}

The plot was uncovered, and Rashad - like his master - met his death at the hand of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the dialogue, Rashad will shapeshift into his true &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Doppelganger\"&gt;Greater Doppelganger&lt;/a&gt; form."}

When the player speaks to her she is clearly frightened and if asked who she expected to come through the door she will say there is a &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt; behind her house who has been harassing her. Then she asks you to kill the &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt; offering 150 gold as a reward, more than enough for killing such a weak monster, but if the player isn't happy with this she can be pressured into giving the player 300-500gp and her &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Necklace\"&gt;Pearl Necklace&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Widow%20Leila\"&gt;The Widow Leila&lt;/a&gt; should not be confused with the barmaid of the same name in Baldur's Gate II.

He is not hostile and when spoken to it becomes clear that he has some kind of romantic feelings for &lt;a href=\"The%20Widow%20Leila\"&gt;Leila&lt;/a&gt;. He also mutters something about a contract but is unable to articulate exactly what he is talking about. At this point the player can either kill him or instigate further.\nInvestigation.\nWhen questioned about the contract &lt;a href=\"The%20Widow%20Leila\"&gt;Leila&lt;/a&gt; tries to lie but is clearly very nervous and if pressed will admit that there was indeed a contract. The &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt; outside was once her husband and when they were married he put in the marriage contract that as long as she lives in his house and uses his money she must remain faithful to him even after his death. Assuming that he meant she could not remarry or take another lover she signed it without protest but he made arrangements before his death to be brought back by a necromancer so they could still be together.\nThe day after his funeral he arrived at her door and demanded she resume her wifely duties but, though she loved him in life, she found the idea too repulsive and could not. The other villagers helped her drive him away but he keeps hanging around the village. At this point the player can either agree to kill the &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;, leave, or insist that &lt;a href=\"The%20Widow%20Leila\"&gt;Leila&lt;/a&gt; honor the contract.\nCompletion and Outcomes.\nHonor the Agreement.\nIf the player insists that &lt;a href=\"The%20Widow%20Leila\"&gt;Leila&lt;/a&gt; honor the contract she gives in easily and continues with her plan to leave her home and give up her husband's money. This was her intention before the player spoke to her but she hired them in hopes of another solution. The player can send her on her way with nothing or offer her 50 gold out of kindness.\nReward: 300XP.\nKilling the Zombie.\nAfter hearing &lt;a href=\"The%20Widow%20Leila\"&gt;Leila's&lt;/a&gt; story the player can still go back outside and kill the &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;. Like all &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s he is weak and dies easily. Once he is dead and the player returns to &lt;a href=\"The%20Widow%20Leila\"&gt;Leila&lt;/a&gt; and she will give the player the promised reward. If the player did not investigate the truth behind the &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Widow%20Leila\"&gt;Leila&lt;/a&gt; will reveal that he claimed to be her husband on completion of the quest but she will say nothing of the contract.\nReward: 300XP, 150gp, 300gp, or 500gp and possibly &lt;a href=\"The%20Widow%20Leila\"&gt;Leila's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Necklace\"&gt;Pearl Necklace&lt;/a&gt; depending on dialogue choices and charisma."}

Enter the Jysstev Estate. Talk to the butler. Sir Sarles will be in the northernmost rooms after that. The arrogant sculptor refuses unless he is provided the medium of his choice: two hundred pounds of pure &lt;a href=\"Illithium%20Ore\"&gt;Illithium Ore&lt;/a&gt;. In pursuit of this, he sends them to &lt;a href=\"Jerlia\"&gt;Jerlia&lt;/a&gt; the Ore Merchant, who runs a stall in &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen talking to her, Jerlia explains that pure illithium is very rare and she only deals out 50 pounds of the ore each season herself. She offers to provide an &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20of%20Illithium%20Alloy\"&gt;Illithium Alloy&lt;/a&gt; for 200 gp instead, which she can do in a day. If the party is diplomatic, and sweetens the pot with more, she reveals that she buys her illithium from a &lt;a href=\"Duergar\"&gt;Duergar&lt;/a&gt; trader, &lt;a href=\"Unger%20Hilldark\"&gt;Unger Hilldark&lt;/a&gt;, who operates out of the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are three routes to complete this quest:\nObtaining fake illithium.\nTelling Jerlia to create the Illithium Alloy prompts her to tell the party to return in a day. However, when they do, she explains that demand from other temples means she must increase the price she originally set, from the original 200 to a new 500. She must be paid this amount to hand over the Alloy.\nUpon returning to Sir Sarles, however, it is unsatisfactory; &lt;a href=\"Keldorn%20Firecam\"&gt;Keldorn Firecam&lt;/a&gt; will admit the Alloy is fake if he is in the party, but even if he is not and you don't admit the truth, Sir Sarles still recognizes the Alloy is fake because it holds smears, something that doesn't happen to pure illithium. Outraged, he leaves Athkatla, forcing the party to return to their Temple and report the failure. However, the Temple's superior sees the Illithium Alloy and mistakes it as Sir Sarles' work, accepting it happily. The party is rewarded with for this route.\nObtaining real illithium.\nSpeaking to Unger Hilldark has him reveal that he can't give you any illithium, as it was stolen from him by an evil demihuman named &lt;a href=\"Neb\"&gt;Neb&lt;/a&gt;. As Hilldark reveals, Neb is hidden inside a &lt;a href=\"Derelict%20House\"&gt;derelict house&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20District\"&gt;Bridge District&lt;/a&gt;. Upon finding him, he reveals himself as the child murderer from Baldur's Gate. An Evil Gorion's Ward can bargain with him to just give them the ore, but &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt; will force a confrontation. If you choose to fight Neb, he will use invisibility and summon 4 &lt;a href=\"Child%20Spirit\"&gt;Child Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s to attack you.\u00a0 Neb's death rewards the party with , a lesser restoration spell cast on each party member (those spirits can cause level drain, but in the end everyone will be back to normal), and for each Child Spirit that survived the battle (while killing them only rewards per spirit). On his corpse is the Illithium Ore the party seeks, as well as &lt;a href=\"Neb%27s%20Nasty%20Cutter\"&gt;Neb's Nasty Cutter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neb%27s%20Head\"&gt;Neb's Head&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20for%20BG2\"&gt;Unfinished Business for BG2&lt;/a&gt;\" adds the \"Extended Illithium Quest\" which provides an alternative path to complete the quest. You must first rescue Unger Hilldark's brother from the Temple Ruins in the &lt;a href=\"Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt; to find how to obtain the real illithium. Still, if you can kill Neb, you can take the ore for yourself.\nPlayer exploits regarding Sir Sarles.\nBelow are some dubious roleplay and immersion twisting pursuits that can be tried to circumvent the quest's intended reward and plot - optional of course:"}

The only differences between this spell and &lt;a href=\"Gate%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;wizard version&lt;/a&gt; are that this version has a much shorter casting time and is a level 7 spell (instead of level 9), meaning Cleric/Mages are able to put it in a &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Contingency\"&gt;Chain Contingency&lt;/a&gt; (as it only accepts spells up to level 8).\nGameplay.\nThe caster selects a point on the map location within range where the gated demon shall appear - this is done by using the targeting cursor to designate the point on the map.\nWhen the spell is finished an infernal gate graphic animation renders at the caster's targeting point, and a few seconds later the fiend appears on the map, ready to attack any creatures in its detection range, as determined by the creature's default AI script.\nThis fiend is unable to leave the area map it is teleported to and cannot follow the party to another map area.\nWhen the spell's duration expires the fiend disappears from the material plane, with a brief lighting effect and a text reading \"Pit Fiend: Unsummoned\". \nA summoned fiend killed in combat leaves a corpse behind on the map.\nThis spell interacts with the summoning cap in a way that's different than most summoning spells, in that summoned demons/devils do not add to the total towards the summoning cap (meaning, it's technically possible to summon as many demons/devils as you are able to). \nHowever, the spell still respects the summoning cap, meaning you won't be able to summon a demon if you already have 5 non-demon creatures summoned.\nAs a \"GoodButRed\" creature (i.e. technically allied to the party, but has a red circle), the Pit Fiend gated in by this spell doesn't get a save against &lt;a href=\"Otiluke%27s%20Resilient%20Sphere\"&gt;Otiluke's Resilient Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, just like what happens with regular (blue circle) allied creatures.\nMultiple party summoned demons aren't friendly toward each other - they can and will treat others as enemies - however, a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Evil (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%2C%2010%27%20Radius\"&gt;Protection From Evil, 10' Radius&lt;/a&gt; can be cast upon these party summoned fiends, so they do not target each other.\nThe player's party do not gain experience for enemies whom this gated fiend kills.\nAny party summoned fiends are technically allied to party and will provoke any neutral NPC to \"agro\" as if you attacked them yourself.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset and the Gate (Priest Spell) requires that the summoner name the creature to come through the gate, and it isn't necessarily an evil being such as a fiend. The spell ages the Priest by 5 years. See the External Links below.\nA player's suggested Solo party member tactic.\nAs mentioned above, unlike the wizard version, this spell is only level 7, meaning it can be put into a Chain Contingency. Normally, summoning multiple demons at once is a bad idea, as they'll fight each other, but it's possible to avoid that via casting some form of protection from evil on every single one of them. With that in mind, it's possible for a high-level Cleric/Mage to have 3 Pit Fiends (or any other combination of demons) out at once, in a convenient way, via use of this spell, the aforementioned Chain Contingency, &lt;a href=\"Contingency\"&gt;Contingency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%2C%2010%27%20Radius\"&gt;Protection From Evil, 10' Radius&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst, cast Chain Contingency (any condition, but with target \"myself\") and select any combination of demon-summoning spells you want (e.g. Gate or even one of each: Gate, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Fiend\"&gt;Summon Fiend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cacofiend\"&gt;Cacofiend&lt;/a&gt;). Then, cast Contingency (same condition as before and target \"myself\", once again) and select Protection from Evil 10' Radius as the spell to be used.\nSince the two contingencies have the same condition, they fire off simultaneously and, once it happens, all three gated demons (as well as the player, of course) will immediately be protected against evil (even before their gating process is finished) and won't attack each other.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has replaced Gate (priest) with the spell described below:\nSummon Death Knight\nLevel: 7\nSchool: Necromancy\nSphere: All\nRange: Medium\nDuration: 3 turns\nCasting Time: 1 round\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nBy means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack his foes and himself if not careful.

They levitate and move about in a hovering fashion. These creatures are often found with their more mature kin. \nGameplay.\nThe Gauth utilize their array of eye stalks to fire beholder blast projectile rays at enemies. They can target a single creature at a time with a specific type of ray. \nThey are without the dreadful ability known as the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt;. Gauths cannot be backstabbed. As a Gauth or beholder's eye stalks fire projectiles, you cannot \"disrupt\" these attacks like you could with a spell caster attempting to cast a spell. These projectiles can't be interrupted by damaging the creature.\nIn an unmodified game, the Gauth is unprotected against some effects that the Beholder is immune to. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grease\"&gt;Grease&lt;/a&gt; and entangle won't affect a beholder, but will be able to ensnare a Gauth. This is not the case if playing with the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod. All beholder varieties are under a free action type protection effect.\nA Gauth has several eye stalks, each of which can fire a different \"Beholder Blast\" projectile. If the projectile strikes the target, it will cause a spell effect. Most beholder blast spell effects can be blocked by magic resistance and allow saving throws to negate or reduce their potency. Also, as the blasts are spell effects, protective magics such as &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt; and similar can protect the target, but this is dependent on the specific beholder blast type and their assigned spell &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt;. A gauth typically has five or six eye stalks and can fire the following beholder blasts:\nSince they rapidly spam Cause Serious Wounds Beholder Blast Rays, you will probably need some form of protection.\nSuggested methods to handle Gauths/Beholders:\nMod content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod and the \"Smarter Beholders\" component will change beholder intelligence and some other abilities in your game. Note that Gauths are less likely to have some of the more deadly eye stalk beholder blast rays. From the Mod Author:\nThis component upgrades the AI\u00a0of the beholders, gauths, elder orbs and hive mothers in SoA\u00a0and ToB. It basically tries to do it non-cheesily, but it's hard to define this exactly since beholder powers are almost all scripted. Beholders get to use their eyestalks about once per ten seconds each, but they will tend to manage to get through more of them in a round; their targeting has also been drastically improved (the new scripts are about 150 times the length of the old ones!)\nIn accordance with the\u00a02nd edition rules, beholders are now immune to most (not all) of their own eyestalks, which makes them more willing to bombard their way through Spell Deflection. I have added a Telekinesis eyestalk (more for fun than for increased challenge). And I have borrowed, with thanks, the Quest Pack component which allows beholders to lose their eyestalks when damaged. Beholders are also unable to use eyestalk powers when blinded (although their allies may use anti-magic rays to remove the blindness).\nThis component is sensitive to the difficulty setting:"}

Gellal is now a level 12/12 Fighter/Thief class, with 20 STR, 20 DEX, 19 CON, 145 HP, an adjusted &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt; of 2.5, THAC0 3, and Armor Class -3. He can only be struck with +2 enchanted weapons or greater. Gellal may use any of the SCS standard vampire innate abilities such as Vampire Domination, shapeshift to bat or wolf, and has the CON draining melee attack to go along with the level drain."}

The purpose of this page is to provide information for all four of these buildings in one place and thereby eliminate the need for separate pages. \nAll of these buildings have a standard layout of two floors with a &lt;a href=\"Bartender\"&gt;bartender&lt;/a&gt; on the ground floor and multiple &lt;a href=\"Commoner\"&gt;commoners and townsfolk&lt;/a&gt; found throughout both floors. Two have bartenders and gaming tables on the second floor while the other two have rooms. All provide rooms ranging from Peasant to Royal and serve the same six kinds of drinks.\nThe two establishments with rooms on the second floor all contain lootable chests, some of which are locked, although not all containers have loot in them.

Because of the vampire presence, regardless of the actual time calculation in Brynnlaw, the opening arrival will always be at Nighttime.\nOnce the party has defeated the vampires, Sime instructs them to head to the local tavern, known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Vulgar%20Monkey\"&gt;The Vulgar Monkey&lt;/a&gt;, and speak to a man named &lt;a href=\"Sanik\"&gt;Sanik&lt;/a&gt;, before she heads off to scout.\nSanik is a merchant who supplies the Asylum with basic materials, such as food and spell components, but he states that he is leaving town because of a certain \"misunderstanding\" with the local brothel mistress, &lt;a href=\"Galvena\"&gt;Galvena&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore he can explain the matter further, an assassin appears and kills him with an arrow \u2014 then attacks the party. Dispatch the murderer to end the encounter.\nThe innkeeper will be angered about the assassination and will explain to the party the situation of Galvena's business and that Sanik was killed because he had an affair with one of the Lady's brothel employees, &lt;a href=\"Claire\"&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt;. The innkeeper suggests that Claire may be killed by Galvena, and that perhaps she knows how to enter the Asylum. He also explains that you will need some help to enter Galvena's Brothel \u2014 either using violence or talking to a &lt;a href=\"Courtesan\"&gt;Courtesan&lt;/a&gt; just outside her festhall brothel.\nThe Brothel.\nWhen you first reach Brynnlaw, the Brothel, or sometimes referred to as \"\"Festhall\" (or even \"Parlor\" and also \"Galveena's Festhall\"\" - \"seriously\") will be closed to customers/visitor and the courtesans will shun you away, but it will become available after the events in The Vulgar Monkey with Sanik. \nThe courtesan (either a male or a female, depending on the party leader) will either take you inside the building or explain how one can enter by using &lt;a href=\"Galvena%27s%20Medallion\"&gt;Galvena's Medallion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party Journal will update and display:\nIf you choose the medallion, you will have to find &lt;a href=\"Chremy\"&gt;Chremy&lt;/a&gt; and then fight him to acquire it. There's no need to wear the medallion, just keep it in your inventory and enter the Brothel, where the frontman/greeter will stop you. \nOnce inside, you will have dialogue with the frontman. \nBasically, to get past him you have three choices to do so:\nFirst, Tell him you are a new employee, and he'll let the party pass through the door to the interior (which is the &lt;a href=\"Cellar%20of%20Brothel\"&gt;Cellar of Brothel&lt;/a&gt; area). If you try this without Galvena's medallion, he'll know you lie, and hostilities will commence. This will not only make him hostile, but any guards further into the interior of the brothel. Basically, your ruse will have failed, and your only course of action is entering as an aggressor and use of force. \nSecond, tell him you are here to hire some companionship. The greater will then say \"Of course! Just out the door of our fine establishment, you shall find a selection of courtesans such as the world has never seen. For a small fee, they shall take care of you.\" Go outside a speak with a courtesan. You may then attempt to try and convince a courtesan to get you inside - you will go to their room. It becomes apparent that Lady Galvena is a horrible person and cruel boss. They will urge you to end Lady Galvena's operations and will suggest that you go speak with the cook &lt;a href=\"Ellie\"&gt;Ellie&lt;/a&gt;, who dislikes the whole state of affairs, and then give her a \"Sleeping Draught\" to use and assist the party getting past some Brothel guards.\nThird, take a chance by using no subterfuge, and attack the &lt;a href=\"Brothel%20Front%20%28greeter/guard%29\"&gt;frontman&lt;/a&gt;. He'll fight back, and two pirate lackey fighters will appear to assist him. Assuming the party wins the fight (of course they will!), if you search the fallen will find the &lt;a href=\"Guild%20House%20Key\"&gt;Guild House Key&lt;/a&gt;. Now access to the brothel cellar is in your hands. When ready, enter the interior. The locked door to the interior of the brothel can be lockpicked, and the key won't be needed. However, if this is done, an alarm script will cause the frontman to become hostile, and a group of pirate fighters will appear to assist, and any guards within the brothel will be alerted and hostile. In other words, the jig is up, and no subterfuge or other plan will work except for brute force methods. \nWithin the brothel cellar are five doors on the long hallway, which is shown on the &lt;a href=\"Cellar%20of%20Brothel\"&gt;Cellar of Brothel&lt;/a&gt; page. The first door leads to the Brothel entrance (the one the party entered from); the second is to the courtesan's room; the third to the kitchen; the fourth to Galvena's private bed chamber quarters; the fifth door is locked and leads to a small dungeon where Claire is being held and tortured. There are two guards by the fourth and fifth doors, and as soon as you reach the third door, they will inquire who you are - they are very suspicious and hard to avoid. The party might avoid detection by stealthing past the guards while hidden or invisible. If you have the &lt;a href=\"Galvena%27s%20Medallion\"&gt;Galvena's Medallion&lt;/a&gt; and the correct dialogue choices, you can convince the guard you are a new employee. If the guards are already hostile, due to previous fighting or picking of the locked door in the Brothel entrance area, then none of this will apply. Those guards will attack the party on sight.\nIn the kitchen, talk with Ellie and her aide. She will agree to apply the draught (obtained from the courtesan you spoke with earlier in the courtesan's room) to the Brothel guard's ale. Ellie's aide will hand it to them. Exit the kitchen and observe as the guards in the hallway and their captain in Galveena's HQ/bed chamber fall peacefully asleep in a drugged slumber. You may now search that room for Galvena's Key, to open the Brothel prison/dungeon door. Afterwards, while the &lt;a href=\"Guard%20%28Brothel%20Cellar%29\"&gt;Guard (Brothel Cellar)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Captain%20%28Brothel%29\"&gt;Guard Captain (Brothel)&lt;/a&gt; are under the effects of the spiked ale with the sleeping potion, if the party desires they may attack them. The guards will arise and try to fight back. Don't forget to return and speak with Ellie after lady Galvena has been vanquished, to inform her of your deeds, for a XP reward. \nAlternatively, the party can just use violence and take out the Brothel guards through force of arms on your way to find Claire the Brothel dungeon. The fight shouldn't be difficult at this stage of the saga. One of the guards wields a &lt;a href=\"Halberd%20%2B2\"&gt;Halberd +2&lt;/a&gt;. You'll need Galvena's Key to get into the Brothel prison/dungeon area, which is found in one of the hallway side rooms. if you decide to do it this way, then Ellie the cook and all that other Sleeping Draught business is now over. You may safely ignore Ellie and company.\nGalvena's Key to open the Brothel prison doorway is inside Galvena's/HQ bedchamber.\nRescuing Claire.\nWith the key in hand, gather your party and enter the Brothel Prison map. As soon as you open the eastern door, you will see Galvena, &lt;a href=\"Vadek\"&gt;Vadek&lt;/a&gt; and Claire. After some dialogue, hostilities will ensue. Note that combat in small spaces can be tricky, so expect a confined area with little room for maneuver. \nVadek is a wizard and will engage in spell casting if able when hostilities begin. See his article page for details. Galvena will engage in melee combat and is less of a potential menace. Suggest that the party pay attention to Vadek as a priority. If defeated, Valdek drops a score of Darts +1 and a Quarterstaff +2; Galvena drops a Studded Leather Armor +3 and a Flail +2.\nAddress Claire inside the cell and she will then soon transition with the party to the docks so she can escape Brynnlaw. It is assumed the party helps her do this, as one of her legs has been broken during torture. A friend of Sanik's, named &lt;a href=\"Golin\"&gt;Golin&lt;/a&gt;, will greet Claire, then thank the party for her rescue, Claire will board his ship. Golin then will finally explain to &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; how to access the Asylum: First, with a specific ward stone possessed by the Island's administrative Cowled Wizard, &lt;a href=\"Perth%20the%20Adept\"&gt;Perth the Adept&lt;/a&gt;. The second path would be to petition the Pirate Lord Desharik to allow entry.\nThe Bodhi path.\nAs soon as the party arrives on Brynnlaw, Saemon Havarian tells you to find &lt;a href=\"Sanik\"&gt;Sanik&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Vulgar%20Monkey\"&gt;The Vulgar Monkey&lt;/a&gt; inn. The same information will be furnished to the party as above, and the same path to get more information will be presented.\nPerth the Adept and the wardstone path.\n&lt;a href=\"Perth%20the%20Adept\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; is a mage that lives in the eastern part of Brynnlaw. Enter the &lt;a href=\"CW%27s%20House\"&gt;Cowled Wizard's residence&lt;/a&gt; and dialogue will begin \u2014 leading to an inevitable confrontation. Do not give him much time to act, as he can cast powerful spells. He will drop the &lt;a href=\"Wardstone%20for%20Asylum\"&gt;Wardstone for Asylum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Infinite%20Spells\"&gt;Book of Infinite Spells&lt;/a&gt; if slain. See his article page for more details.\nWardstone in hand, head to the northeastern exit of the town, where you can find\u00a0your trusted escort &lt;a href=\"Sime\"&gt;Sime&lt;/a&gt; once again. Speak to her then proceed to Spellhold. The party will enter a new map. \nPirate Lord Desharik path.\nDesharik is within his home. A guard outside his residence will need to be persuaded to let you have an audience with the Pirate lord. Once inside, then the party may take an alternate path to gain entry into Spellhold. You'll require either &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wilson\"&gt;Wilson&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; in your party, or a player character with superior charisma (16+).\nAs Golin explained, &lt;a href=\"Desharik\"&gt;Desharik&lt;/a&gt; has been using his position to throw anyone he considers a threat in the Asylum as a \"deviant\". His enemies, but also the mentally ill, wind up in Spellhold. You must convince him that you belong there. Telling him \"I'm mad\" is not enough by itself. He'll require further proof. See Desharik's page for the details.\nAs such, having either Minsc (a ranger who talks with a hamster) and/or Wilson (a brown bear who speaks with &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;) in the party is enough to convince him. Or another possible way: the captain will recognize Yoshimo (Yoshimo suspiciously claims the pirate lord must \"believe he owes him from a previous debt\").\nIf this goes well, you will be granted entrance to the Asylum without having to obtain the Wardstone or confront the Cowled Wizard representative."}

Once the party has the skull, they must take it to the The Lady's Hall in &lt;a href=\"West%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;West Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and give it to &lt;a href=\"Agnasia\"&gt;Agnasia&lt;/a&gt;, a priestess of Tymora. \nWhen the party gives the skull to Agnasia she expresses surprise at seeing it and will explain Ghorak's full story. It turns out his brother Kereph was a priest of Tymora and had so much good fortune in his life that \"people\" became jealous and murdered him. His body was torn apart and his head was cut off and taken so that it could not be buried with him. Agnasia then thanks the party for returning it and rewards them, and advises that they return to Ghorak as she believes the curse will now be lifted.\nCompletion.\nWhen the player returns to Ghorak and tells him that his brother's skull has been returned to the The Lady's Hall, his curse is lifted. He gives the player his thanks but nothing else. The only rewards for this quest are 1000 XP and a one point &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; increase, which have been already given by Agnasia."}

This semi-illusory material covers the subject and actually gives some real protection provided that opponents don\u2019t actively disbelieve in the armor (detecting the illusion) and neither a dispel magic nor detect illusion spell is cast upon it. Until dispelled or disbelieved, the armor sets the recipient\u2019s base armor class to 2. This spell will not function with any other form of magical armor, but it is cumulative with dexterity bonuses and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The ghost armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. A favorite among mage/thieves, the ghostly nimbus of light which surrounds the recipient grants +20% bonus to Hide in Shadows."}

He is encountered in a hidden and locked away room on the second floor of the &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Keep\"&gt;de'Arnise Keep&lt;/a&gt; and is under some sort of enchantment forcing his servitude to the &lt;a href=\"Trolls\"&gt;invaders&lt;/a&gt; of the keep.\nOnce discovered, he will proclaim his loyalty to his &lt;a href=\"TorGal\"&gt;new master&lt;/a&gt; and attack the party. His enchantment can be &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;dispelled&lt;/a&gt; or he can be &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Creature\"&gt;charmed&lt;/a&gt; and then talked to for extra quest experience. Note that he is entitled to &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt;s and may resist being charmed.\nIf you kill Glaicus, he will drop the &lt;a href=\"Flail%20Head%20%28Acid%29\"&gt;acid flail head&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the heads required to create the &lt;a href=\"Flail%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Flail of Ages&lt;/a&gt;. If you charm him, he will give you the item unless &lt;a href=\"TorGal\"&gt;TorGal&lt;/a&gt; is dead; if the party has already killed the trolls, he must be killed for the item. (In the he will give you the head when charmed.)\nNote.\nIn , he bears the Glaicas tooltip name, but is still called Glaicus during dialogue with other NPCs.\nBugs.\nEnhanced Edition.\nIn the Enhanced Edition, Glaicus' behavior is handled by the area script and a special status effect that forces allegiance to \"Enemy\". It lasts for 50 game days, but as a caster level 1 effect has a 99% chance to be dispelled successfully by a level 11+ spellcaster.\nUnfortunately that special status effect is bugged and unreliable, and it is possible that a successful dispel will fail to return Glaicus' allegiance to \"Neutral\". This should be fixable with the following command. Do make sure to dispel him first, then execute the command to turn him \"Neutral\":\n C:Eval('ActionOverride(\"kpglai01\",ChangeEnemyAlly(Myself,NEUTRAL))')\nAnother approach is to successfully dispel Glaicus, and \"then only\" &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Creature\"&gt;\"gentle\" charm&lt;/a&gt; him using the &lt;a href=\"Nymph%20Cloak\"&gt;Nymph Cloak&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Human%20Influence\"&gt;Ring of Human Influence&lt;/a&gt;. Avoid other charms because they turn the victim hostile when they wear off.\nEither way, once Glaicus has been dispelled and been made either \"Neutral\" or \"Ally\", the area script should kick in and finish the job: Glaicus should initiate dialogue on his own. If that fails, the party may force the dialogue themselves. If that \"still\" doesn't work, execute the following console command and then speak to him again:\n C:SetGlobal(\"KPGlai01Talked\",\"AR1303\",1)\nOriginal Edition.\nIn the Original Edition, the bugged status effect is not involved and Glaicus is simply turned hostile \"the normal way\" after his initial dialogue. The area script will then only turn him back if he gets charmed, but it may fail to ready him up completely. In that case, make sure he was charmed with the Nymph Cloak or Ring of Human Influence, and just wait for it to end or dispel it. He should become \"Neutral\", at which point he can be talked to. If talking to neutral Glaicus still fails, execute the following console command and talk to him again:\n CLUAConsole:SetGlobal(\"KPGlai01Talked\",\"AR1303\",1)\nIt's possible Glaicus won't become neutral even if you follow these instructions. It is unfortunately not possible to talk to charmed creatures in the original BG2, so a Neutral allegiance is necessary. Reload and make sure you never do anything to him besides casting \"gentle\" charms. Avoid crowd controls, just run around. Once charmed, wait until it wears off. If by then he doesn't turn blue but red, you're certain that the area script failed to change his allegiance back to Neutral.\nThere is little to do beyond reloading a few times hoping for the area script to stop failing. Use of &lt;a href=\"Near%20Infinity\"&gt;Near Infinity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Save%20Editors\"&gt;Shadow Keeper&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the only solution, but first a saved game is needed, so follow the above instructions until the end and then instead of reloading, flee so that you can save the game in a separate slot. You'll need to use one of the tools mentioned above to locate the creature file \"of the right saved game\". In that save, this creature file has its allegiance set to , whereas outside that save, it is . So find the right file, set its allegiance back to , save that tweak and reload the saved game. Should work now.

A default SCS AI fighter script is assigned for smarter tactical behavior and targeting. He also has Grandmastery with his sword and 2 pips in two handed weapon fighting style, which improves damage, speed factor and critical hit percentage with the great sword. Glaicus will quaff an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt; and also a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fire%20Giant%20Strength\"&gt;Potion of Fire Giant Strength&lt;/a&gt; once an opponent is observed, unless prevented in some manner. Once the Oil of speed is applied, then the warrior will be dishing out rapid blows to any in melee range, so be aware of that - it could be unexpected for an early SoA party with limited experience. Up to 5 attacks per round can be expected, dealing heavy slashing damage. If wounded, the warrior will also utilize his Potions of Extra Healing."}

Placing a \"creature\" file on a map to represent an inanimate machine, statue, altar etc. is an Infinity Engine method employed throughout the various game titles.\nAn Automap notes marker labels the machine location as \"The Globe Machine\".\nGameplay - walkthrough.\nWhen first opening the gates to this machine's location, there will be a &lt;a href=\"Mutated%20Spider\"&gt;Mutated Spider&lt;/a&gt; group within, and they'll rush toward any detected party member to attack.\nOnce these gates are opened, they cannot be closed again.\nThe Globe Machine is positioned and built-into the floor of this dungeon. It is a circular pad with a metallic base plate, with four metal pods attached to it - on each pod is a large colored button and dispensing slot.\nJust outside the machine's footprint are four colored glass and metal vertical tubes. These are selectable as empty containers, in which items can be inserted and removed (just like a chest or barrel).\nTo engage with the machine, select a party member and then use the cursor to select the center of the machine on the area map. Click on it.\nThe machine produces a dialogue box, and presents a series of text messages describing the following:\nAfter this series of dialogue that is clicked through by the player, another dialogue box presents a selection of choices for what to do next, reading:\nIf the party isn't ready to select a colored button yet, then go with the last choice, which displays the following:\nOtherwise, select a colored button of your choice, and a dialogue box will display a different text depending on the color chosen, such as:\nThis is followed by:\nThe party member will now have the first globe produced by the button (whichever color was selected) placed in the character's general inventory - if the inventory is full, it will be placed on the ground next to the character. \nThis action triggers a spawning of a particular individual or group of enemies to the eastern side of this chamber. Each colored button and the sequence of that color produces a different threat. \nWhen four buttons have been pressed on a particular color, and the button is tried again, a text will display reading:\nThe party member can continue selecting colored buttons in whichever order and color they wish to. Once four globes have been received from each color, that is all that can be produced by that particular-colored button - this means that a total of sixteen globes can be dispensed by the machine.\nWhen the party is ready, place the correct globe into the matching colored container, which are; the fourth dispensed &lt;a href=\"Red%20Globe\"&gt;Red Globe&lt;/a&gt; into the red container, and the third dispensed &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Globe\"&gt;Blue Globe&lt;/a&gt; into the blue container, the first dispensed &lt;a href=\"Green%20Globe\"&gt;Green Globe&lt;/a&gt; into the green container, and finally, the third dispensed &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Globe\"&gt;Purple Globe&lt;/a&gt; into the purple container.\nWhen the globes are all placed correctly, a Quest Journal entry will register, the &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Key\"&gt;Mind Key&lt;/a&gt; will be obtained by the party member, and each party member receives .\nColored globe enemy list.\nA listing is provided, which is a spoiler - click the page reveal link below if you wish to know what's coming.

(This is probably because, in the Infinity Engine, it is almost impossible to script creatures to avoid them crashing into each other.) This component (again in the name of fairness, and also of hassle avoidance) extends this to the player's version of these two spells: with it installed, players and NPCs use the same form of Blade Barrier. (They don't quite use the old NPC version, which had a rather shorter range: they use a hybrid version, as large as the old PC version but affecting only enemies), only on original-game installs.&lt;br&gt;\nWith &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; installed, this is the equivalent spell description:&lt;br&gt;\nGlobe of Blades&lt;br&gt;\nLevel: Quest&lt;br&gt;\nSchool: Evocation&lt;br&gt;\nSphere: Guardian, Creation&lt;br&gt;\nRange: Personal&lt;br&gt;\nDuration: 1 turn&lt;br&gt;\nCasting Time: 1 round&lt;br&gt;\nArea of Effect: 6\u2019 radius&lt;br&gt;\nSaving Throw: None&lt;br&gt;\nThe priest employs this spell to create a globe of circling, razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around the caster, forming a dangerous and impenetrable barrier. Those within a 6-foot radius of the caster suffer 2d10 points of damage every 2 seconds (save vs. breath at -6 negates). The barrier also provides the caster with a +4 armor class bonus. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.\nNote that spells like Invisibility, Shadow Door, etc. will not function on the caster when protected by Globe of Blades. Also, cleric/thieves and cleric/rangers who cast this will not be able to hide in shadows until the spell expires."}

This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fifth and higher-level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a successful dispel magic spell, as well as other forms of magical attack such as Pierce Magic and Spellstrike."}

Gnomes have dark to tan skin and dark hair. Dwarves are their distant cousins and they share the love of glittering things though gnomes have more affection and respect for the natural world than dwarves do. Gnomes love jokes and are very clever; some might even call them devious. Gnomes can be anything from fighters to illusionists and are far more capable than they appear.\nClasses.\nClass Accessibility.\n&lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illusionist\"&gt;Illusionist&lt;/a&gt; (only mage class available), &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;\nMulti-Class Accessibility.\n&lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Fighter / Thief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Cleric\"&gt;Fighter/Cleric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illusionist/Thief\"&gt;Illusionist/Thief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Fighter/Illusionist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Cleric/Illusionist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Cleric / Thief&lt;/a&gt;\nGnomes are a surprisingly useful race. The only mage class available to them is Illusionist, but this isn't a large burden as Illusion's barred school, Necromancy, does not have very many useful low-level spells.Though you lose out on a couple of useful higher level spells from the Necromancy school such as &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;. In return for this restriction, illusionist gnomes are able to naturally raise their intelligence to 19.\nAlso, because they are forced into being Illusionists, they are the only race that can multi-class a wizard kit, which is a very nice perk. Their bonus to Wand and Spell saves are god-sends against two of the most damaging attack styles in the game. Generally speaking, gnomes do it better than half-elves for any multi-class option both enjoy. It's also worth noting gnomes are one of the two races who can access the cleric/thief multi-class option. It's an odd combo and you'll be limited to clubs and quarterstaves for weapons you can backstab with, but it is a fun class regardless. The penalty to wisdom can be overlooked due to the absurd amount of ways to up your wisdom permanently.\nIn-Game Depiction.\nGnomes use the same sprite as dwarves. As the games lack a female sprite for the dwarven race there is no visual difference between female and male gnomes, even if female gnomes technically do not have facial hair. "}

While you're there, get the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Slippers\"&gt;Old Slippers&lt;/a&gt; from the bookcase.\nConverse with &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Giltham\"&gt;Archivist Giltham&lt;/a&gt; and inquire about the lower levels and the ritual (or question his sanity). He must be summoned in the Kitchen by reigniting the Fireplace using the &lt;a href=\"Tinderbox\"&gt;Tinderbox&lt;/a&gt; before any dialogue can occur.\nObtain the &lt;a href=\"Key%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Altar%20Level%29\"&gt;Key (Watcher's Keep Altar Level)&lt;/a&gt; to open the Crypt door to the &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28WK%20Altar%20Level%29\"&gt;priest's&lt;/a&gt; sarcophagus. \nThere are two &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Golem\"&gt;Guardian Golem&lt;/a&gt; creatures within the Crypt. If you don't want to fight these two defenders, ensure that the stones are possessed by the party. The golem's respective &lt;a href=\"Wardstone%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Altar%20Level%29\"&gt;wardstones&lt;/a&gt;: green for left (north), blue for the other. The cryptic handwritten notes refer to these.\nInteract with the sarcophagus to summon the undead lich-priest. The Golems will attack, unless the wardstones are in the party inventory.\nIf you brought the Old Slippers (have them in a party member inventory), the creature will know, and he'll ask for them. If given freely he will forgive your intrusion and award you to each member. He'll also invite inspection of the contents of his final resting place. Refuse, and the creature will become hostile.\nIf the slippers are provided each party member gains another .\nFollowing the instructions written on the &lt;a href=\"Tattered%20Parchment\"&gt;Tattered Parchment&lt;/a&gt; found throughout this keep's level. First, a party member with the Bell and Candle in their inventory must place them upon the altar (walk up close to it and transfer the items onto the altar container).\nThe altar Holy Ritual requires:\nHowever, interacting with the altar by moving any items to or from the altar at this stage of the game will activate the first defending phase of the &lt;a href=\"Statues%20%28WK%20Altar%20Level%29\"&gt;Statues&lt;/a&gt; that are located closest to the altar. This statue activation interrupts the item placement temporarily. The statues are dangerous opponents, and the party will need to take care and defend itself. They can do some real harm, especially to an under leveled party. Expect competent melee combat from the warrior statues, and buffs as well as &lt;a href=\"Insect%20Plague\"&gt;Insect Plague&lt;/a&gt; type attacks from the cleric statues.\nAfter the first wave of statues are dealt with - the party is probably suspicious of the remaining statues. What if they activate later? Now is the time to prepare and be ready for that likely event. Do whatever actions are deemed necessary to be able to deal with the remaining statues.\nWhen ready, continue placing the items on the altar. When all items are placed, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20%28Altar%29\"&gt;Guardian (Altar)&lt;/a&gt; engages in dialogue and begins the Holy Ritual.\nAs prompted by the Altar Guardian, select the correct ritualist steps as described in the tattered parchments and the verse read from the Priest's sarcophagus. \nIf the player selects an incorrect response - the Guardian will boom out a response \"THE RITUAL HAS BEEN DEFILED!\". \nThis results in 50 &lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;Magical damage&lt;/a&gt; to the offender, and all the objects on the altar are removed and placed back in the PC's inventory. The player will now have to try again.\nThe section below is a \"Spoiler\". Click on the \"Reveal\" button if you want to be provided the answers to the altar ritual. Don't do it if you want to figure this out on your own, like a first-time player was meant to.\nThe correct order of action during the ritual is:\nNote that the statues will animate in two phases as part of the Holy Ritual, and they'll be hostile and attack the party as the altar ritual is being performed. \nThis is unavoidable and seems to be part of the defense of the Portal to the lower reaches. These opponents are the strongest opposition faced on this dungeon level.\nWhen the first group of statue defenders is finished, return to the Altar and ensure all the items are on the Altar, placing the missing ones as required. \nOnce that has occurred, and the correct dialogue selections are made to perform the ritual in the right sequence, the player gets a Journal update and quest experience is awarded for performing this action.\nThe player must now face the second statue group, who have begun to activate after the ritual was finished properly. \nAfter defeating all the statues, the portal can be accessed and used to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Elemental%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Elemental Level&lt;/a&gt;, the player's next dungeon goal. \nJournal Entries.\nUpon talking to Archivist Giltham about the lower levels:\nUpon insulting the man or asking about the ritual:\nUpon inspecting the sarcophagus after talking to the &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28WK%20Altar%20Level%29\"&gt;Priest (WK Altar Level)&lt;/a&gt;:\nUpon completion:"}

It can be started by talking to &lt;a href=\"Pai%27Na\"&gt;Pai'Na&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player proves to not be hostile, Pai'Na explains her current problem, and the paranoia it gives her. Athkatla has recently appointed some Giant Spider-slayers in the Sewers underneath the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;, who have been going about their job with relentless gusto. As a &lt;a href=\"Hivemaster\"&gt;Hivemaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;, this incenses Pai'Na, but she cannot get close enough to stop them, as they have access to a powerful anti-spider weapon. She charges the player with retrieving it from them; whether they kill the exterminators or not is up to Gorion's Ward.\nThe exterminators that Pai'Na wants dealt with are the simple-minded Hurg and Jaeggar, who are in the central-western chamber of the Temple Sewers, Upper Level. The player may either fight them or offer to bribe them. Though the choice ranges are 50, 200 and 1000, they will turn 50 down as being too low and reject the player outright at 1000, as they don't believe anyone could possibly have that much gold. (Actually, perhaps due to a high charisma or some unknown trigger, they will accept 50 after an amusing haggle with Jaeggar). \nAs of the most recent version of the Mod, if you attack and slay these two fighters (each is only worth 165 XP), then the blade you seek will not be available/dropped. You will not be able to complete the quest. You can get the blade only by purchasing it from Hurg. \nUnfortunately, the two of them have misused &lt;a href=\"Spider%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Spider's Bane&lt;/a&gt; as a common implement, and so they have destroyed it; its only worth is to be handed over to Pai'Na, who rewards the party with 15000 EXP, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Spider%20Figurine\"&gt;Black Spider Figurine&lt;/a&gt;, and her &lt;a href=\"Web%20Sack\"&gt;Web Sack&lt;/a&gt; wand (WAND14.itm). The party may also take Scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Spawn\"&gt;Spider Spawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; from her cache.\nWithin Pai'Na's hive are four captured or charmed human males named Bene, Philbert, Samar and Treddin. Perhaps they are envenomed by paralytic poison. These creatures have something to do with previous spider hunting activities. Additionally, there are two of each &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phase%20Spider\"&gt;Phase Spider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Spider\"&gt;Sword Spider&lt;/a&gt; in the chamber should you attack her.\nTrivia.\nIn the final release of the game (unmodded), the &lt;a href=\"Contact%27s%20Note\"&gt;Contact's Note&lt;/a&gt; states that the city exterminators have been bribed to stop them from hunting spiders. This might be the reason why this quest was cut from the final game for consistency reasons.\nGallery.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed, both scrolls available as treasure are different and are the SR equivalent spell scrolls."}

For this reason paladins can only have an &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; of Lawful Good.\u00a0They can use all kinds of weapons and armor and have special abilities to fight and protect others from evil.\nPlayer character paladins, with the exception of blackguard, can become fallen if party &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; drops below 7 (the same is true of &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s). Fallen paladins lose a lot of experience points and all of their paladin special abilities. Redemption is possible if, during the events of \"Shadows of Amn\", the player obtains a paladin stronghold and completes all class-specific quests associated with it. Paladin companions can't fall, but will instead leave the party at low reputation, because they must have lawful good alignment.\nOnly humans may choose to be paladins. Though humans can generally &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt;, paladins may not, nor can they be dual-classed into.\nCharacter abilities table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, other Races have modified ability scores.\n^ Paladins have access to percentile Strength\nSpecial abilities of the paladin.\nTurn Undead.\nPaladins may Turn Undead once they reach level 3, but unlike clerics, whose turning powers scale fully with their levels up to 40, paladins only scales with 2 levels less, and maxes at 32.\nWhen this mode is activated, there is a possibility the undead in range of the character will stop attacking their targets and run away from the character until the effect is worn off. At higher levels, this mode may destroy undead. Blackguard control the undead instead, just like the evil clerics do.\n&lt;a href=\"Lay%20on%20Hands%20%28paladin%29\"&gt;Lay on Hands&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeals the creature paladin touches for 2 HP/level. A paladin of level 1 will only heal 2 hitpoints, but this ability scales all the way to level 34, granting up to 68 HP recovery on touch.\nDetect Evil.\nThis ability is identical to the spell &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Evil%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Detect Evil&lt;/a&gt;, but has a reduced casting time of 1. All evil-aligned creatures in the area of effect will glow red. The paladin receives 4 uses per day at level 1, and an additional use each level thereafter.\nProtection From Evil.\nThis ability is like the spell &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Protection From Evil&lt;/a&gt; but cast at faster speed and with a fixed duration of 10 rounds (1 turn). All evil aligned creatures will receive a -2 penalty to their attack roll when targeting creatures protected by the spell, the protected creature receives +2 bonus to all saving throws from when targeted by evil creatures and the spell also prevents creatures summoned by spells such as &lt;a href=\"Cacofiend\"&gt;Cacofiend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Fiend\"&gt;Summon Fiend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gate\"&gt;Gate&lt;/a&gt; from noticing the protected individual.\nSaving throws bonus.\nThey gain a passive -2 bonus to all saving throws. Thus their saving throws are 2 better than the other Warrior classes (&lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Cleric%23Cleric%20spells\"&gt;Cleric spells&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaladins are able to use cleric spells when they reach level 9. They may only use spells levels 1 to 4. The caster level for these spells is calculated as eight levels less than the current Paladin level, but maxes out at level 9 in classic versions. In the Enhanced Editions, the caster level continues to increase normally with the penalty (up to a max of 26 at level 34). Lower caster level means that many spell effects are weaker or last a shorter duration, and they can more easily be &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;dispelled&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaladins do not gain &lt;a href=\"wisdom\"&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt; based bonus spell slots.\nClass kits.\nPaladin.\nA Paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the exemplar of everything good and true. Like the Fighter, the Paladin is a person of action and combat. However, the Paladins live for the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and chivalry and strive to be a living example of these virtues so that others may learn from them as well as gain by their actions\nClass features:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Cavalier\"&gt;Cavalier&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis class represents the most common picture of the knight: the chivalrous warrior who epitomizes honor, courage, and loyalty. The cavalier is specialized in battling \"classical\" evil monsters such as demons and dragons.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Inquisitor\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Inquisitors have dedicated their life to finding and eliminating practitioners of evil magic and defeating the forces of darkness, and their god has provided them with special abilities toward that end..\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Undead%20Hunter\"&gt;Undead Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese holy avengers have honed their abilities toward the destruction of the undead and other unnatural creatures and is immune to many of the creatures' most devastating abilities\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\u00a0\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Blackguard\"&gt;Blackguard&lt;/a&gt; (\"EE\" only).\nThe Blackguard epitomizes evil and is nothing short of a mortal fiend. The quintessential black knight, this villain carries a reputation of the foulest sort that is very well deserved. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the Blackguard is hated and feared by all. Some people call these villains \"anti-paladins\" due to their completely evil nature.\nAdvantages:\n3rd - All enemies suffer a +1 penalty to THAC0 and -1 to damage rolls and a +2 penalty to Armor Class for 1 &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23R\"&gt;turn&lt;/a&gt;6th - All enemies suffer a +2 penalty to THAC0\u00a0and -2 to damage rolls and a +2 penalty to Armor Class for 1 turn15th - All enemies suffer a +4 penalty to THAC0\u00a0and -4 to damage rolls and a +4 penalty to Armor Class for 1 turn; enemies with 8 or fewer &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Dice\"&gt;Hit Dice&lt;/a&gt; are panicked as well20th - All enemies suffer a +4 penalty to THAC0 and -4 to damage rolls and a +4 penalty to Armor Class for 1 turn; enemies with 18 or fewer Hit Dice are panicked as well\nDisadvantages:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh-level class abilities are added in the expansion . For warrior group and &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s, the pool of abilities can be accessed from the special abilities menu. These abilities are available once they reach the level beyond 3,000,000 xp\n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaladins receive the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Noble%20Order%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt; as their patron and the &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Stronghold%20Duties\"&gt;duty responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; after they complete\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Garren%27s%20child%20from%20Firkraag\"&gt;Rescue Garren's child from Firkraag&lt;/a&gt; in the righteous way.\nClass exclusive items.\nPaladins have access to two of the best ranking weapons in Baldur's Gate 2 as well as a special pair of bracers. One is a two-handed sword,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Carsomyr\"&gt;Carsomyr&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0the Holy Avenger, that obliterates evil monsters and can cast dispel magics.

In order to make it in time, you must leave Athkatla immediately when you receive the quest. When you get there, a runner will take you to the site of the battle, where three knights of the Order are battling Orcs, Ogre Mages and Ettins. Kill these enemies quickly and try to keep the other Knights alive. Once done, return to Reirrac to get your &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; reward. After you turn in the first quest, Reirrac will give you your next task.\nThe XP reward is based on whether or not Shamus, Grady, and Squire Elotte survive.\nEvent 2: Deal with Squatters.\nReirrac wants you to return to Umar Hills to meet &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Metrich\"&gt;Baron Metrich&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Imnesvale%20Inn\"&gt;Imnesvale Inn&lt;/a&gt;, who has had problems dealing with squatters on his land. \nWhen you arrive, a knight of the order named Crolus will meet you and urge you to follow him. Crolus makes it known that you should not speak with the squatters in front of the Imnesvale Inn, as the Baron does not wish you to hear their lies - indeed the Baron doesn't want you to become tainted by the squatter's version of their illegal activity. (&lt;a href=\"Brunson\"&gt;Brunson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pardo\"&gt;Pardo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moreno\"&gt;Moreno&lt;/a&gt;) are outside the Inn. You can disobey Crolus's warning without any negative outcomes if you want to speak with the squatters. \nIn fact, if you talk to the \"squatters\", they will reveal that they are actually farmers, that the Baron has stolen their land from them, and that they were forced to resist with violence, else lose their land and livelihood. \nNext, meet the Baron within the tavern area. He will be accompanied by his assistant &lt;a href=\"Lanka\"&gt;Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, another assistant named &lt;a href=\"Lette\"&gt;Lette&lt;/a&gt;, and two guards (&lt;a href=\"Metrich%20Footman\"&gt;Metrich Footman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metrich%20Yeoman\"&gt;Metrich Yeoman&lt;/a&gt;). Also is a mage, named &lt;a href=\"Sorcerous%20Amin\"&gt;Sorcerous Amin&lt;/a&gt;. From there, you have two choices: \nHowever, if you talked to at least one \"squatter,\" then the \"refuse\" option is replaced with this choice:\nReturn to Sir Reirrac. Your rewards and outcome for this quest depend on what happened and how you choose to respond to him.\nIf you completed this quest to Reirrac's satisfaction, he will immediately give you your third assignment.\nEvent 3: Tyrianna\u2019s Family.\nThe Morningales were slaughtered for opposing the slave trade, with &lt;a href=\"Tyrianna\"&gt;Tyrianna&lt;/a&gt; as the sole survivor. Reirrac wants you to protect her. Head out to the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Docks&lt;/a&gt; district and enter the safe house, which is just to the right of the Temple of Oghma. Once inside you get to meet the \"pleasant\" Tyrianna, and soon you will be attacked by assassins. After the battle, a man arrives claiming to be Tyrianna's godfather &lt;a href=\"Hurgis%20Baltezan\"&gt;Hurgis Baltezan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a 50/50 chance that \"Hurgis\" is either the real deal or an impostor. You can either send Tyrianna with him or refuse, but if you make the wrong choice, you will lose your stronghold. The key is to use &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Evil\"&gt;Detect Evil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Know%20Alignment%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Know Alignment&lt;/a&gt; on him. The impostor will show as Evil; the real Hurgis will not. Kill the impostor or tell Tyrianna to go with Hurgis. Either way, once this is done, report back to Reirrac to get your reward: &lt;a href=\"Pride%20of%20the%20Legion\"&gt;Pride of the Legion&lt;/a&gt; +2 and a &lt;a href=\"Large%20Shield%20%2B2\"&gt;Large Shield +2&lt;/a&gt;. If you had the \"Fallen Paladin\" status, then your paladin abilities will be regained. He will give you one final task.\nEvent 4: The Dragon Slayer.\nYou\u2019re to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Carsomyr\"&gt;Holy Avenger&lt;/a&gt; from Firkraag.\u00a0 Head back to the dragon's lair and fight for glory!\nNote: Petrifying or disintegrating Firkraag can leave you with nothing but experience reward and gold. Beware!\nOnce you kill the dragon, return to Reirrac and report your success. He will officially entrust the Holy Avenger to you and reward you with 35,000 experience.\nCongratulations on being a proven top-notch paladin of the realm.

Such labels may be found in an affected character's \"Record\" screen, in-game combat logs, or simply spell, item or ability descriptions.\nTypically we could expect that a \"paralyzed\" affecting a party member should refer to the Paralyze effect, and \"held\" to the Hold creature effect, but don't bet your house on it.\nIf unsure, take a look at this page's infobox. It only contains sources that really do inflict the Paralyze effect.\nThe Paralyze effect can be used to e.g. create statues through its codice_1 mode. See codice_2 and codice_3 for an example, and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/opcodes/bgee.htm%23op109\"&gt;IESDP&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nThe only things using codice_1 in the unmodded game are the statues in &lt;a href=\"Trademeet\"&gt;Trademeet&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nThe upcoming release of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/eefp/\"&gt;Enhanced Edition Fix Pack (EEFP)&lt;/a&gt; has already beta coded a large overhaul pertaining to Paralyze, as follows:\nRevamp of Hold, Paralysis, and Web \nIn the original Baldur's Gate, there were four internal methods to make an NPC freeze: paralysis (used in undead melee attacks), web (used by the spell of the same name and spiders), and two forms of hold (one for Hold spells and a second, special one reserved for special cases like cutscenes).\nAs the series progressed through the BG expansion, into BG2, and concluding with Throne of Bhaal, these were used more and more freely, and muddled--you had web spells using paralysis, abilities that blocked the special hold (which nothing should) to the point where there was little distinction, if any, between these effects from a player's point of view. \nEEFP is re-establishing the scheme, going all the way back to the original Baldur's Gate, of trying to use these effects in a way that differentiates them and fixes a number of bugs along the way. Paralysis is, once again, the domain of undead attacks, and from which elves have some protection. Web is no longer paired by default with paralysis, meaning items which protect you from web no longer provide paralysis protection by accident, and the special hold will now always take effect."}

At this point there are two routes to take: offer to let him leave and go lay low somewhere for a while or kill him. \nEither way, kill everybody; plant the evidence in the fountain, loot the place if you haven't already, and split back to the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis lead to the following Journal entry if you opted to let Vulova live:\nReturn to Bodhi and report your deed.

The hideout entrance is located through a doorway that's to the right of the front door. Go through the curtained divider to the far wall at the back of the room. The secret door will reveal itself and is accessible with the key in your inventory. First hunt down &lt;a href=\"Tizzak\"&gt;Tizzak&lt;/a&gt; who is in the prison room.

He is the primary attendant to facilitate the transition of those sent to the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; asylum sent by his superiors. Or at least he was. It is not clear whether the Pirate Lord &lt;a href=\"Desharik\"&gt;Desharik&lt;/a&gt; is allowed to do this as well. \nGameplay.\nPerth is inside the Cowled Wizard residence. As soon as the party enters then dialogue will commence. If Edwin, Aerie, Yoshimo or Nalia is in the party each may have an interjection as well. \nDepending on the dialogue and replies, determines how much back and forth occurs. However, Perth's off-kilter behavior and general mannerisms are disturbing, and then highly unusual - as if he is not in control of his actions. Eventually, the encounter leads to a hostile reaction, and blood will likely be spilled.\nAt the opening of hostilities the mage will fire off a self-buff contingency containing &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, followed by either &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt; if silenced. Another instant preparation my launch soon after with a &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; copy and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; on self. After that offensive or disabling spells will be cast at applicable observed party members, with the closest being the priority target.\nPerth can instantly launch a few more triggers to protect himself during a battle, including more stoneskins and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, and another &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt; can be used to buy time if he is in trouble.\nThe spells listed in the InfoBox are all scripted for use. Power Word spells have a casting time of 1 and will be directed at the nearest enemy, so look out for Stun and Kill Power Words. As is usually the case when the party combats a single powerful spell caster, the sheer number of available party actions aimed at the mage can overwhelm it quickly. A well-timed Secret Word, Pierce magic and a Breach spell can render the mage defenseless for long enough to take him down. Perth has no means to destroy summoned creatures, and weak against AoE spells and or elemental damage. Use these for expected good results.\nOnce defeated, you can find two important items on his twitching corpse - &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Infinite%20Spells\"&gt;Book of Infinite Spells&lt;/a&gt; and the sought after Wardstone for Asylum.\nBugs.\nPerma-killing (chunking) Perth appears to lead to a bug where he \"survives\" as a flying rotating chunk of meat (known bug). In which case he becomes non-targetable (and apparently non-killable), but still fully active and continuing to cast his spells. It's advisable to save before entering the door.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises this mage with a different set of memorized spells and new default \"Smarter Mage\" AI. At the outset of the hostilities a self-buff extrapolation automatically launches containing &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;. A second later while the mage is invisible will be added &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Blue%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Blue)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20The%20Elements\"&gt;Protection From The Elements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity Divination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;. This will all take place in the first seconds of the battle.\nNow while protected Perth will conjure an &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Stalker\"&gt;Invisible Stalker&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe mage has other contingency spells ready when certain protections are removed, such as PfMW, Absolute Immunity and more stoneskins. Perth may use &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteors&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blades%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Energy Blades (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; to conduct missile fire in the same rounds as spell casts.\nWhen the mage attempts offensive spell casts, those are determined by the SCS Smarter Mage AI based on available targets and their vulnerabilities. A number of damage dealing spells are in the mage's library and mostly conjuration types like &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt;. As a conjurer, Perth can summon help in the form of a Djinni, and several types of Elementals. On the higher game difficulty setting, he will attempt to use his &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; spell, as well as his &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Planetar&lt;/a&gt;. So, beware those.\nIn addition to the previous spell casting, Perth also has prepared the following for instant release:\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed Perth's spells will be the SR versions. Examples include \"Dispelling Screen \" for Spell Immunity, \"Mesthil's Acid Sheath\" in lieu of the Fireshield, \"Mind Blank\" and \"Moment of Prescience\". \nWith the &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod installed, Perth has a loyal &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt; ally in his home for support."}

The caster wields the phantom blade as if it was a long sword but he suffers no penalty for non-proficiency. The sword deals 1d12+4 points of magic damage to its victims, and an additional 10 points of magical damage against undead creatures. Due to its ethereal nature, strength bonuses do not apply, but attacks with the phantom blade are considered melee touch attacks, and thus gain a +4 bonus to hit. Furthermore, a successful strike temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail (save vs. spell at a -4 penalty negates). The blade is considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what it can hit, but it cannot harm inorganic things because it has no solid existence.

They are fairly rare, usually only found within the depths of various forests, and are distinguishable from their brethren by way of a bright-green body and dark-green legs - pointedly different from the much more common &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nLike most spiders, they can &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; their enemies and are immune to &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt;.

Unlike most spiders which can normally be pulled by a specific party member and/or drawn into a trap, the Phase Spider will often teleport behind or within the parties formation, likely striking (and poisoning) a few weaker party members before the player is able to dispatch it. Most specimens encountered in-game are pre-generated, meaning that there likely won't be a consideration made for the strength of the player, making for a very difficult fight regarding unprepared low-level parties.\nSummoned.\nPhase spiders can be summoned by a 9th or higher level &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; casting the 4th level Wizard spell &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Spawn\"&gt;Spider Spawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a summoned phase spider's attack damage is adjusted for Strength bonus, however the spider's strength is only 14 which provides no bonus; unless it becomes the target of a &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; spell, in which case a +3 damage bonus would apply."}

The DEMPIT01.cre is encountered in &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%201\"&gt;Bodhi's Hunt Level 1&lt;/a&gt; underneath &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;. The DEMPITSU.cre is the version summoned from a &lt;a href=\"Gate\"&gt;Gate&lt;/a&gt; spell. The TELPIT1.cre is encountered on the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Teleport%20Maze\"&gt;Teleport Maze &lt;/a&gt;.\nThe DEMPIT.cre and TELPIT2.cre are unused.\nGameplay.\nPit fiends conduct offensive actions on any enemy creatures in range with innate ability and melee attacks - typically at the closest target. Their attack script is repetitive and based on timed intervals between innate ability uses. The abilities can't really be interrupted by dealing damage to the fiend as the script uses a \"Force Cast\" command.\nParty members will be exposed to &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fear\"&gt;Demon Fear&lt;/a&gt; initially, if close enough to the area of effect of the innate spell, which is directed at the nearest party member. Anyone in the area of effect will need to save vs. spell or potentially be under a two round &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; effect. This ability is used about every two rounds during combat.\nTwo varieties the fiend also will cast a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; at the party members closest to it (instantly). It will also explode an instantly launched &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28innate%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; several times during a battle. Expect an instantly applied &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Fear%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Fear&lt;/a&gt; spell as well. \nThe fiend will not recognize if a party member is protected against these magics, so it will rigidly just keep on physically attacking and launching spells, regardless of whether the party is protected. In that regard, the creature isn't adaptable or very intelligent.\nA pit fiend's general infernal immunities can vary slightly from one creature type to the next, but they all possess an &lt;a href=\"RINGDEMN.ITM\"&gt;undroppable item&lt;/a&gt; in their ring slot which provides the following protections:\nIn addition to this, a pit fiend can only be harmed by weapons of at least +3 enchantment.\nThe creature encountered inside Watcher's Keep (TELPIT1) is provided with more &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;, possesses 100 &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; and has 70% Magic resistance. It also uses a different script and employs &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person\"&gt;Hold Person&lt;/a&gt; \"forcespell\" casts which can't be interrupted and have instant launch speeds. In addition, all of its &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt;s have also been reduced, it is immune to &lt;a href=\"petrified\"&gt;petrification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;, and it is &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;hasted&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe pit fiend in the game isn't fully developed to match what the Dungeons and Dragons 2nd edition ruleset establishes for this devil. Several special abilities, including the power to cast &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; and gate in other allies isn't implemented. It's supposed to have a constricting tail, and a disease inducing bite. The game version did get a few abilities right, such as the fear aura and some spell casting ability.\nLore bug.\nThe game identifies this creature as a Demon by race, and Tanar'ri by class, but it is actually a Devil and a Baatezu in Dungeons and Dragons lore. \nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod, and the \"Improved Fiends\" component will generally change the Pit Fiends in the game as follows:\nPit Fiends (cast at 24th level):&lt;br&gt;\nSmarter AI script&lt;br&gt;\nHP: 140 - 170 HP depending on variety&lt;br&gt;\nMovement Set to 11&lt;br&gt;\nAdditional elemental resistances&lt;br&gt;\nAdditional status effect and specific spell protections (level drain, fire-based spells)&lt;br&gt;\nTeleport without Error, Remove Magic, and Improved Invisibility, at will&lt;br&gt;\nMeteor Swarm and Unholy Word, once per day each&lt;br&gt;\nUnholy Fireball and Symbol of Fear, at will&lt;br&gt;\nPermanent fear aura&lt;br&gt;\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod (also works with SCS installed) will introduce new Pit Demons from the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Gate (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; spell.&lt;br&gt;\nPit Fiend (20 Hit Dice, level 20/20/20 FMC class):\nSTR 24, DEX 16, CON 19, INT 20, WIS 16, CHA 25; AL Lawful Evil\nHP 170, AC -8, THAC0 -7, Saving Throws 4/6/4/8/6\n5 Attacks Per Round, 2d6+16 Piercing Damage (Claws, Bite, &amp; Tail +4)\nCombat Abilities (20% chance each):\nDisease: creatures struck by a pit fiend\u2019s bite attack must save vs. death at -4 or be infected with a vile disease known as devil chills, losing 2 points of strength after an incubation period of 12 hours\nPoison: a pit fiend\u2019s bite injects a lethal poison which inflicts 10 points of damage every second for 2 rounds unless a save vs. poison at -4 penalty is made\nConstrict: creatures struck by the pit fiend\u2019s tail must save vs. death at -4 to avoid being stunned for 1 round\nSpecial Qualities:\nImmune to weapons lower than +3 enchantment\nImmune to confusion, fear, poison, &amp; stun effects\nRegeneration: 2hp/round\nFire Resistance 100%; Cold Resistance 50%; Magic Resistance 65%\nSpecial Abilities:\nSee Invisibility (permanent)\nImproved Invisibility (at will)\nUnholy Fireball (once every 5 rounds)\nDispel Magic (once every 5 rounds)\nSymbol of Weakness (once every 5 rounds)\nUnholy Word (once per day)\nMeteor Swarm (once per day)"}

The traps to the east have room on either side to pass by, while those to the south can not be skirted. For the latter, upon exiting, you find yourself on the north side of each of the traps, closer and closer to a dangerous ambush set up by the Warden and his thralls. As Tagget said, it's much better to go east than north.\nBesides being a powerful cambion, the Warden is an 18th Level &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Conjurer&lt;/a&gt;, able to cast deadly spells such as &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word: Kill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20to%20Stone\"&gt;Flesh to Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;, all while using &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; to spy out your stealthy characters.\nTwo male &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20%28Mage%29\"&gt;Thrall Mages&lt;/a&gt; ( each) and a female &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20%28Cleric%29\"&gt;Thrall Cleric&lt;/a&gt; () also await you, along with &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Thrall\"&gt;Warden Thrall&lt;/a&gt;s ( ). In addition, a silent trigger will have spawned several other enemy monsters here (see \"\"&lt;a href=\"Planar%20Prison%23Silent%20Spawn%20Triggers\"&gt;Silent Spawn Triggers&lt;/a&gt;\"\" above). The two mages begin battle with Protection from &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Weapons\"&gt;Normal Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Electricity%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Electricity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Contingency\"&gt;Contingency&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, then attack with &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. A tough battle if you face them all at once, just after having stepped out of a fleshy trap.\nAfter the battle, loot the Warden for his &lt;a href=\"Planar%20Prison%20Cell%20Key\"&gt;Planar Prison Cell Key&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adjatha%20the%20Drinker\"&gt;Adjatha the Drinker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wave%20Shaft\"&gt;Wave Shaft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Star%20Sapphire\"&gt;Star Sapphire&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt; , and . Also loot his Thralls for minor magical items (&lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Long Swords +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"War%20Hammer%20%2B1\"&gt;War Hammer +1&lt;/a&gt;, etc). A treasure stash to the southwest has &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Biting\"&gt;Bolts of Biting&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Bullet%20%2B1\"&gt;Bullets +1&lt;/a&gt; , Throwing Axes , and Throwing Daggers .\nThe center of the Warden's chamber has a \"throne chair\" [that] \"looks to be more of a device of torture than anything else.\"\nThe Warden's Cell.\nBeyond the Warden's throne room to the west is the cell holding Raelis, Haer'Dalis, and the rest of the Sigil Theatre Troupe. If there is anything else you wish to do before leaving the Planar Prison, do so BEFORE entering the cell, as you will not get another chance, and you can never return here again.\nUpon entering the Warden's prison cell, a cut-scene begins with Haer'Dalis greeting the party, followed by Raelis. The two then have a discussion, the results of which are Haer'Dalis wants to leave the Troupe and explore the Prime Material plane.\nIf eligible, Raelis offers you the Deed to the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Flagons%20Theatre\"&gt;Playhouse&lt;/a&gt;, which you can accept or not.\nAfter all of this, Raelis summons another \"young conduit\" and you are transported back to the Playhouse, where Haer'Dalis will offer to join your party. Accept gladly, Deny harshly, or say, perhaps another time.\nIf you accepted the Deed to the Playhouse, another cut-scene occurs with &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Thunderburp\"&gt;Samuel Thunderburp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Higgold\"&gt;Higgold&lt;/a&gt; the Director, thus beginning the &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; Quest, &lt;a href=\"Running%20the%20Five%20Flagons%20Playhouse\"&gt;Running the Five Flagons Playhouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes revisions to all creatures found in the prison, including spawns. Of particular note are the differences from the unmodified game to the SCS gameplay if the \"Better Calls for Help\" component is installed. In the unmodified game, the party can methodically traverse the map, and encounter enemies in groups, essentially one by one. With the SCS component, once the party sets out and alerts the prison defenders, creatures from other locations on the map will often enter the fray at random times in an unexpected manner, sometimes with three or more extra defenders being present. This can be used to your advantage or may be a burden, throwing off the usual tactics planned. \nWith SCS version 34, the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Warden\"&gt;Prison Warden&lt;/a&gt; has been slightly toned down from the previous SCS version (possibly from player feedback). The warden will no longer cast and be armed with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20of%20Disaster\"&gt;Black Blade of Disaster&lt;/a&gt; or cast &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; as was reported. As the party experience level may be middling at this part of the saga, that may have been too difficult to overcome. The latest version of SCS still has the warden configured to provide a good challenge for a \"boss\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod places two additional Lesser Golems in one of the \"Fleshy Trap\" prison cells."}

This has been tested and confirmed for BG2EE.\nWithout player command, a Planetar's &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23A\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; will only cast &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Restoration\"&gt;Lesser Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neutralize%20Poison\"&gt;Neutralize Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Fear\"&gt;Remove Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Disease\"&gt;Cure Disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; (including its scripted self-Heal ability) and &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; as needed; all other spells require the player to manually cast them from the Planetar's spellbook.\nIt will cast \"Heal\" if a party member is within detection range and hit points have fallen below 25% of maximum. The other curative spells are cast if the planetar detects &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;State: Poisoned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;State: Panic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;State: Diseased&lt;/a&gt;. If a player character is detected and under a &lt;a href=\"Charmed\"&gt;State: Charmed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Confused\"&gt;State: Confused&lt;/a&gt; it will attempt its caster level 1 Dispel Magic (don't count on that being successful).\nNotes.\nPlanetars aren't encountered as enemies during normal gameplay. If, however, a player-summoned Planetar becomes hostile for some reason, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt; is one way to defend against the &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Vorpal hit effect&lt;/a&gt;. Spells that protect from +3 weapons (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;) also prevent the effect from triggering. Alternatively, increasing the defender's &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving Throw&lt;/a&gt; vs. Death (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;) to -1 or below will prevent the vorpal effect from killing the defender.\nThe physical and magical resilience of the Planetar, combined with its vorpal attacks, makes it useful for pretty much any combat encounter. As an example, if given the appropriate pre-buffs, it is entirely feasible for a Planetar to defeat high-level enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;beholders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;liches&lt;/a&gt;, or even a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dragon\"&gt;shadow dragon&lt;/a&gt; single-handedly.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20of%20Amn\"&gt;Shadows of Amn&lt;/a&gt; was initially designed without &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;high-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt; like Summon Planetar; player characters were limited to 2.95 million &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; and mages could only cast a few level 9 spells through rare scrolls. It was the that retroactively unlocked the XP cap and introduced high-level abilities to Shadows of Amn, but the campaign was arguably not updated well enough to higher level parties. It can be useful for a player interested in normal to higher difficulty levels to know that using Throne of Bhaal content in Shadows of Amn can significantly scale back difficulty. Summon Planetar is one of the stronger abilities introduced by Throne of Bhaal, especially so in Enhanced Editions with their regeneration.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes changes to the summoned creature from the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Planetar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt;.

It has no Mage spells. It is equipped with different undroppable items to change its abilities and immunities. It can &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; and can't be backstabbed. It cannot be hurt by &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt;. It now has a casting time modifier with a +10 speed bonus, and spells will cast almost instantly. It is not under a haste effect anymore, and instead has a movement modifier bonus of +4. The Greatsword only has a vorpal effect now, with no dispelling function. It has a hidden helmet that gives it a wings animation and prevents critical hits. Its adjusted Effective THAC0 is now -3. The creature gets a revised and smarter AI, and aggressively uses Divine Spells while engaged in melee, automatically. The player can still control the Planetar to command his spell casting as desired. As a Cleric, the Planetar may attempt to Turn Undead using its appropriate button control. \nThe Planetar gets a different animation than the unmodded game, looking more like a humanoid angel with golden wings, and not the same as a Solar. \nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod with the \"Smarter Mages\" component will mean that the player may now face a Planetar several times in the game, depending on the difficulty setting. Good or Neutral Mages eligible to have HLA's will summon Planetars to fight against your party, and a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt; will be summoned by evil Mages, Liches and Alhoons - where in the unmodded game you may never face one, even in ToB."}

After completing the first challenge, Gorion's Ward and party may come and go from the Pocket Plane at will (as long as they're not in battle), making it very convenient for healing up and changing/rememorizing spells.\u00a0For example, one might start\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Enclave\"&gt;Sendai's Enclave&lt;/a&gt; with a set of general spells for dealing with large groups of enemies and then warp to the plane and refresh their spells before fighting &lt;a href=\"Sendai\"&gt;Sendai&lt;/a&gt; herself.\nA Gorion's Ward with a good alignment who has completed the second trial will find that the trial-room has become a healing pit, allowing for passive health regeneration of any party member standing inside of it.\nBhaalspawn Challenges.\nThe Pocket Plane is the source of five challenges throughout the events of \"Throne of Bhaal\". These must be completed to progress through the game. Each challenge is triggered by defeating a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Five\"&gt;The Five&lt;/a&gt;.\nChallenge #1: Retribution.\nThis challenge is triggered after defeating &lt;a href=\"Illasera\"&gt;Illasera&lt;/a&gt;. The player must speak with the shade of a Bhaalspawn human peasant turned murderer, Gavid, and then face multiple waves of enemies dependent upon their alignment.\nCompleting this challenge grants Gorion's Ward 30.000 Quest EXP and each member of the party 25.000 Quest EXP, as well as giving Gorion's Ward the Pocket Plane ability.\nChallenge #2: Possibilities.\nThis challenge is triggered after defeating &lt;a href=\"Yaga-Shura\"&gt;Yaga-Shura&lt;/a&gt;. The player must confront an alternative version of Gorion's Ward, one who was not saved by Gorion, who leads a party comprised of Tamoko, Semaj and Angelo. \nThe chamber hosting the challenge will start either as a rocky place with pools of lava that burn anyone stepping into them, or as an oasis with pools of healing water. The lava chamber will greet Gorion's Ward if they answered in a Good-aligned way to the Solar prior to the challenge. It will be the oasis chamber otherwise.\nAfter the challenge is completed, the place is remodeled into its \"other\" state, Gorion's Ward receives 30,000 XP, and other party members are awarded 25,000 XP each. \nIf the player has either the &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29%20\"&gt;Unfinished Business (Baldur's Gate II) &lt;/a&gt; mods installed, they will acquire a new Bhaalspawn power, depending on whether they made the \"Good\" or \"Evil\" responses to the Solar before undertaking the challenge.\nChallenge #3: Doubts.\nThis challenge is triggered after defeating &lt;a href=\"Sendai\"&gt;Sendai&lt;/a&gt;. The player must fight their incarnated doubt/lingering innocence (depending on alignment), which takes the form of the Slayer and attacks them. It focuses exclusively on attacking Gorion's Ward and has the ability to &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;drain levels&lt;/a&gt; with its attacks.\nIf the player has either the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Unfinished Business (Baldur's Gate II)\u00a0mods&lt;/a&gt; installed, they will acquire a new Bhaalspawn power, depending on whether they made the \"Good\" or \"Evil\" responses to the Solar before undertaking the challenge.\nChallenge #4: Cyric, God of Murder..\nThis challenge is triggered after defeating &lt;a href=\"Abazigal\"&gt;Abazigal&lt;/a&gt;. The player must defeat three &lt;a href=\"Favored%20of%20Cyric\"&gt;Favored of Cyric&lt;/a&gt;, which are high-levelled Assassins.\nIf the player has either the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt; installed, they will acquire a new Bhaalspawn power, depending on whether they made the \"Good\" or \"Evil\" responses to the Solar before undertaking the challenge:\nChallenge #5: The Ravager.\nThis challenge is triggered after defeating &lt;a href=\"Balthazar\"&gt;Balthazar&lt;/a&gt;. The party must defeat &lt;a href=\"The%20Ravager\"&gt;The Ravager&lt;/a&gt;, the ultimate incarnation of Bhaal's bloody power.\nIf the player has either the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Unfinished Business (Baldur's Gate II)\u00a0mods&lt;/a&gt; installed, they will acquire a new Bhaalspawn power, depending on whether they made the \"Good\" or \"Evil\" responses to the Solar before undertaking the challenge:"}

Firkraag the squirrel now only has 5 current HP, and a Strength and Dexterity of 3.\nHis base &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; is now -5, and his Armor class is 13 (!).\nHe also has no &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance.\nFirkraag can still innately apply &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; to himself, launch a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, and breath a 20d6 &lt;a href=\"Red%20Dragon%20Breath\"&gt;Red Dragon Breath&lt;/a&gt; attack. If these spells were applied as a conventional Wizard spell, they would fail, due to the miscast magic effect that is upon him.

The target\u2019s mental attributes are not affected, and they do not receive the special abilities of the new form, but physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form and the affected creature loses any special abilities it had in its original form. This particular version of the spell will transform the recipient into a squirrel unless a save vs. polymorph is made successfully. The effectiveness of this spell is dependent upon the target\u2019s level, with weak creatures being relatively easy to transmute and more powerful creatures being very difficult. Creatures with less than 8 HD/levels save at a -3 penalty, those with 8 - 14 HD/levels save normally, and those with 15 or more HD/levels save with a +3 bonus. The transformation is instant and permanent until a dispel magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature.\nNote that all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form. However, they will return to their previous state once the target dies, or the effects are dispelled."}

The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others.

A vertical rectangular arched door/portal is positioned on a vertical stone cavern wall face. The portal is edged with carved blocks of stone with striping of some kind etched upon them. \nOn the cavern floor in front of the portal is a circular bed of flagstone on which a thematic triangular rune is visible.\nInstead of a door or gate, peering into the portal is seen a cascading and shimmering shifting energy of some kind, with shadow-like forms discerned beyond in a twisted landscape.\nGameplay.\nThe exploring party will come upon these three portals as they navigate the cavern. Each portal is placed in its own secluded alcove or off-tunnel. The portals have no Auto-map markers nor onscreen labels.\nWhen a party member initially gets within normal visual distance of a portal, a hostile elemental creature will be seen in front of it.\nThe elemental will most likely will also be able to detect a party member who isn't hidden/invisible.

Each portal can produce up to eleven elementals, one at a time.\nAfter the eleventh creature is destroyed, then no further creatures will be produced by the portal.

For custom protagonist portraits only the smaller two are required, which both go into the 'portraits' folder in the game's directory\u00a0(i.e.\u00a0\"C:\\Program Files\\Baldur's Gate\\Portraits\"). The file name can't be longer than seven characters + the ending S, M or L.\u00a0\nTo replace a companion's portrait all three files are required with the exact same file names as used in the game. These files go into the 'override' folder in the game's directory (i.e.\u00a0\"C:\\Program Files\\Baldur's Gate\\Override\"). A list of all companion portraits plus file names can be found &lt;a href=\"Portrait%20File%20Names\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnhanced Editions.\nFor player character portraits only one file is now required, the file ending is not important (S, M &amp; L are all fine). Any size of up to 1024px works in theory, but to assure that the image doesn't become blurry it should be a minimum of\u00a0169x266px and the side ratios need to be the same as the ones mentioned above, otherwise the portrait will be distorted.

This means that a movement boosting item, like &lt;a href=\"The%20Paws%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;The Paws of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; won't provide any bonus movement while the potion is active.\nA character who has this potion active cannot be buffed with a &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt;, or an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt; either. The potion blocks those from working.\nHowever, if the &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt; boosting spells/effects are already present and active on the character before drinking the potion of freedom, then they'll still work normally, but no new applications can be made once the potion is imbibed.\nThe potion's immunities can be removed with a &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect, but unlike the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Free Action (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; won't touch the potion's powers.\nTrivia.\nNo equivalent potion is provided in the Advanced D&amp;D 2nd Edition ruleset.

Therefore, the warrior's new Base THAC0 has improved from 14 to 12.\nAlso, after consuming the potion the warriors base Hit Points are multiplied by 110%. The game engine will round small remainders to the nearest whole number.\nThese effects apply for ten turns, or two in-game hours. \nRegarding &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt;, this potion is akin to a 6th level caster in BG1 and 10 in BG2. \nThe HP bonus (but not the THAC0 bonus) stacks with itself if the potion is used repeatedly, and also stacks with the HP bonus from the &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Power\"&gt;Potion of Power&lt;/a&gt;, but only the last THAC0 bonus from both potions is applied and it does not stack (so if using both, Potion of Power should be used last since it has higher THAC0 bonus).\nLocations.\nUnused references.\nThe Potion of Heroism is referenced more often in the files of the whole than it's actually obtainable."}

This innate ability is initiated via internal creature scripting during combat. The purpose of the spell is to apply &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; to a single target, although the blast has an area of effect and could expose others in the blast radius.\nEffects.\nThe ability is uninterruptible and takes almost no time to deploy. The scripted targeting will fire at a single target which is typically within the creature's sight detection range. A projectile fires, and then a hit animation plays over the target. The breath weapon has an area of effect as well. Any creatures within it are subject to the breath effects.\nWhen a dragon deploys a Shadow Dragon Breath blast, a lighting effect is applied to the targeted creature (the aqua SHEARTH BAM, similar to what happens if struck by a vampire) as well as a sound effect. The innate ability will apply two simultaneous level drain effects. The first drains 4-levels of experience. The second drains 2-levels. Only the second attack has a saving throw vs. breath to negate. The breath weapon also blinds the target for 1 round (no save). A text display on the combat screen will indicate a text string message \"blinded\". Another one will display \"Four levels drained\". If the saving throw vs. breath is missed, another text will display \"Two levels drained\". \nAs the dragon breath attack is schoolless and all the internal effects have &lt;a href=\"power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt; 0, they cannot be blocked by spell protections such as &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;.
