Compared to the Wizard's spell version, the wand's scorcher jet is much longer in length (2X40 feet), almost three times lengthier.\nNote: The spell description states that the area of effect is 1 creature, but in fact the jet of flame inflicts damage to anyone, friend or foe, standing in the path of the flame jet between the caster and the target. The one-creature term is technically correct for target selection purposes.

The Wand of Fire that Erdane sells comes with 20 charges of Fireball and 1 charge of Agannazar's Scorcher. When that 1 charge of Agannazar's Scorcher is used, the wand is destroyed, no matter how many charges of Fireball remain.\nThe wands description \"..column of flame..\" is awkward usage, as a column is generally defined in most cases with a vertical perspective, and this wand's scorcher is using a lateral orientation."}

This wand's Breach effect was miscoded, and Spell Shield does not work against it.\nBreach in the basic game cannot affect creatures immune to level 5 spells, like a Lich or Rakshasa.

When the fallen elven archmage broke out of his cell, he massacred the Cowled Wizards present at the asylum, intending to take it over for his own purposes. Wanev was one of only two survivors, the other being the caretaker &lt;a href=\"Lonk\"&gt;Lonk&lt;/a&gt;. However, during the struggle, Wanev's mind was damaged by hostile spell craft, leaving him a raving imbecile. Perhaps amused by this, Irenicus let Wanev live amongst the inmates he had once warded over.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; arrived, Wanev eagerly fell in behind the hero, his shattered mind fixating on the notion of avenging what Irenicus had done to him. Unfortunately, Irenicus proved too powerful and Wanev died with his former inmates at his side.\nGameplay.\nThe player can interact with Wanev when they first arrive at the Main Floor of Spellhold.

Note that the script allows some spell use that are not even memorized. This is a common practice in the game's script writing.\nWanev will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, and several other higher level attack spells against Irenicus or other hostile creatures.

The state of your progress in the keep, if any, is carried over from to .\nLore.\nWatcher's Keep is an ancient fortress and temple, built to be a magical prison for holding creatures of great evil and power. For ages, the keep has been tended and guarded by followers of the God &lt;a href=\"Helm\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;. A group of \"Helmites\" known as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Vigil\"&gt;Knights of the Vigil&lt;/a&gt; were commanded by Helm to ensure that the \"Imprisoned One\", must never escape the keep, and many knights sacrificed themselves to strengthen the wards of the old fortress. Eventually, the current Knights Vigil have detected breaks, fissures and weaknesses in the keep's wards. They believe a great evil is slowly gaining strength within and may defeat the wards of old. Doubts of confidence and questioning their duty have crept into their faith. Unsure of what to do, they have now engaged in sending messages throughout the lands seeking outside help to bolster their convictions and assistance with refreshing the wards within, before it is too late.\nNotice to the player.\nThis area can be travelled to during the Shadows of Amn campaign if playing the Enhanced Edition. This can occur as early as &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%202\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe game script will add dialogue from &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Garlena\"&gt;Sister Garlena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Odren\"&gt;Odren&lt;/a&gt; if the main character's experience level is less than 10. This will be made apparent when speaking with &lt;a href=\"Odren\"&gt;Odren&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt basically warns the player to consider coming back another time when the PC has more experience. The player can ignore this via dialogue and barrel ahead anyway. You were warned!\nThe dungeon was designed for a player who had completed SoA, and visiting and attempting the dungeon before that will be a high challenge, because of lack of party experience levels and abilities. A new player should probably avoid tackling this dungeon until at least level 14. This experience level is also what the game's internal \"difficulty\" settings are based on, and entering the dungeon by an under leveled party can permanently affect the distribution and challenge of spawned and placed enemies. \nIt could also lead to frustrations for a new player.\nIn other words, if you enter the dungeon early, the game script will see the party's level and experience, and permanently adjust the dungeon level's difficulty to match the player's party as it exists on that first visit. This means it could make the dungeon too easy if the party returns again later in the saga when they are actually capable of tackling it from start to finish. This dynamic could spoil the challenge design for the player.\nAs tempting as it may be to visit Watcher's Keep in Chapter 2 of SoA (usually to get some gear like an &lt;a href=\"Ammo%20Belt\"&gt;Ammo Belt&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Quiver%20of%20Plenty\"&gt;Quiver of Plenty&lt;/a&gt;), the early entry could forever change the dungeon to an \"easier\" dungeon level (thus reducing challenge, and the loss of tens of thousands of potential experience points).\nOne more reason to possibly avoid Watcher's Keep until the Throne of Bhaal (Chapter 8) is that there is specific dialogue (including inter party banter) that will not trigger if the party is still in Chapter's 2 through 7. These dialogues will not present themselves, and the player will miss out.\nArea description.\nWatcher's Keep is located in a solitary place, well off the beaten path. It is many hours travel by foot from any settlements or villages on the World Map. The location artwork shows that it is accessible by ship or boat, as it is also on the coastline.\nThis map area is a lightly forested clearing on the edge of the sea. A Rocky formation has been tunneled into and atop the natural stone is built a single vertical structure with a flat roof.\nOn the western side of the keep are several stone staircases that allow access to magically sealed doors, that corresponds to the elevation of the keep's internal floors. \nA covered grand staircase is connected to the roof of the Keep and several ornamental statues. Mounted above the entry to the main staircase is a glowing beacon of sorts, a Symbol of Helm.\nThe Keep rooftop is where a wondrous magical and technological invention is placed, a hemispherical metallic dome-doorway leading below the first floor of Watcher's Keep, the Altar level.\nMarking the grand staircase is a sort of obelisk and attached statuettes. Examination of this feature displays:\nAt the water's edge on the map is a solitary wooden dock. No watercraft are visible here.\nThis map is considered an outdoor area and is subject to the effects of weather or daylight and nighttime. Resting/camping can occur here, with no disturbances from attacking creatures. Helm sees all.\nOn the map.\nAs the Keep's levels are explored and the portals are opened, the game will add more Automap markers to the Player's World Map:\nGameplay and walkthrough (abbreviated).\nWhen first visiting this area, the party may wander and explore unmolested. \nA carved stone obelisk will be observed, and nearby can be seen six neutral humans, garbed in the colors and surcoats of Helm. \nThey do not hail the party, but simply observe your approach with stoic calm.\nIf desired, the party may initiate dialogue with them. \nSpeak with Odren.\nIf the party wants to figure out what's going on with this area, then speaking with &lt;a href=\"Odren\"&gt;Odren&lt;/a&gt;, the current leader of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Vigil\"&gt;Knights of the Vigil&lt;/a&gt; sect is necessary. \nThrough dialogue and questions and answers the player will be able to accept the call for help the Knight's seek, or refuse it, or even delay making a commitment and possibly returning later.\nIf the party attacks the Knights before accepting the quest, then that action will shutter the entire adventure, because the first level of Watcher's Keep is opened by Odren and only if the party accepts the quest. So, attacking the knights at this juncture closes the Watcher's Keep adventure permanently.\nIf the main character's experience level is less than 10, then Odren will advise the bhaalspawn not to undertake this quest at this time. If the player heeds this advice, the player's Journal will update:\nAccept the quest to continue the adventure.\nThrough dialogue with Odren and hearing various interjections from other Knights - the player can either decline the quest for now or accept it. \nIf declined, then the Knights remain and can be spoken to at a later time, but there is no way for the party to enter Watcher's Keep until they agree to help the Knights. Declining the quest results in the following Journal Entry:\nOn the keep's rooftop.\nAssuming the player agrees to provide assistance, more dialogue continues, and the Knights are pleased. The party is moved via a cutscene to the roof of the keep, along with the Knights.\nOn the keep's rooftop, Odren continues his dialogue and explanation of what is required. This results in the following Journal Entry:\nVia another cutscene, Odren opens the metallic dome that bars entry to a passageway leading to the first level of Watcher's Keep.\nMore dialogue continues. Odren makes it clear that the party may access &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Garlena\"&gt;Sister Garlena&lt;/a&gt; who has a store of goods available for the party. \nThe party is also instructed to get background information from &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Pol\"&gt;Brother Pol&lt;/a&gt; and some necessary items before entry into the keep can be made. At this time another Journal entry update is registered:\nSpeak with Brother Pol.\nGet a briefing and ask questions as desired with the Elder, Brother Pol.\nHe'll be able to provide some insight into the keep's layout and defenses.\nGorion's Ward will also be provided the &lt;a href=\"Vigil%20Stone\"&gt;Vigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Scroll\"&gt;Ritual Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, both key items needed to enter the keep and carry out the task ahead.\nWith these items in hand, there is only the decision of when to enter the keep and begin the quest.\nEnter the keep.\nWhen ready to do so, gather your party and enter the keep. This next phase of the adventure is covered on the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Altar%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Altar Level&lt;/a&gt; article page.\nQuick main point guide to Watcher's Keep.\nThere are six levels in Watcher's Keep:\nEach of the first five levels contain a portal to the next level below, but the requirements to activate each portal varies by floor.\nOn the Altar Level, you must perform a small ritual using the altar in the main hall, requiring you gather both the bell and the candle, and have made a note about which page of the holy book you need to read. Placing the bell and candle on the altar alongside the holy book, you must perform the ritual correctly, which will activate the portal doorway to the next level. See the &lt;a href=\"Open%20the%20portal%20to%20the%20temple%27s%20lower%20levels\"&gt;Open the portal to the temple's lower levels&lt;/a&gt; page for the procedures.\nOn the Elemental Level, you need to collect the Air, Slime, Fire and Ice scepters and use them to unlock the cage containing the Chromatic Demon. You must then defeat the Demon and collect the key from his body to access the portal to the next level.\nOn the Teleport Maze Level, you will first need to collect the Scepter of Radiance and navigate your way through the maze of rooms, collecting the three scepter gems along the way to the exit. Once you have the three scepter gems, the Scepter of Radiance will automatically assemble in your bag, with which you can go through the exit portal to the next level.\nIn the level containing the Machine of Lum the Mad, you'll need to collect the blue, purple and red oil, as well as the flint and tinder in order to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Mallet\"&gt;Crystal Mallet&lt;/a&gt;. Using the mallet, you can then break the glass of the machine, which will free the trapped mage Carston and grant you access to the machine's controls, allowing you to perform the necessary actions to activate the portal to the next level. Carston's journal contains the correct sequence.\nOn the Final Seal level, you will need to collect the Mind, Spirit and Heart key from the three challenges on the level and then defeat all the guardians of the Final Seal in the center of the floor. When all three keys have been inserted into their respective slots and turned, the final portal to the Imprisoned One will materialize.\nOnce down in the sixth level, the Imprisoned One will \"mind-talk\" and impart thoughts and impressions that make known the notion that the Knights of the Vigil are lying and being deceitful. Whether you believe the demon or not or read the ritual scroll or not is up to the player.\nDuring or after finishing the questline, the interior and exterior of Watcher's Keep will remain mostly static. As the keep's levels are explored, the exterior will add \"Automap markers\" indicating opened exterior doors to enter the desired level (so the party can more easily leave the keep and reenter without having to navigate all the previous levels).\nAny loot you leave or place within can be safely retrieved later, even between games. The keep can be accessed in both SoA and ToB, making it a convenient transfer depository and a possible storehouse for the rest of the game series (as long as you have the &lt;a href=\"Vigil%20Stone\"&gt;Vigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; in your backpack).\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod can install two components that affects Watcher's Keep; excerpts below from the mod's \"Readme\" file:\nMake Watchers' Keep accessible between SoA and ToB (BG2, BG2EE, BGT, EET)\nIn roleplaying terms, the natural time to explore Watchers' Keep is between the end of Shadows of Amn and the start of Throne of Bhaal. Before chapter 4 you're probably too weak; in chapters 6 and 7 of SoA you're in a desperate race against time; in ToB, the way the start works makes it difficult not to take random time off from urgent business to explore Watchers' Keep. Also, the NPC dialog in Watcher's Keep is ToB-only and won't play if you do it before you start ToB.\nThis component moves the start location of Throne of Bhaal to Watchers' Keep, so that you're moved there immediately after the end of SoA. You can then explore WK to your heart's content. When you want to start ToB, just leave WK via the world map. You can still return to WK after leaving.\nBe warned: you don't have any stable base, or any way to change your party, as long as you're starting at WK. If you find you need either, you'll need to do the first part of ToB. Similarly, although you could start a new game of ToB using this component, this is only a good idea if you're masochistic enough to want to solo Watchers' Keep with a starting-level ToB character!\nRandomize the maze in Watcher's Keep (BG2, BG2EE, BGT EET)\nThis component is for the benefit of people who've now basically got the Watcher's Keep teleport maze memorized. It randomly rearranges the maze to one of three different alternative configurations. Don't install or reinstall this component while you're exploring the maze (before you enter it, or after you've left it, will be fine).\nInstallation of the EE compatible &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/Pocket-Plane-Group/Under-Respresented_Items/releases\"&gt;Under-Represented Items&lt;/a&gt; mod places a merchant near the Obelisk in the Watcher's Keep area map. Speak with \"Conlan\" to access his store of unique mundane and magical items. Some are clearly Overpowered but might be just the ticket to victory a player is looking for. See Screenshot in the Mod gallery section.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; mod makes many revisions and changes to the Throne of Bhaal content, as envisioned by one of Bioware's main developers (but didn't make it into the game). As such it has more content, more dialogue, some additional encounter changes, and increased challenge difficulty. It also works very well with &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt;, by design, in the Enhanced Edition.\nFor Watcher's Keep, there will be some changes made by the Ascension mod, particularly with The Imprisoned One.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tactics%20for%20BG2EE\"&gt;Tactics for BG2EE&lt;/a&gt; mod installation will set up the option to speak with a \"Pontifex\" character located on the Watcher's Keep area map. Dialogue can lead to accepting a quest to embark on a quest known as \"The Ritual\" - a classic tactical adventure from Westley Weimer's original Tactics Mod. Updated to work with the BG2EE game engine. See Screenshots on the wiki's mod gateway page. This mod is designed for veteran player's, looking for a challenge and is not for the faint of heart. Not advised for a beginner, or those on a \"No reload run\". "}

As is customary when delving into dungeons, assume traps may be present and search for and disarm any that are discovered.\nThere are two portals in this room. The northern one allows travel back to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Teleport%20Maze\"&gt;this room&lt;/a&gt;, and the southern one leads to the exterior of &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are gesturing and the energy field of conjuration magic is visible around them. \nAfter a few seconds, a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Fire%20Elemental%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%29\"&gt;Greater Fire Elemental&lt;/a&gt; is summoned by the red demon, and an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Salamander\"&gt;Ice Salamander&lt;/a&gt; from the blue one. The Elementals will move to attack the closest party member they can detect.\nA short time later the area around the demons fills with infernal smoke and brimstone.

Basically, four portal gates with ascending staircases lead to a central square platform.\nResting on this dungeon level.\nThere is a random probability of being disturbed by infernal fiends if resting here. \"You are awakened from your rest\" will be shown on the combat log, and the enemies can include a &lt;a href=\"Maurezhi\"&gt;Maurezhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cornugon\"&gt;Cornugon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep/ToB%29\"&gt;Glabrezu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Fiend\"&gt;Bone Fiend&lt;/a&gt; group.\nGameplay.\nThe party enters through the portal gate into the northern staircase in this room. The stairs ascend to a floor above.\nAn all-female group of demonic creatures, including a &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubus&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"Alu-Fiend\"&gt;Alu-Fiend&lt;/a&gt; Tanar'ri are seen ahead. The succubus will detect the party immediately and address them without much pause. She is intently eyeing all with a wry smile. Her cohorts are also fixated upon the adventurers with lustful gazes.\nShe'll sense if the party has struck a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Tahazzar\"&gt;Tahazzar&lt;/a&gt; and has &lt;a href=\"The%20Blood%20War\"&gt;The Blood War&lt;/a&gt; questline. This alters potential dialogue slightly.\nThe succubus speaks to her fiend allies, and then the party, asking if they wish to have assistance with this maze to find the cavern with the portal leading out of this place.\nThe party must select a reply to this, which can be \"\"No thanks, I'm not interested in your help\", or the more direct \"Forget it, demon-spawn! Time to die instead!\"\"\nIf the ward cut a deal with Tahazzar and says \"..\"I'm not interested\"\", then the fiends will teleport out of the area with a mocking parting comment. On the other hand, if no prior deal with Tahazzar has been made, then the fiends will become hostile with a comment about making some sport of the party.\nOr the ward can agree to let the she demon have a kiss and embrace, taking some life energy in the process. If so, a cut scene plays out, and the ward is affected by a &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;succubus kiss&lt;/a&gt; and she makes good on her promise by transporting the party somewhere in the maze, adjacent to the maze exit portal. She'll have some final remarks and then transport herself away.\nIf the party should ever get to the point that turns the fiends hostile, a fight occurs in this room.\nThis group of demons aren't particularly heavy hitters in melee combat, but their power lies in potent charm enchantments that can place a party member under their control temporarily. Although standard defenses against charm will work, be advised that relying on saving throws is less effective due to large penalties. \nFor further details of the creature's abilities and spells, see the article page for each creature type.\nThe succubus will attempt to &lt;a href=\"Dimension%20Door\"&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/a&gt; from this battle when she is severely wounded, and her allied alu-sisters will follow this cue and try to do the same. If they get away, then you'll not see these creatures again in the adventure; gone for good (along with any of their carried treasure and experience points)."}

It can only be accessed if &lt;a href=\"Odren\"&gt;Odren&lt;/a&gt; has opened the metallic dome on the roof of the keep. Odren only does this if the party has agreed to assist the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Vigil\"&gt;Knights of the Vigil&lt;/a&gt; with their plea for help to strengthen the seals and wards inside the keep using the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Scroll\"&gt;Ritual Scroll&lt;/a&gt;.\nArea description.\nThis area has 12 rooms. The largest is the great hall which traverses the center of the area. The floor is divided by many doors, of which only one is locked and requires a special key to open.\nThe great hall has arched supports and leads to a massive statue and altar at the far end. Along the way are a variable number of realistic lifelike statues. The number varies based on the player's bhaalspawn experience when visiting the keep for the first time. It can be as low as 6 and up to 12 statues. If the party enters WK in the early stages of and if the experience level is about 500K, then then some statues are erased from the game at that point. See the screenshots in the Gallery section below for comparison of an under leveled party to one that meets the Dungeon's experience level criteria. \nElsewhere on this level are two large library chambers, a few living quarters rooms, a Crypt, and a kitchen. This level was a temple of sorts at one time, with amenities for the attending priests of &lt;a href=\"Helm\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt; and the archivist staff.\nPrimary goal for this level.\nThe goal is to explore this dungeon, gather any useful objects and information, and find a way to continue below to the other levels - so that the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Scroll\"&gt;Ritual Scroll&lt;/a&gt; can be employed to reinforce the keep's seals.\nAt a certain point in the exploration, the player's Journal will register a new quest entitled &lt;a href=\"Open%20the%20portal%20to%20the%20temple%27s%20lower%20levels\"&gt;Open the portal to the temple's lower levels&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, this quest is the player's primary goal for the Altar level.\nResting on this dungeon level.\nIf the player wishes to rest the party, consider just walking back outside the level to the rooftop of the Keep and resting there. In that location the party will not be disturbed or interrupted while having a snooze.\nIf the party rests on this dungeon level, there is a chance of generating a hostile rest encounter. In general, the rests are more likely to be disturbed if selecting the main hall as the resting spot. Taking a respite inside a side room, especially with the door closed, will be safer. The daytime is generally safer than the nighttime as far as the probability for a sleep encounter.\nIf a random rest encounter occurs, it will generate 1 to 4 Mist creatures, such as a &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Mist\"&gt;Vampiric Mist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mist%20Horror\"&gt;Mist Horror&lt;/a&gt;, or similar mixtures.\nGameplay and walkthrough (abbreviated).\nEntrance chamber.\nUpon entry to the keep's altar level, a square room decorated by symbolic statues of Vigil Knights is seen. Ahead is a grand set of double doors which are currently closed. If a party member approaches these doors a text is displayed on the player's game screen:\nAnother doorway to the west is closed as well. \nFor now, the party will leave the double doors alone, and try the western door.\nThe Archivist.\nFrom the Entrance chamber, open the door and move west into the next room.\nSome cabinets are seen, as well as a great trunk or sea chest on the floor.\nA few moments after entering, a swirling disturbance of the atmosphere is observed and a ghostly figure coalesces within the room. The figure looks insubstantial. A hollow whisper is heard saying - \"Cold, so very cold...\"\"\nTrying to initiate dialogue with the figure, identified on screen as &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Giltham\"&gt;Archivist&lt;/a&gt;, results in a repeat of the same phrase and no more. The ghost seems to be wandering very slowly without any notice toward the party at all.\nThe containers in the room can be examined. As is good practice, expect some being locked, and always survey for traps. Take any desired items found within. The Archivist cares not.\nThere is another closed door to the west.\nThe Stone Golem.\nThrough the next door to a room that is the keep's southeast corner.\nNo time is allowed before a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt; guardian attacks.\nThe construct can be avoided by closing the door until ready to go back inside. Or a party member could be made invisible or hidden.\nProbably best to just rid yourself of this nuisance and destroy it. The room has no found items or containers. There is a closed door leading north bound.\nThe Library (West).\nThrough a closed door is a dusty library ahead, it's quite large.\nThis room is a random enemy spawn zone, with Undead shadow creatures present at lower-level experience, and mixed troll group at levels closer to the level's challenge design criteria.\nAs soon as any of the creatures detect a party member, the creatures will move forward to attack. \nWatch out for &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fiend\"&gt;Shadow Fiend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wraith\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; creature group. \nTake care to watch for level drain, and ability score drain if you face the undead.\nWith a higher XP party, there may be &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Troll\"&gt;Spirit Troll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Troll\"&gt;Spectral Troll&lt;/a&gt;, and ordinary &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; giant humanoids group.\nDispatch the enemies so the library can be searched unmolested. \nThere are three shelf units with items that can be taken, as well as a chest. Take whatever you desire. \nOf note is a book, titled . A read through of the tome discusses several creature types that are introduced into the game for the Throne of Bhaal.\nThe only way forward is through a closed door on the north wall.\nThe Museum study room.\nInto the next chamber is a smaller room, with some furniture, shelving and writing credenza, and a chest.\nCentrally located is a rectangular box with framed supports encased with filthy and dust coated translucent material, not glass, but some other kind of substance. The faint outline of a statue or taxidermy figure is within.\nCloser examination displays a text:\nOn the north wall is a mounted plaque that catches your attention. It's fastened between two shelving units: \nSearching the area for traps and preparation to force or pick any locks is always a good practice. As seen in previous rooms, the keep has already shown that locks and traps have been utilized earlier, so expect more of the same. They could be anywhere.\nTake any items found of use as you wish. Attention to a tome entitled &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Imprisoned%20One\"&gt;History of the Imprisoned One&lt;/a&gt;. What insight does it offer? Are there any drawings or critical information? Have a look and decide for yourself.\nThere is a closed door leading eastward, which connects to the main hall.\nThe Main Hall.\nThis central hall transects the keep's first level in a south to north axis. Doors to the east and west side are seen on the opposite walls.\nWhen first entering the hall, especially from the southern end where the double doors are located from the Entrance room, the party will have an encounter.\nDepending on the party's average experience level, the randomly determined spawn zone trigger will generate some hostile creatures.\nThese might be various &lt;a href=\"Mephit\"&gt;Mephit&lt;/a&gt; creatures. \nAt higher experience levels the spawns will probably be a mixed group of Mist creatures.\nThe middle portion of this grand hall holds a curious device. Examination of the object displays a description:\nAlong about half the length of the hall are a number of realistically depicted statues of various humanoid figures of different races and appearance. \nAt the northern end of the hall is seen an altar, and behind that a colossal dais and statue combination. Examining the structure displays a text reading:\nNothing can be resolved in this hall without further exploration of this dungeon level. The party still requires some more information and items in order to open the portal.\nThe Kitchen and Fireplace.\nIn the northwest corner of the area is a closed door. The party will need to pass through and explore what's beyond.\nUpon entry to what appears to be a large kitchen and dining chamber, the party will trigger a random spawn encounter.\nThere might be various slime creatures, and perhaps an &lt;a href=\"Ooze%20Mephit\"&gt;Ooze Mephit&lt;/a&gt;. At higher level party experience the slimes might be of the &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20Jelly\"&gt;Mustard Jelly&lt;/a&gt; variety.\nAfter clearing this room of the dangerous creatures, the explorers will note a few cabinets and a chest that can be searched. Take any items of use.\nThere is a disused large Fireplace along one wall - probably used for cooking and grilling purposes at one time. A text display reads:\nIf the party has already found the &lt;a href=\"Tinderbox\"&gt;Tinderbox&lt;/a&gt;, the item can automatically trigger an action if it is possessed by the party, by \"clicking\" on the Fireplace. A text will display on the screen, and the hearth will roar alive with fire:\nThe fireplace is filled with flames once more, and each party member is awarded .\nSoon after a swirl of animation magic plays, and the form of &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Giltham\"&gt;Archivist Giltham&lt;/a&gt; appears nearby.\nSpeaking with the spirit must be initiated by the player. The spirit will remark \"\"Ahh... few things in life are as fine as the simple pleasure of a warm fire.\" The dialogue can continue, and the player is urged to ask questions and not just shut down the exchange immediately, as that will ensure a few clues are gained as to what to do next in order to move towards the goal of figuring out how to open up that portal in the main hall. When the player has gotten all the information it can from the Archivist, then a quest update will register in the Journal: \n\"The ghost of the temple's archivist suggested I seek out the forgetful old priest\u2014though I doubt he's even still alive\".\nIf the player asked about \"how the ritual works\"\", an additional Journal entry registers:\n\"It seems the way to get down to the next level is by performing some type of ritual. Since this is a temple, I imagine the altar would have something to do with this\".\nThe party probably still doesn't have everything needed to attempt using the altar and also needs to find that old priest. \nIt's time to cross over to the other side of the main hall and explore the eastern side of this level.\nThe Library (East).\nThere are three closed doors on the eastern side of the main hall. One of these won't open without a special key.\nThe other two can be opened as desired. For documentation purposes, the party decides to go through the door to the Library (East).\nOnce opened, it's not long before a group of spawned hostile enemies rush forward and attack any detected party members.\nDepending on the party's average experience level, there will be a variable mixed group of attackers - possibly composed of &lt;a href=\"Ettercap\"&gt;Ettercap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phase%20Spider\"&gt;Phase Spider&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Spider\"&gt;Sword Spider&lt;/a&gt; creatures to contend with.\nOnce those are dealt with, the party observes another library room, with some evidence of disarray and potential vandalism. There are various shelving units covered in dust, webs, cobwebs and some tomes and parchment. Several sofas and tables are present for library patrons. On the north and south walls of the room are seen closed doors.\nAs is good practice, check for traps and hidden hazards when searching the area. Take any found items you desire from the shelves.\nOne of them contains a strange stone that has been split in half. At the moment, the party has no idea what use, if any, this half-stone might have.\nWhen ready, open the door leading northbound. There is a small plaque next to the doorway, identical to the one mounted in another room on the west side of the level.\nThe Bedchamber.\nAn unoccupied bedchamber is seen ahead. As always, search carefully for booby traps and hazards.\nWithin are a four postered canopy bed, and several furnishings. There is a statuette in an alcove. Some of these may contain items that can be removed and kept. There is some unique equipment here that is sure to come in handy.\nA &lt;a href=\"Scribbled%20Note\"&gt;Scribbled Note&lt;/a&gt; can also be found, plus a &lt;a href=\"Tinderbox\"&gt;Tinderbox&lt;/a&gt;, and a pair of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Slippers\"&gt;Old Slippers&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext stop is The Study.\nThe Study (Rune room).\nOpen the closed door at the south end of the library (east). \nUpon stepping forward a text message display is seen on the player's screen:\nShelves on standing desk and a closed cabinet contain items that can be taken. \nAnother &lt;a href=\"Tattered%20Parchment\"&gt;Tattered Parchment&lt;/a&gt; is found, as well as a curious stone that has been cut in half.\nOn the west wall is a closed door.\nBedchamber (Southeast).\nOpen the door and see another bedchamber. Also some kind of intangible enemy creature floats toward the intrusion.\nA hostile &lt;a href=\"Spellhaunt\"&gt;Spellhaunt&lt;/a&gt; attacks. Destroy this undead malign creature before it can cause harm.\nThis bedchamber is furnished well. A search of the space turns up no traps or locks. \nA valuable gemstone is found, and on table is a dusty key. \nThis might be the one needed to open the Crypt door, which has defied attempts to lockpick or be forced.\nThe Priest's Crypt.\nFinally, with the &lt;a href=\"Key%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Altar%20Level%29\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; in hand, the party can see if it fits the door to the Priest's Crypt. It does.\nWith the double doors opened, a large ornate chamber is seen. Symbolic statue figures are set in alcoves on the walls. A marble sarcophagus is the focal point of the room.\nTwo hulking &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Golem\"&gt;Guardian Golem&lt;/a&gt; creatures stare blankly at the party as they enter. Their heads and necks move slightly to follow the movement. They don't appear hostile.\nIf the player examines the sarcophagus, a text message is displayed, reading:\nWith little else to try, a party member can interact with the sarcophagus and look inside. This action will stimulate the guardians to attack, but if the player's party has possession of the &lt;a href=\"Wardstone%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Altar%20Level%29\"&gt;Wardstones&lt;/a&gt;, then the golems remain neutral and passive.\nOnce the sarcophagus is opened, a test message is displayed:\nAt this point to the right of the sarcophagus, a &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28WK%20Altar%20Level%29\"&gt;lich-priest&lt;/a&gt; rises from the Crypt floor in a cut scene. The creature will know if you have the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Slippers\"&gt;Old Slippers&lt;/a&gt; in the party's inventory, and if so, the undead priest will ask for them. If the slippers are given to the creature, it apologizes for its outburst, expresses gratitude for the slippers, and let's the party know they are free to have a look in the sarcophagus. The creature then disappears, never to be seen again. Every party member gains 20'000 XP.\nOn the other hand, if the player refuses to give the undead creature it's slippers, or if they aren't in the party's possession - then the lich will say a few menacing words and attack. Killing it nets the party 22'000 XP, split between party members, as well as 8'000 XP for destroying its summons.\nAssuming the party is able to defeat the creature, then the sarcophagus may be examined at the player's discretion. Every party member gains 8'000 XP. When done, a text is displayed that reads:\nThe party should now have everything they need to recon with the altar, and conduct the Holy Ritual for themselves.\nThe Holy Ritual at the Altar.\nWhen the party has collected all the items mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Tattered%20Parchment\"&gt;Tattered Parchment&lt;/a&gt; documents and taken note of the Holy Ritual notes from the old Priest's robe then the ritual may be performed at the Altar to open the portal to the lower reaches.\nWhen ready, the party should refer to its parchments, and engage the altar &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20%28Altar%29\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to prompt the Holy Ritual dialogue. Ensure the character performing the ritual has the required items ready to place on the altar. Place both items on the Altar alongside the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Book\"&gt;Holy Book&lt;/a&gt; (which should be on the altar already).\nFollow the guidance on the &lt;a href=\"Open%20the%20portal%20to%20the%20temple%27s%20lower%20levels\"&gt;Open the portal to the temple's lower levels&lt;/a&gt; quest page for the correct steps to take, as well as some observations of what's to come.\nIf the party is able to complete the Holy Ritual, and is able to defeat the all the statues, then the quest experience will be awarded and the Portal will be opened and usable to travel to the next dungeon level. If the player is having a tough time and wants to avoid fighting the statues, and just make a run for it and transport through the portal - you'll find out that the game doesn't permit this action. All the statues must be destroyed before the Portal will open - in fact, if tried, a text displays on the screen reading:\nOnce all the statues have been defeated, the Portal is now energized and ready to accept travelers.\nThe party has done it! \nThe first portal is now opened, and the player may continue below to the lower reaches when ready to do so.\nFor the next stage of the adventure see the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Elemental%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Elemental Level&lt;/a&gt; page.\nTreasure (See \"Map notes\" on InfoBox).\nStatues.\nMaximum items recoverable (based on all statues present):\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod changes the appearance of the two &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Golem\"&gt;Guardian Golem&lt;/a&gt; and Statue Golem creatures. The &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt; on this level is also changed to a \"Greater Stone Golem\" creature, with extra powers and more robust vital statistics. See the Mod screenshots section for additional visual info."}

A large circular rotunda is observed, with a high domed ceiling. Soft luminescence bathes the room from the glow provided by the two portal gates positioned on the east and west of the chamber.\nAt the northeast side of the room is an elaborate cage made from some kind of metallic alloy. Within can be seen a hulking winged-fiend of some kind, staring intently at the party.\nThere are four closed arched doorways with ornate metal double-doored gates positioned at equal distance on the circumference of the rotunda. They lead to the north, east, south, and west.\nEach gate connects to a short hallway that leads to:\nEach library is in-turn connected to two other hallway passages at opposite ends. One hallway leads to its own laboratory, and the other to a different Elementalist Laboratory.\nThe hallways leading to the opposing or different laboratory have closed doors and may be locked and possibly trapped to prevent free travel between them.\nResting on this dungeon level.\nIf the party rests on this dungeon level, there is random chance of the rest being interrupted \"You are awakened from your rest..\", with &lt;a href=\"Devil%20Shade\"&gt;Devil Shade&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nGameplay and walkthrough (abbreviated).\nWalkthrough explanation: This walkthrough is done in a specific order that is considered the optimal path. The reasons for this aren't subjective, but objectively based because the developers have made the path forward in this dungeon level in a somewhat linear fashion. For example, clues are given on how to proceed, and certain doors are barred and can't be opened without possession of certain keys or scepters. This order of what to do first, second, and so forth is not mandatory, but the player will eventually come to an impasse and will have to, eventually, backtrack and perform these steps in order to complete the adventure. With that said, explore the dungeon as you wish, and the walkthrough below is offered as the most streamlined path.\nEnter the central portal room.\nThe party travels through the portal gate from &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Altar%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Altar Level&lt;/a&gt; to this area. \nThe party is positioned in a certain manner by the game, facing the large magical cage just to the north of the room. After a few tics of the game clock the creature inside the cage opens up dialogue.\nThe demon in the cage, who is the &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Demon\"&gt;Chromatic Demon&lt;/a&gt;, will now have an exchange of dialogue with the party. \nAsk questions and reply as desired. If the party doesn't want to have anything to do with the creature, and shuts down the dialogue, then the party will be basically stuck, and can't progress to the next level in Watcher's keep. \nRegardless of the feelings toward this demon, it is necessary to find out what needs to be done to free the fiend from its cage, so that the creature can open up the portal gate - otherwise the party is going nowhere further in their adventure inside Watcher's Keep.\nAgreeing to free the demon and finding out what to do next to achieve that will lead to the demon giving the ultimate goal and registering the &lt;a href=\"Gather%20the%20four%20scepter%20keys\"&gt;Gather the four scepter keys&lt;/a&gt; quest entry in the player's Journal.\nThe party is now free to pursue the quest as they see fit, and the player can take control of the characters. \nIt is suggested to first explore the area behind the closed gate to the north side of room, just to the rear of the demon's cage.\nThis gate leads to the Fire Elemetalist Library.\nEnter the Fire Elementalist Library.\nOpen the gated doorway and move within the library. Most likely two armed &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giant\"&gt;Fire Giants&lt;/a&gt; will be seen - they are hostile. \nIf they detect a party member they will move forward and attack. \nIt is possible to retreat and draw the two giants out, allowing more party members to engage with missile fire and stay out of melee range. \nCharging into the library could prove hazardous due to invisible traps present, and the party may not be able to detect these without being nearby the enemies.\nThese giants can hit hard, plus they deal additional fire damage on a successful hit.\nA party member in range will probably be hit, even with a very good armor class. Best to use some additional defenses to reduce the risk. These giants will quaff a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Superior%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Superior Healing&lt;/a&gt; when heavily damaged, increasing their survivability.\nWhile exploring and examining the library area, it is likely that one of the party members will trigger an encounter over by the east side of the room, where a corridor is.\nThis will be challenge from the &lt;a href=\"Imp%20%28Elemental%20Level%29\"&gt;Imp (Elemental Level)&lt;/a&gt;, who demands:\nThis dialogue initiates an exchange with the Imp, that requires a chain of questions and responses from the party. The Imp will provide some important background information about this place and give some advice that is absolutely true about how to navigate this area the right way, after all, the Imp served the \"masters\" here. \nAt the conclusion of the exchange the party will know that the Elementalist Wizards each had their own agenda, library and laboratory, described as:\nThe imp makes another telling remark:\nBefore any more questions can be asked, the Imp closes out the conversation and departs the area in a fiery flash, gone for good.\nThe player's Journal will now register two entries:\nAnd a second one:\nOn the western side of the laboratory is another corridor leading towards a closed metal gate. The temperature quickly rises in this space, and a text displays on the player's combat log reading: \"The crackle of flames and the smell of smoke assails your senses. A blast of heat from the room causes your skin to redden and blister.\"\nEnduring the heat is tough, and if the party attempts to open the gate, it finds that the passage is locked. Nothing seems to work to open it at this time.\nFinish combing through the various shelves and compartments in the library, take whatever objects and items are desired. Make sure to look for one of those written records the Imp spoke of and retain/read the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Library%20Note\"&gt;Fire Library Note&lt;/a&gt;. This information is essential for later actions by the party.\nThe party will recall that the Imp made it clear to \"start that fan again\" so that the Wizards labs are not empty. In fact, as the party explores the eastern passageway from the library where the Imp appeared, another closed gate is seen. Unlike the gate over on western side of the library, this gate isn't locked. \nEnter the Air Laboratory (activate the magical fan).\nOpening the gate to the next room allows the party to observe a circular room - probably the Air Laboratory. Within can be seen a central switch apparatus with a wheel, some electrodes or other unknown machinery along the perimeter, and to the north, a massive fan unit with stationary impeller blades. Some sort of cables or conduits crisscross the floor and connect to the central switch. Another closed gate is also seen over at the eastern side of the chamber.\nWith little else to try, a party member can approach the central switch and activate it with the cursor and \"click\" upon it. This action will initiate the magical fan to begin circulation, and a text is displayed on the screen reading:\nEach party member receives and four air elementals appear nearby the wheel-switch unit, who are hostile.\nThe group of elementals is actually two &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Air%20Elemental\"&gt;Greater Air Elemental&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Air%20Elemental\"&gt;Lesser Air Elemental&lt;/a&gt; creatures. Also, hidden from view initially is an invisible &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Air\"&gt;Guardian of Air&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Air Guardian is similar to a slightly tougher Aerial Servant/Invisible Stalker type of foe.\nAttention to one tricky part of this encounter, is that along the southern part of the room are two hidden proximity trigger zones that will cause the electrode globes mounted on the perimeter of the map to begin firing regularly timed chain-lightning electricity bolts at any party members inside the room. There are actually three different kinds of electricity power that will rotate, about every round. Damage ranges from 4d4, 4d8 to 4d10 &lt;a href=\"Electricity%20damage\"&gt;Electricity damage&lt;/a&gt;, and there is no saving throw, and it bypasses &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;. However, a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; can prevent this damage. The Air elementals and Guardian of Air are immune to these particular electricity bolts. (Reference SPWI025, 26 and 27)\nAs to what the party should be trying to achieve here is to find the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Scepter\"&gt;Air Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, and defeat all the hostile enemies, and not perish while attempting that. Pretty simple goal, but it might be tougher than it sounds.\nThe elementals will periodically be activating their innate &lt;a href=\"Air%20Elemental%20Whirlwind\"&gt;Air Elemental Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the Air Guardian will appear from hiding after it attacks. The player may notice their party members being knocked unconscious for brief periods as well, getting knocked backwards and suffering some crushing damage. This is occurring from the fan's air currents in the room (ref: SPIN643.spl). There is no saving throw or resistance to this air turbulence buffeting effect.\nIf the chain-lightning is initiated in the room, this place can be quite hazardous to those unprotected from lightning bolts. Focus on defeating the Guardian of Air, and if it is killed the creature will drop the Air Scepter. This item is one of the objects sought to free the Chromatic Demon, but it also serves as a key to open another door, and more importantly, allow the party member to shut off and turn on the magical fan. With the Air Scepter in hand, interact with the central wheel switch to shut off the device and to stop those lightning bolts and damaging air turbulence.\nOnce the creatures and guardian are destroyed and the fan is turned off by the Air Scepter, the party can move forward by opening the gate on the southeastern edge of the room.\nEnter the Air Elementalist Library.\nWhen ready, open the gate to a corridor on the southeastern side of the Air lab. The gate will be unbarred if the party has the Air Scepter in their possession.\nMoving forward to the east the party observes another furnished library ahead. There is a small hallway connected to the main central rotunda, and another corridor across the library on the southeastern side. \nIt is probable that a group of golem creatures will be seen in the center, and if they detect the party, will immediately initiate their innate golem powers such as &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Haste\"&gt;Golem Haste&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Slow\"&gt;Golem Slow&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf there is an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; present, that creature will most likely discharge a &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Cloud\"&gt;Gas Cloud&lt;/a&gt; after a few rounds. These golems will be under a &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt; and will charge toward the party and attempt to crush all intruders.\nDestroy the golems and then explore the library. Be cautious and check for hidden traps. Numerous items and books are discovered. The party will also find the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Library%20Note\"&gt;Air Library Note&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollect any items desired and prepare to move forward, with additional information gleaned from the Elementalist Wizard of Air's notes. It seems as though the Air Wizard was particularly keen to destroy the Slime Wizard and his creatures. \nEnter the Slime Laboratory.\nA corridor leads south eastward to a shut gate ahead. Moving cautiously forward, the explorer is aware of a pungent odor, and a text message displays:\nTo open the gate, the party must possess the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Scepter\"&gt;Air Scepter&lt;/a&gt;. When ready, open it up and within can be seen a circular shaped chamber with another closed gate on the southwestern edge.\nIn the center of the room is a pool of noisome bubbling ooze. there are also four vertical glass tubes containing a greenish bubbling mixture. These are described as:\nSeveral cables or hoses are connected to the various tubes and pool as well as to the perimeter walls - they are laying on the floor and can be stepped over.\nInside the chamber are seen some amorphous &lt;a href=\"Green%20Slime\"&gt;Green Slime&lt;/a&gt; blobs undulating toward the party and some kind of &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt; creatures. Most strangely is a massive snake creature that rapidly moves menacingly forward and attacks. This giant snake is the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Snake%20%28Guardian%20of%20Slime%29\"&gt;Guardian of Slime&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party enters the chamber to engage these creatures, a few moments later the chamber quickly fills with a noxious gas. This occurs even if the magical fan is on the highest setting in the Air laboratory. The cloud will inflict 3d10 &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt; every round a party member is exposed. Unlike a &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; spell, this potent gas isn't blocked by magic resistance and has no saving throw.\nIf a party member gets close to the central pool, it will trigger an acidic attack, which is actually a point blank &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nAll of these creatures can be destroyed by the party, and none of them are invincible. Although the Air Library Note gives some advice about using the fan to clear the toxic gas and to use lightning to halt the slimes, there is no requirement to do so, and frankly, that advice is more of an embellishment than a fact.\nThe party may notice that the central ooze pool in the chamber keeps on producing a green slime periodically (see the screenshot left). \nThis is triggered by a party member's presence in the room and occurs about every three rounds. The pool will continue to \"manufacture\" a slime creature seemingly forever. Experience point \"farming\" is possible here, but the slime is only worth , so that's not really good use of adventuring time.\nCollect the &lt;a href=\"Slime%20Scepter\"&gt;Slime Scepter&lt;/a&gt; from the corpse of the Slime Guardian. Also, if desired, search the central ooze pool in the chamber for a &lt;a href=\"Flail%20Head%20%28Poison%29\"&gt;Unique component&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe gate on the southwestern edge of the chamber can't be opened at this time. Some sort of key is needed to unbar it.\nAs this chamber is a decidedly unhealthy place to remain, grab the loot and get out of the slime laboratory chamber at first opportunity.\nEnter the Slime Library.\nThe next logical step forward in the &lt;a href=\"Gather%20the%20four%20scepter%20keys\"&gt;Gather the four scepter keys&lt;/a&gt; questline is to find the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Scepter\"&gt;Ice Scepter&lt;/a&gt; to go along with the Air and Slime Scepters already collected.\nPrepare to enter the gate from the central rotunda room and take the southeast passage behind it. The party will observe another library ahead, full of furnishings and shelves.\nThe room has a corridor leading to the northeast (to the Slime Laboratory) and another to the southwest (to the Ice Laboratory). \nMost likely, a group of smallish &lt;a href=\"Mutated%20Spider\"&gt;Mutated Spider&lt;/a&gt; creatures will be observed in the center of the library. If these arachnids detect an intruder, they'll scamper quickly toward the party member and try and land vicious poisonous bites. \nIt may be a good idea to let the spiders come to the party rather than just rushing inside the library, due to the inevitable traps which are concealed ahead.\nDispatch the spiders, disarm or avoid the traps, then rummage through the containers and collect any items desired. When the &lt;a href=\"Slime%20Library%20Note\"&gt;Slime Library Note&lt;/a&gt; is discovered, read this carefully, as it gives important clues on how to deal with the next challenge, the Ice Laboratory.\nThe party will also discover a &lt;a href=\"Key%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Elemental%20Level%29\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt;, which if examined provides the following description: \"This key likely unlocks the door on the north-east end of the slime library.\"\nThis is the gate leading to the Slime Laboratory.\nThe small hallway leading southwest from the library ends in a closed gate. If a party member approaches it, a rapidly decreasing temperature is apparent, and a text displays on the player's game screen reading:\nTo open this gate to see what lies ahead requires that the party possesses the &lt;a href=\"Slime%20Scepter\"&gt;Slime Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, which unbars the otherwise locked gate.\nEnter the Ice Laboratory.\nOpening the gate to the Ice Laboratory reveals a circular room, ankle deep in crusty frost and ice. Another closed gate is seen across the chamber on the northwest permitter. \nThree floor mounted ventilation hoods with fan impeller blades whirl and discharge frosty air - described as:\nThe party can discern a great golem like creature, seemingly made from solid polished crystallized ice, as well as some sort of mist creatures hovering and floating in the frigid atmosphere.\nIf a party member ventures within, the group of monstrosities will attack once the character is in detection range. These are the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Golem%20%28Guardian%20of%20Ice%29\"&gt;Ice Golem (Guardian of Ice)&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Mist\"&gt;Ice Mist&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nIf the player maneuvers about, perhaps trying to avoid the creatures and explore the room, it will become apparent that the chamber is so cold that it might instill a temporary &lt;a href=\"Slow%20effect\"&gt;Slow effect&lt;/a&gt;\nupon the adventurer, reducing some actions to half speed. Whether this effect occurs is based on if a party member enters a hidden proximity trigger zone in the chamber. There are two of these zones, and with luck, a character might miss them. Any party member that triggers the effect will be slowed for 3 seconds. Anytime a zone is contacted, the slow effect is reapplied. There is no saving throw provided and it ignores magic resistance, however, a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt; could block it. The slow effect will neuter a haste effect and the extra movement rate afforded by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Paws%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;The Paws of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt;.\nEngaging in combat or casting spells at any of these creatures results in the realization that they seem invulnerable to everything the party member tries. No damage of any type is registering on these ice creatures. No spells have any effect on them. As this unpleasant fact sets in - it is a reminder that the party should follow the clues in the &lt;a href=\"Slime%20Library%20Note\"&gt;Slime Library Note&lt;/a&gt; in order to have a chance of success to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Scepter\"&gt;Ice Scepter&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssuming the party follows and executes the procedures in the Slime Wizard's notes, and all the gates remain open between the magical fan, the Slime laboratory and the Ice laboratory - as soon as the fan setting is raised to maximum, a text will display reading:\nWhen a party member enters the Ice chamber after this action, a greenish cloud should form and fill the lab. The presence of this cloud makes the formerly invulnerable ice creatures now partially subject to various attacks. They can now be engaged in melee combat and some spells may work against them. \nBattle and destroy these creatures with whatever tactics are best suited by the party. When killed, the Ice Golem Guardian's body can be searched for the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Scepter\"&gt;Ice Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some an unusual &lt;a href=\"Horn\"&gt;Horn&lt;/a&gt;. Possession of the scepter allows unlocking of the closed gate on the ice chamber's northwest, which connects to the Ice Library.\nThe next step is to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Scepter\"&gt;Fire Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, to continue completing the &lt;a href=\"Gather%20the%20four%20scepter%20keys\"&gt;Gather the four scepter keys&lt;/a&gt; quest.\nEnter the Ice Library.\nThe Ice Library may be entered from two gates. The first gate is accessed from the initial Portal Chamber. The second is by way of the Ice Laboratory, but only if the Ice Scepter has been obtained.\nWhichever entry point is selected, the party needs to explore this area, to find any remaining clues, and to hunt for the Fire Scepter. When ready advance forward to have a look at what's inside. The party will find yet another furnished library ahead. Care must be taken in case there are hidden traps, as was the case in the other laboratories explored previously.\nCautiously moving forward reveals the distorted outline of some more Mist creatures ahead. They can &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt;, so when the party sees them, they'll see the party. They'll rush forward with their life stealing tendrils outstretched. Best to destroy these undead horrors immediately so they don't cause any problems later. \nExpect a pair of &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Wraith\"&gt;Vampiric Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Horror\"&gt;Wandering Horror&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the party has dispatched the mist enemies, explore the library. Collect all the found items desired, and then ensure that the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Library%20Note\"&gt;Ice Library Note&lt;/a&gt; is read thoroughly.\nThe information in the Note makes it clear that the nearby Fire laboratory may be guarded by \"\"invincible servant\", that is apparently indestructible. However, drawing the \"elementals\"\" into the Ice Laboratory will deprive the giant of its protection. There is only one way to find out if this plan is going to work or not, and that is to try it out.\nScout forward to the hallway leading north and see a closed gate ahead. \nExtremely hot air is felt radiating out of the room beyond. \nWhomever ventures within should prepare and make use of fire protection magics or other measures against flame.\nThe gate ahead will now be unlocked, as the party has possession of the Ice Scepter.\nEnter the Fire Laboratory.\nWhen ready to enter the Fire Laboratory chamber, gather the party and open the gate. It won't open unless the party possesses the Ice Scepter.\nAside from the extreme heat within, the party first notices another circular room, with a central round pool filled with bubbling magma. \nThree vertical oriented smokestacks are also positioned in the room, described as:\nTo the eastern side of the room is seen another closed gate that connects to Fire Library. The most pressing issue is the 15-foot tall &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giant%20%28Guardian%20of%20Fire%29\"&gt;Fire Giant (Guardian of Fire)&lt;/a&gt; that lumbers toward the intrusion. This must be the so-called invincible servant created by the now long dead Fire Elementalist wizard.\nAs soon as the giant makes a move, a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Fire%20Elemental%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%29\"&gt;Greater Fire Elemental&lt;/a&gt; forms outside the magma pool, and coalesces, then races towards the party.\nIf a party member goes too near the permitter of the magma pool, this will trigger a point-blank instant spell attack with a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt;. This can be a recurring issue depending on if the character keeps crossing into the proximity zones, so watch out.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Library%20Note\"&gt;Ice Library Note&lt;/a&gt;, the key to making the Fire Guardian vulnerable is to lead the four fire elementals into the frigid Ice chamber - and they'll freeze, trapping their spirits, so that can't be respawned. otherwise, the elementals just keep being reborn in the lava, and maintain the guardian's invincibility. How else can the party gain the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Scepter\"&gt;Fire Scepter&lt;/a&gt; than to attempt his plan? And so, the party will have to try this tactic out for themselves.\nEnter the Fire chamber and avoid the giant's weapon blows as much as possible. \nRemain inside long enough to spawn a fire elemental. \nThen move away, toward the Ice chamber, leading the elemental on, bit by bit. \nThe fire guardian may also follow but won't venture too far before retreating back to the safety of its lair.\nDon't destroy the elemental before it reaches the Ice chamber, or it will just be reborn again.\nLead the elemental into the ice chamber a short distance within, the creature will suddenly freeze. A text will display, reading:\nThe elemental is marked as dead, and a &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;22000&lt;/a&gt; reward is shared by the party. Note that slaying the elemental in any other way than by freezing it in the Ice chamber results in no experience points at all. There is no XP farming available here. If the party strikes the elemental after its frozen, it will explode into ice chunks, but this isn't necessary.\nRepeat this process three more times, until all four elementals are frozen. After this process the Fire Guardian will no longer be impervious to being killed.\nEnter it's fiery lair and destroy it in whatever manner is best delivered by the party. The giant fill fight back, but it can be put down like any other mortal being. Search the creature's corpse and find the Fire Scepter as well as a magical &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20the%20Rock\"&gt;Helmet&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne final exploration is possible if the party dares, and that is to search the lava/magma pool for some found items within. Take them if desired.\nWith all four elemental scepters in the party's possession, it is now possible to free the Chromatic Demon from its cage, and then the fiend promised to open the portal gate to the lower reaches.\nFree the Chromatic Demon.\nWrap up any loose ends and housekeeping needed before speaking with the Chromatic Demon. Rest first if needed. There is no rush.\nBe aware that with a bit of forethought and patience, the party can time when to engage with the demon to free it and do so when it has assumed a specific form that the party wishes.\nWhen the party is prepared, interact with the cage to initiate engagement with the Chromatic Demon. After this occurs, the game AI looks to see that the party possesses the four elemental Scepters. If they are indeed retained, then the demon will exclaim:\nIt then remarks and laughs, saying:\nThe demon is placed in a spot outside the cage and attacks, and the player can then take control of the characters and issue commands.\nAt this time the player's journal updates on the &lt;a href=\"Gather%20the%20four%20scepter%20keys\"&gt;Gather the four scepter keys&lt;/a&gt; questline, as follows:\nEach party member receives for this action. It is up to the party to destroy this fiend. Use the clues given from what the Imp said, and some of the texts in the libraries touched on to defeat the creature.\nFor more information and the enemies' stats and immunities, see the &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Demon\"&gt;Chromatic Demon&lt;/a&gt; page.\nRecover the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Key%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Elemental%20Level%29\"&gt;Portal Key&lt;/a&gt; dropped by the fiend after it is defeated.\nThe party can now unlock and use the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Teleport%20Maze\"&gt;Lower Reaches&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//github.com/The-Gate-Project/klatu-tweaks-and-fixes\"&gt;klatu Tweaks and Fixes&lt;/a&gt; mod will add an \"Elven Tome\" to one of the libraries in this dungeon level. Take this tome to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Oghma%20%28Athkatla%29\"&gt;Temple of Oghma (Athkatla)&lt;/a&gt; (if playing the adventure in SoA), or to the &lt;a href=\"Lazarus%20Librarus\"&gt;Lazarus Librarus&lt;/a&gt; in the ToB portion of the game. After a period of time, this tome can eventually be deciphered to be the \"Manual of War\", which has the key to eventually instill some amazing abilities, most likely being viewed as overpowered (OP), but can be fun to try for player having difficulty in their gameplay and needing some extra help with their party's combat skills."}

The party has possession of the &lt;a href=\"Vigil%20Stone\"&gt;Vigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; which is needed to enter the keep, and to leave and return again later.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt; has been previously explored by the party, and the fourth portal gate has been successfully opened, allowing travel to the next lower floor, the Watcher's Keep Final Seal.\nThe party was able to navigate and overcome the challenges of the previous Watcher's Keep Machine of Lum. \nTo continue the quest of assisting the Helmites to renew the seals and keep the \"imprisoned one\" under control - the party will need to be able to find the means to open the portal on this new level of the keep. That is the overarching mission. Find the clues and method to open the portal to allow progress into the \"Lower Reaches\" of the keep.\nPlayer's goal.\nExplore the maps, overcome challenges, and collect the necessary keys in order to unlock the pedestals, which allows movement of the Final Seal Wheel, which opens the portal to the next level.\nArea description.\nThis dungeon level is a large stone floored chamber with high celling supported by various buttresses and arches.\nThe illumination in this place seems provided by only the two portal gates. The further one travels from each lighting source the dimmer it gets.\nThe chamber is fitted with three double metal gates, all closed, positioned on the east, west and southern ends of the main chamber. Above each gate is a plaque with a symbol of helm.\nIn the center of the chamber is a round seal on the floor, with a symbol of helm emblazoned upon it. Three metallic pedestals and a wheel apparatus are placed just outside the seal.\nExamining any of the pedestals will prompt a text message reading \"\"There is a large keyhole in the pedestal next to the seal\".\nChecking out the wheel will display a text message reading \"This wheel opens the final seal but cannot be turned until all three keys are found and used to unlock the seal\"\".\nResting on this dungeon level.\nThis dungeon level has a random probability of spawning a rest encounter.\nThe party may be disturbed by a &lt;a href=\"Mutated%20Spider\"&gt;Mutated Spider&lt;/a&gt; group or a pair of &lt;a href=\"Spellhaunt\"&gt;Spellhaunt&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nWalkthrough.\nWhen the party arrives from the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt; dungeon level, there is a brief dark interlude, and then the party is rendered on the map.\nThe game doesn't provide any information about what to do, or any narration or text displays. The party may now be controlled by the player as normal.\nThis walkthrough seeks to present the exploration on this dungeon level in the optimal order to complete it.\nOne area cannot be accessed until a previous one is completed, although a new player wouldn't know this from the outset.\nHowever, there is no need to follow this walkthrough whatsoever. Feel free to just explore as desired and do things in any order that the game allows.\nOpen the southern gates and find the Helmite Ghost.\nOpen the double gates on the southern side the main chamber.\nThis will trigger a greeting from the &lt;a href=\"Helmite%20Ghost\"&gt;Helmite Ghost&lt;/a&gt; who waits beyond in an alcove with three more double doored gateways behind him - the Automap notes marker here indicates this location is labelled as \"The Challenge Rooms\".\nInteracting with the Helmite ghost will introduce the &lt;a href=\"Unlocking%20the%20Final%20Seal\"&gt;Unlocking the Final Seal&lt;/a&gt; questline into the player's journal. \nThe party learns that in order to obtain one of the required keys to open the final seal, three challenges must be successfully overcome first.\nFor a walkthrough about the Helmite Ghost's actions and the challenges before the party, refer to this &lt;a href=\"Helmite%20Ghost\"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen all three challenges have been solved, return to the ghost and it will deliver the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Key\"&gt;Heart Key&lt;/a&gt;, and a final farewell.\nThe ghost departs the area map for good.\nThe party is also now in possession of the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%27s%20Skull\"&gt;Warrior's Skull&lt;/a&gt; as well, allowing access to the next challenge.\nOpen the eastern gates and find the Spirit Altar.\nWhen ready to do so, with the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%27s%20Skull\"&gt;Warrior's Skull&lt;/a&gt; in the party's inventory, open the double gates on the eastern side of the main chamber.\nThe chamber beyond is a rather small alcove, and within is seen a hostile group of golems standing ready adjacent to &lt;a href=\"The%20Spirit%20Altar\"&gt;The Spirit Altar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf any of the golems observe the party, they will rush forward and attack mindlessly as golems are often instructed to do - the double gates can be closed if needed.\nThese golems must be destroyed before investigating and successfully engaging The Spirit Altar, even if the party has the Warrior's Skull, so one way or another, take down the constructs.\nAfter the golems are finished off, the party can get ready to interact with the spirit altar. If the Warrior's skull has been obtained, then clicking on the altar initiates a sequence of events.\nBy way of a cut scene, the party is transported to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%E2%80%93%20Adventure%20Level%20%28Spirit%20Warrior%29\"&gt;Watcher's Keep \u2013 Adventure Level (Spirit Warrior)&lt;/a&gt; area, and &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; has been replaced by an avatar of some kind.\nA dialogue box is displayed indicating a description of what has occurred.\nFor details about what can transpire next, as well as a walkthrough, see the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Warrior\"&gt;Spirit Warrior&lt;/a&gt; article.\nAssuming the main character is able to successfully complete the challenge, then the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Key\"&gt;Spirit Key&lt;/a&gt; will be obtained, and the party returned adjacent to the spirit altar.\nWith two keys now in the party's possession, there remains only the final &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Key\"&gt;Mind Key&lt;/a&gt; to get their hands on.\nWhen ready to do so, make way to the double gates on the western side of the central chamber.\nOpen the western gates and find the Globe Machine.\nOpen up the double gates on the western side of the central room - and observe a relatively large alcove beyond.\nWithin will initially be seen a &lt;a href=\"Mutated%20Spider\"&gt;Mutated Spider&lt;/a&gt; group, that will race towards the closest detected party member and attack.\nNote that once opened, the double gates can't be closed again - rid yourself of the threat from these arachnids, and then explore the chamber.\nWithin is a curious assembly, labelled on the player's world map as \"The Globe Machine\".\nFor details of this apparatus and associated objects, as well as a walkthrough, see the &lt;a href=\"Globe%20Machine\"&gt;Globe Machine&lt;/a&gt; article.\nAssuming the party is able to work through the various challenges involved with interacting with the machine, then the &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Key\"&gt;Mind Key&lt;/a&gt; will eventually be in their possession.\nWith all three required keys on hand, the party can prepare to attempt to unlock the pedestals on the Final Seal in the central chamber. \nUnlock the pedestals surrounding the final seal.\nWhenever the party has obtained one of the three required keys, including the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Key\"&gt;Heart Key&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Key\"&gt;Spirit Key&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Key\"&gt;Mind Key&lt;/a&gt;, then it is possible to use a key to unlock the corresponding pedestal adjacent to the Final Seal.\nA key can be used whenever desired, one by one, or later on after all the keys are obtained.\nTo use a key, approach the Final Seal with a party member, and get close enough to a particular pedestal so that the golden colored cursor allows clicking on it.\nA text will display reading - \"There is a large keyhole in the pedestal next to the seal\".\nIf the correct key is possessed by the party, then the screen will display a text reading - \"You place the key into the lock. Click again to turn the key and unleash whatever guardians await you.\"\nClick on cursor again, and a message displays - \"The key turns easily. This lock is now open.\"\nIf the lock has already been opened, a message display reads - \"There is nothing more that you can do with this.\"\nOnce a key is successfully used and the pedestal lock is opened, then the key is removed from the player's inventory and guardians are spawned into various locations about the Final Seal.\nNote that it is possible to open all the pedestals (can be done in various ways) at one go - releasing all the guardians at once. There are many disadvantages to doing this, but if the player seeks some stimulating and challenging gameplay, or has a particular strategy that is planned, it can be performed in this manner.\nAnother factor that exists in the game, especially for a first-time player, is that the text warns of \"whatever guardians await you\" - but it doesn't describe any details, so they'll be unknown, and an exciting surprise.\nEach pedestal is unlabeled, and there isn't a particular means to figure out which pedestal needs which key, until trying them out. \nBelow is a list with a linked article about the guardians, which is going to be a \"Spoiler\", so don't read ahead unless you desire to find out before regular gameplay:\nWhen the final pedestal is unlocked, a text is displayed - \"The final guardians of the seal are awakened, and you know that you must defeat them with ease if you are ever to face the Imprisoned One and survive. The final lock has been opened. The wheel can now be turned to open the seal.\" \nTurn the wheel and open the final seal.\nWhen all three Pedestal locks are opened, then the last step can be taken to open the Final Seal.\nClick on the wheel apparatus.\nA brief cutscene will play, and then each party member will receive as the Final Seal opens up.\nThe player's Journal updates and resolves the &lt;a href=\"Unlocking%20the%20Final%20Seal\"&gt;Unlocking the Final Seal&lt;/a&gt; questline. \nSo ends the adventure on this dungeon level. \nThe party may transition below to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Imprisoned%20One\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Imprisoned One&lt;/a&gt; dungeon level by entering the new portal when ready to do so."}

They can both be ignored as far as the main plot is concerned or investigated at the desire of the party for further adventure.\nNote that this area does not require that the player must \"gather your party\" in order to visit - one or more characters may enter on their own, and the party can be split.\nResting on this dungeon level.\nIf the party rests in this dungeon area, there is a chance of generating a hostile rest encounter. \nIf a random rest encounter occurs, it will generate a group of &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28githyanki%29\"&gt;Knight (githyanki)&lt;/a&gt; creatures - \"You are awakened from your rest\".\nWalkthrough.\nEnter the encampment - first room.\nThe party transitions to this area from the level above, entering through a double doored metal gateway.\nDirectly ahead in the room are observed three hostile and armed githyanki, an &lt;a href=\"Anti-Paladin%20%28Ir%27revykal%29\"&gt;An anti-paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28githyanki%29\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28githyanki%29\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nExpect some initial buffs from the anti-paladin, and if the party is detectable, &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Mind%20Blast%20%28githyanki%29\"&gt;Psionic blast&lt;/a&gt; attacks from the other two.\nThe creatures will engage in swordplay with their blades, and the anti-paladin may use some other &lt;a href=\"Blackguard\"&gt;Blackguard&lt;/a&gt; abilities depending on how well it lasts/if able.\nAfter the foes are felled, amidst the general debris in this room are several containers that can be examined. As is customary, check for traps and ready your lockpicks or prybars.\nDon't forget to recover any loot from the fallen giths, of note is a marvelous looking &lt;a href=\"Ir%27revrykal\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are doors leading from this room, closed. One leads west, and the other south.\nExplore south - second room.\nThe next room is square shaped, and of moderate size. Various furnishings are placed throughout.\nThe room is occupied by an Anti-paladin, two Knights and three Warriors, all with their drawn swords at the ready.\nThere is no curiosity displayed by these githyanki or attempt to communicate. Just immediate aggression.\nExpect the initial onslaught of Psionic Mind Blasts, and the blackguard will probably be able to get up a buff or two.\nRepeat the same procedure as the first room. Kill, check the bodies, and loot the containers.\nThere are no other exits from here, so return to the first room, and then open the gates to the west.\nExplore west - third room.\nPast the gates is a square room with some githyanki furnishings.\nWithin are a hostile Anti-Paladin, a &lt;a href=\"Gish%20%28githyanki%29\"&gt;Gish&lt;/a&gt; and two Warriors.\nPsionic blasts will be released, and the Gish will attempt to get some arcane magic released. \nThe blackguard will also use some of its innate abilities, before advancing and striking with its unholy reaver.\nOnce these foes are finished off, grab any desired items from the bodies, and check the two containers here.\nThere is a closed gate leading to the south.\nExplore south - fourth room.\nEntering the final room of the encampment through the gateway will quickly show a larger rectangular space, dominated by the sight of an astral skiff, a type of spelljammer vessel.\nHow this ship is here at all is a mystery. Are the githyanki trying to escape the dungeon, or is this craft here because of Carston's use of the machine of lum?\nWith little time to ponder these questions the party must now face another group of hostile githyanki here.\nTwo anti-paladins, two Gish fighter/mages, four warriors, a knight and the encampment leader are within.\nExpect various buffs applied on the Gish, anti-paladins, and several Psionic Mind blasts directed at detected party members.\nThe Gish may also recklessly endanger everything in this area with lightning bolt spells.\nAt a certain point, the leader of the githyanki, the &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28githyanki%20WK%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt;, will shout out some remarks. The party can even reply to them via dialogue.\nHe'll probably exclaim:\nThe party can question what the captain means, but he'll not parlay and order your death.\nAssuming the party is able to best these githyanki, gather any loot desired from the fallen and then search the area for other objects in found containers.\nSeveral items are discovered of interest, such as the &lt;a href=\"Angurvadal\"&gt;Angurvadal&lt;/a&gt; sword, &lt;a href=\"Montolio%27s%20Clasp\"&gt;Montolio's Clasp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diary%20of%20Carston%27s%20Apprentice\"&gt;Diary of Carston's Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Oil\"&gt;Purple Oil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd what was that said about gold and the hoard of the Ancient? \nExamination of this room will show a non-descript transition doorway to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%E2%80%93%20Crypt\"&gt;west&lt;/a&gt;, and a set of huge double doors to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%E2%80%93%20Saladrex%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt;.\nExplore these connections if desired, and at your own peril; more adventure awaits.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises all the creatures in this area to a varying degree, mostly by improving their scripts and AI.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28githyanki%20WK%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; is toughened up considerably.\nProbably the most noticeable gameplay change will be the githyanki response to being intruded upon by the party. Doors will be opened, and each group of githyanki will rush to the aid of the others, which may be beneficial or hazardous to the party, depending on the tactics employed."}

There is one on the west, and another leading south.\nSecond encampment room (west).\nA curved corridor leads to another circular chamber.\nWithin are three more Umber Hulks, that'll attack if they sense an intruder.\nThere is a secret container hidden in a floor mounted pod.\nSome valuables are within including a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Illithid%20Rod\"&gt;Illithid Rod&lt;/a&gt;, which will be needed to advance inside this encampment.\nReturn to the first room and try the second door, leading south.\nThird encampment room (south).\nAs soon as the door is opened the party will face an Umber Hulk, positioned in the middle of a corridor leading southward.\nIf the creature is able detect anyone, then it will attack.\nIt is also possible that a battle at this location might draw other Umber Hulks here from the connecting room further south.\nOn the other hand, if the party is using invisibility or stealth, then a party member can creep past the Umber Hulk and have a look at the next room.\nWithin are observed three more Umber hulks and a &lt;a href=\"Ulitharid\"&gt;Ulitharid&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeal with these hostile defenders in whatever way best suits the party.\nThis rather large chamber is fitted with alien illithid furnishings, as well as five closed doors, and two connecting corridors leading west and south.\nSeach the chamber and open the doors to smaller rooms/cells and look for containers and items - take precautionary measures in case traps are present.\nIn one of the cells is an unwell and wounded man, &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20%28Carston%29\"&gt;Apprentice (Carston)&lt;/a&gt;, that has important dialogue and background insight into &lt;a href=\"Carston\"&gt;Carston&lt;/a&gt;.\nGet whatever information available before he expires from his poor health - additionally a Journal entry will register from this encounter.\nWhen this room is wrapped up, and all the desired loot/valuables are collected, the party must decide which corridor it will explore, either westward or south.\nFourth encampment room (south).\nMoving south through a curved corridor leads to a closed door. Take care that the corridor is checked for traps, just in case.\nOpening the door the party will observe another circular shaped chamber inhabited by a Ulitharid, two Mind flayers and two Umber hulks.\nIf they detect the intruder, they will all launch their special innate ability spell effects, then attack in melee and periodic psionic use if they survive long enough.\nTake out these enemies so that the room can be searched and find out if any of these creatures carry any loot.\nAssuming the dwellers are slain, the party will find the second half of the &lt;a href=\"Illithid%20Rod\"&gt;Illithid Rod&lt;/a&gt; from the dead Ulitharid.\nIf the party has already found and possesses the first piece of the rod, then the two pieces will automatically merge into one, and the party receives an experience point reward and a text display explaining the event.\nThere is also another one of those hidden floor pod containers here as well. What's inside it? But first, are there any traps upon this container?\nWith the Illithid Rod reassembled, it can open the locked door that is currently barred.\nFifth and final room (north).\nTake the final curved corridor leading north from the central chamber, which ends at a locked door. \nAs is standard dungeon exploration practice, check for traps.\nThe locked door resists all lockpicking, &lt;a href=\"Knock\"&gt;Knock&lt;/a&gt; spell, or brute force to open it - the party needs the reassembled &lt;a href=\"Illithid%20Rod\"&gt;Illithid Rod&lt;/a&gt; to open it.\nOnce inside the round shaped chamber, the character will see two mineral based pods/eggs with slab-like seals, and three circular fonts containing a crimson-colored ichor.\nCryptic alien inscriptions and symbols are etched into the floor.\nA search of the room reveals the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Oil\"&gt;Red Oil&lt;/a&gt; faintly visible below the surface of the liquid in one of the pools. Take it if desired.\nWhen the oil is removed, a surge of psionic energy flashes in the chamber, and almost instantly a pair of &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Illithid\"&gt;Vampiric Illithid&lt;/a&gt; creatures appear, and the pod/egg doors unseal. \nThese two undead mind flayers are hostile and intent on extracting punishment on the party of would-be thieves. Any in detection range must defend themselves or flee.\nIf the party manages to defeat the horrid creatures, this will conclude exploration of the encampment.\nNow, with possession of the red oil, return to the Machine of Lum level to continue the adventure.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a &lt;a href=\"Brain%20Golem\"&gt;Brain Golem&lt;/a&gt; to this dungeon serving as an additional defender. A few unique psionic attacks are included with this golem's scripted abilities. Additionally, if the party doesn't already have the mod's \"\"Secret Manual of Golem Building (Vol. 3)\", then one is included in this dungeon level. \nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod and the Tactical Challenges for BG2 \"Improved Watcher's Keep\" component will greatly increase the number of Mind Flayers here.\nIt will have all the enemies found in the base game, plus an additional 12 &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt; and 4 extra &lt;a href=\"Ulitharid\"&gt;Ulitharid&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nIf the player installs the \"Smarter Mind Flayers\" component, then all the illithids will have a wider selection of psionic attacks, higher HD levels, better targeting, superior response and calls for help, recognition of party protections, many are invisible on the map, and can turn improved invisible and more.\nUlitharids have more potent saving throw penalties from some of their psionic abilities.\nExpect that the illithids will planar travel across the map, sometimes up to hundreds of feet to attack party members in the backline/rear areas and be initially invisible when they do so.\nDepending on the player's game difficulty selection, the illithids here can &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; in this encampment. You can't hide from them in their detection range. (ref: dw#sinat)\nDepending on the player's game difficulty selection, the illithids in this encampment will have 50% &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance for increased staying power.

The central alcove contains a swinging bell, that is clearly seen tolling yet produces no audible sound despite the fact that the bell is obviously equipped with a working clapper. If examined closely the object will display a dialogue box text description:\n\"Beware, O mortal, and heed these words:\nKeep well the ritual, and still shall sit the bell.\nBut should the Imprisoned One break his bonds, \nThis bell shall ring out warning to Helm. \nHe shall know thou has failed in thy duty,\nAnd His anger will burn like the midday sun.\"\nOn the upper platform are two illuminated portal gates. \nOne leads back to the \"Upper Levels\" which will return the party to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Final%20Seal\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Final Seal&lt;/a&gt; dungeon level, and the other is an \"Exit\" to the exterior of Watcher's Keep.\nResting on this dungeon level.\nResting is permitted in this area, and there are no random chances of being disturbed by hostile attackers.\nGameplay/walkthrough.\nWhen the party uses the portal from the Final Seal dungeon level, there will be a brief pause (a fade to black cutscene occurs here) and then the party arrives on this dungeon level located on the eastern side of the lower section of this new area.\nBefore the player can control the party members, the game script initiates a series of dialogue boxes to introduce the new plot lines.\nMod screenshot gallery.\nNote - the \"Guide\" info (below) will go to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Watcher's Keep (Quest)&lt;/a&gt; walkthrough page as much of it takes place outside the scope of this area, and involves various decisions, other actors not found in this area, as well as several choices and actions that can occur post contact with the Imprisoned One."}

That is the overarching mission. Find the clues and method to open the portal to allow progress into the \"Lower Reaches\" of the keep.\nPlayer's goal.\nExplore the maps, overcome obstacles, traps, enemies and find necessary items in order to operate the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt; to unlock the Portal Gate and continue below to the next keep level.\nArea description.\nThis area has a uniform architectural theme, with a total of six rooms in all.\nThese rooms are partitioned by metal lattice and decorative bars with paneling that obscures what is beyond.\nMetal double-doored gates provide access to the different areas, all are closed initially.\nThe flooring is consistent with square tiles, that are polished smooth and reflect the light, and there are some orange-colored storage cabinets here as well.\nThe central room has a tall ceiling supported by columns and arches, and a source of illumination is mounted on the ceiling above the strange machine that is placed in the room's center.\nThe central machine is bizarre, and has steam-punk appearance, in the general shape of a 20-sided die. Various gears, steam pipes, and other apparatus are visible on the contraption, and several cables snake along the floor connected to whirling centrifugal generators and some kind of pedestal box of an unknown purpose. The south end of the machine is fitted with a glass-like window protrusion.\nTo the north and south end of this room are exits to other areas indicated on the Auto map markers.\nTo the east and west of the main room are gates leading to other rooms.\nTo the north side of the room are two portal gates on small, raised planforms, that glow with their own light.\nResting on this dungeon level.\nIf the player wishes to rest the party, consider just transitioning to the previous dungeon level or outside the keep and resting there. \nIf the party rests in this dungeon area, there is a chance of generating a hostile rest encounter. \nIf a random rest encounter occurs, it will generate a group of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fiend\"&gt;Shadow Fiend&lt;/a&gt; creatures - \"You are awakened from your rest\".\nWalkthrough.\nIntroduction to Carston.\nWhen the party first transitions from the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Teleport%20Maze\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Teleport Maze&lt;/a&gt; through the exit portal it appears on this new dungeon level nearby the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt; as part of a cut scene (Cut207b.bcs). \nThe party observes a confrontation between a group of &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Githyanki%20%28Race%29\"&gt;Githyanki&lt;/a&gt; engaged in a fight. \nAt this time text on the player's screen shows a person inside the strange machine viewing the battle from behind a glass window extension - he shouts \"\"Hahahaha! Absolutely marvelous!\" - the scene continues as the two groups fight, and this person begins hurling spells at various creatures embroiled in the fight, such as flame arrow and flame strike, or even magic missiles.\nEventually the cruel entity shouts \"Enough! I'm tired of this!\"\". A moment later an infernal fiend, maybe a &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt; appears, causing the two groups to scatter and flee, with the fiend in pursuit. \nThe cut scene ends, and the man in the machine is revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Carston\"&gt;Carston&lt;/a&gt;. The mage initiates dialogue with the party, saying:\nThe party must select a dialogue reply at this juncture. Refer to Carston's article for specific dialogue outcomes.\nAfter the introduction and various dialogue outcomes are finished, the party should fully investigate the main room.\nExplore the main room.\nAs is standard procedure so far in Watcher's Keep, be mindful of potential traps, and also be aware of potential spawned enemies that could manifest, especially when a party member moves close to the northern side of this room.\nThere are four orange hued metal cabinets along the eastern side of the room. What might be inside these?\nTwo portal gates are visible on the northern side as well. Presumably the one used to enter this level, which can now be used to exit to the exterior of the keep.\nThe other most likely connects to the lower reaches. Examining this gate will display a text reading:\nBe alert for random spawned enemies near these portals, approaching from the north. \nThere may be a fast-moving &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fiend\"&gt;Shadow Fiend&lt;/a&gt; group as well as a few &lt;a href=\"Devil%20Shade\"&gt;Devil Shade&lt;/a&gt; creatures, all lusting for the party's precious life force.\nDispatch any enemies and collect any found items desired from the cabinets.\nNext, decide which way to explore. \nFor the purposes of presenting this dungeon, let's assume the party scouts to the east first - to find out what is behind those closed double-gates.\nExplore to the east.\nOpen the double metal gates and peer inside.\nNo enemies are initially seen and the chamber beyond is a bit dimmer, with no light sources illuminated within.\nScout ahead looking to the left and right and the party may trigger one or two enemy group spawns.\nThere might be some &lt;a href=\"Yuan-ti\"&gt;Yuan-ti&lt;/a&gt;, and a few &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; enemies to the north, and a larger group of mixed troll types to the south.\nA &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Troll\"&gt;Spirit Troll&lt;/a&gt; could be here as well, invisible at the outset.\nThe creatures will race toward any detected party member and attack. Destroy these monsters and examine the containers - more orange metal cabinets - checking for traps first is a good precaution. Collect any found items desired.\nOf note in this room are three unusual triangular stone shapes with raised edges placed on the floor. They are colored blue, purple, and a faded red. What these objects are for, or mean is unknown at this time.\nAnother closed double metal gate leads to the east.\nExplore further to the east.\nHaving opened the double metal gates, the party explorer will observe a room that is even less illuminated than the previous one.\nA circular pool in a raised font or cistern of sorts is seen ahead, situated between a pair of massive columns supporting arches stretching to the ceiling.\nTo either side of the pool are two humanoid shaped &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Golem\"&gt;Magic Golem&lt;/a&gt; creatures, wreathed in a nebulous energy of some type.\nIf the creatures are able to detect a party member, they fire an unknown missile projectile from their forms, that is visually reminiscent of a beholder's eye blast.\nThe party may find that any missiles directed at the creature, or weapon strikes, are listed as \"weapon ineffective\". Similarly, spells cast at the creatures may also be ineffective.\nSee the link above if the player is having trouble figuring out what to do here.\nThe pool of liquid is actually a container, and if examined, will provide the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Oil\"&gt;Blue Oil&lt;/a&gt; bottle.\nIf necessary, the party can just grab the Blue Oil, and then close the gates and never return to this room, although there are some more of those orange-tinged cabinets in here as well.\nExplore west of the main room.\nOpen the closed double gates and most likely will spot a hostile group of armed &lt;a href=\"Orog\"&gt;Orogs&lt;/a&gt;, and they'll move to attack if any in the party are detected.\nSimilar to the room nearby the Magic Golems, three more of those colored triangular shapes are positioned on the floor, but they aren't the same as the first group. No explanation is given about them. \nA number of those orange hued cabinets are in this chamber as well. Particularly on the northern side.\nExamine these and take precautions in case of traps.\nIt's likely that a party member that isn't hidden/invisible will alert some kind &lt;a href=\"Killer%20Mimic%23Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Killer Mimic&lt;/a&gt; creatures camouflaged within several of those containers.\nThese nasty monsters have some dangerous attacks, especially if they cause a party member to become &lt;a href=\"Helpless\"&gt;Helpless&lt;/a&gt;.\nDestroy these creatures and then search the containers for found items of use.\nExplore further to the west.\nOpen the gate to the west and venture inside the next area.\nThis dimly lit chamber has no visible occupants, nor any containers.\nHowever, as the party moves about within, there is a chancce of triggering a spawned pack of those &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fiend\"&gt;Shadow Fiend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devil%20Shade\"&gt;Devil Shade&lt;/a&gt; undead.\nSix bowl shaped braziers/torches are mounted on metal legs in two rows. They are unlit and lack any combustible fuel oil.\nA closed double door is seen on the north wall, and it is locked. The door is resistant to any lock picking attempts, as there isn't a visible keyhole at all, nor can strength force it open, and a &lt;a href=\"Knock\"&gt;Knock&lt;/a&gt; spell is ineffective.\nNothing else can be found or learned here at the moment.\nReturn to the main room.\nHaving explored this dungeon area to the extent possible so far, the party must make a decision as where to go next.\nAs of yet, the party doesn't know how to open the portal gate to the lower reaches, and Carston isn't cooperative.\nThe party can explore to the north, marked on the player's map as the \"Illithid Encampment\", or to the south labelled as the \"Githyanki Encampment\".\nFor the purpose of continuing exploration, the player can go either direction, and it doesn't matter which one is first.\nTo see what's north, see the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Illithid%20Encampment\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Illithid Encampment&lt;/a&gt; article.\nTo explore south, see the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Githyanki%20Encampment\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Githyanki Encampment&lt;/a&gt; page.\nContinue the walkthrough on this page after both areas are explored, in the sections below.\nContinuation of the walkthrough after exploration of the two encampments.\nAssuming the party has finished up with the Illithid and Githyanki encampments, they now should have in their possession the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Oil\"&gt;Blue Oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Oil\"&gt;Purple Oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Oil\"&gt;Red Oil&lt;/a&gt;, and \nthe &lt;a href=\"Flint%20and%20Tinder\"&gt;Flint and Tinder&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, they will have obtained the &lt;a href=\"Diary%20of%20Carston%27s%20Apprentice\"&gt;Diary of Carston's Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party can now address the six cold torches/braziers discovered earlier and that locked door, so go and visit these features again.\nThe six torches.\nWhen reentering the room with the torches there is a possibility of a random spawn attack - more &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fiend\"&gt;Shadow Fiend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devil%20Shade\"&gt;Devil Shade&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nTake down these horrid undead if they appear, and then inspect the torches.\nUsing the cursor click on one of these torches. A dialogue box will present that reads:\nThe party member can then select to light the torch with red, blue, or purple oil, or leave the torch for now.\nAfter a selection the torch will burst into flame, and the flame's color matches that of the oil used.\nIf the player wants to try a different colored oil, then click on the lit torch again and a dialogue box appears that says:\nSelect either \"Extinguish the flame\", or \"Leave the torch for now\". Extinguishing the flame allows igniting another or the same oil color to try on the torch.\nContinue lighting the torches and use the appropriate oil color on each torch.\nIf the six torches are all ignited, and they are done so in the correct pattern, then this action results in a brief screen shake and a text display reading:\nAt this time the oils and flint and tinder are removed from the party's inventory.\nIf the player isn't having any luck or doesn't know which colored oil is needed in a specific torch to open the locked door, then a clickable \"Spoiler\" is provided below - don't click on it if you want to keep trying to figure it out on your own, as the game intended for a first-time player.\nClick the \"Solve\" button for the correct oil color and torch pattern:\nYou may have not really noticed that this dungeon level has two locations where there are three triangular shaped formations with raised edges set into the floor.\nThere is a set of these on the eastern side of the dungeon, and a second set in the adjacent room to the east of the torches.\nThese shapes are colored. Take note of the colors, and match the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Oil\"&gt;Blue Oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Oil\"&gt;Purple Oil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Oil\"&gt;Red Oil&lt;/a&gt; to each floor pattern with the two rows of torches.\nIgnite the torches using the same color pattern as is seen on the floor formations. Doing so will unlock the door on the north side of this room.\nExplore the final room.\nAfter the torches were lit in the correct fashion, the double gated door opens on the north end of the torch chamber.\nAfter opening, no creatures or other signs of life are noticed stemming from the area. If there is anything beyond, the sheer magnitude of the sound created would have awakened the dead anyhow.\nWhen ready, enter to find out what waits beyond.\nAhead can be observed two hulking Minotaur creatures, adorned with skulls, ears, and various scalps of their victims.\nThese are &lt;a href=\"Rock\"&gt;Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garock\"&gt;Garock&lt;/a&gt;. They wield impressive, razor-sharp enchanted axes.\nBehind these two are a pair of sturdy reinforced strongboxes/safes, secured to the stone floor.\nIf either of these brutes detects a party member one or both of them will roar out a remark, and then rush forward and attack the nearest enemy.\nSeconds later, animations of summoned creatures will form in the chamber, eventually manifesting as four &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Salamander\"&gt;Ice Salamander&lt;/a&gt; foes with icy spears.\nThe two minotaur will most likely have enabled their warrior &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; powers as well.\nAssuming the party is victorious, collect any valuables from the fallen and then inspect the strongboxes - expect that they'll be locked, and possibly rigged with a trap.\nIf the party is able to open them, several treasures are found, and something unusual, identified as the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Mallet\"&gt;Crystal Mallet&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreak into Carston's Bell jar.\nWith both the Crystal Mallet and the information gleaned from the &lt;a href=\"Diary%20of%20Carston%27s%20Apprentice\"&gt;Diary of Carston's Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;, the party can now get to Carston inside the invulnerable Bell Jar with the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen ready to do so, proceed to Carston and hover the cursor over the Carston/Bell Jar and click on it. \nAs long as the party has possession of the Crystal Mallet, then a dialogue box will present and allow the party to proceed with the process of using the Crystal mallet.\nMake a selection from the choices offered in the dialogue box.\nIf for some reason the party doesn't have the Diary of Carston's Apprentice to refer to, then the player will have to guess how many times the Crystal mallet will be struck against the Bell Jar.\nAn incorrect response will allow Carston to retaliate against the party, and an offensive spell will be directed at the character who used the mallet.\nOn the other hand, if the party did read the diary, then they'll know exactly how many times the mallet should strike the Bell Jar.\nCarston will cry out during a short cut scene and then plead for mercy and blame his actions on the machine.\nThe party can let Carston go or they let him know that he'll have to pay for his evil deeds.\nSee Carston's article page for more details about this.\nRegardless which approach the party takes with Carston, the party will end up with &lt;a href=\"Carston%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Carston's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, and that contains the information needed to manipulate the controls on the machine and open the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Final%20Seal\"&gt;lower reaches&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party also has an opportunity to refer to the various &lt;a href=\"Handwritten%20Note\"&gt;Handwritten Note&lt;/a&gt; papers collected in Watcher's Keep, and if desired, see if the machine can provide some benefits to various party characters that the notes hint at. See the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt; for further information about that.\nWhen the party is finished here, they can exit and reenter this dungeon from the exterior of the keep from one of the portals or proceed to the lower reaches and the unknown with the other portal. \nSo ends the exploration of this dungeon level.\nWhen ready to do so, take the portal to the next dungeon level, marked on the map as \"To the Lower Reaches\" and linked &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Final%20Seal\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;."}

The dungeon is a maze, and therefore it isn't immediately clear to an adventuring party which way to travel, and the sequence of portals to take when travelling through this level.\nClues can be obtained that can assist with travel direction decisions - but even so, a first-time player might be confused at times, and lose track of where they have been, where to go next, and how to return to a previous area if they desire to do that. All of this is intentional. It is after all, a maze.\nSave your game often, in multiple places, in case the need arises to go back in time and redo something, or to get out of a jam. A no reload player will just have to grit it out and persevere as best as they are able.\nRecap.\nThe party has accepted &lt;a href=\"Odren\"&gt;Odren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Vigil\"&gt;Knights of the Vigil&lt;/a&gt; request for help in reinforcing the seals to keep the &lt;a href=\"Imprisoned%20One\"&gt;Imprisoned One&lt;/a&gt; confined in perpetuity by reading the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Scroll\"&gt;Ritual Scroll&lt;/a&gt; on the lowest level of the keep's reaches. The party has possession of the &lt;a href=\"Vigil%20Stone\"&gt;Vigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; which is needed to enter the keep, and to leave and return again later.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Elemental%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Elemental Level&lt;/a&gt; has been previously explored by the party, and the second portal gate has been successfully opened, allowing travel to the next lower floor, the Watcher's Keep Teleport Maze.\nPlayer's goal.\nExplore the maps, overcome obstacles, traps, enemies and find necessary items in order to complete the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Radiance\"&gt;Scepter of Radiance&lt;/a&gt; to unlock the Portal Gate and continue below to the next keep level.\nArea description.\nThe party will enter this dungeon level from the northern portal gate when travelling from the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Elemental%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Elemental Level&lt;/a&gt;. \nThis room is quite large, with expansive stone arches, polished marble columns for support of the tall ceiling, vertical banners with illuminated symbols, and unusual circular \"pits\" descending too far to see the bottom, with jutting stone obelisks rising from the depths. Truly an architectural feat.\nThere are four staircases that rise to the elevated floor. Each stairwell ends at a portal gate leading to points unknown.\nMost interesting is an inlaid design on the floor, showing the Cardinal Points for navigational compass bearings. This isometric perspective bearing is used throughout the Watcher's Keep dungeon exploration. Keep these directions/bearings in mind when interpreting the &lt;a href=\"Madman%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Madman's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, found later.\nResting in this room.\nThis room/area is safe to rest in. There are no random chances of encounters that can disturb the sleeping party.\nGameplay.\nMoving forward the party observes an unarmed male elf ahead. \nThe elf initiates a remark to the party, and assuming the party doesn't immediately slay the creature, will turn and scamper towards the southern staircase and disappear through a portal gate.\nThe elf is identified as &lt;a href=\"Tamorlin%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%29\"&gt;Elven Madman&lt;/a&gt; on the player's dialogue screen.\nThe party may move in any direction desired, N, S, E or W. They could even follow the Madman Elf's path and pursue him through the portal.\nIt may be more immersive to simply play the adventure with no foreknowledge at all, and as the party gathers clues and information through normal gameplay, forge their own path - this is the way the game developers intended a first-time player to experience the adventure.\nGallery.\nThe maps to the maze's rooms are provided below but are a \"spoiler\". Don't click on the \"See Maps\" button if you don't want to look ahead in the maze. \nThe Teleport Maze maps are provided in Area number order:"}
{"id": "55850", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55850", "title": "Watcher's Keep Teleport Maze Walkthrough", "text": "This article is a \"Walkthrough\" for the Watcher's Keep Teleport Maze, the third dungeon level in Watcher's Keep.\nAbout this walkthrough.\nThis walkthrough is a Wiki editor developed guide based on gameplay, trial-and-error experiments and other available open public sources.\nThe views and suggested path to follow are entirely optional, and not mandatory in any way to complete or enjoy the game.\nFeel free to ignore this walkthrough, and forge your own path into the maze, just like a first-time player would be expected to figure out on their own as the game the developers expected.\nThere is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to explore the maze.\nAbout the Teleport Maze.\nThere are thirteen areas included in the Teleport Maze.\nSome rooms have unexpected phenomena occurring in their spaces, such as \"Dead Magic\" zones, or even temporary \"Wild Magic\" zones. Look for the clues provided when entering these areas and keep an eye on the party character portraits for tell-tale icons displayed.\nTravel between areas is accomplished by \"gathering your party\" and entering portal gates. Most areas have multiple portals available, always situated on the north, south, east or west bearings of the various rooms. \nWhenever the party travels through a portal to another area, the party will emerge in the next room/area and be positioned at the northern side (except the last area).\nEach area has its own map, and some areas look similar (maybe on purpose). Others are unique.\nClues are provided on a path through the maze in the &lt;a href=\"Madman%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Madman's Journal&lt;/a&gt;. This journal can be found early in the dungeon if the party follows the &lt;a href=\"Tamorlin%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%29\"&gt;Elven madman&lt;/a&gt; \"Yakman\" into the portal gate he takes.\nEven with only this poetic and cryptic information available in the Journal, the Teleport Maze can be successfully explored.\nTeleport Maze game difficulty scaling.\nIn general, Bioware's introduced more refinement and consideration to adjust game difficulty than found in the portion of the trilogy.\nIn the Enhanced Edition, even more adjustments were made by Beamdog.\nThe player's game difficulty settings, such as \"Easy\", or \"Core\" are occasionally used to adjust difficulty in specific areas, or with specific creatures AI scripts.\nMore frequently the difficulty presented in encounters may look for how many characters are in a player's party (fewer can mean less difficulty). Generally, the AI scripts also look for a party's average experience level, and baseline values such as 14, 15 or 16th level are often used as thresholds for changing difficulty in encounters and scripts.\nSo, a small less experienced party can expect an easier time in this dungeon, while a full party with XP levels at least 14-16 will get the greatest challenge level, and those factors may be adjusted slightly by the player's game difficulty selection (such as \"Normal\" vs. \"Insane\"). Difficulty adjustments are made in a room/area by room/area basis.\nWalkthrough (abbreviated).\nTransition to the Teleport Maze Level.\nThe party arrives in the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Teleport%20Maze\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Teleport Maze&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Elemental%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Elemental Level&lt;/a&gt;. The floor is inlaid with \"Cardinal Points\" marked for bearings, indicating north, south, east and west - this orientation and bearing is used throughout the maze dungeon level, no matter what room/area the party explores.\nA male elf creature ahead identified as &lt;a href=\"Tamorlin\"&gt;Elven Madman&lt;/a&gt; initiates a remark. He refers to a \"Yakman\", maybe himself, in an off-kilter speech style. His speech pattern and word usage suggest a mental impairment of some type. Killing this creature in cold blood is possible here, but he might have some use. Evil parties don't have to kill everything they meet, so don't act rashly, and play smart.\nThe elf eventually heads for the southern portal gate. Follow the elf through the portal, or still go that way even if you slaughtered him. The other exits in this room can wait for now.\nStep 1 -Take the Portal south.\nGather the party and follow the mad elf into the next &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Bard%27s%20Gloves%20%28AR3011%29\"&gt;Area - AR3011&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party ventures through the portal, and a brief darkness then reappearance in a different area occurs.\nThe new area is about the same general size as the first room; however, this one is decorated differently.\nThe party enters from the northern side and will observe the Elven madman over to the east, nearby a makeshift tent and a small campfire.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Tamorlin%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%29\"&gt;Elven Madman&lt;/a&gt; page for details of the encounter.\nAfter any action with the madman, also known as \"Yakman\" are final, ensure that the party searched the area for found items.\nDepending on how things went with the elf, will determine how much information was gained from this creature.\nIt may be that very little was gleaned, or quite a bit of information was had. Even so, the party will likely find the &lt;a href=\"Madman%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Madman's Journal&lt;/a&gt;. This journal with its cryptic prose seems to offer a path to follow through the maze. Also found is the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Radiance\"&gt;Scepter of Radiance&lt;/a&gt;, and examining the object indicates that the scepter is missing three gemstones. It seems as though those will need to be found in this maze as well.\nIf the party wishes to exit to the exterior of Watcher's Keep at this time, then take the portal to the south. Otherwise, follow the Journals script, which reads:\nThis reference means the first room with the \"Cardinal Points\" bearing design on the floor, the room that \"shows the way\". The party will need to go back through the portal to the north.\nStep 2 -Take the Portal north.\nWhen ready, gather the party and leave the elven madman's camp site through the northern portal to area &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Teleport%20Maze\"&gt;AR3003&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party has returned to the very first room they entered when first arriving in the Teleport maze.\nAccording to the text in the Madman's Journal, it reads:&lt;br&gt;\n\"I stand in the room that shows the way,&lt;br&gt;and I must get out of here.&lt;br&gt;I flee towards the rising sun&lt;br&gt;to find the pillar of stone is near.\"\nThe sun rises in the east, and therefore the text wants the party is to travel through the eastern portal towards a new location.\nWhen ready, enter the eastern portal.\nStep 3 - Take the Portal east.\nThe party emerges from the portal into a new &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Balor%20%28AR3008%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. See that article link for more information.\nInitially the party will be bereft of any buffs applied, and all spell casting will fail. This also applies to the fiends soon observed within.\nThe party can choose to let the fiends kill each other or get involved. Apparently, there is some kind of Blood War going on between a lone &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt; demon and three &lt;a href=\"Cornugon\"&gt;Cornugon&lt;/a&gt; devils.\nAfter a few rounds, the \"Dead Magic\" phenomena in the room dissipates, and spells will fly again.\nAfter the fiends are dealt with, the party can inspect the pillar of stone. A chiseled inscription is available on it, and this rock can be interacted with. \nA text is displayed reading: \"WITH MY LAST BREATH, I PLACE MY GREATEST PRIZE FOREVER BEYOND THE REACH OF THE EVIL ALL AROUND ME\".\nMore about this rock is available, but it is a SPOILER, so don' view the link &lt;a href=\"Purifier\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to avoid foreknowledge, otherwise, just investigate and play this object as desired.\nAfter the room is fully explored, another view of the Madman's Journal is warranted. it reads:&lt;br&gt;\n\"I continue from there as I began&lt;br&gt;and with the demon speak.\"&lt;br&gt;\nThis cryptic message seems to imply that the party continues in the same direction as first directed, which is east. and then a demon will be encountered to which the party must speak with.\nWhen ready, enter the eastern portal towards a new location.\nStep 4 - Take the Portal east.\nThe party emerges from the portal into a new &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Tahazzar%20%28AR3012%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. See the article link for information.\nImmediately the party is challenged by a winged &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt; standing amidst a group of various &lt;a href=\"Tanar%27ri\"&gt;Tanar'ri&lt;/a&gt; demons.\nThe balor &lt;a href=\"Tahazzar\"&gt;Tahazzar&lt;/a&gt; makes a coarse statement. Depending on certain factors regarding \"Player1's\" class and alignment, the demons may turn hostile right away.\nIf not, then some further dialogue can proceed. This extra conversing may also abruptly turn hostile influenced yet again by certain \"Player1\" alignment. \nThere is also a chance to enter into a bargain with the demon, and if the party agrees to perform a job for them (with a promised reward if doing so), then the side quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Blood%20War\"&gt;The Blood War&lt;/a&gt; will register into the player's Journal.\nAgreeing to take on the job allows earning additional experience points, as well as a unique magical item that can only be obtained from completing this quest.\nRegardless of whether the party slew the demons, or agreed to take the quest, to move forward the party is to take the southern portal next.\nIf referring to the &lt;a href=\"Madman%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Madman's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, moving south is corroborated by the text that reads:&lt;br&gt;\n\"..and with the demon speak.&lt;br&gt;He bids me south to journey onward,&lt;br&gt;to run and not be weak.\"\nWhen prepared, transit the southern portal.\nStep 5 - Take the Portal south.\nThe party emerges from the portal into a new &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Baatezu%20%28AR3004%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. See the area article link for information.\nThe party hears a booming remark from a &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Fiend\"&gt;Pit Fiend&lt;/a&gt;, who is hostile and accompanied by two pairs of &lt;a href=\"Cornugon\"&gt;Cornugon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velithuu\"&gt;Velithuu&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nThe devilish fiends attack, seeking to rend the party asunder and feast on the party's flesh.\nNote that any dispellable effects present on the characters is now removed, and this area appears to be a \"dead magic\" zone. No spellcasting, whether arcane, divine or innate will work.\nEven the devils will suffer from this effect. It seems as though swords, claws and teeth will decide this fight. Additionally, there are hidden traps located in this room, that are triggered whenever a character crosses their boundaries. Although the room is a dead magic zone, the traps aren't affected by this.\nWhen the fiends are felled, a search of this area reveals no containers or treasures, other than what may have been recovered from the devil's corpses.\nAfter this battle, the party must press on. Consulting the &lt;a href=\"Madman%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Madman's Journal&lt;/a&gt; again, it alludes to the following:&lt;br&gt;\n\"South until the obelisk I find,&lt;br&gt;with runes on every face.\"\nWhen the party has caught its breath, transfer through the southern portal.\nStep 6 - Take the Portal south.\nThe party emerges from the portal into a new &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Succubus%20%28AR3006%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. See the area article link for information.\nUpon entry from the portal, they are immediately addressed by an alluring &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubus&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by armed, yet attractive &lt;a href=\"Alu-Fiend\"&gt;Alu-Fiend&lt;/a&gt; creatures. They are neutral at the moment.\nThe succubus will know if you have made a bargain with the Tanar'ri and says no harm will come to you, unless you want it, and giggles.\nVarious dialogue can occur here - ranging from heightened threats and hostilities, to inquiring about an offer. She may propose to help the party get through the maze to the portal leading out.\nThis is covered in the Area article linked above.\nIf the party takes the bargain, then all will be transported to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%E2%80%93%20Aesgareth%20%28AR3015%29\"&gt;Exit portal&lt;/a&gt; area.\nIf a fight breaks out, then a battle will ensue right here in this room. Beware some potent charm spells here, as Succubae and Alu-kin have powerful enchantments. It may be that the female demons will dimension door to another area location if the battle goes badly for them.\nAfter the melee, make preparations and continue through the southern portal.\nStep 7 - Take the Portal south.\nThe party emerges from the portal into a new &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%E2%80%93%20Ka%27rashur%20%28AR3013%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. See the area article link for information.\nThe party appears in this new room, and immediately observes a mixed group of &lt;a href=\"Baatezu\"&gt;Baatezu&lt;/a&gt; devils.\nA &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Fiend\"&gt;Pit Fiend&lt;/a&gt; identified as &lt;a href=\"Ka%27rashur\"&gt;Ka'rashur&lt;/a&gt; challenges the interloping party immediately.\nIf the party has made a deal with the Tanar'ri Balor &lt;a href=\"Tahazzar\"&gt;Tahazzar&lt;/a&gt;, then the devil will sense this, shout an alarm, and the devils turn hostile and attack (see the screenshot left).\nIf \"Player1\" (usually that is &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;) is a Paladin, or lawful good &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;Alignment&lt;/a&gt; the devil can smell taint of goodness, leading to a remark and all devils will turn hostile and attack.\nIf not, more dialogue will continue. The player may make a reply selection and could just threaten the devils leading to a fight. Or the exchange can progress, and the devil will begin to make an offer to the party. One more alignment check is performed here, and if \"Player1\" is neutral good alignment, then this sputters out and leads to a fight as well.\nOtherwise, Ka'rashur will offer a bargain for the party to bring him &lt;a href=\"Tahazzar%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Tahazzar's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for a magical reward and the baatezu's good will. If the party somehow already has this item, then dialogue options will account for this, and different words/replies are added.\nShould the party ever get in a tussle with these devils, for whatever reason, then expect a ferocious battle, with infernal spell attacks, melee blows, and missile fire.\nAssuming the party survived and triumphed, search the area for found loot and items. Ka'rashur carries a critical object needed to complete this dungeon level.\nWhen the party is ready, move through the southern portal to the next area, confirmed by the text in the &lt;a href=\"Madman%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Madman's Journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep 8 - Take the Portal south.\nThe party emerges from the portal into a new &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Obelisk%20%28AR3010%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. See the area article link for information.\nThe party transition into this new area through a portal gate that is at the northern side of this area. A short hallway connects with a circular chamber.\nInside this chamber is a central obelisk, on which are chiseled numerous runes on each facet.\nAs soon as a party member is within detection range, two unusually colored Glaberzu demons are seen - one &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28TELTAN1%29\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28TELTAN2%29\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese demons say nothing and just continue to wave their arms and pincers as if conjuring/summoning something. About a round after being spotted, a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Fire%20Elemental%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%29\"&gt;Greater Fire Elemental&lt;/a&gt; is produced by the red demon, and a &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Salamander\"&gt;Ice Salamander&lt;/a&gt; from the blue one. The Elementals will attack the closest party member they can detect.\nAs the elemental appear on the map, the area fills with roiling smoke and brimstone. It will be difficult to see through this smoke and fire, yet the demons appear to be summoning still more creatures. The next round another elemental and salamander are added to the room.\nThis cycle will continue until they've summoned five of these elementals each. It is best countered by working through the smoke and summoned creatures to reach the demons, and slay them as soon as possible, before the whole room is full of hostile creatures. Note that the demons shy away from contact and will move away from melee attackers, all the while still summoning.\nWhen each demon has reached its 5-summon quota, it switches gears and actively participates in attacking the party through melee attacks and spell casting.\nOnce the demons and summoned creatures are destroyed, examine the obelisk.\nAfter this battle, the party must press on. Consulting the &lt;a href=\"Madman%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Madman's Journal&lt;/a&gt; again, it alludes to the following:&lt;br&gt;\n\"South until the obelisk I find,&lt;br&gt;with runes on every face.&lt;br&gt;The setting sun draws me on, then,&lt;br&gt;into its fiery red embrace.\"\nThis journal passage is interpreted to mean that the party should next proceed west towards the \"setting sun\".\nStep 9 - Take the Portal west.\nThe party emerges from the portal into a new &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%E2%80%93%20Tieflings%20%28AR3005%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. See the area article link for information.\nA text displays warning the party of a tingling energy felt in this room. It is another \"Wild Magic\" zone.\nAn armed &lt;a href=\"Tiefling\"&gt;Tiefling&lt;/a&gt; group is situated towards the eastern side of the room, including two male &lt;a href=\"Tiefling%20%28Fighter%29\"&gt;battle axe wielding fighters&lt;/a&gt;, A female &lt;a href=\"Tiefling%20%28Mage%29\"&gt;Mage with a quarterstaff&lt;/a&gt;, and a female &lt;a href=\"Tiefling%20%28Thief%29\"&gt;thief with a short sword and dagger&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf any of the party are detected, the mage will shout an alarm, and the group becomes hostile, referring to the party as \"Primes!\".\nAt this time the mage also summons a Mood Dog named &lt;a href=\"Aranthis\"&gt;Aranthis&lt;/a&gt; into the fray.\nSee the various creature articles for details of their abilities and equipment. Expect some spell casting from the tieflings, as well as potion use.\nAs this area is under the \"Wild Magic\" energy phenomena, both the party and the tiefling spells will be subject to potential &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge\"&gt;Wild Surge&lt;/a&gt; effects. Spell casting can be unpredictable and potentially beneficial or harmful to either side.\nIf the party triumphs against these foes, collect any recoverable loot desired from the fallen.\nTo proceed onward with navigating the maze, refer again to the Madman's Journal. The text says \"From there I flee to the coldest north - and lay down by the tree\".\nSo, the next portal to take is actually the north one, which is incidentally the same one the party stepped through to arrive in this room. \nSuch is strange power of the teleport maze.\nStep 10 - Take the Portal north.\nThe party emerges from the portal into a new &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Cambion%20%28AR3007%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. See the area article link for information.\nA party member will observe a lone &lt;a href=\"Cambion%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%29\"&gt;Cambion&lt;/a&gt; wielding a large one-handed sword towards the eastern side of the circular central chamber.\nAs this creature can &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; it will also detect the party member and react by disappearing from view after using a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;Potion of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few moments later the party will see that a magical gating is occurring in several spots in the same room. Depending on the party's experience level, either two or four &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Knight%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep/ToB%29\"&gt;Demon Knight&lt;/a&gt; creatures will soon appear and begin hostile actions.\nAt this time the Cambion and demons will attack any party members in detection range. Expect initial spell casting such as &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; projectiles.\nWhen these creatures are destroyed, some loot is recoverable from their corpses.\nWhen prepared to move on, refer to the Madman's Journal for the recommended path.\nThe journal's text says to take the northern portal, which oddly is the same one the party transitioned through to get here.\nStep 11 - Take the Portal north.\nThe party emerges from the portal into a new &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%20%E2%80%93%20White%20Dragon%20Scales%20%28AR3014%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. See the area article link for information.\nTransiting through a portal gate leads to the party arriving in this room on the north side.\nThis room is heavily trapped. The traps cause various disabling and harmful spells to be released, to include possible instant death and petrification. The traps can be disarmed by a party member with the appropriate skill. The traps can be avoided through careful maneuver, but only if they are exposed with a &lt;a href=\"Find%20Traps\"&gt;Find Traps&lt;/a&gt; spell or the equivalent skill from a monk or thief.\nAlmost immediately a ghostly figure seen to the south addresses the party and turns hostile. This creature is labelled as the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Wraith\"&gt;Demon Wraith&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe demon immediately initiates a chain of protective spells, and a group of &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Wraith\"&gt;Slave Wraith&lt;/a&gt; creatures appear in the room. They are hostile, and based on some text displays, are unable to control themselves and must attack the party.\nThe slaves will move to engage the party in melee attacks, while the demon will most likely continue casting spells, if able. It may eventually participate in melee attacks as well.\nIf the party is able to destroy the demon, then any surviving slaves will be freed of their domination and are released from forced servitude.\nAfter the battle, examine the various remains and loot \"piles\" of previously vanquished adventurers who were defeated here, for a mix items and valuables.\nWhen the party is ready to move on, consult the Madman's Journal again. It seems that taking the north portal is the correct direction.\nStep 12 - Take the Portal north.\nThe party emerges from the portal into a new &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%E2%80%93%20Aesgareth%20%28AR3015%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;. See the area article link for information.\nThe party arrives in a cool and dim cavern, over at the western side of it.\nIf the party was transported here by the &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubus&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Succubus%20%28AR3006%29\"&gt;Area 3006&lt;/a&gt;, then the party is on the eastern side of the cavern, next to a portal gate with an Automap marker labelled as \"To the Lower Reaches\".\nRegardless of which side of the cavern the party landed on, eventually a cambion named &lt;a href=\"Aesgareth\"&gt;Aesgareth&lt;/a&gt; addresses the first character detected, and the cambion can &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt;.\nAesgareth is accompanied by four high-level &lt;a href=\"Tiefling\"&gt;tieflings&lt;/a&gt;, including a &lt;a href=\"Tiefling%20Cleric%20%28Aesgareth%29\"&gt;female cleric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiefling%20Fighter%20%28Aesgareth%29\"&gt;male fighter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiefling%20Thief%20%28Aesgareth%29\"&gt;male thief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiefling%20Mage%20%28Aesgareth%29\"&gt;female mage&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Fell%20Cat\"&gt;Fell Cat&lt;/a&gt; beasts.\nThrough dialogue with the cambion, it is possible to enter into conflict and ignite hostilities after only two or three threatening remarks. If not, then the calm and charming cambion will entice the party with an invitation to gamble with its wondrous &lt;a href=\"Deck%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;Deck of Many Things&lt;/a&gt;. \nAesgareth is very interested in games of chance and insists on a good wager with the party. In the end, the party can enter into a contest to win some powerful rewards, including an item needed to escape the Teleport Maze. \nThe cambion is also interested in leaving this place as well and would like to borrow or obtain the Holy Symbol of Helm, the scepter that the party should have in their possession from &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Bard%27s%20Gloves%20%28AR3011%29\"&gt;AR3011&lt;/a&gt;. If not, then the party will have to backtrack and get it, then return to this cavern.\nAssuming the party did not immediately spark a battle - then the player will have registered &lt;a href=\"The%20Gambling%20Cambion\"&gt;The Gambling Cambion&lt;/a&gt; quest in the Journal. See that link for details.\nOn the other hand, if the party ended up fighting and destroying Aesgareth, then the final &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20Gem\"&gt;Scepter Gem&lt;/a&gt; can be recovered, as well as the magical deck of cards, and other treasures.\nNot engaging in any gambling with Aesgareth means the party cannot attempt to win the &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Brand\"&gt;Spectral Brand&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; scroll. \nNo matter which events took place, if the party successfully obtained the final scepter gem, then the holy symbol of Helm is restored and becomes the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Radiance\"&gt;Scepter of Radiance&lt;/a&gt;. This item serves as a key to unlock the final portal to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Lower Reaches.&lt;/a&gt;\nWhen ready to do so, transition through the exit portal."}

It can go peaceably or degrade into later hostilities. \nThe party can also potentially win some gambling wagers and receive some powerful rewards. There is also an even chance of having some unpleasant curses or other price to pay when participating in the cambion's game of chance with its &lt;a href=\"Deck%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;Deck of Many Things&lt;/a&gt;. The party can choose how far it desires to gamble, and delay making a decisions as well.\nThe party could also decide to make a surprise attack on the cambion after the quest is registered. All choices have variable effects, some produce potentially more experience points than others. Some are risker than others. Gamble or don't, that's all up to the player.\nIf the party avoids all combat with the cambion, then everything the party needs to leave the maze can be achieved.\nIf the party gets into combat with this fiendish group, then they'll face the hazards of potential death at their hand. However, the rewards may be desirable from claimed and recovered loot, as well as earned experience points.\nFighting and defeating the cambion is the only way to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Deck%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;Deck of Many Things&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the cambion is killed, any surviving tiefling and Fell Cat opponents will depart the map quickly.

The architectural and decor are similar to a room likely already &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Tahazzar%20%28AR3012%29\"&gt;visited&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe slightly sunken circular symbol of helm commands attention in the center of the chamber.\nResting on this dungeon level.\nThere is a random probability of being disturbed by infernal fiends if resting here. \"You are awakened from your rest\" will be shown on the combat log, and the enemies can include a &lt;a href=\"Cornugon\"&gt;Cornugon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erinyes\"&gt;Erinyes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt; group. \nGameplay.\nThe party arrives on the northern side of this room and is immediately challenged by a Baatezu Pit Fiend &lt;a href=\"Ka%27rashur\"&gt;Ka'rashur&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party has already accepted the job from &lt;a href=\"Tahazzar\"&gt;Tahazzar&lt;/a&gt; then the devil will sense this and cry out a call to arms leading to hostilities.\nIf not, then there will be some dialogue potential with \"Player1\" (usually this is Gorion's Ward). However, if \"Player1\" is a Paladin, or of lawful good &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;Alignment&lt;/a&gt; then the devil recognizes the taint of goodness, and hostilities will ensue.\nIf those conditions aren't applicable, there will be one more check as the dialogue continues. If \"Player1\" is neutral good alignment, then the fiend will not stomach that virtue either, and fighting will start.\nAssuming none of that occurs, the player can just attack the devils as soon as an applicable dialogue selection is chosen. The party could also strike a deal with the devil and agree to perform a job for Ka'rashur. This leads to the party receiving &lt;a href=\"The%20Blood%20War\"&gt;The Blood War&lt;/a&gt; quest. See that article for more details.\nIf at any time the party is drawn into or chooses to fight the devils here, expect an intense and dangerous fight.

The floor is tiled with segmented stones. Four archways are positioned at each staircase. Hanging banners with illuminated symbols are fastened to the archway vertical pillars.\nResting on this dungeon level.\nThere is a random probability of being disturbed by infernal fiends if resting here. \"You are awakened from your rest\" will be shown on the combat log, and the enemies can include a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Fiend\"&gt;Bone Fiend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marilith\"&gt;Marilith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cornugon\"&gt;Cornugon&lt;/a&gt; group. \nGameplay.\nThe party transitioned into the northern side this area. \nWhen a party member climbs the steps up to the floor above a text will display:\nIt's possible the party has experienced this phenomenon in this maze before, when they visited the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Wild%20Magic%3F%20%28AR3009%29\"&gt;room with the quasits&lt;/a&gt;.\nAny spell casting here may be affected by a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge\"&gt;Wild Surge&lt;/a&gt;, with potentially random results occurring.\nWithin the room are seen a group of armed humanoids, with features that suggest they are &lt;a href=\"Tiefling\"&gt;Tieflings&lt;/a&gt;. If any party members are detected by the group, the &lt;a href=\"Tiefling%20%28Mage%29\"&gt;Tiefling (Mage)&lt;/a&gt; shouts an alarm, saying:\nThis area of the maze is one of the only places where being hidden or invisible/sanctuaried is effective, as these Tieflings aren't able to &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the alarm is sounded, a few moments later the group will turn hostile. The two &lt;a href=\"Tiefling%20%28Fighter%29\"&gt;Tiefling (Fighter)&lt;/a&gt; warriors will initiate their &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Whirlwind Attack&lt;/a&gt; innate ability and move forward and attack the closest detected party member. \nAssuming the mage wasn't instantly slain in some manner, then she summons &lt;a href=\"Aranthis\"&gt;Aranthis&lt;/a&gt;, a plane travelling version of a Moon dog to join the Tieflings. \nAlso, a &lt;a href=\"Tiefling%20%28Thief%29\"&gt;Tiefling (Thief)&lt;/a&gt; will quaff a potion and turn invisible, and then advance to attack, possibly with a &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; opportunity.\nUnless disrupted, the mage will attempt to self-protect with a few buffs, and then begin trying some offensive spell options at eligible targets. This initial preparatory action might go awry with a Wild Surge, or it might not.\nThe Moon dog may also be able to turn Improved Invisible, and initiate a &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; as well. The dog has a biting attack.\nBe aware that the Tiefling magic might Wild Surge just like the party's spells could.

It is possible that any movement forward could kill one or more party members. Taking control of the party and micromanaging their movement, perhaps disabling any automatic melee attacking scripts, and similar action could help prevent this. Having a thief that can detect and disarm traps is useful.\nCasting the &lt;a href=\"Find%20Traps\"&gt;Find Traps&lt;/a&gt; spell can be a quick way to at least know where they are.\nUpon entry, the party will observe a creature with an undead appearance positioned further south. The creature is a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Wraith\"&gt;Demon Wraith&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe demon makes an opening remark in a hollow and chilling voice, saying:\nThis triggers the demon's initial protective spell casting chain and will also cause the appearance of several hostile &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Wraith\"&gt;Slave Wraith&lt;/a&gt; creatures in the chamber.\nThe slaves will occasionally show various text displays that indicate they can't help themselves from attacking and are being forced to obey the demon.\nThe slaves will move toward the closest party member they can detect (they also &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt;) and will attack in melee touch weapon range.\nSpell casting will continue from the demon, and it will try and get a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; spell completed, and then place a few symbol spells at the nearest party member, or perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter that, the demon will advance and melee attack. If the party's XP levels are greater than 16, it will also cast &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Spray\"&gt;Prismatic Spray&lt;/a&gt;, repeatedly until it is unable to, or destroyed.\nIf any slave wraiths are still viable when the demon is destroyed, every surviving slave awards . The slaves give thanks for releasing them from their bondage.\nTreasure.\nThere are a number of \"piles\" of loot that can be examined and plundered for treasure in this area. These are ostensibly from fallen adventurers destroyed by the Demon Wraith.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod places a rare component, a \"Mithral alloy\", in one of the piles of loot in this room.

However, Baldur's Gate II, as well as the Enhanced Editions of both games, have an updated proficiency system, so the updated proficiency system is widely used to categorize weapons, instead of the eight categories from Baldur's Gate. For a complete table and explanation, see the main &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;Weapon Proficiency&lt;/a&gt; article.\n&lt;a href=\"Axe\"&gt;Axes&lt;/a&gt; remain unchanged, including both &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe\"&gt;Battle Axes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Axes\"&gt;Throwing Axes&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Blunt%20Weapons\"&gt;Blunt Weapons&lt;/a&gt; were divided into its constituent weapon types: \n&lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;Bow Weapons&lt;/a&gt; were divided into:\n&lt;a href=\"Large%20Swords\"&gt;Large Swords&lt;/a&gt; were divided into:\n&lt;a href=\"Missile%20Weapons\"&gt;Missile Weapons&lt;/a&gt; were divided into:\n&lt;a href=\"Small%20Swords\"&gt;Small Swords&lt;/a&gt; were divided into:\n&lt;a href=\"Spears\"&gt;Spears&lt;/a&gt; remain, but &lt;a href=\"Halberds\"&gt;Halberds&lt;/a&gt; are no longer included, becoming their own proficiency.\n&lt;a href=\"Spiked%20Weapons\"&gt;Spiked Weapons&lt;/a&gt; is renamed to &lt;a href=\"Flails\"&gt;Flails&lt;/a&gt;, but functionally remains the same, still including &lt;a href=\"Morning%20Stars\"&gt;Morning Stars.&lt;/a&gt; The new category is often referred to as Flails &amp; Morning Stars, for clarity.\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"Katana\"&gt;Katana&lt;/a&gt; proficiency is present in every version after the original Baldur's Gate."}

Most non-warrior &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Class%20group\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; may become proficient (one proficiency slot) in their weapon array; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s can specialize (two slots), and only &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s are able to achieve grand mastery (all five slots).\nCertain non-&lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; might also be proficient in fighting with their specific weapons, or even master these.\nExamination of the unmodded basic and EE game files indicate that many, but certainly not all, weapon wielding opponents in the game lack individual assigned weapon proficiencies or fighting style points that reflect the changes made to Weapon Proficiency assignment in BG2 SoA and the EE. However, many of these creatures retain the original weapon proficiencies that are grouped together, such as \"Large Swords\", \"Blunt Weapons\" or \"Missile Weapons\". These older or original weapon proficiencies will still provide bonuses in &lt;a href=\"Infinity%20Engine\"&gt;Infinity Engine&lt;/a&gt; game versions, including EE. They may not be visible (on the character record) and are \"behind the scenes\" values. In the popular &lt;a href=\"Save%20Editors\"&gt;Save Editors&lt;/a&gt; tool, EE Keeper, these values are titled \"Legacy Proficiencies\" and are listed on the \"Miscellaneous\" Tab.\nDue to previous editing and decisions on this Wiki, a number of creature articles do not actually calculate the final adjusted To Hit, Damage, Weapon Speed Factor and Attacks per round that are modified by Weapon Proficiency. Just be aware that some of these reported values in the info boxes may be slightly off regarding to hit values, damage, weapon speed factors, damage bonuses and final attacks per round - unless specifically noted.\nSkill lists.\n\"Baldur's Gate\" &amp; \"Tales of the Sword Coast\".\nThe original \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" groups certain, \"similar\" weapons together and offers only a few categories of weapon proficiencies: eight in number.\nThis makes characters more versatile, and they can quickly switch to a different weapon of the same category \u2013 e.g. if the one used suddenly &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Weapon\"&gt;breaks&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 without having to deal with penalties during combat.\n\"Icewind Dale\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Dale\"&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/a&gt;\", a \"sister\" game of \"Baldur's Gate\", which was developed and published between the &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; and the part of the &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt; saga, has a more specialized system of weapon proficiencies, splitting the \"Baldur's Gate I\" categories up into many more single weapon types, and keeping only very few weapons within one category.\n&lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;Class&lt;/a&gt; restrictions are also handled slightly different from the \"Baldur's Gate\" games:\n\"Baldur's Gate II\" &amp; \"Enhanced Editions\".\n' further cuts down the weapon proficiencies and binds most of them to a single weapon, following even closer the underlying ' ruleset, documented e.g. in the \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3APlayer%27s%20Handbook%202nd%20edition\"&gt;Player's Handbook&lt;/a&gt;\". Remaining exceptions are:\nThese expansions of the weapon proficiency system were carried over into and are still valid for the \"Enhanced Editions\" of the , with slight spelling changes.\nTechnical note: The old &lt;a href=\"%23Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%26amp%3B%20Tales%20of%20the%20Sword%20Coast\"&gt;\"Baldur's Gate\" &amp; \"Tales of the Sword Coast\"&lt;/a&gt; proficiencies are still existent and active in the game files of the newer games. &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;Creatures&lt;/a&gt; that haven't the new proficiencies assigned to their code (e.g. ones that were imported into \"Shadows of Amn\" from \"Baldur's Gate\" or almost any in the \"\") do benefit from the old system's bonuses.\nFighting Styles.\nIntroduced in \"Baldur's Gate II\" &amp; \"Enhanced Editions\", these melee proficiencies apply to weapon/shield configurations instead of classes of weapons. They do not apply to ranged weapons. There are a few class restrictions. &lt;a href=\"Wizards\"&gt;Wizards&lt;/a&gt; are not eligible for any fighting styles.\nTwo-Handed Weapon Style.\nProficiency points give the following bonuses when fighting with a two-handed melee weapon.\n&lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wizards\"&gt;Wizards&lt;/a&gt; are not eligible for this style.\nAll two-handed weapons such as spear, quarterstaff, halberd, and great sword will benefit from pips placed in this fighting style.\nSword and Shield Style.\nProficiency points give the following bonuses when fighting with a one-handed melee weapon and a shield:\n&lt;a href=\"Kensai\"&gt;Kensai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wizards\"&gt;Wizards&lt;/a&gt; are not eligible for this style (they can't use shields).\nSingle Weapon Style.\nProficiency points give the following bonuses when fighting with a one-handed melee weapon without a shield:\n&lt;a href=\"Wizards\"&gt;Wizards&lt;/a&gt; are not eligible for this style.\nTwo-Weapon Style.\nEquipping a 2nd weapon instead of a shield (without spending any proficiency points) yields an extra attack per round with this weapon, at the cost of -4 penalty to attack rolls with the main weapon and -8 with the off-hand weapon. Spending proficiency points reduces these penalties as follows:\n&lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wizards\"&gt;Wizards&lt;/a&gt; are not eligible for this style.\nAdditional considerations:\nSlots gained with level by class group (Progression by leveling up).\nGrowth rate differs based on &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Class%20group\"&gt;class group&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Multi-class\"&gt;Multi-class&lt;/a&gt;es use only the class of the fastest progression. &lt;a href=\"Dual-class\"&gt;Dual-class&lt;/a&gt;es only gain slots from the current active class. Note that all rangers automatically start specialized in Two-Weapon Style. The numbers in this chart for that class are what can be chosen by the player, with the absolute total being two higher. Some classes will reach their\u00a0maximum proficiency before their highest level due to limited weapon selection.\nAllowed slots investments by class kit.\nMax slots per weapon differs based on &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Class%20kits\"&gt;class kit&lt;/a&gt;. Fighter, ranger multi-classes\u00a0may specialize (2 slots), other combinations may only be proficient (1 slot); dual-classes gives the better of the two caps, with fighter dualing are allowed up to 5 slots (both when dualing from and to fighter), but beware of risking wasting and permanently losing any duplicate slot expenditure, as the slots spent are not combined, only chosen the better value if you take the same proficiency in both classes, so keep track of what you have spent. Fighting styles have different investment values.\nAt level 1 on character creation, fighter classes cannot allocate more than 2 slots per weapon type or style.\nAchievements.\nIncreasing the proficiency with any &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; to five points, becoming a \"Grand Master\", will unlock an &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; in ' and '.\nBugs related to weapon proficiency.\nThe non-proficiency penalty for Shadowdancers and Mage-Thieves is incorrect. Reference (clswpbon.2da).\nAs of BG2EE 2.6, Natural weapons (claws, bites, etc.) and magically created weapons (e.g. Chill Touch) should not benefit from weapon style proficencies.

It can also be used to cover a retreat, especially against hasted creatures. Another useful tactic is to cast web to prevent interruption of long casting spells like &lt;a href=\"Insect%20Plague\"&gt;Insect Plague&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the receiving end, the best defense is prevention (see &lt;a href=\"Webbed\"&gt;the status effect&lt;/a&gt; for details).

The Web spell covers a maximum area of about 20 feet in radius. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. Creatures that make a successful saving throw vs. breath can move at half speed through the area but must make additional saving throws each round they remain in the area of effect. A failed saving throw means the creature is stuck in the webs, unable to move for that round.

Whenever they cast a memorized spell, there is 5% chance (casting\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nahal%27s%20Reckless%20Dweomer\"&gt;Nahal's Reckless Dweomer&lt;/a&gt; pushes the chance to 100%) of a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge\"&gt;Wild Surge&lt;/a&gt;, which can have beneficial or detrimental side effects. Wild Mages also have a -5 to +5 adjust range to their levels every time they cast a spell. The growth of most spells caps at level 20, but higher caster level does make them harder to &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Specialist Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, they depend on spells in battles, learn magic from scrolls, and cast spells from a wizard spellbook. Wild Mages receive 1 additional spell in every spell level, but unlike Specialists, they do not have an opposing spell school and can cast spells from all 8 schools of magic.\nIn order for mages to cast a spell, first they need to successfully scribe a mage spell scroll into their spell book (scroll lost in process regardless of success or failure), in which they must prepare the spell by putting it into an empty spell slot, then they have to rest to get the spell ready.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"Humans\"&gt;Humans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;Half-Elves&lt;/a&gt; may become Wild Mages. Wild mages cannot &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual class&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbility scores table.\nFor the information of this table, the human race was used, because humans don't have any bonuses to the primary abilities and act as a 'neutral'. For all other races, these numbers might be slightly different.\nWild Mage Spellbook.\nWild Mages are able to cast spells from the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Wizard Spellbook&lt;/a&gt; and learn spells from scrolls. They start with 3 additional spells related to wild magic: &lt;a href=\"Nahal%27s%20Reckless%20Dweomer\"&gt;Nahal's Reckless Dweomer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Shield\"&gt;Chaos Shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Chaos%20Shield\"&gt;Improved Chaos Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\u00a0\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nMages can access to level 10 spells, which are added to the level 9 wizard spellbook after they have been chosen. These spells are:\nCaster level modification.\nWhen a Wild Mage casts a spell, their caster level may be increased or lowered by a random amount. The combat log will display a message such as \"\" when that happens.\nEach spell is affected in its own way by the caster level, but typically duration of effects scale upwards, and it isn't rare that damage does too. Scaling almost always caps at level 20, and it doesn't necessarily increase smoothly \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, for example, doesn't grow at all until it suddenly gains a whole new arrow with full damage at levels 10, 15 and 20. Quite a few spells only scale starting from a certain level, like &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;: Since it scales from level 16 to 20, even if a level 16 Wild Mage gets a -5 modifier when trying to cast it, the damage dealt will be 16d8, not 11d8. And with a +5 modifier, the damage will be 20d8, not 21d8.\nFinally, the modifier is tame at low levels, such that a level 1 Wild Mage would not be able to cast a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; with 3 projectiles \u2013 a feat only available to mages level 5 and above. See below each possible value that the caster level modifier can take, along with its associated odds.\nKit recommended items.\nThese are usable by &lt;a href=\"Mages\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorcerers\"&gt;Sorcerers&lt;/a&gt; (so are not kit exclusive equipments), but are highly recommended for Wild Mages, while nearly useless for other wizards.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"The%20Tweaks%20Anthology\"&gt;Tweaks Anthology mod&lt;/a&gt; allows human Wild Mages to dual class."}

It will also happen when any spell is cast in an area affected by wild magic (like &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Wild%20Magic%3F%20%28AR3009%29\"&gt;some levels of Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Forest\"&gt;Wild Forest&lt;/a&gt;). When a wild surge occurs, a 100-faced die is rolled and the mage's &lt;a href=\"%23wild_surge_bonus\"&gt;wild surge bonus&lt;/a&gt; is added to it. The result is compared to &lt;a href=\"%23Wild_surge_table\"&gt;a table with rows numbered 1 to 101&lt;/a&gt;. If it matches one of the rows, the effect from that row replaces the spell that the mage was trying to cast. Otherwise the desired spell is cast properly and not replaced.\nLore.\nWild Magic is a young school of magic born after the &lt;a href=\"Time%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Time of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, as scholars started to study the wild magic zones created from the descent of so many gods on &lt;a href=\"Toril\"&gt;Toril&lt;/a&gt;. In such places, the Weave, a \"fabric\" that serves as a convenient interface letting casters more easily and more safely manipulate raw magic, has become damaged or distorted. Spells cast through the Weave in such a state behave differently, sometimes becoming more potent, sometimes being more difficult to aim as desired, or sometimes producing entirely unpredictable results.\nSoon enough, &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Mage\"&gt;Wild Mage&lt;/a&gt;s became able to reproduce this phenomenon in areas where the Weave is intact. Since it involves a more direct manipulation of raw magic, it is harder not to make mistakes, mistakes don't just result in spell failure, and there seems to be an irreducible part of chaos to the process. As the mage shapes magical energy into the desired spell, a mistake or that irreducible part of chaos may get in the way and force them to release the raw energy in a sudden surge called \"wild surge\".\nAs a way to lift the limitations on spellcasting that go in hand in hand with a full reliance on the Weave, Wild Magic is a promising school. Research focused on improving raw magic manipulation and reducing risk enabled the creation of items such as the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Goodman%20Hayes\"&gt;Robe of Goodman Hayes&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Thayan%20Circlet\"&gt;Thayan Circlet&lt;/a&gt;, and spells such as &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Shield\"&gt;Chaos Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Chaos%20Shield\"&gt;Improved Chaos Shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nahal%27s%20Reckless%20Dweomer\"&gt;Nahal's Reckless Dweomer&lt;/a&gt;.\nNahal's Reckless Dweomer.\nNote: Casting this spell means a wild surge \"will\" occur, odds are not 5% but 100%.\nMechanics.\nWhenever a wild surge occurs, a D100 is rolled and the caster's wild surge bonus is added to it. If the result matches the ID of one of the 101 rows in the &lt;a href=\"%23Wild_surge_table\"&gt;wild surge table&lt;/a&gt;, the effect in that row will replace the spell that the mage wanted to cast. If the result matches no row, typically because it is greater than 101, the mage will successfully cast the spell they wanted to in the way they wanted to.\nAll creatures have a wild surge bonus of 0, which can be modified by:\nFor the most part, it can be considered that every point of wild surge bonus translates to an increase of 1 percentage point in the odds to cast the desired spell in the desired way. As the bonus increases, its other effect is to decrease the proportion of bad surges in the remaining pool of \"incorrect spells\". This is because the density of potentially troublesome surges is higher in the lower rows of the surge table, and those rows are eliminated first from the realm of possibilities as the wild surge bonus grows.\nConfusing aspects.\nWild surges can be confusing at first, so it can be useful to be aware the following:\nTargeting.\nMost of the 101 wild surges described in the &lt;a href=\"%23Wild%20surge%20table\"&gt;surge table&lt;/a&gt; below entirely replace the spell that the Wild Mage was trying to cast. But there is one element that remains: the target.\nA spell target can either be a creature or container, or a point on the ground. Single-target spells such as &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt; expect the former type, whereas &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23A\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; spells like &lt;a href=\"Grease\"&gt;Grease&lt;/a&gt; expect the latter type. A sub-type of single-target spells expects that the target creature be the self -- the caster -- like &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a Wild Surge occurs and replaces the desired spell, the spell target may not be appropriate to the surge spell selected by the D100. Surges use the following rules to address that concern.\nWild surge effects.\nLegend.\nIn the surge table, the \"Block or remove\" column uses shorthand icons to convey ways to either block or remove all of a surge spell's effects. The following icons mean that their associated spell(s) are effective against a surge:\nNotes to help read the other columns:\nTips.\nSaving throws.\nThe Wild Mage has a vested interest in improving their &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt; vs Spell as quickly as possible, especially in \"Baldur's Gate I\". A foolproof value for save vs Spell is -4, but a value of 1 coupled with a &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt; spell memorized is great.\nAs an &lt;a href=\"evil\"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt;-aligned character, the Wild Mage gets a +2 save bonus against their own surges with &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil\"&gt;Protection From Evil&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore \"Baldur's Gate I\"'s &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Four\"&gt;Chapter Four&lt;/a&gt;, the ways to improve saving throws vs Spell are &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Spell%20Warding\"&gt;Amulet of Spell Warding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Claw%20of%20Kazgaroth\"&gt;The Claw of Kazgaroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Evil%20Archmagi\"&gt;Robe of the Evil Archmagi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Princes\"&gt;Ring of the Princes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Protection%20%2B1\"&gt;Cloak of Protection +1&lt;/a&gt;, Protection From Evil, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chant\"&gt;Chant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aid\"&gt;Aid&lt;/a&gt;, and consumables &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Stone%20Form\"&gt;Potion of Stone Form&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Kazgaroth\"&gt;The Horn of Kazgaroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Shielding\"&gt;Potion of Magic Shielding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt; could also be found as a random drop.\nWithout reliance on consumables, a +11 bonus can be expected before Chapter Four, leading to a save vs Spell of 1 at level 5 and below, and of -1 at level 6+. This doesn't account for Spirit Armor and Improved Invisibility (high level spells) or Blur (random drop), but does rely on a +2 bonus from Chant and Aid and on the Wild Mage being evil. \nSpell scrolls.\nHunt for high level spell scrolls as early as possible, and keep an eye out for &lt;a href=\"random%20treasure\"&gt;random treasure&lt;/a&gt;s. What a random treasure will be is determined only once, either upon first entry into the area hosting the creature or container, or when a creature is first spawned.\nIn \"Baldur's Gate I\", a lot of useful spells are sold in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Hedge%20Estate\"&gt;High Hedge Estate&lt;/a&gt;, others can be stolen from &lt;a href=\"Shandalar\"&gt;Shandalar&lt;/a&gt;, Improved Invisibility is at &lt;a href=\"Ulgoth%27s%20Beard%20Inn\"&gt;Ulgoth's Beard Inn&lt;/a&gt;, and there are many great ones in containers of the &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20One%29\"&gt;labyrinth's 1st level&lt;/a&gt; under Durlag's tower. Domination and Polymorph Self are in the 2nd level, more difficult to reach early on.\nFor random loot, valuable scrolls may be pickpocketed or dropped by all kinds of , , , , , &lt;a href=\"Ankheg\"&gt;Ankheg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Amnian%20Soldier%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;Amnian Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s in Nashkel, or the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s from the 1st level of Durlag's labyrinth. Containers don't have random loot. \nIn \"Baldur's Gate II\", absurdly high level spells can be found as random loot in containers and on creatures right from the start of the game. &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizards&lt;/a&gt; are good target practise, but many containers in Athkatla qualify.\nPlay style.\nAt low level, it is relatively safe to cast single target spells at enemies that are distant enough to cover the radius of a standard AoE (i.e. a Fireball's). That is because \"Creature\" spells cannot be &lt;a href=\"%23Targeting\"&gt;retargeted&lt;/a&gt; unless it's a Self surge or &lt;a href=\"%2348\"&gt;#48 \"Oops, wrong target\"&lt;/a&gt;. \"Point\" spells, on the other hand, can get retargeted by both Self and Creature surges.\nBring statistics to your side.\nIn \"Baldur's Gate I\", &lt;a href=\"Evermemory\"&gt;Evermemory&lt;/a&gt; doubles level 1 spells. While the odds for a single NRD to cast the desired spell are low, it is very likely to happen when all NRDs are unleashed at once. If the nature of the desired spell is such that it could end the fight on its own, then the battle is very likely to be won in a single quick barrage of NRDs.\nKeep in mind play style and saving throw advice to avoid risks.\nTechnical details on Oops, wrong spell.\nAs seen in the table, surge &lt;a href=\"%2365\"&gt;#65&lt;/a&gt; replaces the desired spell with another in a certain pool of candidates. But what does that pool contain? The game takes the desired spell's file name, usually in the form \"codice_3\" \u2014 the codice_4 being digits, and replaces the last two digits with an integer randomly selected between 00 and 10. For example, if a player casts the level 9 spell &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Immunity\"&gt;Absolute Immunity&lt;/a&gt; (codice_5) and gets this surge, the resulting spell could be &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt; (codice_6), &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt; (codice_7), &lt;a href=\"Gate%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Gate&lt;/a&gt; (codice_8), Absolute Immunity (codice_5), &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Contingency\"&gt;Chain Contingency&lt;/a&gt; (codice_10), &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; (codice_11) or &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; (codice_12).\nThat's, at least, how it goes with regular &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; spells whose file names start in codice_13 or codice_14. There seems to be some kind of slightly different system when it comes to some (most of them result in codice_15 spells), (like the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon%20Monk\"&gt;Dark Moon Monk&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Fist\"&gt;Frozen Fist&lt;/a&gt;, some of them result codice_16 spells) or even outlier cases such as wishes cast by the genie from the level 9 spell &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; (something entirely different).\nIf the randomly selected number corresponds to no spell or the target is invalid, then no spell will be cast. For example, the level 9 spell &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20Swarm\"&gt;Meteor Swarm&lt;/a&gt; never produces any result, as the spells from the pool listed above fail in the same way that &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge%2329\"&gt;\"Invisible #29\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge%2361\"&gt;\"Held #61\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge%2398\"&gt;\"Color change #98\"&lt;/a&gt; do when inheriting a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge%23Targeting\"&gt;Point target&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll of this also means that if the game is modded, then the \"Oops, wrong spell\" surge can cast spells installed by mods if they fit the criteria. For example, &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; adds codice_17 with the file name codice_18, making it a valid candidate for a \"wrong\" spell.\nSome creatures, abilities and spells may replace the desired spell with effects that constitute a bug or exploit, e.g. permanently granting Blackguard passive abilities, summoning Kangaxx or granting the Slayer ability. See the Wild Surge: Oops, Wrong Spell entry on the &lt;a href=\"Exploits\"&gt;Exploits&lt;/a&gt; page."}

The scripted targeting will fire over a selected target area, which is typically right over the center of the dragon. and all creatures in the area of effect (except for the caster and caster allies) are subject to the effects. The buffeting force will implement a &lt;a href=\"Wing%20buffet\"&gt;Wing buffet&lt;/a&gt; effect. See the effect page for additional details.\nWhen a dragon deploys a Wing Buffet, several actions will occur to any enemies in the effect range (most likely this will be the party and allies/summoned helpers) as follows: \nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises this innate spell, and removes the secondary type \"Magic attack\", changing it to \"None\". \nThis is in-line with the mod's philosophy of ensuring dragon breath attacks and wing buffeting are non-magical, with no affiliation to any school of magic or secondary type classification.\nThe practical result of this is that some weird spell protection interactions are avoided, and the player can't just wear the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt; and rebuff many dragon breath attacks with impunity."}

It is sometimes referred to as 'Knockback\".\nDescription.\nIn general, the effect can knock away any creature not immune to it. The Opcode can define how fast the affected creature slides or is knocked back, what direction the affected creature moves in relation to the Wing Buffet source, and the distance the affected creature will travel by the force of the wing buffet, in feet. The Wing buffet may have a saving throw, or not, and be unaffected or affected by magic resistance depending on the source. Opcode 235 is used by Dragons who do an actual \"Wing Buffet\", the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Ram\"&gt;Ring of the Ram&lt;/a&gt;, some arcane and divine spells and innate ability spells and other sources.\nA Dragon's wing buffet.\nAn actual Wing Buffet from a Dragon is implemented using an innate spell effect labelled as SPIN695.SPL. This is a spell effect that has no assigned school or type. It has a spell power level of 0 (zero). The Dragon Wing Buffet has a 30' range, only affects enemies of the caster (Dragon), and casts with a speed of 1. The Wing buffet effects are:\n- A sound effect is played\n- An Opcode 235 Wing Buffet is applied to any creature in the AOE - For a duration of 2 seconds the creature will move up to 30 feet away from the source of the buffet. There is no saving throw or resistance.\n- The force of the Wing Buffet inflicts 1d8 +12 crushing damage, with no saving throw or magic resistance applicable.\n- an Opcode 39 \"unconsciousness\" effect lasting 3 seconds is applied to the creature. A saving throw vs. spell with a -10 penalty negates. Magic resistance does not affect the unconsciousness, nor do Elven racial \"Sleep\" resistances. While unconscious, further damage to the creature will not wake it up.\n- An Opcode 273 \"Zone of Sweet Air\" effect takes place, removing any projectiles coded in the applicable .2DA file. This means that most clouds and fogs will be dispersed immediately from the map. Examples include, stinking cloud, cloud kill, death fog, writhing fog and others.\nThe game gives some creatures immunity to Opcode 235, if they are large, like some golems , Dragons and the like.\nBugs/Mechanics errors.\nAs of BG2EE 2.6, Wing buffet/knockback effects are not being applied to all creatures who should be affected.\nReference: (cdwb220.eff, cdwb225.eff, cdwb230.eff, cdwb3100.eff, cdwb470.eff, spcl911b.spl, spin547.spl, spin643.spl, spin658.spl, spin695.spl, spin854.spl, spin896.spl, spwi818.spl, spwi918.spl, spwi922.spl, spwi925.spl, spwish27.spl, spyanc01.spl)"}

Winski then details the true purpose of Sarevok's plans and states that he always expected Sarevok to cast him aside in the end.\nDialogue.\n\"*cough* Well, well, I thought it would be you. Quite the little family reunion shaping up now, isn't it? I knew you would follow; you two are of the same blood. You must take the fight to him lest he strike you down at his leisure. Not that it will matter; you have already beaten him. His plans are in ruins, and his allies are fleeing in droves. Such glorious goals they were, though none understood the true desire behind them. None but me, that is. Unfortunately, I am now expendable, but I expected no less.\"\nWhat was your role in this? Why did you help him if you knew you were to be cast aside?\n\"What was my role? I was Sarevok's mentor and tutored him in the blackest of rituals. If he had succeeded, there is no doubt I would be among the dead, but my name would live on in his wake. There are things beyond death if you die in the right fashion, and how could there not be a place in history for the architect that shaped the actions of the ascending Lord of Murder? You would not understand; you were born to affect the realms. The rest of us must carve our own place by whatever means necessary.\"\nWhat did he hope to gain by all of this? He must have known that inciting war with Amn would eventually expose him!\n\"You must know his plan by now. You have practically followed his every move. Likely you are driven by the same desires as well, though you have channeled them in a different fashion. No, war with Amn was not his true goal; Sarevok is no profiteer. The slaughter was all he wanted, with enough lives lost in the initial battles to ignite the fire in his own divine blood. He thought death on the appropriate scale would cause him to ascend. Perhaps he would have, but who can really say? If you have the arrogance of a god and can kill like a god, who's to say you are not a god?\"\nI will prove he is not! Where has he gone to hide?\n\"Oh, Sarevok is not intent on hiding. You have stripped him of any pretense; there is no longer any point in him maintaining his respectable veneer. Only the most fanatical or fearful of his allies stand by him now. He will gather what resources he can and move on. Of course he knows that you must come to confront him and that it is to his advantage to choose the battleground. There is an altar in the Undercity; it was to be where the ritual would take place, but now serves as his last refuge. If you do not go to him, he will strike at you at his leisure.\"\nI would kill you, but perhaps the anonymity you have attained is punishment enough. Get out of my sight!\n\"\"I am dead regardless. Sarevok left me here for my \"failure\" earlier. He wished me to dispatch the Grand Dukes rather than effect his escape as I did. He would not consider failing as a possibility: a common weakness in those that would be gods. He will come for me when he realizes his first strike did not kill me. Do as you will: I am resigned to my fate whether it comes now or later.\"\nHis plans are in shambles. You will live to be accountable for your part in this!\n\"Your \"charity\" is admirable. You have definitely taken a separate path than Sarevok, though I wonder if it shall truly matter in the end. Leave me, I am no longer a threat to you or anyone. I'm just going to rest here a while.\"\"\nAt the conclusion of the dialogue the following &lt;a href=\"Journal\"&gt;Journal&lt;/a&gt; entry is placed in the quest section under the title \"Tandem in Extremis\":"}

Afterwards, When the party leaves and moves from the Bridge District to another area, the rest of her introduction will continue in a \"between\" area.

She is standing in the street between the &lt;a href=\"Blushing%20Mermaid\"&gt;Blushing Mermaid&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Splurging%20Sturgeon\"&gt;Splurging Sturgeon&lt;/a&gt; during the daytime.

With a pickpocket skill of 70 or so the book will soon be in the right hands.\nCompletion and outcomes.\nOnce the party has the book they must return it to Brielbara at the Splurging Sturgeon to receive their reward. When they give her the Curse Book she thanks them profusely but will not pay them until prompted. If the player asks for payment she will give them the promised along with 1000 XP and one &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; point. If the player says that she'll just owe them a favor the party receives only the 1000 XP and Reputation point as a reward.\nA charming Yago.\nIf Yago is charmed he has this to say:"}

Drinks and food are available if renting some employee's time, but no lodging is available for party resting purposes. \nDescription.\nThis single-level structure with a flat roof (that is actually part of the terraced walkway above). It has one doorway to enter and exit. The internal layout for the Brothel entrance is just one room, furnished with a tavern style bar or counter, some shelving, a wood fired stove and tables and chairs. There is locked doorway that leads to the &lt;a href=\"Cellar%20of%20Brothel\"&gt;Brothel cellar&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nBefore attempting to enter the Brothel, it is advised and necessary to gain information from &lt;a href=\"Sanik\"&gt;Sanik&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Vulgar%20Monkey\"&gt;The Vulgar Monkey&lt;/a&gt; Inn - and only then visit the Brothel.

Only after that point will it make more sense to visit this place. Without the clues given, the party will not have a cohesive set of goals to further the adventure. And frankly, without Sanik's plot global setting correctly, a certain door cannot be opened.\nOnce the information from Sanik has been obtained, go ahead and visit the Brothel when desired. Speak with a Courtesan out front. Upon entry the group will trigger a greeting from the Brothel's &lt;a href=\"Brothel%20Front%20%28greeter/guard%29\"&gt;Greeter/Guard&lt;/a&gt;.

Follow this &lt;a href=\"Getting%20inside%20the%20asylum\"&gt;link page&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nIf certain conditions are triggered or if the greeter catches you in a lie, or you attack him, then some Pirate Guards appear in the room to assist the frontman, and a battle will ensue.\nIf the Frontman is killed then the party can loot the &lt;a href=\"Guild%20House%20Key\"&gt;Guild House Key&lt;/a&gt;, which allows entry into the Brothel's Cellar.\nContainers.\nNone in this area."}

Not much chance of this is probable, as the party, if paying attention can probably disrupt and destroy this relatively weak foe very quickly.\nAt the outset of hostilities, an alarmscript will summon in several other pirate fighters to assist in the brothels defense. they are melee fighters and aren't really special enough to have their own InfoBox. They attack with their scimitars and will be a relatively minor threat. Perhaps a party member might get a slight wound before being they are overwhelmed.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod assigns a new default SCS Fighter/Mage AI to the frontman, as well as slightly revised weapon proficiencies for Halberd use. \nAs is normally the case with this mod installed, the creature will benefit from a rapid series of instantly applied buffs, making this F/M tougher at the outset of battle. Precast spells include &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Armor\"&gt;Ghost Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;.

A &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; is also prepared and is scripted to fire during the fight."}

The purpose of the spell is to apply &lt;a href=\"Acid%20damage\"&gt;Acid damage&lt;/a&gt; in an Area of Effect to the dragon's enemies.\nEffects.\nThe ability is uninterruptible and takes little time to deploy. The scripted targeting will fire over a selected target and area surrounding it.\nThis is typically within the creature's sight detection range. \nAll creatures in the area of effect are subject to the effects. Rather than a cone of acid spreading forth from the dragon, this projectile will burst from the central aiming point/target and spread in a ring of corrosive destruction. \nWhen a dragon deploys an acid dragon breath, a blast explodes upon enemies within the AoE who are then subjected to 24d6 &lt;a href=\"Acid%20damage\"&gt;Acid damage&lt;/a&gt;. A quick reaction &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; vs Breath will apply, and a successful save will reduce the damage by half.

At some point in its history, Brynnlaw was taken over by pirates and quickly became a pirate town. &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious \"asylum\", is located on the north side of the island, and is ostensibly operated by the &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizards&lt;/a&gt; order.\nDescription.\nOnce a small sea trading town offering a port haven from storms and a stop for fishermen, sea merchants to restock provisions, crew rest and some basic services - the town has since been forcefully taken over by pirates. The local townsfolk have been upended, some murdered, and displaced by the rule of the Pirate Lord. The town has some kind of relationship with the Spellhold asylum, and they coexist with an unknown arrangement. Brynnlaw is outside the sphere of influence of Amn or any other kingdom, and is currently just an outlaw island, and a temporary stop over for various independent traders, pirates, and daring mercantile sea farers. \nThe town is home to a small population of dockhands and some fishermen, but the majority are pirates and transient visitors. The town maintains a working dock, moorage for anchored ships, a general store/shop, Inn, Temple and a Brothel. A grand home has been confiscated by the Pirate Lord as his residence and headquarters. The Northern side of the island is occupied by the strange and mysterious structure of Spellhold, the Asylum. \nGameplay.\nUpon arrival to Brynnlaw, depending on if the party sided with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thieves&lt;/a&gt; or if on &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;'s side will determine a certain encounter for the party.\nIf the party is on the Shadow Thieves' side, then the party will arrive at night, and &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sime\"&gt;Sime&lt;/a&gt; will have certain dialogue. Afterwards the party will learn that a betrayal is afoot, and that a trio of &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; assailants are waiting to ambush your group. A battle with &lt;a href=\"Del\"&gt;Del&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Parisa\"&gt;Parisa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valen\"&gt;Valen&lt;/a&gt; will take place. If you are successful in driving away the undead attackers, Sime will let you know to visit Brynnlaw's Inn, the Vulgar Monkey, she'll say \"\"Go to the tavern. Speak with a man named Sanik. If there is a way into the asylum, he will know it\".\" - and soon after she will tell you \"I will scout around a bit and meet you at the pass leading to the asylum itself. Work with haste, &lt;CHARNAME&gt;. Our enemies know we are here.\" \nUpon arrival to the island having sided with Bodhi, then Saemon will have dialogue with the party, with several statements and questions answered. In the end he'll say \"H\"erein you shall find what you need. I will go no further lest I be recognized and harm your efforts. The Vulgar Monkey tavern should hold what you are looking for.\" And perhaps soon afterwards say \"Speak with Sanik inside. He has little love for me, but there is scant about this town that does not pass his notice.\"\"\nAs the party moves about Brynnlaw while exploring the streets, there will be some opportunities to speak with various folks. Dockhands and fishermen will have a bit to say and fill-in the town's mood. \nThe first time the party approaches the Brothel entrance, a duel of some kind is about to take place, involving a so called \"Duel Coordinator\", and two foes named Adante and Dirbish the Black. After their randomly resolved fight, there will be a parting line or two. And as is normal for BG games, the party can just walk over to the corpse and loot the body, while a few onlookers watch the pilfering. Perfectly normal behavior, especially for a Pirate town like Brynnlaw.\nIf you wish, speak with some of the Courtesans in front of the Brothel. The party can get some info from these physically attractive workers. There are male and female choices available. \nAs the party wanders around, perhaps dispelling the \"Fog of War\", it is likely that an encounter with a pair of pirates will be seen - squaring off in a fight - they are named Andar and Olben. They don't have any dialogue, except for some \"Argh's\" and other pirate-like exclamations as they circle each other. If you wish to get involved, send them to Davey Jones locker in speedier fashion, and attack the Pirates. They will become hostile if attacked, but otherwise they may eventually fight amongst themselves on their own. They drop a few items when slashed and stabbed sufficiently.\nAt some point, a small boy will perform a pick pocketing on &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;. This encounter with &lt;a href=\"Ason\"&gt;Ason&lt;/a&gt; is covered as part of the quest. Also, the party can speak with &lt;a href=\"Ginia\"&gt;Ginia&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern side of the town. Both these characters are related to the optional quest.\nAt various times, and typically after sundown, the streets of Brynnlaw can present some dangers. There are spawning points on the map that are scripted to generate backstabbing thief pirates. These scoundrels will be invisible and just attack with little warning, although the player may see some text in the screen log where the attacker says some kind of threat.\nThere is also one larger spawn involving a whole group of pirates and thieves that will challenge the party - it's some kind of press gang that is attempting to capture the party to force them into a Pirate Ship crew servitude. This naturally leads to a fight on dockside area of Brynnlaw, and is basically unavoidable. This encounter does not trigger until after returning to Brynnlaw from &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;, and only during the late evening and nighttime.\nContainers.\nThroughout the main Brynnlaw townscape are various barrels, crates and miscellaneous cargo containers with nothing in them, or random treasures or even a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Paralyzation\"&gt;Wand of Paralyzation&lt;/a&gt; in a secret wall niche. These are all for the taking if the party finds them. \nMod content.\nMod screenshots.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Back%20to%20Brynnlaw\"&gt;Back to Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt; mod begins in Athkatla in Chapter 6 and is initiated by speaking with a figure near the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer%20Mart\"&gt;Adventurer Mart&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt;. If pursued, the party will be returning to Brynnlaw again for new content and quest adventures.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20for%20BG2\"&gt;Unfinished Business for BG2&lt;/a&gt; mod restores the character Greyhand to the game, who is encountered at the north part of Brynnlaw on the pathway to the Spellhold map transition. Greyhand will drop the deprecated \"Boots of Hastened Departure\" as shown in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//imgur.com/9524z9x\"&gt;this screenshot&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Quest Pack&lt;/a&gt; mod finishes an earlier quest in the Vulgar Monkey Inn. See that page for details.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sime%20%28mod%29\"&gt;Sime (mod)&lt;/a&gt; companion modification, if installed, will begin here in Brynnlaw. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes minor revisions to pirates and thieves in Brynnlaw, as well as various guards in the Brothel. These changes are the usual creature class AI scripting modifications to allow for smarter tactical behavior, item use (such as potions carried), and corrected weapon proficiencies and fighting styles commensurate with the class and level of the creature. Of particular note, Pirate Thieves encountered at night will attack from invisibility, attempt to &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;. and if they have a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;Potion of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory, use that, and attempt another backstabbing, if able. Special care must be taken to prevent \"squishy\" party members from being \"chunked\" from excessive damage."}

Elves cannot naturally regenerate at all in .\nMoreover, Buckley's Buckler allows &lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt; Half-orcs and Dwarves who start with 19 Constitution to reach 25 via the use of the aforementioned Manual of Bodily Health and &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Rage\"&gt;Barbarian Rage&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the character to regenerate 1hp every 10 seconds (6 seconds = 1 round, so it's just over 1.6 rounds) very early in BGEE. Though, of course, this is limited by the short duration of Barbarian Rage (5 rounds), but with two casts the 25 Constitution can be kept up for 10 rounds.\nFinally, the Constitution increase from this item can be used as emergency healing for certain characters, depending on their Constitution, class and level, as any hp increase gained from equipping it remains for as long as it stays equipped. For example, a badly injured level 9 &lt;a href=\"Eldoth%20Kron\"&gt;Eldoth&lt;/a&gt; (15 CON) that currently has 7hp and equips this shield (perhaps switching away from an equipped bow to a sword-and-shield setup) will get +9hp (current and maximum) as a result of it and, due to the fact equipping a shield or switching weapon sets is a \"free action\" in combat, he can still drink a potion of healing in the same round, meaning he can instantly get +18hp to go from a dangerous 7hp to a reasonably safe 25hp."}

Upon a successful hit, it deals 1d4 crushing damage with a strength damage bonus of +8. In addition, the attack also deals 1d8 fire damage and 1d4 magical energy damage.\nThe creature regenerates 1 hit point every second and is healed by fire damage. A +3 enchanted weapon or greater is needed to strike the Firey golem.\nBurning Men can innately produce a spell effect known as Cinder Ashes to cause fire damage and &lt;a href=\"blindness\"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt; to multiple party members. They can also &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; party members for 4 rounds if they fail a save vs spells with a -4 penalty (blocked by magic resistance, no magic school). If the character is not protected against the effect, the save must be made once every four rounds.\nAs of BG2EE 2.6 + the innate spell is entitled as Cinder Shower (SPIN560.SPL) and the &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; effect aura is called Keening (SPIN559.SPL).\nThe Cinder Shower is \"cast\" instantly and uses an AoE projectile identified as \"Sparkle Area Red\", about 15' in diameter. The effect has a 50' range. The innate spell will inflict 4d10 fire damage on all party members in the AoE, although magic resistance can block it. There is no saving throw. Additionally, the effect will also cause a 'Blindness'-like effect that impedes affected party members with a -4 THAC0 penalty and -2 Dexterity modifier lasting 5 rounds. The Blindness effect cannot be blocked by any protections, nor does it have a saving throw, and it bypasses magic resistance. The effect cannot be dispelled. An affected victim will have a \"blinded\" icon on their avatar portrait. However, it is not actually blindness, and the character still retains their usual visual range. \nThe Keening spell is \"cast\" instantly and has a 320 feet radius and only affects the player's party members. No spell immunity or spell protection will protect against the Keening. Magic resistance can block it. A saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty is needed to negate the effect or be under a Panic effect for 4-rounds.\nThey are first encountered in \"\".\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes a few changes to this creature."}

See below:\nSummon Death Knight\nLevel: 7\nSchool: Necromancy\nRange: Medium\nDuration: 3 turns\nCasting Time: 1 round\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nBy means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack his foes and himself if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Death Knight, a powerful undead demon. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for him for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature\u2019s will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster.

Each month\u2019s name is followed by a colloquial description of that month, plus the roughly corresponding month of the Gregorian calendar.\nCalendar.\nYears are referred to by numbers, using the system known as Dalereckoning (DR). Dalereckoning began the year &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s were first permitted by the Elven Court to settle in the more open regions of the forests.\nThe Roll of Years.\nThe wide variety of competing and often conflicting calendars causes no end of pain to the historian and the sage. Most use the Roll of Years, a system by which each year has its own personal name. Names for the years are known collectively as the Roll of Years, as they are drawn from the predictions written down under that title by the famous Lost Sage, Augathra the Mad, with a few additions by the great seer &lt;a href=\"Alaundo\"&gt;Alaundo&lt;/a&gt;. The Roll is a long one; some more important years include the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), the Year of Shadows (1358 DR, the year of the &lt;a href=\"Time%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Time of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;), the Year of the Turret (1360 DR), and 1373 DR (the current year). The Time of Troubles, in which the gods assumed mortal form, started when the gods &lt;a href=\"Bane\"&gt;Bane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Myrkul\"&gt;Myrkul&lt;/a&gt; stole the Tablets of Fate from Lord Ao, the overpower god of the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Realms\"&gt;Realms&lt;/a&gt;. In retribution, Ao banished all of the gods from their outer-planar domains (except for &lt;a href=\"Helm\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, who guarded the Outer Planes). The gods were forced to assume the forms of mortal avatars until the end of the Time of Troubles, when the tablets were returned to their rightful owner. During the crisis, &lt;a href=\"Mystra\"&gt;Mystra&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s (goddess of magic) and Myrkul\u2019s (god of the dead) avatars were killed, Bane (god of evil and tyranny) was destroyed fighting Torm, and the human &lt;a href=\"Cyric\"&gt;Cyric&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; (god of murder and assassins) in an epic struggle while competing for Bane\u2019s portfolio.

It can reapply invisibility with its remaining supply of potions as it battles the party.\nAlthough this is a demonic creature, unlike most other fiends in the Watcher's Keep, this particular opponent has no special protections against normal or magical weapons, status effects, and not even fire damage.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod revises the Cambion in moderate ways.\nAs the fiend is a Thief class, it now is assigned 1 pip in long sword weapon proficiency and one pip in single-weapon fighting style. The creature's final THAC0 is now improved, as well as armor class.\nAttacking from invisibility bestows a 4-point THAC0 bonus to hit. \nThe Bastard sword is replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Long Sword +1&lt;/a&gt;, so it can benefit from &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nThe cambion begins battle from invisibility and can backstab with a X5 damage multiplier.

This is calculated in the InfoBox. \nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod assigns a new default smarter fighter script to Camitis for better tactical behavior. SCS assigns 5 pips in Axe, and 2 pips in sword and shield fighting style. This will improve his THAC0, damage output and boost APR.

{"id": "20996", "revid": "209199", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20996", "title": "Canon", "text": "Discussion of Canon in the \"Baldur's Gate\" game universe often revolves around the so-called \"canon party\" that travels with &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; during the events of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, , and .\nIn some contexts \"canon\" can also refer to &lt;a href=\"%23Forgotten%20Realms%20canon\"&gt;Forgotten Realms canon&lt;/a&gt;.\nCanon party.\nBaldur's Gate.\n establishes in its introduction that &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; was captured along with &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khalid\"&gt;Khalid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt;. While the player is allowed to speak with various members of the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; as if they do not remember them, this is employed as a method to give players a brief summary of the events of the first game, and does not seem intended as a way for the player to dispute their past connections with these characters.\nHowever, it is not made clear whether Gorion's Ward traveled with these &lt;a href=\"companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; \"exclusively\" throughout their adventures in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, only that they traveled together for some amount of time. Jaheira's introductory dialogue to a player who claims not to remember her states that \"we have traveled together for some time, and the places we have gone number too many to name,\" so it's not unreasonable to assume that a lot of time was spent with Jaheira and Khalid at least, but still no definite conclusions can be drawn. No returning party members in Baldur's Gate II except Imoen make any reference to being present for the slaying of &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt; at the conclusion of Baldur's Gate.\nTherefore it cannot be stated definitively that Baldur's Gate II establishes a canon party for the first game, but it is not out of the question to accept the returning characters as such.\nOne other note on the subject of canon for Baldur's Gate is that many possible companions from the first game do return in Baldur's Gate II as non-playable characters. It could be considered canon that those characters did not die permanently even if the player killed them or allowed them to die in the first game. The player is even sometimes able to comment on this, e.g. \"didn't you die?\" An example of returning characters like these are &lt;a href=\"Xzar\"&gt;Xzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Montaron\"&gt;Montaron&lt;/a&gt;.\nTales of the Sword Coast.\nThe original release of the included a pre-existing save file called the Mission Pack Save, intended to allow players to skip the content of Baldur's Gate and play the new content directly. This file has never been included with . The active party members included in this save file are &lt;a href=\"Abdel%20Adrian\"&gt;Abdel Adrian&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;, Imoen, Jaheira, Minsc, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Odesseiron\"&gt;Edwin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Viconia%20DeVir\"&gt;Viconia&lt;/a&gt;. Khalid and Dynaheir are not present and no attempt is made to explain their absence.\nAgain, the introduction of Baldur's Gate II only establishes that the party members met at the beginning had traveled together for some time, and not necessarily on an exclusive basis. This save could be seen as contributing to the list of characters Gorion's Ward traveled with at some point, but is far from a definitive source. It is equally likely that it simply represented a well-rounded party the developers thought were well-equipped for the challenges in the expansion, though it is notable that both Edwin and Viconia make a reappearance in &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; in Baldur's Gate II.\nBaldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear.\n will import any party of characters from Baldur's Gate, allowing players to treat any combination of them as canon -- at least for the &lt;a href=\"Korlasz%20Family%20Tomb\"&gt;introductory dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the exception of Imoen, Siege is very careful in allowing the player to treat every other returning companion as a complete stranger or old friend. The initial conversation choice with each of them establishes this, and further dialogue is written to reinforce that choice. The player is even allowed to deny having traveled with Jaheira, who Gorion's Ward is guaranteed to have at least heard about from &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt;. More than any other game, Siege goes out of its way to deny any particular canon party, allowing each player to make that determination for themselves. This may conflict with Baldur's Gate II's introduction, though at least every character from that introduction can be incorporated into the party in Siege of Dragonspear (along with later returning characters Edwin and Viconia).\nShadows of Amn.\n&lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irenicus's Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in the introduction of allows Gorion's Ward to recruit Imoen, Minsc, Jaheira, and &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt;, but the player is also allowed to reject or ignore any of these companions. While it seems likely that the player is intended to take these companions along, Baldur's Gate II does not enforce any particular party, and there are not yet any game sources set post-BGII that make any declaration one way or the other.\nIt makes sense to consider Yoshimo a likely replacement &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; for Imoen, and the relative significance of his personal quest that takes place at &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; could be seen as an indicator that he would likely have traveled with Gorion's Ward, but again, the game is flexible in allowing the player to make their own determinations on this front. &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Jansen\"&gt;Jan Jansen&lt;/a&gt; is just as likely to have been the party's \"canon thief\" as Yoshimo, until some future source materializes that establishes a definitive answer.\nAlong these same lines, it is tempting to include &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt; as a canon party member in , due to his relative plot significance, extensive dialogues, and personal quest taking place there. However, like other characters as established previously, Gorion's Ward is not required to take him along.\nGiven the through line of characters across all games in the series, it would not be unreasonable to look at Gorion's Ward, Imoen, Jaheira, Minsc, and Sarevok as a likely party concluding events in Throne of Bhaal. The fact that the player is able to take most of these characters from the beginning of Baldur's Gate all the way to the end is a reasonable argument toward potential status as canon. But players are still allowed to form their own party at any stage across all games, and no source exists yet that might judge any of them incorrect or non-canon. The upcoming &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20III\"&gt;Baldur's Gate III&lt;/a&gt; may eventually provide some answers on this front.\nCanon Gorion's Ward.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt; narration in Baldur's Gate establishes Gorion's Ward to be about 20 years old. While some races in Forgotten Realms are much longer-lived than others, this age does not preclude any particular racial choice, since most of them mature at roughly the same rate as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. As one example, &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; are not considered adults until they reach the age of 110, but they grow physically throughout their childhood years much the same as humans. A 20-year-old elf would be considered immature by elf standards, but having been raised by Gorion, would have the same level of education and understanding of the world that any other race would have in that environment. In Gorion's chamber in Candlekeep there is a note stating \"I am not your biological father.\" This means the protagonist must be human or half-elf. As you would already know you were not biologically related if you were not human as Gorion is Human.\n&lt;a href=\"Half-orc\"&gt;Half-orc&lt;/a&gt; was not an option as a playable race in the original release of Baldur's Gate, and they are described as merely being \"tolerated\" in &lt;a href=\"Amn\"&gt;Amn&lt;/a&gt;, so it isn't unreasonable to conclude that a half-orc Gorion's Ward would be unlikely. Purists who look only to the original release for canon certainly would discard this race as an option.\nIf nothing else, humans are among the most widespread and common of all the races in Forgotten Realms.\nIf a canon &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; must be determined for Gorion's Ward, it seems most likely the character would be Chaotic. As the prophecies of Alaundo state:\n\"During the days of the Avatars, the Lord of Murder will spawn a score of mortal progeny. These offspring will be aligned good and evil, but chaos will flow through them all. \"\nThat chaos may be paired with good or neutral, as many of the Ward's, most likely, companions are good or neutral, and neutral good Imoen is a constant presence throughout the series; it seems unlikely that a good-aligned friend would remain a companion or even stand by and watch as the Ward committed numerous evil acts. Jaheira's introductory dialogue at the start of Baldur's Gate II states that \"our exploits together have left the land for the better,\" which is the clearest indication of the way Gorion's Ward behaved during Baldur's Gate at least. Much of the games' content is also heavily skewed toward committing good acts, even if for selfish reasons. Finally, there are indications in the prologue and by later characters who knew him that Gorion would have raised his Ward to be a good person.\nThere is no indication of a canon gender. If one were to assume that a romance needed to take place in canon, it is notable that there are fewer options for female Wards than males.\nThe games do not indicate a canon &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; for Gorion's Ward. There are some considerations and guesses that can be made based on the few established facts about this character.\nThere is nothing that would preclude any multiclass or dual class combinations.\nForgotten Realms canon.\nBaldur's Gate series game takes place in &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Realms\"&gt;Forgotten Realms&lt;/a&gt; Dungeon &amp; Dragons setting, so areas and events in game fits the Forgotten Realm canon."}

The captain is accompanied by four other mercenaries.\nGameplay.\nHe initiates conversation when you enter Delosar's Inn. If you provoke him he will attack you, thus rendering you unable to do the quest.\nCaptain Dennis is scripted to:\n-Use his Potion of Frost Giant Strength if an enemy is within sight (can be pickpocketed to prevent this).\n-Use his Potion of Extra Healing when below 20% hp (can also be pickpocketed).\n-Equip a ranged weapon when there are no enemies close to him (his crossbow, which is marked as \"unstealable\").\n-And equip a melee weapon when an enemy gets close (the Boomerang Dagger, in melee mode, if it hasn't been pickpocketed; otherwise, he'll use his halberd, which is marked as \"unstealable\").\nAs a level 16 Fighter, Dennis can be quite formidable, but fighting him from a distance can make it easier to take him down, as he has 5 APR when using either of his melee weapons, but only 3 APR when using his crossbow. Plus, the extra strength he gets from the Potion of Frost Giant Strength has no effect on his abilities when he's wielding his crossbow.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises some aspects of Captain Dennis. An SCS Fighter AI script is assigned for better tactical behavior and potion use. The Captain will use healing potions during the battle when HP falls below a certain threshold and quaff his Potion of Frost Giant Strength. The creature favors Halberd use in melee range, and most likely won't utilize the crossbow or boomerang dagger unless no opponents are close to him or are moving away from him. \nIn terms of weapon proficiencies and SCS, and the Mod's mantra to not \"cheat\" with abilities, Captain Dennis as a level 16 Fighter can by rule only have 9 proficiency points. In the unmodded game he has grandmastery in all weapons, which is technically impossible. With SCS, he is assigned 4 pips in Halberd, 4 pips in dagger and 1 pip in crossbow. So, in this sense, he actually has a slightly reduced APR and damage output with his halberd and dagger. His crossbow attack will suffer a marked decrease in effectiveness, but he really doesn't use it with SCS either."}

The player can visit this area anytime it wishes once it transitions to the Underdark from Chapter 4. \nHowever, if the player does not enter this area and waits until it has the &lt;a href=\"The%20Drow%20Summoning%20Ritual\"&gt;The Drow Summoning Ritual&lt;/a&gt; quest line and has already completed &lt;a href=\"Inside%20the%20Drow%20City\"&gt;Inside the Drow City&lt;/a&gt; tasks - then &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt; will assign an actual quest purpose to the party, and a reason is provided to seek the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Brain%20Blood\"&gt;Elder Brain Blood&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern Tunnels. There are two alternative quest items that will suffice as well, so there is no \"requirement\" to visit this particular area.\nLevel dependent spawns.\nThis area will trigger a spawn script when the party transitions into the area via a hidden proximity region. The game engine looks at the protagonist's accrued total experience point value, and that will determine the quantity of additional creatures placed on the areas map locations - these are extra creatures beyond the base actors already on the map. The game difficulty slider does not influence the spawn quantity. There are four tiers of spawns based on the XP level of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;:\nNote that with Mod content discussed below, the spawned creatures are game difficulty setting dependent.\nWalkthrough.\nCapture.\nEnter the Mind Flayer Dungeon from the southeast corner of the Underdark. Moments later, the Mind Flayers will use their psionic powers to make all party members suffer a \"Psychic Drain\" effect. This action is accomplished via a cutscene. \nJailed and forced to battle in the gladiatorial fighting pit.\nAfter returning to a conscious state, you will find out that your party is locked up in a cell and that you are prisoners. A few minutes pass, and a &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Mind%20Flayer%20Jailer%29\"&gt;Ogre (Mind Flayer Jailer)&lt;/a&gt; opens the cell and speaks, informing the party of their fate. He will explain that you must fight creatures to entertain the &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt; spectators in some kind of arena or pit or be destroyed. The player's auto map notes this location as the \"Gladiatorial Fighting Pit\". The player's journal will update:\nThe Ogre jailer says you will need to fight soon, and without delay the party is transported to the fighting pit to face several &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;Umber Hulk&lt;/a&gt; opponents. \nWhile in the fighting pit, the party was not able to see any Mind Flayer spectators, but you could feel their presence and just know they are watching. \nAn oppressive feeling of intrusion upon your psyche is nagging in the back of the mind.\nMeet the githyanki prisoners.\nWhen you return after surviving your first battle, open the door to the cell northeast and speak to &lt;a href=\"Simyaz\"&gt;Simyaz&lt;/a&gt;, leader of a group of &lt;a href=\"Githyanki\"&gt;Githyanki&lt;/a&gt;, who have also been captured by the Illithids. After participating in the raid on your ship on the return from &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;, their ship was also sunk by the Sahuagin. After dialogue with the new cell mates, the player's journal updates:\nThe githyank knew that they would be next up in the pit. And that occurs. They are returned to their cell, a bit battered and bruised, but all but one survived. The Ogre jailer has said that the party and the githyanki will fight each other in the next pit match. Simyaz proposes a plan, to work together with the player. There is much dialogue available about this.\nOn the other hand, if the party can come to an agreement with Simyaz, then the githyanki will interfere with the illithids in a psychic battle of wills to allow the party to finish off any other opponents in the arena, and then find a door to escape the fighting pit. The player's journal updates:\nSome time passes, and the Ogre jailer informs the party that the battle is to begin. Once again the player's forces are in the pit. \nThey will have to protect the githyanki from a number of &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toa\"&gt;Kuo-toa&lt;/a&gt; opponents, and the githyanki are engaged in a group chant and psychic trance to suppress or disrupt the illithid. \nOnce the enemy is defeated try and get through the eastern door of the pit. The githyanki will continue the mental battle while the party tries its escape. The psychic seals should be weakened, and the party can try to open it. \nIt has a normal lock on it, and will need to be picked or forced open, or perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Knock\"&gt;Knock&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nOnce through the door and into the main illithid complex the party must now get past the hostile Ogre Jailer. He may have sounded kind of friendly, but he isn't now.\nAfter escaping the jail and initial exploration.\nNow free of the fighting pit and control by the Ogre jailer, the party must conduct a careful exploration of the illithid complex, to not only find a means to escape, but possibly recover some of that &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Brain%20Blood\"&gt;Elder Brain Blood&lt;/a&gt; if the player has an open quest requirement from &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt;. Either way, it's time to move forward and trying to rest might be an impossibility. With the initiative regained for now, the player should capitalize on freedom of action and get cracking. \nJailer room.\nAfter defeating the Ogre Jailer, make sure you search for any containers that may contain items of interest. A wall cache contains some gold, and table contains the &lt;a href=\"Hilt%20of%20the%20Equalizer\"&gt;Hilt of the Equalizer&lt;/a&gt;. There is a passage leading north, and one is southward direction. Going north leads to a chamber with two sealed doors. An easterly path leads to a room with additional Jails cells, and a corridor heading further east. \nMore jail cells.\nThe two jail cell doors are locked. If opened, there are some hostile creatures within, including a &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin%20Baronial%20Guard\"&gt;Sahuagin Baronial Guard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin%20Prince\"&gt;Sahuagin Prince&lt;/a&gt; in one cell.\nIn another cell are two crossbow wielding &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Warrior\"&gt;Kuo-toan Warrior&lt;/a&gt; creatures. They will move out and attack once the cell door is ajar. \nThese prisoners were most likely gladiatorial combat fodder.\nRoom with vats.\nContinue east into another chamber, where a Mind Flayer is observed within, and will attack. Once dispatched the party can investigate the six vats placed along the roundish room's interior. A text string will display if the player hovers their cursor over a vat:\nInteracting with the vat by clicking it displays:\nThe party member has the &lt;a href=\"Illithid%20Serum\"&gt;Illithid Serum&lt;/a&gt; item placed in their inventory.\nMoving South.\nA curving corridor leads to another round chamber in which are at least two Mind Flayers. \nThey are hostile and will attack any detected party members. \nBe prepared for their &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Blast\"&gt;Psionic Blast&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Domination\"&gt;Psionic Domination&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nAnother corridor leads southeast through a door.\nSlaves and illithid machine.\nA larger round room is observed. Odd illithid globes, tubing, and interconnected machinery of alien origin is quietly humming and throbbing with purpose. \nVarious humanoids are seen connected to this apparatus - and they appear to be in some kind of stupor or impaired state. Trying to speak with these humans gets no response. \nThey are oblivious and eyes are closed. Some of them are sporadically twitching slightly , and show rapid eye movement beneath their eyelids. \nIf the player's cursor is hovered over one of the six globes a text displays:\nIf the player wishes to add the &lt;a href=\"Illithid%20Serum\"&gt;Illithid Serum&lt;/a&gt; to one of these tubes (accomplished by clicking on the globe and having the serum in the inventory), then another text displays:\nA cut scene now initiates, and all the human surface dwellers awaken from their stupor - the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Leader%20%28Illithids%29\"&gt;Slave Leader&lt;/a&gt; initiates dialogue with the party. He begins with:\nFurther conversation will continue, and the party may ask questions and get some answers about their experiences and what they know of this place. The party learns that the slaves connected to the machine powered it in some way and were able to produce the &lt;a href=\"Control%20Circlet\"&gt;Control Circlet&lt;/a&gt; item. The Slave leader, who tells you his name is \"Camaris Highcastle\", is unsure exactly what the circlets do, or if the machine could make more, and even if that may help the party while in this complex. Camaris says that he and the freed slaves can remain quiet, but that the party will have to find a way out, as they are overmatched and too weak to battle mind flayers. Once freed he says they will be able to find their own way out of the Underdark.\nIf the player wishes, then interacting with the main machine console is possible. Examining it reveals the following text:\nThe machine is able to produce four circlets before it runs too low on power. \nThese objects will be placed in the characters inventory. \nEach circlet has a limited charge quantity and can be activated/used by placing the object in one of the quick item slots (like where a wand or potion would go).\nRoom with sealed doors.\nThe chamber to the north of the Jail room has two closed doors that are sealed shut. Moving in close proximity to either initiates a Journal entry:\nSeveral clues have now been given that a Mind Flayer can open a sealed door. It hasn't been made very clear what the \"being of great power\" could be. That fact aside, and at the risk of being a spoiler - that \"great being\" can be had by the protagonist activating their &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt; power. Once activated, this form can force the door open. \nIf that seems like a method not desirable by the player, then perhaps one of those Control Circlets can be used to Charm a Mind Flayer to open the door. Are there any Mind Flayers still alive in this section of the complex? \nWell, yes there is actually. Return to the Room with Vats where the Illithid Serum was found. \nA Mind Flayer will be present, and attack as is usual. If the player can Dire Charm it with the circlet, then guide and control the illithid next to the sealed door to open. \nWhen it gets close to it, the door will open. And surprisingly, the Dire Charm will end, and the creature is hostile.\nThe Githyanki bid farewell.\nWhen the door is opened, Simyaz and the githyanki teleport into the room and address the character (unless the party killed them earlier, then this won't occur). In short, the githyanki are able to planar travel via their own psionic powers but cannot free the party as well. Simyaz may say:\nFurther dialogue can develop, and it may be somewhat cordial or lean towards anger at them leaving the party behind. Regardless, the githyanki will not be assisting with exploration or fighting with the party against the denizens of this complex. The party will have to cope on their own. Remember, the party may not have been able to escape without the Githyanki's initial assistance in the first place.\nWestward into the Mind Flayer complex - first chamber.\nWith the sealed door now finally opened, the party can enter a curved westward leading corridor that connects to a circular chamber. \nThis room is occupied with several illithids including more than one ulitharid and umber hulk pets. Expect a stiff resistance here from the hostile creatures.\nOnce the enemies are defeated, there are two closed doors available. One to the North, and another to the west.\nNorth to the birthing pods.\nThrough the north door a coridor leads to another closed door. Open this and observe a circular chamber beyond.\nWithin are a trio of illithids tending to the brine pool pods where tadpoles are birthed and nurtured.\nA fight will take place in the chamber if any party members are detected.\nDefeat these foes, then interact with a brine pool to examine it for information.\nCollect some Brine.\nUsing some empty vessels found in the chamber, the party can collect some of the fluid.\nBy doing so, up to eight &lt;a href=\"Brine%20Potion\"&gt;Brine Potion&lt;/a&gt; containers can be had.\nImbibing the potion will bestow temporary immunity to some psionic attacks.\nWhen ready, continue delving deeper into the complex. To the western door found previously.\nExplore westward.\nEnter into a lengthy westward corridor. A side passage leads to the spectator gallery of the Gladiatorial Fighting Pit - now empty. \nAt the west end of the corridor is another closed door. Beyond is another round chamber.\nA group of mind flayers, ulitharids and umber hulks are present. The most found in one area so far.\nPlan and execute your tactical battle plan against these hostile forces.\nThree directional choices.\nDestroying the defenders now leaves the party with three different paths it can try.\nThere are two doors to the north and one to the south.\nOne door north is sealed so that only an illithid or use of the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt; can open it.\nFor purposes of documenting the area, assume the party tries the other northern door.\nIllithid work and living chamber.\nGo northward into a short corridor and open a closed door.\nSome kind of illithid work and living area is seen with odd decor and furnishings.\nSeveral more mind flayer, ulitharid and umber hulk creatures are within. \nDefeat the defenders and search the space for the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Command\"&gt;Staff of Command&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouth to the prisoner pods.\nTravel southward through a closed door and down a short corridor into a chamber dominated by three alien looking pods.\nEach metallic object has a door that can be unlatched from the exterior.\nOpening the door of any of these will reveal a prisoner within. Each of these creatures are hostile to the party and can't be reasoned with.\nThe pod on the north contains an umber hulk beast. The central one has an &lt;a href=\"Insane%20Dwarf%20Warrior\"&gt;Insane Dwarf Warrior&lt;/a&gt; with a sling equipped. The last one holds a &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Priest\"&gt;Kuo-toan Priest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome loot can be gathered from two of the prisoners, including the rare &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fire%20Control\"&gt;Ring of Fire Control&lt;/a&gt;.\nLair of the Master Brain.\nThe last unexplored area is behind the specially sealed door to the north in the previous chamber. Attempting to open it displays a screen message that it can't be opened except by a powerful being. Similar to the earlier door in the saga.\nTo get past this door the party could attempt to use either the &lt;a href=\"Control%20Circlet\"&gt;Control Circlet&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Command\"&gt;Staff of Command&lt;/a&gt; to dire charm an illithid and lead them to this door. A respawning illithid can still be found in the room of vats with the illithid serum.\nA second way would be for the bhaalspawn to transform into the &lt;a href=\"Slayer\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt; and open the door.\nIf the player is concerned about the loss of party &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; that comes with evoking the slayer form transformation, then consider trying to open the door using a charmed mind flayer instead,\nSee the screenshot to the left - just maneuver the illithid close to the door, and it will open, and the creature will revert to a hostile being once again.\nBehind the opened door is a short corridor leading to locked door. The lock can be picked, or potentially forced open, or a &lt;a href=\"Knock\"&gt;Knock&lt;/a&gt; spell will work.\nOpening the door will reveal only a portion of the Master Brain's lair and from the doorway only the MB can be discerned. A text message will also display on the combat log and describe some strong odors and other details. \nIf the brain detects anyone by the doorway it will trigger an &lt;a href=\"Ego%20Whip\"&gt;Ego Whip&lt;/a&gt; attack on the first detected party member.\nWithin the lair are two illithid and an umber hulk attendants.\nThese creatures will engage in combat with any they can detect in the lair. \nThey may also pursue if the party retreats into the corridor.\nIf any damage is incurred by the Master Brain, this event triggers the spawning of two &lt;a href=\"Brain%20Golem\"&gt;Brain Golem&lt;/a&gt; defenders in the lair. \nAt the same time, the door to the lair closes automatically and is locked again. It must be picked or forced open in order to pass through.\nWhen the brain is killed a journal update will display and the locked door opens.\nFinal actions.\nSearch dropped items held by the Master Brain and find a plethora of gemstones and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Brain%20Blood\"&gt;Elder Brain Blood&lt;/a&gt;.\nMake for the exit leading back to the Underdark caverns and find the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Leader\"&gt;Slave Leader&lt;/a&gt; and his group waiting there (unless you killed them earlier).\nSee the screenshot (left) for the dialogue and subsequent reward.\nCongratulations, the party has escaped the Mind Flayers!\nLast encounter.\nAfter leaving the Mind Flayer complex, the party will eventually pass adjacent to the githyanki group and &lt;a href=\"Simyaz\"&gt;Simyaz&lt;/a&gt;. This occurs after crossing the bridge structure. Note that if they were killed earlier then obviously this entire encounter will not take place.\nThe group will not initiate dialogue, and the party can ignore them if desired.\nHowever, if a party member speaks to Simyaz then a dialogue will open up, requiring replies.\nSimyaz seems to know that the PC has the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Blade\"&gt;Silver Blade&lt;/a&gt; or at least had it at one time. He wants it back as it is considered a holy relic sacred to their race. The dialogue allows the PC to return it without any bloodshed. All the other dialogue choices will lead to hostilities. If the party wants to keep the blade, they may, but the githyanki will attack.\nShould the party fight and kill the gith, their corpses may be looted. This is the last the party will see or hear from these blade hunting githyanki in chapter 5.\nTreasure.\nYou can find some unique equipment here. Near your cell, you can find the hilt of &lt;a href=\"The%20Equalizer\"&gt;The Equalizer&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fire%20Control\"&gt;Ring of Fire Control&lt;/a&gt; can be found as loot when opening a locked cell pod southwest of the area. The crazy dwarf within drops it when he is killed.\n&lt;a href=\"Methild%27s%20Harp\"&gt;Methild's Harp&lt;/a&gt; is hidden in a wall niche near the door to the main complex entrance.\nThe powerful &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Command\"&gt;Staff of Command&lt;/a&gt; is hidden in a piece illithid furniture.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises this area and add extra or change the composition of &lt;a href=\"Ulitharid\"&gt;Ulitharid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20flayer\"&gt;Mind flayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;Umber Hulk&lt;/a&gt; opponents based on the player's game difficulty setting. It may be very similar to the unmodified game in some rooms, and different in others.\nThe mod also revamps and improves the capabilities of all the illithid &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; powers. Many of their abilities have no easy safeguard - now a character under &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt; will be attacked with a different set of psionics to bypass that defense.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a rare tome to the Master Brain's loot. Additionally, the Master Brain and Brain Golem defenders drop \"Brain Tissue\" - a component necessary to construct your own brain golem for the party."}

He is also a \"shop keeper\", and will open a store function, available for only one visit to the cave. Side Note: Apparently, based on the accents of Esamon and Carras, there is a part of the Faer\u00fbn which is similar to Australia.\nThe first time in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%208\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 8&lt;/a&gt; when you enter the &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Cave\"&gt;Smuggler's Cave&lt;/a&gt; in Amkethran, you will see some of &lt;a href=\"Balthazar\"&gt;Balthazar's&lt;/a&gt; monks shutting the smugglers' business down. Regardless of whether you help the smugglers or not, you can trade with Carras, although you can only do it once. \nIf you don't enter the cave in Chapter 8, you will have missed your chance, even if you go in the Smuggler's Cave in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%209\"&gt;Chapter 9&lt;/a&gt;. For a more detailed look at the first encounter of Carras and the Monks visit the &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Cave\"&gt;Smuggler's Cave&lt;/a&gt; area article. \nGameplay.\nCarras has an adjusted pickpocketing score of 125% - which will make it tougher for a party member to steal from him.\nIf attacked by the party - Carras will initially force cast &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Invisibility\"&gt;Mass Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf able, he'll attempt a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Normal Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, then cast a &lt;a href=\"Horror\"&gt;Horror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Hold Person (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Summons\"&gt;Carrion Summons&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that this smuggler has an innate 63% &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe items in his quick slots (&lt;a href=\"Enkidu%27s%20Full%20Plate\"&gt;Enkidu's Full Plate&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"K%27logarath\"&gt;K'logarath&lt;/a&gt;) are flagged as unstealable, but can be dropped upon death. The same applies to the &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Boots\"&gt;Gargoyle Boots&lt;/a&gt; he wears.\nCarras is scripted to use his bow and arrow attacks over melee fighting.\nDiscount (exploit).\n Helping the smugglers will make Carras give you a discount. He then will sell for only 99% of the regular item value (opposed to 140% without discount) and buy items for a rate of 80% of their value (30% without discount). With high &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charisma\"&gt;Charisma&lt;/a&gt; this can lead to a situation where a unique, high valued item, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Enkidu%27s%20Full%20Plate\"&gt;Enkidu's Full Plate&lt;/a&gt; from his own stock, can be sold back to him for more coin than it originally cost when buying \u2013 effectively letting &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; gain coin through trade, here.\n This exploit no longer works in the enhanced edition, since the buy markup is set to 30%.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; Mod addresses an oddity. Dialogue in the game suggests that the smugglers buy and sell stolen goods, however the unmodded game does not allow them to behave as a fence. The Mod changes this (it is the only fence available in ToB). The shop's inventory is modified slightly to include some Mod specific items.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod assigns a different smarter mage script to Carras. He gets a fully populated spell book commensurate with his mage XP level, and will initialize different spells for protection, such as &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI Divination&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Dispelling Screen\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and others.\nHe can try a few spell removals and a &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;.\nExpect a &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt; to assist him in battle.

The daily use charge ability is of the &lt;a href=\"Priest%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;priest type&lt;/a&gt; though and won't attract their attention.\nThe on-hit dispel magic effect works as described, and it applies a schooless dispel effect that has no secondary type assigned - &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI: Abjuration&lt;/a&gt; cannot block the on-hit dispel magic effect. \nThe daily use dispel magic charges don't work as described. See the \"Bugs\" section below.\nThe level 30 dispel magic on-hit effect will not trigger if the weapon is made ineffective because the target is protected from being struck - for example by a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; spell.

There are some effects that can add onto the weapon's flat value, such as certain bard songs. Equipping another item that provides magic resistance can also add onto the flat value, but the player may have to equip the item before the sword, or even afterwards to have the cumulative MR values take effect and display on the character record properly.\nSome examples of the interactions found with this set value mechanic are given below:\nKeldorn has Carsomyr equipped, and quaffs a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Protection\"&gt;Potion of Magic Protection&lt;/a&gt; = MR is 100%.\nKeldorn has already quaffed a Potion of Magic protection and then equips Carsomyr = MR is 100%.\nKeldorn has the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Gaxx\"&gt;Ring of Gaxx&lt;/a&gt; equipped, and then equips Carsomyr = MR is 50%.\nKeldorn has Carsomyr equipped and then adds the Ring of Gaax = MR is 60%.\nKeldorn is wearing the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Cloak of Balduran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Seldarine\"&gt;Amulet of Seldarine&lt;/a&gt; = MR is 35%.

If pressed about this subject, he'll probably say:\nCarston will release a moderate electricity attack at the party member asking the question, although it can be mitigated just like a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; spell would be.\nIn the end, the party realizes that Carston is trapped in the machine, inside a \"bell jar\" as it is referred to in a few texts and is apparently sustained by it and immune to the effects of age. He's also likely invulnerable to any harm while inside the glass cage, yet can still attack others outside it, and has the power to conjure various extra planar creatures seemingly at will for his own cruel entertainment.\nCarston is triggered by criticism and will lash out if he grows annoyed by persistent questions as well.\nIf and when the party discovers the method to free Carston from this machine there are two options available to choose regarding his fate.\nThe party can let the mage go free and let him depart the area (he'll be grateful and sorry for his behavior), or the party can take swift revenge upon the evil actions Carston has taken previously.\nIf the party let's Carston go, he hands over &lt;a href=\"Carston%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Carston's Journal&lt;/a&gt; - which provides the control sequence to use the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt; and open the portal gate to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Final%20Seal\"&gt;Lower Reaches&lt;/a&gt; as well as .\nIf the party ever says:\nCarston will reply with - \"Well, I'm not going down without a fight!\", and the mage will enter a hostile state and try and fight back with the spells noted on the InfoBox.\nNotes.\nThere is also the unheroic and definite &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology\"&gt;\"Cheese\"&lt;/a&gt; option for the player who wishes to dispose of Carston, where the party can double-dip on experience points by letting Carston go, and then while Carston's sprite walks off the map, attack the neutral creature and kill it.

On certain difficulty settings he has use of mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; spells too.\nA random potion is added to his inventory to boost abilities or to heal wounds."}

When the creatures are defeated, another appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Apparition%20%28Spellhold%29\"&gt;Apparition&lt;/a&gt; will occur.\nThe Apparition will await the party to initiate dialogue:\nThe party is presented with several dialogue selections to choose from.\nIf the party replies with \"I refuse to speak to you anymore. You are little more than a mindless golem.\" - then the Apparition will reply \"That may well be, but I must still fulfill the duty that I am assigned. Were I living and breathing, your fate would be the same. The path gets harder still.\" \nIf the party says \"It is wasted as it is. Would that it had the fertile nature of the previous room.\" then the Apparition remarks \"A naive view, but a hopeful one. Had I a soul, I am sure I would be moved. So be it; I will take this as a good sign, though I find your mind to be more complicated than these simple tests illustrate.\"\nAnother possible answer is \"I shall raze the entire building to this condition.\" to which the Apparition replies \"Unproductive. You are not responding to these evaluations well at all. Would that I had a director here to study you properly. As it stands, I can only discourage the thoughts. The path gets harder.\" \nAnd the last reply is \"I have no insight as to why it is like this. Should I worry over what I cannot help?\" and the Apparition says \"I suppose this view is unavoidable, since I reinforce it by subjecting you to the tests in the first. Very well. This acceptance shall be taken as a good sign. The path is made easier.\"\"\nContainers.\nThere are four \"craters\" in the cave that can be searched, and various items are available for the taking. There is a &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt; as well as plenty of mundane and enchanted arrows, bolts and bullets. There are also a Crossbow and Longbow. Note that if the containers within are not searched before speaking with the Apparition there won't be an opportunity to loot them before being whisked away from the cave. "}

With Irenicus schemes in play, that balance has been lost for the moment.\nDescription.\nThe area is part natural cavern, and an underground series of connected rooms that are part of a dilapidated and damaged elven temple.\nGameplay.\nThe party will enter a natural cavern from the &lt;a href=\"Kuo%20Toa%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Western Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as the party transitions here a hidden map sector triggers a spell effect that removes the drow illusion that is upon the party from &lt;a href=\"Adalon\"&gt;Adalon&lt;/a&gt;. If the party never had it (unlikely but possible) then it won't affect anything noticeable to the player.\nThe party observes a scattered group of drow , as well as a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Huge%20Spider\"&gt;Huge Spider&lt;/a&gt; arachnids. There are five drow here, all armed. Four are male and female fighters and there is one male wizard. \nEverything in this cavern will be hostile immediately. Fight your way through to an opening on the North wall and continue on to the elven temple ruins.\nThe next room has two closed doors, one to the north and one to the west. Inside is a female drow warrior and three War Elves. Upon entry a text will display:\nThe party can help fight the drow or just press on.\nThe room to north has more action going on, with a three-on-three battle between drow and elven warriors. There are two \"containers\" on the floor rubble/a fallen warrior's corpse that can be examined for found items.\nOpening the doorway to the west has yet another melee happening. This time 5 drow are up against 6 elves. On the floor within is another fallen corpse that can be examined.\nA closed door to the west is available leading to a small room with rubble and debris and another door leading to the exit to the surface on the north wall. Several elves have already told the party to make for the surface and to see someone called &lt;a href=\"Elhan\"&gt;Elhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the drow are dead, which can be hastened with help from the party, all the surviving elves will leave the temple ruins.\nThe party can transition to the surface when they are ready. Note that it won't make much sense to take any drow equipment with you top side.\nNotes.\nThe elves in this area are difficult to turn hostile through deliberate/accidental attacks or damaging them with errant AoE damage. However, they will eventually become hostile on an individual basis. Making one, few, or all of the elves hostile will not damage party reputation and has no effect on the how the surface elves in the next area will react.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod will add and revise the scripts of the drow in this area. The drow wizard will let loose some buffs and spells. The warriors will have revised weapon proficiencies commensurate with their XP levels and furnished weaponry.\nAdditional drow will be placed in this area with the mod, depending on components installed and the game difficulty setting.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eilistraee%27s%20Song\"&gt;Eilistraee's Song&lt;/a&gt; mod will place &lt;a href=\"Solaufein\"&gt;Solaufein&lt;/a&gt; in the final room with the exit to the surface door. The party must initiate dialogue to trigger essential mod scripts and a &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;World Map&lt;/a&gt; addition."}

To gain access to the Cave, you must get &lt;a href=\"Marlowe\"&gt;Marlowe&lt;/a&gt; to agree to pass a message to the guardian monk and allow your entry.

These tables may be interacted with (\"clicked on'). Each Table will spawn monsters (yielding a total of 110.000 XP) and disarm some of the traps that are set on the balcony and doors (reached by climbing ladders).

It is entered from the Brothel \"front\" area, where guests are greeted and order drinks and such. Along the length of the corridor are various closed doors leading to other rooms. The look of the \"brothel\" seems more like this was Brynnlaw's armory and perhaps town jail - it certainly does not have that \"festhall\" vibe one would expect in a parlor of hedonistic pleasure.\nGameplay.\nWhen first entering the cellar from the brothel your Journal will update and display:\nThis long corridor is guarded, but the party will not be able to observe the entire length upon first entry, so they will be unseen and are located further away.

She has formed a significant bond with the &lt;a href=\"spiders\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; inside the nest who feed her and keep her alive. \nBackground.\nCenteol will claim that she was once a &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt;, and was cursed by the arch-mage &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; for murdering his wife, &lt;a href=\"Tanova\"&gt;Lady Tanova&lt;/a&gt;. Centeol was obsessed with Irenicus and she wanted him to love her, but he loved only Tanova. So Centeol devised and executed a plan to kill her. When Irenicus discovered his wife's death, he animated her corpse (noted only in the original Baldur's Gate) and discovered the identity of her killer. Then he went to Centeol's tower and cursed her with obesity and put her in the nest with spiders to guard and feed her so she would live in misery.\nGameplay.\nHer lair must be entered by at least one member of the party in order to complete the side-quest, though killing her is not required. While she does turn hostile despite whatever dialogue choices are made, and is responsible for even more spiders joining the fight, her guardians are the real threat while she is practically harmless; she has no spells at her disposal despite a magic-intensive past, she can't move due to the curse she suffers from, and she has a very weak and slow melee attack.\nSince the nest does not require the entire party to enter, a viable tactic is to first bring in a hidden thief to chart the location of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Spider\"&gt;Sword Spider&lt;/a&gt;s. Then move the thief back out and bring in your tank. This will initiate the dialogue after which the tank leads one of the sword spiders outside and then just finish it off with the group. Rinse and repeat for the second sword spider. You can do the same for the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ettercap\"&gt;Ettercap&lt;/a&gt;s or just finish them inside. The two (hasted) sword spiders are the real threat here and because there's very little room to maneuver and they're likely to agro your weakest characters and possibly kill them before you can get the tank in melee range.\nRewards.\nKilling all creatures, including Centeol herself, yields 8100 &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;. Her lair also includes a treasure trove containing a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Opal%20Ring\"&gt;Fire Opal Ring&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Wand of Frost&lt;/a&gt; with 12 charges, the cursed ring &lt;a href=\"Discipliner\"&gt;Discipliner&lt;/a&gt;, the unique two-handed sword &lt;a href=\"Spider%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Spider's Bane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chelak%27s%20Body\"&gt;Chelak's Body&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\nEvery dialogue option ends with her hostility and the spawning of the two giant spiders.\n\"Kill the meat, my pets.\"\nThere is an additional line, though without anything to trigger it, presumably from after the end of the fight against all of her pets:\n\"You have defeated my ssspidersss, there is nothing I can do.

The beast will disappear from the map in 300 game seconds (5-turns), which is plenty of time for the creature to do some good.\nCerebus is a controlled creature, as is best utilized by micromanaging its movements, selecting its targets in battle, and to give it orders to launch/cast/use its spell abilities.\nThe creature has the ability to fight in melee combat, albeit at only a moderate potential effectiveness.

This means that Cerebus will, essentially, \"fight the player\" for control for two rounds before actually obeying commands adequately. In short, it will try to, in order:\n- Cast Improved Invisibility on itself, if the one cast is still available.\n- Apply (not cast, so it doesn't waste the round's \"cast\" action) a \"free\" version of Moon Dog Howl that doesn't actually use the memorized cast, immediately upon spotting an evil enemy.\n- Cast Mirror Image on itself, if it's not already protected by it and there are enough casts left.\nAlso, it will never use Healing Lick, or Moon Dog Sight on its own, so keep that in mind.\nBeyond that, don't forget that Cerebus will try to re-cast Mirror Image on its own as soon as it expires (even if you don't want it to), so you don't ever need to order it to do that."}

Igarol has some strong opinions about Cernd's abscence, and he and Cernd will have a lively exchange.

The player character will show an icon (No. 75) titled \"Contingency Active\".\nCancelling a Contingency.\nContingencies can also be cancelled (i.e. harmlessly dissipated without casting the stored spells) by pressing the \"Contingency\" button on the wizard's spellbook, then pressing the small \"hand\" button next to the contingency.\nSome example Chain Contingency combinations.\n&lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Cleric / Mage&lt;/a&gt; multiclass can also put Cleric spells into the Chain Contingency.\nResting and permanent duration.\nSince the duration is unlimited until triggered, you can memorize the Chain Contingency spell and the spells you want to put in it, cast it, then replace them in your memorized spells and rest. That way, you still have Chain Contingency active after rest, but also have more spell slots for the next encounter. Also this way you gain back the three spells which you put into Chain Contingency.\nTime stop.\nContingency and Chain Contingency will trigger even while you're immobile due to an enemy's &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, but only spells that target yourself only or otherwise don't have projectiles actually take effect during the Time Stop, since all ranged spell projectiles are paused. This means that self-only spells, spells that work on melee touch range (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Touch\"&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/a&gt;), and ranged spells that take effect without projectiles (e.g. the Power Word spells like &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Silence\"&gt;Power Word, Silence&lt;/a&gt;), do work.\nDead magic zones.\nMuch like &lt;a href=\"Contingency\"&gt;Contingency&lt;/a&gt;, Chain Contingency can trigger successfully even in dead magic zones (e.g. the room in &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Teleport%20Maze\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Teleport Maze&lt;/a&gt; where three &lt;a href=\"Cornugon\"&gt;Cornugons&lt;/a&gt; are fighting a &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt; and the player can acquire the &lt;a href=\"Purifier\"&gt;Purifier&lt;/a&gt;). However, it must be prepared before entering the area.\nTrigger delays.\nProbably due to programming reasons, the different conditions offer different delays in terms of how quickly the contingency actually triggers once the condition is met. For example, the \"see enemy\" condition almost always has a very noticeable delay between the player actually spotting an enemy and the spells being released, whereas the \"hit\" condition always triggers the release of the spells immediately.\nAfter extensive testing, this seems to be the amount of trigger delay that each condition offers (keep in mind, though, that the more trigger delay a condition has, the more variable said delay also becomes):\nAbout the \"wizard is helpless\" condition.\nAlthough the \"wizard is helpless\" condition might initially seem entirely devoted to defense (e.g. a mage is held and casts dispel magic on themselves to be cured or invisibility to avoid damage), the spell &lt;a href=\"Otiluke%27s%20Resilient%20Sphere\"&gt;Otiluke's Resilient Sphere&lt;/a&gt; in the Enhanced Editions made it possible for this condition to be used offensively in a consistent manner.\nIn the Enhanced Editions, Otiluke's Resilient Sphere doesn't require a save when cast on friendly targets, so a Mage is able to use it on themselves to be protected from almost any attack in the game. However, since the spell technically \"holds\" the Mage, they're considered \"helpless\" for the purpose of contingencies (despite being very well protected), allowing contingencies to be triggered in a more controlled manner by the player compared to other conditions, while simultaneously providing the Mage immunity to almost anything in the game.\nMoreover, another noteworthy \"positive\" spell (since Otiluke's is, essentially, a protection spell when cast on a party member) that also triggers the \"wizard is helpless\" condition is &lt;a href=\"Project%20Image\"&gt;Project Image&lt;/a&gt;. So, despite what the condition's name might suggest, it's not just \"negative\" statuses (e.g. Mage is stunned, paralyzed, webbed and so on) that trigger it.\nWhat's considered a \"hit\" for the \"wizard is hit\" condition?\nThis can be very counter-intuitive, since some attacks that do no damage are considered a hit and others aren't. And some attacks can be considered hits or not depending on the circumstances. So here are various examples of attacks that are considered hits and attacks that aren't:\nWhat's considered \"being poisoned\" for the \"wizard has been poisoned\" condition?\nActual damage-over-time \"poison effects\" coded as such, like the one caused by &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Poison (spell)&lt;/a&gt; or the ones inflicted by various spiders, but also \"bleeding\", like the effect caused by &lt;a href=\"Cornugon\"&gt;Cornugons&lt;/a&gt; (cause they're coded as \"poison effects\").\nOn the other hand, merely suffering poison damage (eg from &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;), does not count as \"being poisoned\".\nCommunity insights.\nThere are some opinionated insights available at &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Contingency/Gameplay\"&gt;Chain Contingency/Gameplay&lt;/a&gt;, that read as a discussion and are best left as an exercise for the reader to obtain useful bits of information from it.\nMod content.\nRegarding this type of spell, the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod will do the following:\nAllow players to use the individual versions of Spell Immunity in triggers&lt;br&gt;\nSpell Immunity is really eight sub-spells. This component allows a subspell to be placed into a Contingency or Spell Trigger.&lt;br&gt;\nOn Enhanced-Edition installs, this is done crudely, by introducing scrolls of the eight different versions of Spell Immunity. ToBex allows it to be done more smoothly on original-game installs.&lt;br&gt;\nMake spell sequencers, spell triggers, and contingencies learnable by all mages&lt;br&gt;\nIn the unmodded game, spell sequencers, contingencies etc. are in the Evocation school, making them unavailable to Enchanters; this is a serious weakness for the class. This component moves them to be in both the Conjuration and Evocation schools (like Wish), so that all mages may use them. The affected spells are Minor Sequencer, Spell Sequencer, Spell Trigger, Contingency, and Chain Contingency. This will not take effect if you have Spell Revisions installed (as SR takes care of this already by making them \"Universal\" School).\nWith &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; installed, this is the equivalent spell description:\nChain Contingency&lt;br&gt;\nLevel: 9&lt;br&gt;\nSchool: Universal&lt;br&gt;\nRange: Personal&lt;br&gt;\nDuration: Special&lt;br&gt;\nCasting Time: 1 round&lt;br&gt;\nArea of Effect: Special&lt;br&gt;\nSaving Throw: None&lt;br&gt;\nChain Contingency channels some of the magical energy of the mage and releases it only under certain circumstances. Basically, the mage chooses three spells, which will be released under certain conditions such as being hit by an enemy. When this condition occurs all three spells are cast immediately. Spells of up to 8th level may be used in the contingency."}
{"id": "44553", "revid": "3234315", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=44553", "title": "Chain Contingency/Gameplay", "text": "~Write your insights below, different from Gameplay section above, you may use your signatures, &lt;a href=\"Monk%23Gameplay%20.28community.29\"&gt;example page&lt;/a&gt;~\nUsage notes.\nChain Contingency is the most powerful spell in all Baldur's Gate and warps gameplay around itself. It is truly broken, so much so that fixes failed to balance it. There are numerous reasons for this hallowed distinction. As the highest level \"condition\" spell, Chain Contingency has access to almost every spell in the game, including offensive spells and Level 8 spells, with 3 total uses. This completely outclasses regular Contingency which could only cast one use of a Level 6 or lower NON offensive spell. The sequencers (Spell Trigger, Spell Sequencer, Minor Sequencer) were sometimes corrupted by bugs due to scripting events or condition changes and might fail: the contingencies never suffered from these corruptions as they were coded differently, never being stored in the innate ability slot for on-demand initiation.\nEven more ridiculous, in vanilla Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal, Chain Contingency was bugged to have no casting time. By setting a condition of \"see enemy\", a caster was capable of casting three Level 8 spells instantaneously. The prime target of this is &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest damage dealing spell in the game with a normal casting time of 8. This effectively allowed players to have an at-will nuke, at no risk to the player because Horrid Wilting only harmed enemies. While this bug was fixed in the final TOB patch, Chain Contingency remained very cheesy with the \"see enemy\" trigger, since it still lead to instantaneous death for most enemies.\nCasting three spells at once without restriction also revealed unforseen interactions with spells not intended to be cast more than once, or &lt;a href=\"Exploits%23Super%20Slayer\"&gt;transformations&lt;/a&gt; not intended to receive stat bonuses.\nWhy was this spell so overpowered? Chain Contingency is essentially a simplified, spell version of the scripting language used for NPC behavior. But unlike NPCs, who cannot adapt their scripts and do not have access to game mechanics like sleep, players are free to customize Chain Contingency to counter any surprise or challenge on the fly. When used properly during high leverage encounters, Chain Contingency can pull victories out of almost certain defeat. While practice/experience is required to master and recognize those situations, this spell is what makes miracles happen. -- () 05:07, April 08, 2018 (UTC)\nMisunderstandings &amp; Confusions.\nFrequent misunderstandings and confusions among certain players, as demonstrated in the above \"The Usage Note\" section as of today (March 24, 2019), are to be corrected in the following text:\n1) Misleading speculation: \"Chain Contingency is the most powerful spell in all Baldur's Gate...\"\n-- This is a speculation rather than a fact. Truth: there is no consensus here. If there has to be a list of candidates for the Most Powerful Spell nomination, then CC can hardly get into the top 3, which arguably have to be a contest among Time Stop, Project Image, Imprisonment, and Improved Alacrity (IA).\n2) False information: \"...regular Contingency which could only cast one use of a Level 6 or lower NON offensive spell.\"\n-- This is completely false. Truth: any one of the offensive and defensive spells, level 1 to 6, from the wizard and cleric spellbook may be put into Contingency, provided that the caster is able to cast it at the time of setting up the Contingency spell. On the other hand, a tiny number of \"NON offensive spells\" may not be put into Contingency, such as Identify or Knock (for obvious reasons).\n3) False and misleading: \"Even more ridiculous, in vanilla Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal, Chain Contingency was bugged to have no casting time... this bug was fixed in the final TOB patch...\"\n-- There are multiple layers of false information. Truths:\na) In vanilla SoA, PC and companion NPCs don't and can't have access to level 9 spellslots without cheating. Due to level cap imposed by original (vanilla) SoA, a wizard can only reach level 17. They can only have spellslots up to level 8.\nb) A spell with \"no casting time\" is not necessarily \"ridiculous\" or \"more ridiculous.\" In fact, there are other spells with no casting time, such as Spell Immunity.\nc) Having no casting time is not necessarily a bug, and BG2 has never fixed such a non-existent bug. In fact, in both BG2 (with final patch or not) and today's BG2 EE, CC has the same casting time.\n4) False and misleading: \"By setting a condition of 'see enemy', a caster was capable of casting three Level 8 spells instantaneously. The prime target of this is Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting, the strongest damage dealing spell in the game with a normal casting time of 8. This effectively allowed players to have an at-will nuke... it still lead to instantaneous death for most enemies.\"\n-- There are a few layers of false information. Truths:\na) The spells stored in CC are not meant to be cast by the caster. They are meant to be cast by the game AI.\nb) The way how the spells stored in CC are cast is not controlled by the caster/player at all - the caster/player can only set the trigger condition to one of the options. This leads to certain unpredictable behaviors of CC. For example, when the \"enemies sighted\" condition of an active CC is satisfied, the CC does not always get fired up right away. It is possible that the delay is so significant that the enemies, who could have been wiped out by the spells stored in CC, may have already killed the caster when CC is finally triggered. It is not unusual to see BG2 liches get killed when their protective CC is triggered that was meant to prevent their death.\nc) Storing 3x ADHW in CC with the trigger condition of enemies sighted is only ONE of many ways of using CC. In TOB or late game, powerful enemies tend to have high magic resistance. As a result, putting 3x ADHW in CC tends to be an unwise way of wasting spells.\nd) Getting the result of 3x L8 spells in a non-player-controlled way for the cost of those 3x L8 spells plus an extra 1x L9 spell is a quick way to drain L8/9 spells. It is so costly, especially during active combat, that CC is never an at-will nuke and can never become one.\n5) Trying to mislead everyone: \"Why was this spell so overpowered?...\"\n-- This question treats an unproven opinion as if it had already been a widely known fact. Also, what follows the question that is supposed to offer an answer to the \"why\" question, does not make sense at all.\n6) An example to demonstrate the superiority of Time Stop (TS) + Improved Alacrity (IA)\nRegardless, there are far more powerful spells and spell combos than a passive CC that consumes 1x L9 spell just so as to hand over 3 memorized (mage) or castable (sorcerer) spells to the game AI for casting them later upon a trigger condition.\nFor example, if you are a sorcerer, unless under special circumstances (such as Dead Magic) or for self-defense purposes, why would you waste 1x L9 spell to let the game AI cast 3 of YOUR L8 spells on YOUR behalf? With a single L9 spell (Time Stop), could you not cast those 3 spells by yourself - uninterrupted during your Time Stop? If you are willing to combine 2x L9 spells (Time Stop + IA), you can cast dozens of spells uninterrupted during your Time Stop - potentially resulting in 1000s of raw damage in a large area. If 3x L8 spells (ADHW) cast on enemies on sight could kill most of them (not true in tough battles late game), would 20+ spells from level 1 to 9 cast during your Time Stop lead you to a guranteed victory? Compared to the cost of 1x L9 spell in setting up a passive CC, the only mandatory extra cost of using TS + IA is just another L9 spellslot.\nHere is an example to demonstrate the superiority of Time Stop (TS) + Improved Alacrity (IA)\n1x Lower Resistance (Note: meant to counter Spell Shield just in case)\n1x Spellstrike\n3x Lower Resistance\n1x Breach\n1x Remove Mage\n6x Magic Missile\n6x Acid Arrow\n5x Skull Trap\n6x Delay Blast Fireball\n3x Dragon's Breath\n3x ADHW\n\u2192 All the above spells can be cast during TS, with these net results:\n1) One target has lost 90% or 120% magic resistance and all spell/combat protections\n2) Raw damage with max near 2000 to all enemies in a large area\n3) Up to 3x chances to knock down every enemy in the range\nNote: You could summon a Planetar to kill survivors, by casting only 2x Dragon's Breath.\nNote: a handful of enemies in BG2 /BG2EE are immune to your Time Stop. They will fight you during your Time Stop and may interrupt your spellcasting. Also, more than a handful of enemies cannot be touched by Lower Resistance and/or Breach, and some are completely immune to low-level spells. So the above example only serves as a demonstration.\nConclusions.\n1) Chain Contingency, being a top level spell, is a powerful defensive mechanism, not just a single spell. In particular, it is a best and costly way for high-level mages/sorcerers to remain powerful in all Dead/Wild Magic zones.\n2) If used offensively, however, Chain Contingency has never been the most powerful spell in the game. However, some players may mistake this spell as the most powerful one in the game, ultimately because they are unaware of the existence of more powerful spells and spell combos available to a mage/sorcerer who is approaching or has already reached their highest possible class level (up to level 31 in official BG2).\nThe above completely fails to take into account you can just rest and regain all your spell slots you used on the chain contingency. Including the slot you used on the contingency itself - contingencies and sequencers/triggers are a flat bonus to your spellbook.

It is encountered as part of the Druid stronghold quest line. It will be encountered on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Trademeet\"&gt;Trademeet&lt;/a&gt; and cajoled forth from the boy &lt;a href=\"Loren\"&gt;Loren&lt;/a&gt;. \nGameplay.\nThe party druid will be assigned a task by the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Spirit of the Grove&lt;/a&gt; to help Loren exorcise an intruding spirit from his mind. The party will find Loren in the southern outskirts of Trademeet. Speak with the boy. Through force of will and dialogue, force the spirit to engage.\nWhen asked, \"Why do you torment this boy?\" the fell spirit replies, \"He is ours! Cursed Marek thought to fight us but we are the Dark Power, the Eternal Power of nature's chaos. We cannot be defeated! They boy will not follow in Marek's footsteps! Feel true power, druid!\"\nOnce the spirit has been forced to reveal itself from Loren's mortal frame, the spirit swirls and forms into a creature of pure evil and entropy. The party must now defeat it by physical or magical means and destroy it.\nIn battle, the monster will engage in melee combat if any near to close quarters combat with it. Be careful of its &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; attack.\nThe Chaos creature will attempt spell casting, as noted in the scripted spells listed in the InfoBox. All of those will be attempted sequentially. Spell casts and melee attacks might be occurring in the same round due to scripting.\nAttention to the immunities and regeneration rate of this opponent - see the InfoBox.\nAs this creature has equipped the &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Phasing\"&gt;Boots of Phasing&lt;/a&gt;, during a battle it will exhibit an erratic and frequent jumping around the map to different opponents. Consistent with the creature's name, it is very chaotic. These boots aren't dropped or obtainable if the monster is destroyed.\nNotes.\nNot a Bug per se, but the creature uses a Fighter/Mage script for its spell casting use - however, the creature file has no mage class experience level assigned. This is not ideal and can lead to less-than-optimal spell potency for the monster.\nThe creature has an always on Blur animation, but it isn't an actual &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt; spell effect, it is just for visual purposes.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes some changes to this creature. A new default Fighter/Mage script is assigned with a \"Smarter Mage AI. SCS changes the creature's class to Fighter/Mage with a level 12/12 experience level. A different memorized spell book is available to the monster.\nWhen it becomes hostile the following instantly cast spells are launched: &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith a F/M class, the creature has a modestly improved &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;. SCS also furnishes the creature with a small &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Electricity%20damage\"&gt;Electricity damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance. Also, as a Fighter it gets a constitution HP bonus to 128 HP.\nExpect a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, and many other spells during this fight."}

Find your way to the southern most room and the exit should be there.\nOn the fourth level you will be immediately attacked by another guard. Kill him and go down the south-west passageway. There are four traps down this passageway, two of which will summon &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Horror\"&gt;Battle Horror&lt;/a&gt;s so make sure you remove them. &lt;a href=\"Davaeorn\"&gt;Davaeorn&lt;/a&gt; will hail you upon sight. He will teleport around the level a fair bit. Once he is dead, &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Five\"&gt;Chapter Five&lt;/a&gt; will begin. Make sure you pick up the &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20River%20Plug\"&gt;Key to River Plug&lt;/a&gt; off his body."}

Your old friend\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; will join your party (even if you try to send her home) and suggests that you check out &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt;'s body. Go north to the ambush site and collect the items you want from Gorion and the ogres and thugs that were killed.\nNext travel east to the &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Way\"&gt;Coast Way&lt;/a&gt; where an old man will approach you and ask questions about yourself. As you continue north to the &lt;a href=\"Friendly%20Arm%20Inn\"&gt;Friendly Arm Inn&lt;/a&gt;, you encounter &lt;a href=\"Montaron\"&gt;Montaron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xzar\"&gt;Xzar&lt;/a&gt; , two NPCs you can recruit to join your party. They are looking for help to investigate who is to blame for problems at the Nashkel Mines.\nOnce you reach the Friendly Arm Inn, a mage called &lt;a href=\"Tarnesh\"&gt;Tarnesh&lt;/a&gt; will hail you when you reach the stairs of the inn and attack. Kill him and there will be some useful items you can collect from his body.\nInside the inn you will find &lt;a href=\"Khalid\"&gt;Khalid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt; who are friends of Gorion and will offer to join your party. They will suggest you go south and take a look at the iron shortage. Also at the inn is &lt;a href=\"Bentley%20Mirrorshade\"&gt;Bentley Mirrorshade&lt;/a&gt; who will sell you items and allow you to rest.\nGo down south until you reach &lt;a href=\"Beregost\"&gt;Beregost&lt;/a&gt;.

It serves also as Prologue to \"\" \u2013 see &lt;a href=\"%23Siege%20of%20Dragonspear%20%E2%80%93%20Prologue\"&gt;further down&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you have left the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Caves\"&gt;Candlekeep Caves&lt;/a&gt; and are walking outside the walls of &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt;, Chapter Seven will begin.\nBack to the Gate.\nFirst you must leave Candlekeep and return directly to &lt;a href=\"East%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;East Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. If you first go to Wyrms Crossing, you will be approached by a &lt;a href=\"Smuggler\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; introducing himself as \"Tomlin\" the \"Owner of a small trading coster..out of Beregost\" who offers to smuggle you into the city for a price of 100 . This is unnecessary as there is no one on the bridge who will stop you, including the lone Flaming Fist Mercenary at the northwest end.\nIt's rather easy to miss small and even large parts of the storyline here if you are not walking through all sectors of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;the Gate&lt;/a&gt;, as you can find characters who have information for you in nearly every district of the city.\nCollecting evidence.\nWhilst you are in the city, lots of &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist%20Enforcer%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29%23FFHUNT\"&gt;Flaming Fist Enforcers&lt;/a&gt; are encountered walking around on the streets. If they see you they will arrest you. Again, do not resist. If they arrest you, you will be taken to &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Dosan\"&gt;Angelo&lt;/a&gt;, the new head of the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist\"&gt;Flaming Fist&lt;/a&gt;. Unless there's only one person alive in your party, do not challenge his leadership. If you do, he'll kill one of your party members. If his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Shar-Teel%20Dosan\"&gt;Shar-Teel&lt;/a&gt;, is in your party, Angelo will release you. Otherwise, you can talk to &lt;a href=\"Neb\"&gt;Neb&lt;/a&gt; in the prison who will help you get out. (The answers to his riddles are: \"thirty-three children\", \"a mirror\", and \"tomorrow\", or simply attack him.) Once you're out, any Flaming Fist soldiers now will attack you rather than arrest you. Killing a soldier will earn you a reputation decrease. As alternatives, you can defend yourself with non-lethal blows to incapacitate attackers or simply run rather than fight with weapons. You can actually be caught twice, first on street, then in the Merchants' League Estate by talking to &lt;a href=\"Aldeth%20Sashenstar\"&gt;Aldeth&lt;/a&gt; if you've completed both of his previous quests. This will allow you to experience the interactions of both Shar-Teel and Neb in a single playthrough.\nAt the entrance of East Baldur's Gate, &lt;a href=\"Husam\"&gt;Husam&lt;/a&gt; will greet you and tell you to meet him again by the &lt;a href=\"Blushing%20Mermaid\"&gt;Blushing Mermaid&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Inn. Outside the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerous%20Sundries\"&gt;Sorcerous Sundries&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Delthyr\"&gt;Delthyr&lt;/a&gt;, who works for the Harpers. He asks if you are responsible for the murder of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Throne\"&gt;Iron Throne&lt;/a&gt; leaders in Candlekeep and then gives you some information. In the northern part of this district you can meet &lt;a href=\"Herschel\"&gt;Herschel&lt;/a&gt;, who tells you a bit more about &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt; and the Iron Throne. Finally, you can find\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Tamoko\"&gt;Tamoko&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0here. Agree to meet her by the Flaming Fist Headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Southwest Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. When you meet her there she'll ask you to dispose of &lt;a href=\"Cythandria\"&gt;Cythandria&lt;/a&gt;, who is an evil influence on her lover Sarevok, and to spare his life. In southwest Baldur's Gate, you can meet &lt;a href=\"Kaella\"&gt;Kaella&lt;/a&gt; who is upset about her Iron Throne investments and, like others in town, will direct you to the Iron Throne building. &lt;a href=\"Rededge\"&gt;Rededge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shop%20of%20Silence\"&gt;Shop of Silence&lt;/a&gt; (or a nameless rogue, depending on your previous interactions with &lt;a href=\"Niklos\"&gt;Niklos&lt;/a&gt;) will comment on how much worse things are for thieves now that &lt;a href=\"Scar\"&gt;Scar&lt;/a&gt; has been replaced by Angelo.\nIn &lt;a href=\"South%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;South Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; you will be approached by &lt;a href=\"Brennan%20Risling%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;Brennan Risling&lt;/a&gt; who will tell you more of rising tensions with Amn and his support for Sarevok as Grand Duke. You can also meet &lt;a href=\"Jonavin\"&gt;Jonavin&lt;/a&gt; of the Flaming Fist who will relate how close the city is to war is with Amn. &lt;a href=\"Kolvar\"&gt;Kolvar&lt;/a&gt; will also give you a good deal of information if you charm him or have Montaron or Xzar in your party, though it can be a challenge to get to him without triggering the guards. The easiest way to do so is to come in from Central Baldur's Gate.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Central%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Central Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; you can meet &lt;a href=\"Addy\"&gt;Addy&lt;/a&gt; who will ask you to investigate the Iron Throne as others have. You may also once again speak with the Diviner in the tent, who you can ask \"Who framed us for the murder of the Iron Throne Leaders?\" &amp; \"Why is Eltan so ill?\" both of which add to your journal.\nIn &lt;a href=\"West%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;West Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; your party will be approached by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Lothtyran%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;Sir Lothtyran&lt;/a&gt; who will fill you in on the upcoming inauguration ceremony. You can also meet &lt;a href=\"Hecito\"&gt;Hecito&lt;/a&gt;, an Amnian messenger who will warn of upcoming war.\n&lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Southeast Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; features &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Blackblade\"&gt;Alan Blackblade&lt;/a&gt;, a thief who will provide you with rumors about the Duke's illness and suggest raiding the Flaming Fist headquarters.\nYou can head towards &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Northwest Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Entar%20Silvershield%27s%20Estate\"&gt;Entar Silvershield's Estate&lt;/a&gt; to find the prostitute &lt;a href=\"Sugar\"&gt;Sugar&lt;/a&gt;. She will point you towards &lt;a href=\"Ivanne\"&gt;a witness&lt;/a&gt; of the murder of Scar. This will lead you to the &lt;a href=\"Blushing%20Mermaid\"&gt;Blushing Mermaid&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0inn in &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Northeast Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutside the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Old%20Kegs\"&gt;Three Old Kegs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"North%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;North Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, a Flaming Fist member named &lt;a href=\"Sorrel\"&gt;Sorrel&lt;/a&gt; will give you more info on the current events. Inside the inn, you\u2019ll find Delthyr again if you talked with him before, and he will tell you of his suspicions for &lt;a href=\"Rashad\"&gt;Rashad&lt;/a&gt;, Duke Eltan's healer. And in front of the palace you can find &lt;a href=\"Bill\"&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt; who asks for your invitation to Sarevok's coronation.\nEnter the Flaming Fist building and you will meet &lt;a href=\"Benjy\"&gt;Benjy&lt;/a&gt;. An ambush will happen. It is safe to kill the Flaming Fist officers here, you can do this without suffering penalties. Go upstairs and you will see &lt;a href=\"Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;. He suspects the healer, Rashad, attending to &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Eltan\"&gt;Duke Eltan&lt;/a&gt; is a fraud. Interrogate the healer and he will turn into a greater doppelganger. Kill him. Talk to Eltan. He is injured and he wants you to take him to the &lt;a href=\"Harbor%20Master%27s%20Building\"&gt;Harbor Master's Building&lt;/a&gt;. He also wants you to stop the assassins &lt;a href=\"Krystin\"&gt;Krystin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slythe\"&gt;Slythe&lt;/a&gt;, and take the &lt;a href=\"Invitation\"&gt;Invitation&lt;/a&gt; from Slythe that will get you into the &lt;a href=\"Ducal%20Palace\"&gt;Ducal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Head to the Harbor Master's building in South Baldur's Gate.\nWhen you have taken &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Eltan%27s%20Body\"&gt;Duke Eltan's Body&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Harbor%20Master\"&gt;Harbor Master&lt;/a&gt;, enter the Iron Throne building. &lt;a href=\"Dhanial\"&gt;Dhanial&lt;/a&gt; will address you on the way out the building. A few steps north you will be drawn into dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Pang%20Wallen\"&gt;Pang Wallen&lt;/a&gt;, who is reeling from the collapse of the Iron Throne. If you immediately threaten him he will attack. Otherwise he will give away some of the plans afoot. Go up to the 2nd floor and talk to &lt;a href=\"Gregor\"&gt;Gregor&lt;/a&gt;. If you tell him you were accused of the murders of the Iron Throne he will attack, otherwise he will declare his disgust for Sarevok much like Pang and will leave. &lt;a href=\"Tralithan\"&gt;Tralithan&lt;/a&gt; is in the south part of this floor and is equally defeated from Sarevok's mishandling of the Iron Throne. &lt;a href=\"Kalessia\"&gt;Kalessia&lt;/a&gt; will address you on the third floor and yet again express her confusion as to the state of the Iron Throne. &lt;a href=\"Wirthing\"&gt;Wirthing&lt;/a&gt; on the fourth floor will say much the same things as the rest. Go up to the fifth floor. Cythandria will hail you and summon her Ogres (&lt;a href=\"Arghh%20%26amp%3B%20Ughh\"&gt;Arghh and Ughh&lt;/a&gt;) to attack you. Kill her or spare her life, just be sure to collect &lt;a href=\"The%20Diary%20of%20Sarevok\"&gt;Sarevok's diary&lt;/a&gt; either way.\nObtaining the invitation.\nNext, go to Northeast Baldur's Gate, western section. There you can find &lt;a href=\"Husam\"&gt;Husam&lt;/a&gt;, who is not a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%27%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves' Guild&lt;/a&gt;, but in fact, a Shadow Thief of Amn. He and his Shadow Thieves are willing to help you to bring down Sarevok, and end the rumors of Amn provoking a war with Baldur's Gate. Husam will direct you to &lt;a href=\"Ilmater%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;Ilmater's Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, which has a secret entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Undercellar\"&gt;Undercellar&lt;/a&gt; and wants you to take the invitation from Slythe and Krystin, two assassins hired by Sarevok. Kill them both and take the invitation. Go back to Husam, they will try to find a way to sneak into the Ducal Palace while you will enter the palace with the invitation. Go to North Baldur's Gate.\nGive the invitation you took from Slythe to &lt;a href=\"Bill\"&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance of the palace and you will gain access. Another Flaming Fist inside will want to see your invitation and you can simply show it again. You will find Sarevok set to be the new head duke of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. You can safely prepare here with protection magic (potions, spells, scrolls), though most threats will be only physical and this is not the last battle. You can also search the entire building for extra scrolls and potions beforehand. When you move within about 15 feet of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Belt\"&gt;Duke Belt&lt;/a&gt;, a dialogue will be triggered between Sarevok and the nobles present, but the latter will all transform into greater doppelgangers. Kill them but make sure either Duke Belt or &lt;a href=\"Liia%20Jannath\"&gt;Liia Jannath&lt;/a&gt; survive, otherwise &lt;a href=\"Winski%20Perorate\"&gt;Winski Perorate&lt;/a&gt; will materialize and you will be instantly killed. \nOnce you have killed the doppelgangers you can reveal Sarevok as a scoundrel. The dukes will want proof of Sarevok's mischief. If you have none they will kill you. If you produce evidence - either Sarevok's diary or Sarevok's &lt;a href=\"Letter_from_Sarevok_to_Slythe\"&gt;letter to Slythe&lt;/a&gt; - Sarevok will attack. Fight him until he is teleported away by Winski Perorate. Attacking the dukes will also result in instant death. Duke Belt or Duchess Liia will then teleport you to the Thieves' Guild in East Baldur's Gate so you can pursue Sarevok. After you have revealed Sarevok as the true threat to Baldur's Gate your name will be cleared and you can walk around anywhere without fear of being arrested.\nHunting down Sarevok.\nWhen you are in the Guild head down the stairs into the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%27%20Maze\"&gt;Thieves' Maze&lt;/a&gt;. When you are downstairs &lt;a href=\"Voleta%20Stiletto\"&gt;Voleta Stiletto&lt;/a&gt; will explain the maze and why she is laying injured. Navigate the maze until you reach the exit. Watch out as there are many traps and tough monsters within. Next to the exit you will find Winski lying on the floor. He too has been injured by the fleeing Sarevok. You can question his role and what Sarevok's plans are.\nThe exit will lead to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Go west in the Undercity and you will see &lt;a href=\"Rahvin\"&gt;Rahvin&lt;/a&gt; and his crew. He is also looking for Sarevok, having been sent by the Iron Throne. He recognizes you and decides that he wants the bounty on your head over chasing Sarevok. Kill him and his party and keep going west. Outside the gates to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Temple of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; you will find &lt;a href=\"Tamoko\"&gt;Tamoko&lt;/a&gt;. She feels compelled to right the wrongs she has done against Sarevok by killing you. You can fight her or, if your NPC Reaction is 15-20, you convince her not to attack in which case she will leave.\nWhen Tamoko is out of the way, go through the gates and enter the Temple of Bhaal. The temple is flooded with traps. None of the traps on the circle in the middle can\u00a0be removed. There are also traps between the reaper statues and on the stairs to where Sarevok and his lackeys. When you see him Sarevok will hail you. He, Angelo, &lt;a href=\"Tazok\"&gt;Tazok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Semaj\"&gt;Semaj&lt;/a&gt; will all attack. This will be an extremely difficult battle. As soon as Sarevok is dead the final cutscene will play, in which you see the essence of Bhaal going back his domain.\nThe end is the beginning.\nCongratulations, you have completed \"Baldur's Gate\"! But your journey is only just beginning, as it can be continued in the \"Siege of Dragonspear\". Otherwise, see &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%201\"&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/a&gt; to continue your adventure in the \".\nSiege of Dragonspear \u2013 Prologue.\nChapter Seven \u2013 Prologue is the first part of the \" , following the final events in the \"Baldur's Gate\" portion of the chapter.\nYou start just with the same party if you imported from save, excluding Imoen, or with a party fitting to your alignment otherwise. So, you shouldn't worry too much about losing good items during importing. However, if a character from your party is not available in next chapters, his inventory will be transferred into the chest, but everything equipped(quick-slots included) will be gone."}

Before you can enter Candlekeep, you will need to give the &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Portal\"&gt;Keeper of the Portal&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Nether%20Scrolls\"&gt;History of the Nether Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; that you received from the Duke.\nIf you have explored the map inside, you will notice that things have changed. You need to enter the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Library\"&gt;Candlekeep Library&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the map. Once inside, &lt;a href=\"Karan\"&gt;Karan&lt;/a&gt; will talk to you and reveal some odd facts about &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Koveras&lt;/a&gt;. On the second floor, Koveras will talk to you and pressure you to attack the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Throne\"&gt;Iron Throne&lt;/a&gt; leaders. On the back of the third floor is &lt;a href=\"Rieltar%20Anchev\"&gt;Rieltar&lt;/a&gt; and the other Iron Throne leaders. You can kill them, talk to them or avoid them. If you kill Rieltar, the second and fourth floors will be filled with &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; intent on your arrest. If you have talked to Rieltar or Koveras you will be arrested outside the library or on the sixth floor. Do not resist in any way or you will be instantly killed. On the fifth floor &lt;a href=\"Piato\"&gt;Piato&lt;/a&gt; will show a letter &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt; left for you in his room. On the sixth floor a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gatewarden\"&gt;Gatewarden&lt;/a&gt; will be there and will arrest you.\nAfter you have been arrested, you will be sent to the jail inside the Barracks. &lt;a href=\"Ulraunt\"&gt;Ulraunt&lt;/a&gt; will talk to you and find you guilty no matter what you say and sentence you to death. &lt;a href=\"Tethtoril\"&gt;Tethtoril&lt;/a&gt; will then appear, explaining that Koveras is actually Sarevok and offer to teleport you to the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Catacombs\"&gt;Candlekeep Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. Accept this.\nEnter the catacombs on your right. If you want to rest, do it before you enter since there is no penalty for resting in the small room.\nGo up the passageway where &lt;a href=\"Phlydia\"&gt;Phlydia&lt;/a&gt; will approach you. She will turn into a doppelganger and attack. You can go down the south-west corridor and there will be three routes, each leading to a tomb. The tombs will contain lots of useful items. Watch out as there are lots of traps in these passages and the tombs will be trapped themselves. When you are done, go to the north-east corridor taking you to the second level of the catacombs.\nOn the second level there are lots of old friends around, all who are actually doppelgangers. Even the likes of Gorion and &lt;a href=\"Elminster\"&gt;Elminster&lt;/a&gt; will be there. Only &lt;a href=\"Arkanis\"&gt;Arkanis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deder\"&gt;Deder&lt;/a&gt; are real and will offer to fight alongside you. If you accuse them of being doppelgangers and your reputation is less than 8, they will attack. If it is 8 or higher, they will leave the area. There are lots of archways with traps in between some of the arches. Inside the archways there will be lots of skeletons. Go to the north-west of the catacomb and proceed up the passage until you reach the next exit.\nAfter going through the exit, you will be in the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Caves\"&gt;Candlekeep Caves&lt;/a&gt;. Beware of more traps. Just south you will find &lt;a href=\"Prat\"&gt;Prat&lt;/a&gt; and his party. They will attack. Kill them and keep going south. You will eventually be facing some Basilisks. Walk south and then west from that area. You will find &lt;a href=\"Diarmid\"&gt;Diarmid&lt;/a&gt; who will mistake you for Prat. Pretend you are Prat so you can gain information from him. Eventually he will find out you're not Prat but will go away rather than attacking because he is too busy. Follow him to the exit. Once you are outside again,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Seven\"&gt;Chapter Seven&lt;/a&gt; will begin."}

Starting a new game first asks difficulty, then you decide your race, class, starting equipment, and more. The character you create here is the \"leader\" of the party. You could choose a different origin story, for example selecting Astarion changes certain dialogs, but the main story remains. If you play as an Origin Character, you will not encounter them in the world, they will be the leader of the group. This prevents copies of the same character in the world of Baldur's Gate.\nOrigin.\nThe first step in character creation is to decide whether to create a custom character, or choose one of the premade &lt;a href=\"Origin%20Characters%20%28BG3%29\"&gt;Origin Characters&lt;/a&gt;. If you chose to play an existing character, you will be unable to alter the race, class, background and appearance. You can still modify spells (if any), Fighting Style (if any), ability points, and skill proficiencies. Please note \"The Dark Urge\" does not follow the same restrictions as other Origin Characters, but rather the \"Custom\" instead.\nRace.\nIn Baldur's Gate III, you can choose from 11 races. Seven of these have two or more subraces, allowing you to further increase your character's unique design and abilities. Each race grants specific weapon armor, and skill proficiencies, as well as race and subraces (if any) features. Selecting a race is permanent, including subraces, after character creation!"}

At any point in the process, you may press \"cancel\" and will be prompted if you wish to return to the main game screen. To go back during character creation, press the up arrow at the bottom left of the screen. You may also choose to &lt;a href=\"Importing%20a%20Character\"&gt;import&lt;/a&gt; an existing character.\nGender.\nThe gender of your character is decided first. You can select either male or female. Once selected, press the \"Done\" button (as on every page). Gender chosen does not affect game-play\u2014save for minor dialogue choices and romance options.\nAppearance: Portrait Selection.\nSelect a portrait for your character.\nTo import a custom portrait, check the instructions in the Read Me file on the installation CD.\nRace.\nSelect the race of your character. There are six available character races. Choose between &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"halfling\"&gt;halfling&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Baldur's gate 2, you may also play as a &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;\nDescriptions of each race are given in the area beneath the selection boxes.\nClass.\nThe classes and class combination that are available to the race you have chosen will be highlighted. Choose the class that you want from the list.\u00a0\nDescriptions of each class are noted in the area beneath the selection boxes.\nMulti-class.\nMulti-classed characters are available to non-humans only and share the traits and restrictions of both classes. Human characters can choose to become dual class later in the game.\nDual-class.\nDual class characters start their adventuring life as one class and then later switch to a different class, the abilities of the former class are unavailable until the character surpasses the level of their former class with the level of their new class. At this time, the abilities of both classes are available at their current level. The character can never advance further in the former class. Only humans can be dual classed characters.\nAbility Scores.\nYou'll see a screen with the abilities the computer has randomly determined for your character (calculated as if you rolled three 6-sided die for each ability, adjusted for character race). Any class minimums will be automatically selected for the character for abilities that were too low (i.e., if the character needs a 17 charisma to be a paladin, and computer rolled a 12, then the player will receive 17). You can subtract points form an ability to add to another; however, you cannot take points away from an ability if it will lower the ability below racial or class minimums. Each ability will have a caption describing it. Re Roll your abilities as many times as you like until you reach a combination you are happy with.\nYou may also store 1 set of abilities and roll again by clicking on the \"store\" button. You may bring the stored set up again by clicking on the \"recall\" button. Only one set may be stored at a time but may be overwritten.\nAlignments.\nThe player has a choice of alignments according to his class and race. Each alignment will have a caption describing it in detail. Your alignment determines how your character interacts with his environment. Read over each carefully before choosing. If you stray severely from your alignment during the course of the game, there will be consequences - you may even suffer loss of some of your abilities. &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s become fallen when their behavior is out of line with their alignment. Fallen classes lose their special abilities and there is no way they can redeem themselves, unless you export/import the character into Shadows of Amn. You can then complete all the paladin tasks for the Radiant Heart stronghold or the ranger tasks for the village of Imnesvale and your status will be restored. But by then you will have too much experience to be able to transfer the character back to Baldur's Gate or BG: Tales of the Sword Coast.\nSkills.\nHere, you pick what weapons you want to be proficient in. The available options are limited by class.\nWhile all classes can assign points into &lt;a href=\"weapon%20proficiencies\"&gt;weapon proficiencies&lt;/a&gt;, some have also access to &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;Thieving Abilities&lt;/a&gt; and can invest additional points here. For some of those classes,\u00a0the points are automatically assigned to certain skills, such as a &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; gets &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; appropriate to their &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nChoose colors for your character's clothing. Be colorful and pick whatever draws your attention!\nName.\nChoose a name. Choose wisely because this will be your name for the whole game.\nStarting equipment.\nFor a detailed listing, regarding specific items and classes, see &lt;a href=\"Starting%20equipment\"&gt;the main article&lt;/a&gt;.\nExperience.\nStarting experience point doesn't apply if the imported character has more experience than the minimal requirement.\nSources.\nThis information comes straight from the &lt;a href=\"Game%20guides\"&gt;Baldur's Gate game manual&lt;/a&gt;."}

The diggers all give you the same advice if you speak to them: \nWhen you speak to Charleston, dialog responses 1, 1, 2, 3, 1 (shown below) will get you a job as security for the dig, paying for one day's watch on the site. \nCharleston will leave once you are done talking to him, and &lt;a href=\"Gallor\"&gt;Gallor&lt;/a&gt; will then approach you with a different offer.\nOnce you are done with Gallor, you must speak to Charleston again at the entrance to the excavation to advance the story: \nThen comes a cut scene in which you follow Charleston into and through the excavation to a chamber with a stone sarcophagus, where Charleston's joy at the discovery is quickly marred by all of his workers going mad and attacking your party. You are then given the choice of concluding your contract peacefully, for whatever gold reward you may have negotiated and , or you can kill him for a huge &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; penalty, , a &lt;a href=\"Sunstone%20Gem\"&gt;Sunstone Gem&lt;/a&gt;, and your gold reward (which may be 0, 50, or 100 ). \nFinally, you can loot the sarcophagus for the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Kozah\"&gt;Idol of Kozah&lt;/a&gt; (which Charleston has warned you to leave untouched), and carry it outside for a challenging encounter with its guardian &lt;a href=\"Doomsayer\"&gt;Doomsayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialog.\nThe dialog that leads to the offer is shown here.

You look to be excavating a tomb of sorts.\n\"You are partially right, though it's not a tomb, but an ancient settlement. It is also all that remains of a primitive race long since extinct, and we know little about their culture save that they seem to have destroyed themselves in war. Perhaps today we will learn something more. We are just about to break through into an inner chamber, perhaps the dwelling of the village shaman himself. Mayhaps you could be of assistance to us? We need but keep the camp secure a short while longer. Your very presence would probably dissuade anyone from attacking us, though I do not know the force behind our misfortune. They seem to take great pleasure in minor sabotage and kidnapping, though some of the missing men may have just run off from fear.

Once identified, the true name and purpose of the item is revealed.\nMany items that are unidentified can't be used by a character until they are identified. For instance, a wand, potion, or scroll. Curiously, even if the party already identified an exact duplicate item previously, the game doesn't allow this knowledge to carry over and identify a duplicate automatically - thus having to identify the same item again, and again.\nSome items that are unidentified can be equipped by a character, and will confer their powers/abilities, even if not identified. This also can be potentially perilous if the item is \"cursed\".\nAs of the \"Tales of the Sword Coast\" Expansion, unidentified items will appear with a blue watermark over them in your inventory. The watermark will disappear after the identification.\nMany merchants and temples offer an identification service for a fee.\nMove the mouse/cursor over to the item displayed on the charachter record &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt; screen and then right click, the character will try to identify the item using their &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;.

If able, Ifhateer will attempt to cast a &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; first, which may target multiple party members if applicable. \nAfterwards will likely be a second Chain Lightning, then perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Fog\"&gt;Death Fog&lt;/a&gt; or up to two &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; spell casts in a row, and finally an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; - after that her spell casting is basically finished.\nThese spell casting attempts assume she isn't disrupted from her casting sequence by damage or other interruption.\nShe has limited accuracy with her long sword but has an above average number of &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe fight can be a surprisingly difficult for an unprepared party, mainly because of the potential use of poison spells. In addition, an ordinary Rakshasa like &lt;a href=\"Saadat\"&gt;Saadat&lt;/a&gt; can only be harmed by magical weapons. Also, only spells of &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; 8 or above can affect them. Certain consumables and abilities that bypass Power Level constraints could be useful. \nIf killed, Ihtafeer drops a &lt;a href=\"Periapt%20of%20Proof%20Against%20Poison\"&gt;Periapt of Proof Against Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ihtafeer%27s%20Head\"&gt;her head&lt;/a&gt; and an ordinary long sword. This changed in the Enhanced Edition as her head is moved to an armor slot to prevent stealing it.\nIn both her head and the periapt can be pick-pocketed, even before taking the quest from the genies.\nMod Gallery.\n&lt;a href=\"Afaaq%20the%20Djinni%20Companion\"&gt;Afaaq the Djinni Companion&lt;/a&gt; mod makes some changes in this encounter. The first will be that Saadat and Jalaal are not present in human form inside the store. They only appear via a teleportation animation if and when hostilities begin. The second is that after all three of the Raksasha have been destroyed, a teleportation portal will appear on the upper deck of the area. The party must decide if they will enter the portal, to open up the adventures offered to begin this modification.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises the AI, scripts and spell usage of the Rakshasas. Ihtafeer is provided a larger repertoire of arcane mage to select. When she transitions from Adratha the Witch to the Rukh form, a group of uninterruptible protective buffs (previously cast) will manifest upon her. These include &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Dispelling Screen\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;. One round later &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; will be applied. As can be seen from these buffs, she is very difficult to strike, and few spells can get through until she has been attacked with appropriate magic removers. \nUnlike the unmodified version of Ihtafeer, she does not rigidly follow only a certain path with subsequent offensive spells. These are determined by the Party's protections detected by the AI and vulnerabilities identified. She may never use Cloudkill (but she can) for example. With a new compliment of spells, the Raksasha can banish summoned creatures, she can Breach, Secret Word, has more than one Mirror Image and PfMW, will caste multiple AoE attacks such as &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Horror\"&gt;Horror&lt;/a&gt; and . She can also attempt &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, although her casting level isn not very high.\nIhtafeer has a prepared &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; that can be instantly released.\nSCS has changed her weapon proficiencies to 3 pips in long sword, and 2 pips in single weapon fighting style which results in improved THAC0, damage, and armor class. If hasted she can strike 4.5 times per round. \nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; she will use the SR spells. If Icewind Dale spells are added to the game, she will have \"Icelance\" and \"Emotion: Despair\" for example."}

The creature is nearly identical copy of the &lt;a href=\"Karun%20the%20Black\"&gt;Karun the Black&lt;/a&gt; file, including spell use script and equipment. \nWhen hostilities commence, the mage applies (instant uninterruptible casting) &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, followed by another set of instantly applied buffs to include &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.

The script is rigid in that Karun has no means to dispel magic or Breach or remove spell protections. He just chucks spells and waits to see what happens.\nMod content.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; mod some revisions are made to this mage, mostly to enhance its powers and abilities.\nCombined with the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod, an excellent overhaul to the AI and Ascension scripts is made. Using both mods together will improve the challenge and ensure scripts and compatibility with the EE game are realized. \nThe mage is now a female, and may have a Conjurer Kit assigned. She has Intelligence raised to 18 (so can legally cast level 9 spells). The mage is equipped with some additional items in a quick slot &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Superior%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Superior Healing&lt;/a&gt; for self healing.\nWhen hostilities begin the mage will apply (previously cast) spells to include, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity Abjuration&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Dispelling Screen\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, \"Mind Blank\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom this point on the SCS Smarter Mage scripts will evaluate opponent protection and vulnerabilities to help determine what offensive or conjuration spells will be attempted.

She may have several henchmen accompanying her, depending on how powerful Gorion's Ward's party is.\nGameplay.\nDespite being a member of The Five, Illasera is a fairly weak opponent and has very simple behaviors. She also does not have any notable abilities or defenses, aside from immunity to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s. If the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; landed here imported from the final fight against &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;, all buffs will be stripped, but the spells that have been used in that fight have not been memorized again. While this puts the party at a slight disadvantage, she should still not pose a threat \u2013 her posturing is just that.\nIllasera's spells are cast at the lowest power level, as she has only one mage level. Most of her spells are cast only once, and in a fixed order. \nShe opens up with a &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and then a &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt;. If any summoned creatures are detected a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; will be attempted. If Illasera is silenced she will deploy a &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt;. \nOffensively, Illasera typically casts spells at her nearest enemy, such as a &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Summoning%20I\"&gt;Monster Summoning I&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull Trap&lt;/a&gt;. Further into the battle, if she is still alive and able, a &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Symbol, Stun&lt;/a&gt; and perhaps an &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt; will be attempted.\nIllasera has four henchmen (three fighters and one mage) but depending on the party's level and the number of party members, they may not all appear. If the main character is alone, or if the party's level is lower than 10, only Illasera will appear. If the party's level is at least 20 and there are fewer than four party members, or if the party's level is lower than 20 and there is at least one other party member, the three fighters will appear. In all other cases, all four henchmen will appear.\nBlack Reaver.\nIn the basic or EE version of the game, depending on the party level and number of party members, Illasera will have allied help known as a \"Black Reaver\". Each is worth 5,000 XP. A synopsis is provided below of their capabilities:\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; Mod restores Illasera to the initial designs. Installation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; improves the AI of her and any allies she has with her. SCS also builds a little bit onto Illasera's Ascension capabilities and provides some SCS random treasure. This Bhaalspawn is orders of magnitude more difficult opponent than the unmodified game - be aware!\nIllasera is changed to a unique Bhaalspawn Level 18 Ranger class, with 2 uses of &lt;a href=\"Hardiness\"&gt;Hardiness&lt;/a&gt;, which she will apply. She has 2 pips proficiency in dagger and shortbow. She has a few unique Bhaalspawn powers and adjusted abilities including:\nShe is equipped with three undroppable but special &lt;a href=\"Shortbow\"&gt;Shortbow&lt;/a&gt;s that emulate her special bow attack talents and powers. By script, she will switch uses of these bows as required based on the target's protections. They all provide their own limitless ammo, striking as +5 enchantment. They all deal 1d6+9 missile damage and get a +9 THAC0 bonus. They fire as fast as a Tuigan bow, and with her bow proficiency and fighter experience level, she averages 4.5 attacks per round. Each bow has a special on-hit ability (bypasses all magic spell protections and magic resistance):\nIllasera is also equipped with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Princes\"&gt;Ring of the Princes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Superior%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Superior Healing&lt;/a&gt; x6 (which she uses if damaged, especially while invisible).\nBlack Reaver Mod Content - Ascension and SCS change the Black Reavers. They carry some gold and random treasure as well. A synopsis is provided below of their capabilities:\nIf the player installed the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/A-Wizard-Did-It/Black-Hearts-BG1\"&gt;Black Hearts&lt;/a&gt; for BG1 mod and would like Illasera to have dialogue/plot elements in Throne of Bhaal, then install either the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/A-Wizard-Did-It/Black-Hearts-BG2\"&gt;Black Hearts BG2&lt;/a&gt; patch, or the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/A-Wizard-Did-It/Black-Hearts-EET\"&gt;Black Hearts EET&lt;/a&gt; if rolling with the mod.

Unfortunately, there wasn't enough left in the game files or dialogue for the &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20for%20BG2\"&gt;Unfinished Business for BG2&lt;/a&gt; modders to restore it without creating brand new content."}
{"id": "14126", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14126", "title": "Illithid Hideout in the Sewers", "text": "Illithid Hideout in the Sewers is a dungeon accessible through a secret wall panel in the northeastern part (2484, 340) of the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Sewers&lt;/a&gt; underneath the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;. The \"fog of war\" blocks any view of what might be beyond the panel, and no means of dispelling that obscured part of the map.\nThe secret wall panel can be discovered as early as &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%202\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;. The panel has a difficulty of 90 to detect. Examination of the panel will only reveal that it is \"locked\" with no other information. The panel can't be opened, nor will a &lt;a href=\"Knock\"&gt;Knock&lt;/a&gt; spell do anything, and it can't be forced. \nDescription of Area.\nAssuming the party was able to get the key needed to enter the corridor to this area, make way past the rotting corpses of unknown adventurers and climb the steps to the new map. The fact that some kind of force may have temporarily stunned the party weighs heavily on the mind.\nTransitioning from the previous corridor in the Sewers, the party will see a strange and almost \"alien\" architecture, stonework, colorings, and perceive a foreign and unidentifiable background odor. The place is silent except for a barely discernable low frequency throb. The hairs on the back of your neck and arms seem to stand up on their own.\nThis place is not the work of elves, dwarves or human societies as far as one can tell.\nGameplay (abbreviated walkthrough).\nThe entry chamber.\nThe party makes the transition up the stairs into this round chamber. Everyone's senses take in the sights, sounds and smells. \nA soft illumination is provided throughout the room from the very material comprising the ceiling itself.\nThere are no denizens, objects, or furnishings to be seen. No debris or filth of any kind is observed. On the western side is a corridor leading further into the complex.\nThe second chamber.\nWhen ready, investigate the corridor leading westward, and a closed door of some kind of altered wood and iron is shut before you. Some barely audible sounds are picked up behind it - perhaps an unintelligible voice? It's too faint to make anything out, and the alien door is tightly fitted to frame and flush with the floor, although it has a conventional handle to open it with.\nWhen prepared, open the door and peer inside or enter the next chamber - which is another roundish room, with a closed door on the western side.\nWithin are seen a group of somber humans in various dress. All are garbed in armor, or robes and they have weaponry readied. At the western side is a brutish &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;Umber Hulk&lt;/a&gt; squatting down, and one of those horrible illithids, or &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt; you've heard about (and maybe even faced before).\nIf any party members are detected, the group will spring into hostile action.\nThe archers will attempt to let loose arrows, the fighters will rush forward with their drawn weapons, the assassin will skulk and try and get in a piercing stab. There is also a cleric, and a mage in the rear that will try in earnest to get up some initial magic.\nKeep an eye out for the charging umber hulk - which will likely precede that with its innate confusion attack. Likewise, the mind flayer will soon launch a &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Blast\"&gt;Psionic Blast&lt;/a&gt; at the party.\nIf the party triumphs, various items can be gathered from the fallen humans, who were apparently dire charmed and controlled by the domineering illithids.\nThe third section.\nSteel your nerves and open another closed door leading westward. \nA fairly lengthy curving corridor stretches before the party, ending in another closed door. With all the noise created by the previous fight, it's unlikely that any other illithids within aren't already alerted to your presence. \nUse stealth or not and see what lies ahead. Within is a third circular room with fully alert brood of mind flayers and a pair of &lt;a href=\"Ulitharid\"&gt;Ulitharid&lt;/a&gt; creatures. Another umber hulk pet is within as well.\nWhen a party member is detected the illithids will launch their psionic attacks, then move toward the party to engage with their tentacles and attempt to perform a \"Devour Brain\" assault.\nThe umber hulk will also race forward and might be able to fire one of its confusion projectiles.\nPlan your attack and defense as desired. You know that after these enemies there is yet another corridor leading to the north part of the complex.\nThe final chamber.\nThrough a door a corridor curves north ending with a shut door. So far none of these doors has been barred or locked. As if the inhabitants don't worry about being invaded. The party will put them to the test and see if they can't clear out this nest of evil.\nMake necessary preparations and enter through the door. Within is a room ringed by strange fonts of unusual liquid. A central one is also placed. \nInside the chamber are two umber hulks, two ulitharids, three mind flayers and an &lt;a href=\"Alhoon\"&gt;Alhoon&lt;/a&gt;. When a party member enters the combat log displays a text message from this creature - it doesn't speak, so presumably this is some kind of telepathic message.\nWhen a party member is detected, the group will initiate hostile actions and attack. Expect the usual onslaught of psionic attacks, confusion from the hulks, as well as some preparatory protective spells cast upon the Alhoon.\nNote that the door to this room can't be closed once opened. It is likely that various monsters within will follow the party into the corridor. Perhaps this can be used to the player's advantage.\nWhen the last of the illithid group falls, search the final room central container for some very nice loot. A cryptic manuscript is also found. \nThus ends this strange gathering of evil below the streets of the temple district.\nBugs.\nAs of BG2EE 2.6, several doors in various areas, including this one, would disappear when opened, leaving no way to close them. This is identified for correction in the pending Enhanced Edition Fix Pack (EEFP).\nReference: (ar0406.are, ar0711.are, ar1302.are, ar1307.are, ar1307.are, ar5007.are)\nSpoiler.\nFor further information regarding how to find the key to open the secret wall panel that allows entry to this area, a \"Spoiler\" reveal button is provided below. Don't open it if you want to figure this out on your own as the game intended for a first-time player. That's part of the game's immersion and appeal.\nDefeat &lt;a href=\"Tazok\"&gt;Tazok&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Firkraag's Maze&lt;/a&gt; - the key is amongst his carried items.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod places a bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Brain%20Golem\"&gt;Brain Golem&lt;/a&gt; next to the Alhoon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises all the AI scripts for the enemies in this area. If the \"Smarter Mind Flayers\" component is installed this will greatly increase the variety of &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; choices available to the illithids, and help to counter some of the tactics used by players such as relying on &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;. The illithids now have other ways to attack the party that can't be blocked with only one spell.\nAll illithids are typically invisible or under weak invisibility at the outset of battle with this mod. It makes single target spell casting difficult. \nA skeleton servant is also with the enslaved Cleric. The \"Assassin\" is now an actual assassin and will use &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Weapon\"&gt;Poison Weapon&lt;/a&gt; and backstab from invisibility, then try it again, and then yet again using potions to attain stealth.\nAnd finally, the Alhoon is designed as a pseudo-lich/ulitharid, and has a wide array of arcane spells and HLA's.\nThese changes make this area probably too tough for a party to handle if still in chapter 2, but it depends on the player's skill of course."}

Imix will engage the party in a hostile manner once detected, along with &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Man\"&gt;Burning Man&lt;/a&gt; allies. Imix uses the standard fire elemental animation, although a constant &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; graphic is also upon the creature as well. \nDescription.\nImix is in most respects an upper echelon Fire Elemental. The creature has some passive immunities, and a few special powers. Some of these are granted by undroppable items equipped.\nImix also wears the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20the%20Master%20Harper\"&gt;Amulet of the Master Harper&lt;/a&gt; in its neck slot, and will receive the powers of that item, which in regard to Imix are immunity to &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt; and a bonus to &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; rating. These are included in the InfoBox figures.\nThe elemental is able to see invisible or hidden foes by script, as long as they are within its range of detection. \nWhen the creature strikes an opponent in melee combat, it will apply crushing and fire damage, and will also manifest a moderate &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect. Details can be reviewed on the &lt;a href=\"ELEMIMIX.ITM\"&gt;Imix's Weapon&lt;/a&gt; page.\nParty members within close quarters of Imix, about 6' distance, who attack the creature are subject to a retaliatory special &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; effect. This will occur on any kind of attack that targets Imix in range, such as melee weapons, missile fire or spells cast. This ability is permanent and can't be removed or dispelled. It always activates upon an attack on Imix.\nObviously Imix is of the elemental plane of fire, so party members should not try fire damaging spells or attacks at the creature, which may actually heal the beast. This includes a party member with a &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; spell of their own.\nGameplay.\nImix is primarily scripted to engage with its melee attacks, and moves toward detected enemies to do so.\nInitially the creature will force cast its innate special version of &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt; (SPIMIX.spl) at the closest target but may strike party members further back as well. This ability can be performed periodically during the battle. The ability can't be disrupted or interrupted. The ability can be blocked by magic resistance and is a level 5 &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; spell effect, meaning that many spell protections can stop it. Additionally, the innate ability is classified as an Invocation spell and Offensive Damage type. \nNote that the &lt;a href=\"Wave\"&gt;Wave&lt;/a&gt; halberd weapon will make short work of Imix, as it has no immunity to the special Fire Elemental Class/Race killing ability of that polearm.\nIf defeated, Imix drops the Amulet of the Master Harper and the &lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt; halberd.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod Improves Yaga Shura's Keep and all creature's within and without as a whole. Along with the changes, Imix is also improved and enhanced. Imix remains similar in most respects to the unmodified version. Some changes are however made. An improved AI script is assigned and some additional abilities:\nImix will initially empower itself with a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Greater Whirlwind Attack&lt;/a&gt;, a text display reads \"\"Who calls Imix, Prince of Fire?\". Seconds later it will blast out a \"Starfire\"\" spell effect, which is identical to a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Dragon%20Breath\"&gt;Red Dragon Breath&lt;/a&gt; attack. This attack also adds a secondary effect that will apply a &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Buffet\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; effect on any foes in the AoE, which can cause brief unconsciousness (save vs spell with -10 penalty) as well as 1d8+12 &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt;. A text displays on the combat log reads \"Feel the wrath of Imix!\"\nFollowing this action, the prince will call forth a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt;, identical to the cleric spell. Note that this spell can slowly heal Imix if it is within the AoE and it has any hit point damage. \nExpect a rapid flurry of melee attacks from the creature, especially while under its Greater Whirlwind. Imix still retains the ability to cast the special single-target Flame Strike at eligible targets, about every two rounds and alongside melee attacks.\nImix's AI will assess weaknesses and vulnerabilities of opponents by script. It will prioritize attacks on those helpless, vulnerable or compromised that it can detect. "}

A stable is in the rear, but not shown. The main floor has a bar and counter, tables for patrons, a storage room behind the bar, and furnished bed chamber suites. The exterior artwork of the building shows a second floor with windows, however that floor is not mapped. Perhaps it's the Inn's staff living area or loft.\nGameplay.\nSafe rest is available if the party wishes bed and board for a fee. A selection of beverages is also available to purchase. Remember that local rumors can be generated with the purchase of drinks, with the more expensive variety giving a better chance of a juicy rumor. Overdoing it can lead to becoming &lt;a href=\"Intoxicated\"&gt;Intoxicated&lt;/a&gt;, but you only live once, unless you are friends with the Temple, then maybe more than once. \nIts owner &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20the%20Innkeep\"&gt;Vincenzo the Innkeep&lt;/a&gt; will be the point of contact to access the Tavern services.

The party has to initiate this. All of the characters in the Inn can be addressed, although the \"sleeping women\" is not one of those. The information gleaned from chit chat will further the understanding by the party of the mood of the village regarding current events.\nBeginning in the late evening hours, several of the group of merchants who set up stalls outside the Inn will move into the tavern. In the morning they will open up their business again in front of the Inn's exterior. An exception to this group is &lt;a href=\"Fael\"&gt;Fael&lt;/a&gt;, who seems is available 24/7 just outside the Inn.\nThere is an opportunity for a rogue to attempt some stealthy pilfering with pickpocketing abilities.

Without spoiling the adventure, this page will point out that one of the containers has an alarm feature, that could lead to the authorities responding to theft. There are several items of value and potential use scattered throughout. As is normal by this stage of the saga, a rogue with detection and disarming of traps is useful. Lockpicking skills are needed too.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Trials%20of%20the%20Luremaster\"&gt;Trials of the Luremaster&lt;/a&gt; mod begins in the Imnesvale Inn.

The mod didn't even have an official name assigned - it was simply a \"Tactical Challenge\" modification.\nThe mod has two different names and versions available to try. \nEach version of the mod's download locations is noted below in the External Link section.\nMod description.\nThe mod takes place in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%206\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 6&lt;/a&gt; in the village of &lt;a href=\"Imnesvale\"&gt;Imnesvale&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt;. The First time the party visits Imnesvale in that chapter will trigger the scenario.\nThe mod is a single tactical challenge scenario. Essentially, an unknown group of marauding invaders under the command of a mage named \"Jugend\" has added this village to its target list.\nA cut scene will introduce the mod to the player, with some witty and campy dialogue. The party must make a choice to help &lt;a href=\"Minister%20Lloyd\"&gt;Minister Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; and his wife defend against the expected assault. The player can refuse, and the quest will finish. Imnesvale will be destroyed.\nIf the party agrees to help, then there is a short period of time to prepare for the imminent attack. The time allowed before the attack is determined by the player's game difficulty settings. \nEnsure that Minister Lloyd is not killed by the attackers, or that will not only lose the quest, but cause the death of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe attackers will come from the north and south in multiple waves. Several of the attackers are specifically scripted to locate and destroy minister Lloyd - who moves at an extremely slow pace.\nDestroy all the attackers while keeping the minister safe will win the battle. A reward is bestowed if that occurs.\nMuch unusual and unique loot can be found on the attackers' corpses. Some might be considered unbalanced and OP.\nThis encounter is not an easy one to win. It is designed as a Bonafide challenge, even for a very experienced and well-equipped party."}

She's the first companion who offers to join &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;the protagonist&lt;/a&gt; and will join despite any answer given in dialogue.\nGameplay.\nHer valuable thieving skills, such as detect and disarm traps, open locks, pick-pockets, etc., can be very beneficial for a starting party. She also has a very high &lt;a href=\"charisma\"&gt;charisma&lt;/a&gt;, making her an effective &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; leader in regards to yielding better prices in shops and good reactions during particular conversations. She doesn't have major conflicts with any other party members, but despite what she says about sticking by you no matter what, she will leave if your reputation drops low enough in BG1.\nImoen has one of the highest overall stats of all companions in the entire saga, being a human thief with a &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; score of 18 and an &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; score of 17. You may &lt;a href=\"Dual-class\"&gt;dual&lt;/a&gt; class her anytime after level 2\u00a0to a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, and the 161,000 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20tables\"&gt;experience cap&lt;/a&gt; present in and creates a manageable cut-off point for regaining her thief skills. A &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt; by definition must have its new class exceed the level of its old class by one level in order to regain the benefits of the old class. Imoen may become a level 7 Thief at 40,000 XP, which will still allow her to reach a level 8 Mage at 90,000 XP (130,000 XP total). This allows a significant investment in 2-3 Thief skills, primarily lock-picking and find traps, as well as a third &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20proficiency\"&gt;proficiency&lt;/a&gt; point. If you want to maximize her Thief levels, dual class her immediately after Imoen reaches level 7\u00a0Thief in order not to waste any earned experience - plus it will match up &lt;a href=\"Canon\"&gt;canonically&lt;/a&gt; with the next installment. If you want to reach level 9 Mage to gain level 5 spell slots, dual class at level 6 Thief.\u00a0 At level 1, she has 8 hp and &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20proficiency\"&gt;Weapon proficiency&lt;/a&gt; in Small Sword and Bow or\u00a0Short Sword and Shortbow ().

Unlike in the other games, Imoen cannot join the party as a regular member, because she is at first too busy with her training and is poisoned by assassins during the first scenes, which prompts her to stay at the palace while the protagonist travels north to fight against &lt;a href=\"Caelar%20Argent\"&gt;Caelar Argent&lt;/a&gt;'s crusade.\nShe does show up again during the finale, where she awaits the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; outside of the city walls of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khalid\"&gt;Khalid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt;. The six of them then leave the town behind them, starting the events of .\n&amp;.\nPrologue.\nAt the start of Shadows of Amn, Imoen, who is already a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual-classed&lt;/a&gt; Thief (level 7) &gt; Mage, has freed herself from capture, and very soon comes to the player character's rescue. When the protagonist awakes, she tells &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; that they have been captured and tortured, but she doesn't know why.\u00a0 She relates something she overheard her captor saying: he wants to release the player character's '&lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;potential&lt;/a&gt;', though it is not known what that means.\nThe protagonist must escape the dungeon and may take Imoen with the party or not. Whatever the decision, once outside, Imoen is back with Gorion's Ward in a cut-scene in which she attacks &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;, their captor, with magic. But what is not known to the party is that casting spells without license is forbidden in the city of &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizard\"&gt;Cowled Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s appear and spirit both her and Irenicus (who also used spells during the cut-scene) away to an &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;unknown location&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecruitment.\nImoen is available to be recruited in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%204\"&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt;, while the first part of the game consists of the party gathering information and funds, and performing for the purpose of finding out where Imoen has been taken, and to gather the necessary resources to rescue her, which is eventually realized in &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the original SoA, Imoen joins as a level 8/7 Mage/Thief with trained proficiency in Dagger, Quarterstaff, Short Bow, and Dart. In order to have only 4 &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;Weapon Proficiency&lt;/a&gt; points at her level, she has to have wasted a point earned by leveling as a Mage into a proficiency she had already invested in from reaching Thief level 7, thus losing that additional weapon proficiency point when regaining her Thief levels.\nIn the Enhanced Edition, Imoen starts as a level 8/7 Mage/Thief with trained proficiency in Dagger, Dart, Quarterstaff, Short Sword and Short Bow.\nIn Chapter 4, the earliest she can be re-acquired will be when she is level 11/7. Note that in SoA, if she is acquired at a higher level, such as 13/7, she will be missing a weapon proficiency point that she should have received at level 12.\nGameplay.\nImoen is a dual class Thief (level 7) -&gt; Mage with enough skill in Open Locks and Find/Disarm Traps to fulfill the fundamental needs of any party competently and is capable of reaching maximum level in her Mage class. \nStarting in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%208\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 8&lt;/a&gt; in the portion of the saga, she'll eventually attain &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt; powers. The changes improve her stats as well as add a number of innate abilities. All occur at a random time through party banter. The first banter will give her the following abilities:\nWith her second 'dream banter' she will \"lose\" Cure Light Wounds and Larloch's Minor Drain, but gain the following spells in their place (she will not lose the Dexterity boost, that is permanent in addition to the Strength boost).\nNote that while there is one additional one-on-one banter between the player and Imoen after said abilities are unlocked, but that final banter exchange results in no new powers.\nIn SoA her &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;Thieving Abilities&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the game in &lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon%201st%20Floor\"&gt;Irenicus' Dungeon 1st Floor&lt;/a&gt; are: Open Locks 95, Find Traps 85, Pick Pockets 25, Move Silently 30, Hide in Shadows 25, Detect Illusion 0, and Set Traps 5. This is 25 fewer thief points than would be expected, effectively giving her a thief level of 6 instead of 7.\nIn EESoA her Thieving Abilities at the start of the game are slightly boosted to match her thief level, with: Open Locks 95, Find Traps 95, Pick Pockets 35, Move Silently 35, Hide in Shadows 25, Detect Illusion 0, and Set Traps 5.\nAfter rescuing Imoen in Chapter 4, her known spells will have reset to a fresh default selection, so it's not recommended to have Imoen inscribe any new spells during Chapter 1.\nHer spells upon rejoining the party in Chapter 4 of SoA are as follows:\nLevel 1: &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Identify%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Identify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;\nLevel 2: &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;\nLevel 3: &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Summoning%20I\"&gt;Monster Summoning I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;\nLevel 4: &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Blue%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Blue)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;\nLevel 5: &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Summoning%20III\"&gt;Monster Summoning III&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;\nLevel 6: &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Contingency\"&gt;Contingency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;\nPersonality.\nImoen is a care-free, optimistic, cheerful and easy-going character. She seems happy to have escaped the boredom of &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt; and eager to discover the world beyond the city walls. Imoen will try to joke around with &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and almost any other companions in the group and lighten their spirits in the hardest moments to come. She never picks up fights with any others, no matter how different they are.\nImoen is also unyieldingly faithful, extremely attached to Gorion's Ward, to the extent that she thinks it's her responsibility to safeguard the Ward and sees herself as the Ward's guardian angel.\nIn Imoen appears a bit worried and more mature, as she struggles with her newly-discovered Bhaalspawn heritage and the nightmares related to it. Nonetheless, she retains a great portion of her care-free attitude.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; mod changes some dialogue and assignment of &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt; abilities in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Throne of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; game portion (Chapters 8, 9 and 10). \nIf Imoen is present in the final battle, there is a period of time where her taint of bhaal can be used against &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;, at least for a time, until Imoen is able regain her self-control. She can be recruited back into the party at that time, assuming she wasn't killed by the player before that."}

After killing most of the major figures, the minor Crusaders will retreat, and the gate to the bridge will open. This not only a difficult fight alone (Bridgefort defenders will not join in), but it bypasses a number of quests that can be worth doing, including The Missing Patrol, The Creeping Darkness, Tender of the Dead, and The Fear. Additional, the defenders strangely do not have a reaction \nIf the Bridgefort defenders are prepared, the assault can be triggered immediately, with the defenders and party attacking over the drawbridge, a difficult fight at best.\nAlternatively, the party can return to the Flaming Fist camp, gather the army and attack from one side while the defenders attack from the other. can opt to lead the Fist attack or return to Bridgefort and lead their attack.\nIf leads the Bridgefort defenders, they can begin the conversation to surrender, and after the terms are decided, can launch a surprise attack, with or without the Flaming Fist's assistance, depending on if they were placed on alert.\nOnce the camp has been completely cleared, the barricade to the bridge opens and the next phase begins.\nSurrender / \"Surrender\".\nSince the Crusade is only interested in the supplies, either or Khalid can negotiate with The Barghest for the freedom of the defenders in return for the supplies. If Jegg has been properly prepared, she will quietly sabotage the supplies, leaving nothing for the Crusade.\nThe Bridge.\nOnce the Crusaders have been dealt with one way or another, a &lt;a href=\"BDFISTM1.CRE\"&gt;Flaming Fist Mage&lt;/a&gt; will teleport in and warn that the Crusaders are placing barrels like those that destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Crossing%20Way%20Bridge\"&gt;Crossing Way Bridge&lt;/a&gt; on the Boareskyr Bridge.\nThe gate will be open, and at the midpoint of the bridge will be 4 &lt;a href=\"BDCRUBB1.CRE\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s, 2 &lt;a href=\"BDCRUBB2.CRE\"&gt;Crusader Archer&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"BDCRUBBM.CRE\"&gt;Crusader Mage&lt;/a&gt; who begins casting a spell to open a portal. If the mage is not killed within a certain amount of time, they will open the portal and teleport away, and any living crusaders will flee. Over time, the portal will spawn several waves of random fire-related creatures: 2 &lt;a href=\"BDMEPF01.CRE\"&gt;Fire Mephit&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"BDSALF01.CRE\"&gt;Fire Salamander&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"BDELFIRL.CRE\"&gt;Lesser Fire Elemental&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf any of the barrels take at least 24 points of damage (they take half damage from anything but acid, electricity, fire, and magic damage, and they normally automatically succeed on all saves), everyone on the map will be killed, and the game ends."}

The \"Final Save\" of a previous game may not appear at the top of the list, and you may need to scroll down to find it.\nTo manually export a character instead, load a game, go to the the character's \"Record\" screen, there's a \"Export\" option in the lower right portion, type in the file name (this won't change the character name) which will generate a typedname.chr file in the \"characters\" subfolder located in the main folder where \".\"exe is. Each game will only read the .chr files in its own subfolder, so if you need to start Shadows of Amn with a BG1 character without importing from an existing save state, you need to manually copy paste the .chr files from BG1 to BG2 folder. You may only export the character(s) you created, &lt;a href=\"Companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; won't be exported.\nWhile you aren't allowed to change gender, race, class, alignment, abilities, or skills of an imported character, you can still change their appearance and name, and inherit the status (eg. exp level) at the time of export. You will need to manually copy the character's portraits (in L, M and S sizes) as well as their voice pack over into the corresponding folder. You can alter these at any point during regular gameplay from the character's profile if the game doesn't automatically detect them on import.\nDepending on campaigns, you may even have all items the character themself was carrying except the .

Anything equipped or in the inventory of your created characters (including containers), anything in the inventory of non-SOD NPCs in your party, and anything equipped or in the inventory of SOD NPCs will be imported if you continue a game from Baldur's Gate. This means when you later meet a BG:EE NPC, such as Edwin they will have all the equipment and inventory items that they had on them at the point you finished BG:EE, even if they were not in your party at the time. Non-SOD NPCs in your party at the end of BG:EE will be replaced by a SOD NPC of a similar alignment; however, they will only have generic starting equipment. When you get to your chest in the Ducal Palace you will find the items from the inventory of the Non-SOD NPCs that were in your party (as well as all of &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;'s inventory in a separate chest), but none of the items they had equipped.\nYou will lose any Gold Pieces you had at the end of BG:EE, so convert your GP to items. To bring the maximum number of items into SOD, fill all containers (Potion Case, Scroll Case, Gem Bag, Bag of Holding). Fully equip all SOD NPCs before the final battle, including quiver, quick items and inventory, but do not have any of those NPCs in your party. If you have a party of Non-SOD NPCs make sure you put all their equipment into their inventory. You do not need to worry about doing that for any custom characters you have in your party. Some SOD NPCs cannot be recruited, so you will either need to pick pocket the items from them or kill them.\nIf you intend on continuing with your characters into SOA you may want to prioritize having three or four of the items listed below in your inventory."}

The victim remains there unless the reverse of the spell, Freedom, is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists, rather a horrible fate, actually. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned, then he will reappear exactly where he was last standing. Dispel magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner.

If a spell or ability has a cast time of 0 (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Rage\"&gt;Barbarian Rage&lt;/a&gt; in , or casting &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; while wearing the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Power\"&gt;Amulet of Power&lt;/a&gt;), it will go off immediately - more specifically, after 1 frame has passed - and is therefore rarely interrupted.\nFor example, a wizard casting &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull Trap&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of combat: \nImproved Alacrity Casting.\nWhile Improved Alacrity is active, spells can be cast as soon as the current spell is finished, allowing multiple spells to be cast in a single round.\nInteraction with Improved Casting Time.\nThe total potential spells cast per round under Improved Alacrity is greatly increased while wearing items that improve &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23C\"&gt;casting time&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Vecna\"&gt;Robe of Vecna&lt;/a&gt; (cast time improved by 4).\nExamples Comparing Potential Damage Output.\nExample 1, Level 20 Sorcerer, No Alacrity.\nAverage Single-Target Damage Dealt in 3 rounds formula_1 330 damage\nExample 2, Level 20 Sorcerer, Improved Alacrity.\nThe average damage dealt in 3 rounds formula_1 525 damage. Damage output is almost twice that dealt in Example 1 (without Improved Alacrity), while only using one Level 9 spell slot.\nExample 3, Level 20 Sorcerer with Improved Alacrity, wearing Robe of Vecna and Amulet of Power.\nAssuming Wish Rests are successful, average damage dealt in 1 round formula_1 \"1206\" damage, and in 3 rounds formula_1 \"4256\" damage . Damage output in 1 round is more than twice that in Example 2 (with Improved Alacrity over three rounds). Total damage over 3 rounds is more than 8 times Example 2 (with Alacrity) and more than 15 times Example 1 (No Alacrity).\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this High-level class ability spell, revising its school, and description.

They have the special abilities &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28inquisitor%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as twice their level and is cast very quickly, and &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt;, which dispels hostile illusions. They gain one extra use of each ability every four class levels. However, this comes at the price of not being able to cast priest spells and the loss of the Paladin abilities &lt;a href=\"Lay%20on%20Hands%20%28paladin%29\"&gt;Lay on Hands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis class is a spellcaster\u2019s worst nightmare as it is able to cast two powerful anti-spell abilities twice their actual level, thus being able to disrupt any and all spells with relative ease.\nIn-game description.\n\"The Inquisitor has dedicated his life to finding and eliminating practitioners of evil magic and defeating the forces of darkness, and his god has provided him with special abilities towards that end.\"\n\"Advantages:\"\n\"Disadvantages: \"\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod under the \"\"Gameplay Tweaks\" and the \"Reduce the power of Inquisitors' Dispel Magic\"\" component allows an adjustment to this ability:\nInquisitors have a very fast and powerful Dispel Magic ability, which is cast at twice their level. In most bits of the game, this is usually much higher than the majority of spellcasting enemies. This component reduces the power of the Dispel a little; you can choose to use it at 1.5xlevel or at 1xlevel. Install this component for a balanced challenge, as the 2X level ability becomes unfair and is regarded as overpowered throughout the game. Consider for example, that in the unmodded game Keldorn at level 14 would exceed the power of Kangaxx the Lich, and then be able to dispel the lich's protections easily. Game balance would suffer, and therefore the challenge diminished."}

Multiple casts can be stacked on the same enemies to increase damage per round, but it does not bypass magic resistance. Haste effects on plagued enemies will also increase damage significantly, similarly to what happens with poisons and haste.\nGameplay.\nThis spell is very dangerous when targeted on you by enemies. However, there are certain ways to protect against it (all those also work against &lt;a href=\"Creeping%20Doom\"&gt;Creeping Doom&lt;/a&gt;):\n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; provides a chance to completely evade the spell.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;: Conjuration (for Mage, Sorcerer, Bard; and also, a rogue with &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; if he has a scroll) completely protects and can't fail.\n&lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;:\nAn ongoing Insect Plague / Creeping Doom can be removed by a successful &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; roll, but because of the spellcasting failure by the insects, this would require a character who is standing outside the area of effect or was otherwise protected (e.g. by Spell Immunity), or that the affected character casts the spell via an item (e.g. using a Dispel Magic scroll or using one of the daily Dispel Magic casts available from the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Slayer%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;Wizard Slayer (axe)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carsomyr\"&gt;Carsomyr&lt;/a&gt; or the upgraded &lt;a href=\"Purifier\"&gt;Purifier&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection From Magic&lt;/a&gt; scrolls work, but are very rare and also remove all friendly buffs on the character. The same for the &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Blocking\"&gt;Potion of Magic Blocking&lt;/a&gt;, which only works against Insect Plague but not Creeping Doom.\nSomeone who is not the initial target, but is standing inside the area of effect, can try to \"outrun\" the insect swarm before it has spread. This requires high speed (&lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Paws%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Boots of Speed&lt;/a&gt;...). It is advisable to spread your party out if enemies are going to use insect spells, then it can't hit multiple characters at once.\nYou can also try to &lt;a href=\"Silence%2C%2015%27%20Radius\"&gt;silence&lt;/a&gt; the enemies before they can cast, as Druids have almost no way to defend against silence (they can't cast &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe&lt;/a&gt;).\nSingle-target protection spells like &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; do not work and can't reflect / deflect Insect Plague, even if they are applied on the initial target. Spells such as &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, protection from weapons or fire shield don't help either - at least in the unmodified game.\nThere are many possible protections against Insect Plague's &lt;a href=\"panic\"&gt;panic&lt;/a&gt; effect (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Fear\"&gt;Remove Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fear\"&gt;Resist Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; songs ...), but those don't protect against the damage and spell failure part.\nCreatures with innate spell &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; immunity, such as a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rakshasa\"&gt;Rakshasa&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Demilich%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%29\"&gt;Demilich&lt;/a&gt; will shrug off the spell because of that immunity.

It also handles the insects more systematically as summoned creatures: they cannot harm or affect creatures immune to nonmagical weapons; they are unaffected by antimagic or by Dispel Magic; they will not attack undead creatures, and cannot penetrate the extreme heat or cold of a Fire Shield.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod version as follows:&lt;br&gt;\nInsect Plague&lt;br&gt;\nLevel: 5&lt;br&gt;\nSchool: Conjuration&lt;br&gt;\nSphere: Animal&lt;br&gt;\nRange: Long&lt;br&gt;\nDuration: 6 rounds&lt;br&gt;\nCasting Time: 5&lt;br&gt;\nArea of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30\u2019&lt;br&gt;\nSaving Throw: Special&lt;br&gt;\nWhen this spell is cast, a mass of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm, first attacking the target, and then moving on to all enemies of the caster within the spell\u2019s radius.&lt;br&gt;\nFor the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round the victims suffer 2d3 points of damage from insect bites and have a 100% chance of spell failure. If a successful save vs. breath at -2 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty. Magic resistance does not affect this spell."}

He will say several lines of dialogue, and you may ask a question or two:\nSolaufein will draw in the devourers, and several teleportation animations will play, and then will reveal at least three &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt;, and three &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;Umber Hulk&lt;/a&gt; creatures, as well as Phaere scattered in the general vicinity of Solaufein. The party should engage the enemies as soon as practical and try to destroy these hostiles swiftly. Note that Phaere can actually be killed in this encounter, so watch the accidental friendly fire, and don't let the opponents gang up on Phaere. If she dies, the party fails the main quest.\nIf Phaere is successfully rescued, the party receives 20,000 XP (shared) and she will say a few lines of dialogue, including:\nPhaere and Solaufein will have an exchange of obvious unfriendly views about this mission, and eventually she will depart for Ust Natha and say:\nAfter she leaves for Ust Natha, Solaufein addresses the party and remarks:\nIntroduction to Phaere.\nReturn to Ust Natha, where you'll find Imrae and Solaufein in the bazaar, in the same place they were standing before you went off to rescue Phaere. Talk to Solaufein. Phaere demands your presence in the tavern in a day's time, and she also demands that Solaufein and your party rest and relax in the tavern as a reward. Imrae spells this out with the following words:\nSolaufein will make it known that he does not wish to go to the tavern, and Imrae snaps back:\nAssuming the party did not exceed the 24-hour time limit, report to Phaere inside the &lt;a href=\"Ust%20Natha%20Tavern\"&gt;Ust Natha Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting, Phaere and Solaufein are verbally indicating their acrimonious relationship, sparring back and forth with unveiled insults and disdain for each other. Some dialogue options are present for the party, including if the player's \"Veldrin\" wishes to be a bit \"flirty\" with Phaere (which could lead to a negative reaction from a party member that is romancing Gorion's Ward). This meeting kind of sets the tone for how Phaere and Solaufein react to each other and gives some insight into Phaere's ambitions and her place in House Despana.\nThe party may also learn that Phaere believes that House Despana has big plans and will soon be making a move to consolidate power in Ust Natha \u2013 and your party can be a player in this upcoming plan. How intriguing?\nAs the conversation and reply options are cycled through, she will get to the part where she says:\nDestroy the smuggling eye tyrant.\nBack at the city entrance platform find Phare and Solaufein \u2013 initiate dialogue with Phaere to receive new orders. She will say:\nRendezvous with Phaere and Solaufein at the SE platform. When you arrive Phaere will say:\nAfter a few more lines of repartee. the eye tyrant beholder will materialize not very far from the staircase descending to the lower platform. Hostilities begin soon after. The party will be the main way to defeat this creature, as Phaere and Solaufein really will attempt to engage the creature in melee by script. But mainly it's up to Veldrin and company to take down the &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholder&lt;/a&gt;, which is just an ordinary type with the regular assigned beholder attack script. The creature can target either Phaere or Solaufein with eye beams.\nWhen defeated, the party receives 20,000 shared XP, and Phaere says:\nAfterwards, Solaufein makes more comments and questions Phaere, who retorts:\nThe party now has 72 hours of time to do what they will before having to meet Phaere again in the Tavern. Perhaps some exploration in the Underdark's connected tunnels is in order?\nSlaughter the deep gnome's patrol.\nReturn to the Tavern and find Phaere and Solaufein in the usual place. Address Phaere to initiate the meeting. She and solaufein will have their usual back and and forth banter of ill-will towards each other. You'll learn from Phaere about the upcoming task for the party, a paraphrased gist of this follows:\nIf either Keldorn, Jan Jansen, Mazzy, or Aerie is a companion in the party, they have interjections and reservations about this task, raising their concerns out loud to Phaere. This leads to a comment or two from her, but changes nothing.\nWhen ready to do so, the party is to travel to find Solaufein in a section of the Underdark (west of the Drow soul prison device) near coordinates (x=900, y=2200). Speak with him, and the party can decide what they wish to do about this particular mission. If you don't mind the killing of the svirfneblin patrol to obtain the patrol leaders helmet, then this can be done. \nIf on the other hand, the party doesn't want to act in an evil way and slaughter the gnomes - then guide the dialogue in such a way to suggest that Solaufein can leave this mission, and the party can take care of it on their own. As is obvious by his dialogue, he finds this task as pointless and beneath him. Solaufein will take Veldrin up on the suggestion and will return to Ust Natha, with a warning to not fail or all will be punished. Now the party can try and get the patrol leaders helmet in their own way.\nMove further to the east and go towards the mining encampment, and eventually the gnome patrol is observed. If Solaufein is still with the party, the gnomes will be hostile, and the slaughter can begin. Loot the patrol leader's helmet. Without Solaufein, and looking to not slaughter the gnomes, speak with the neutral patrol leader, have some dialogue exchange, and just ask for his helmet to avoid bloodshed. The patrol leader will react to dialogue and either reluctantly agree or readily do so, and share some parting remarks, and the patrol will make for their encampment. Veldrin will now have the \"proof of the deed\" in the inventory. \nReturn to the tavern and provide the patrol leader's helmet to Phaere. An experience point reward of 28,000 to each party member is provided.\nAlthough the task is complete, Phaere is in a irritated and testy mood, and she will demand that Veldrin meet with her in the &lt;a href=\"Female%20Fighters%27%20Society\"&gt;Female Fighters' Society&lt;/a&gt; in one hour.\nMeet Phaere in the Female Fighters' Society.\nTravel to the Female Fighter's Society and pass through the doorway to within. You aren't sure what Phaere has in mind for this meeting, or why she is in an angry mood.\nPhaere will explains the nature of the meeting. If anyone but Veldrin speaks to Phaere first, they will be rudely and curtly shut down. Her words are for Veldrin alone. Generally, she'll say:\nVeldrin may make remarks and share opinions about a few choices here. The player can make known that they don't wish to do this deed, or even that they refuse. Phaere gives more assertations that it makes sense, and Veldrin will gain great favor if the deed is accomplished. \nThreats will also be made if the party refuses. If, in the end, the party says no to the task, then hostilities will initiate, and the drow city will turn on all. This means the player has failed his mission to retrieve Adalon's eggs. Fair warning was given about this, and your decision is made, and can't be undone.\nIf Veldrin agrees to the task, reluctantly or not, Phaere will provide some more remarks, paraphrased as follows:\nIn conclusion, Phaere finishes with the final command:\nConfront Solaufein and retrieve his cloak.\nThe party is allowed a fairly generous time limit to perform the task of retrieving Solufein's &lt;a href=\"Drow%20Piwafwi%20Cloak\"&gt;Drow Piwafwi Cloak&lt;/a&gt;. There is no need to wait, and the party could go immediately and find Solaufein and resolve this or could potentially perform other adventuring.\nWhen the party decides to confront Solaufein, go to and enter the &lt;a href=\"Male%20Fighters%27%20Society\"&gt;Male Fighters' Society&lt;/a&gt;, and he is observed on the first platform. He'll say:\nIf the party wishes, they can just attack Solaufein, who'll be outmatched and unprepared for battle. Although it isn't known to the party at this time - this can limit the options available to a large extent, and possibly even sabotage the chance to Retrieve Adalon's Eggs (which you agreed to do). While you may be playing an \"evil\" party, or perhaps you just want to get rid of Solaufein to win Phaere's favor - this can't be undone, and the consequences are not ideal. Instead, there may be strategic advantages to speak with Solaufein first.\nEngage Solaufein in dialogue, and don't jump to conclusions or act rashly before hearing him out and exploring the nonviolent paths first. There is a way that you may spare Solaufein's life, and get the Piwafwi Cloak without having to end his life. Later on, who knows what kind of opportunity may present itself with Solaufein? It could be a major breakthrough for the party. If playing an evil party, that doesn't mean that they must be ignorant and not take advantage of a situation. Play smart, and perhaps get a better future outcome.\nIn the end, the party will either kill Solaufein () and obtain the cloak or allow the drow to escape and he'll give you the cloak. He may say (paraphrased):\nSolaufein may even admit to not worshipping Lolth, but instead secretly devoted to Eilistraee, Lady Silverhair. Solaufein will now leave Veldrin the cloak and flee the building. \nPerhaps sometime in the future, you'll meet again.\nWith the cloak in hand, return to Phaere in Female Fighter's Society so she can see that you have \"completed\" the bloody deed she ordered.\nReturn the cloak to Phaere.\nEnter the Female Fighter's Sicienty and hand Solaufein's Piwawfi Cloak to Phaere. She is pleased and makes some comments about the mission. The deed awards each party member .\nSoon after, she turns to Veldrin, and if the PC is a male will order you to her private chambers. She'll say:\nWhen this occurs, you have to make some choices - The player can just agree to her order, and \"get it on\" with the Handmaiden of Lolth (there is no cut-scene for this unfortunately).\nHowever, if the PC is currently in a romance/relationship (such as Jaheria or Viconia) this could be awkward, and a source of conflict within the romance dynamic. There are several methods to try via dialogue and refuse, without actually saying \"No\" directly:\n- The PC could say they \"\"belong to another\": When she demands to know who, say \"It... it's someone you don't know...\" and she'll assume you mean a Handmaiden from\nChed Nasad has 'collared' you, which gives her pause and will deter her lust.\n- The PC can also say that you \"can't\"\", which after a few moments causes Phaere to believe that you have a physical 'disability' precluding you from any rumpy bumpy activity.\nThere is also some Character &lt;a href=\"Ability%20Scores\"&gt;Ability Scores&lt;/a&gt; checks that can be relied on to dissuade her overtures:\n- With a 13 Charisma and a 17 Intelligence, the PC can convince her that an oath of celibacy is promised to Lloth.\n- If the PC has a Charisma and an Intelligence of 15, you can affirm to her that you were cursed, and can't perform.\n- With a a 17 Charisma or higher, claim to be a eunuch (probably another Lloth loyalty ritual).\nIf the PC has actually gone along with joining Phaere in the sack, then Jaheira or Viconia will comment and react with the PC when the private session is over. Jaheira is sarcastic but able to put it aside as an action needed to not break the party's disguise.\nViconia is verbally aggressive towards Phaere. She is also notices that the PC had trouble saying no to that female drow allure.\nAfter all this sexual release or sexual frustration, whatever the case may be, Phaere says:\nMeet the Matron Mother.\nThe party must travel to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Lolth\"&gt;Temple of Lolth&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt; and Phaere are waiting for your arrival."}

At this time there are not separate Wiki pages for each map. Map areas are included on this page, as follows:\nThe Entrance Floor.\nThe Entrance Hall.\nThis is where the party enters the sphere. It is a nondescript room that has three doors; the Guardian's Room to the west, the Welcome Room to the northwest, and the Viewing Room to the northeast. The door to the Welcome Room is initially locked.\nThe Viewing Room.\n(Athkatla).\nEast of the Entrance hall is a locked door that leads to a magical pool that provides a view of the sphere's immediate surroundings.\"This pool shows a bird's eye view of Athkatla. The planar sphere stands out like a magic beacon in the heart of the city.\"\nThere is nothing of material value here, though a &lt;a href=\"Steam%20Mephit\"&gt;Steam Mephit&lt;/a&gt; () has gotten into this room and will need to be slain.\n(Abyssal Plane).\nWhen the sphere has landed at the Abyssal Plane, it shows a bird's eye view of it.\n\"Within the ripples of the magical pool, you see a distorted, demonic valley. A place such as this could only be home to the most foul of beasts.\"\nThe Guardian's Room.\nThe first line of defense for the sphere is the intruder-slaying &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt; () that resides in this room. Once killed, its treasures may be taken. Scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20Other\"&gt;Polymorph Other&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Minor Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Lesser%20Air%20Elemental\"&gt;Conjure Lesser Air Elemental&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20%2B2\"&gt;Arrows +2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bullet%20%2B2\"&gt;Bullets +2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20%2B2\"&gt;Bolts +2&lt;/a&gt;, and three key items may be found here; a &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Arm\"&gt;Golem Arm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coal\"&gt;Coal&lt;/a&gt; for a sub-quest, and the &lt;a href=\"Planar%20Key\"&gt;Planar Key&lt;/a&gt; that party needs to proceed further into the sphere.\nWhen you are prepared, use the Planar Key on the northwest door. The party splits for activating the sphere, and a status messages reads, \"You insert the lever and proceed to pull it. The lights went out for a few moments, then the ship rumbled.\" The Control Panel also speaks:\"You have initiated plane travel. The inner door will now open. You may not leave the sphere until the Master allows it.\"You have triggered an anti-intrusion mechanism, causing the Sphere to plane-shift away from Athkatla. If you return to the Viewing Room you see that the sphere is now in \"a demonic valley\" trapping you inside the sphere.\nThe Welcome\u00a0Room.\nNorthwest of the Entrance Hall is a safe haven and one of the rooms where the party may rest while they are trapped in the Sphere. It contains three people in a similar situation; &lt;a href=\"Reyna\"&gt;Reyna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Onvo\"&gt;Onvo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancan\"&gt;Ancan&lt;/a&gt;. They reveal that they are &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_of_Solamnia\"&gt;Knights of Solamnia&lt;/a&gt;, a holy order of Paladins, Fighters and Fighter/Clerics from the world of &lt;a href=\"Krynn\"&gt;Krynn&lt;/a&gt;, who have been stranded here ever since Lavok visited their homeworld. They provide some valuable information about the Sphere.\nThere is a Scroll of &lt;a href=\"Khelben%27s%20Warding%20Whip\"&gt;Khelben's Warding Whip&lt;/a&gt; on the table. To the north is the Marine Room, and to the west the Cavern of Bones.\nThe Marine Room.\nHere is a sea-themed chamber where &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin\"&gt;Sahuagin&lt;/a&gt; are located for purposes unknown. There is a hidden proximity trigger just beyond the locked door to this area. Once triggered, the OBSSHATP.bcs script will spawn: \nA &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin%20Baron\"&gt;Sahuagin Baron&lt;/a&gt; (), two &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin%20Priestess\"&gt;Sahuagin Priestess&lt;/a&gt; ( each), and two &lt;a href=\"Baronial%20Guard\"&gt;Baronial Guards&lt;/a&gt; ( each) and two basic &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin\"&gt;Sahuagin&lt;/a&gt; ( each). They attack on sight. The Priestesses only have spears, while the Baron has a &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Protection%20%2B1\"&gt;Cloak of Protection +1&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Paralytic%20Bolt\"&gt;Paralytic Bolt&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20%2B1\"&gt;Bolts +1&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Biting\"&gt;Bolts of Biting&lt;/a&gt; and random treasure including gold, jewelry and/or spell scrolls can also be gathered. See the creature links for details.\nIn the room's center is a device, that is spraying briny sea mist in the chamber. A text display on the map reads \"The smell of salt water is everywhere, and when you step, your feet sink slightly and murky water pools about them.\"\nThe Cavern of Bones.\nThese dry, wind-swept rocky chambers lined with various humanoid bones are inhabited by alien halflings. However, these are not the friendly &lt;a href=\"Halfling\"&gt;halflings&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Faer%C3%BBn\"&gt;Faer\u00fbn&lt;/a&gt;, but rather savage, vicious, cannibal Halflings from &lt;a href=\"Athas\"&gt;Athas&lt;/a&gt;. In the first chamber, the party will need to fight a number of Morning Star wielding &lt;a href=\"Halfling%20Warrior%20%28Athas%29\"&gt;Halfling Warriors&lt;/a&gt; ( each).\nFurther on is another halfling named &lt;a href=\"Togan\"&gt;Togan&lt;/a&gt; who will be standing on the bridge into the next chamber. When he sees the party, he grins and a status message reads: \"A bloodied halfling sits, chewing on a human leg bone still partially covered by dirty leather armor. It looks up, smiles, and says 'More to feast!'\" Togan then runs to join other leaders in the next cave. Togan is worth and carries &lt;a href=\"Ripper\"&gt;Ripper&lt;/a&gt;, a +2 &lt;a href=\"Composite%20Longbow\"&gt;Composite Long Bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next chamber has a few more halfling warriors, along with a halfling mage &lt;a href=\"Kayardi\"&gt;Kayardi&lt;/a&gt; (), cleric &lt;a href=\"Mogadish\"&gt;Mogadish&lt;/a&gt; () and a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Psionics\"&gt;Psionic&lt;/a&gt; hafling named &lt;a href=\"Entu\"&gt;Entu&lt;/a&gt; (), innately gifted with &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt;. of various effects. These three are particularly dangerous for a low-level or unprepared party, as they are capable of high-level spell casting, and True Sight that foils preemptive measures such as backstab attacks. After they are defeated, check Entu to recover the &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20Takkok\"&gt;Hands of Takkok&lt;/a&gt; (aka \"Gauntlets of Ogre Power\") and more Coal.\nThe Caverns lead north and exit into the Golem Laboratory.\nThe Golem Laboratory.\nThe party will be attacked by up to six creatures like &lt;a href=\"Phase%20Spider\"&gt;Phase Spiders&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Spider\"&gt;Sword Spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ettercap\"&gt;Ettercaps&lt;/a&gt; when they open the door to this chamber or enter it.\nThis chamber is where Lavok builds his various golems, and a powerful Guardian golem\u00a0is currently under the assembly process. However, it still needs its head and one arm before it can be completed.\nExploring the room will turn up &lt;a href=\"Dart%20of%20Wounding\"&gt;Darts of Wounding&lt;/a&gt; , a third batch of Coal, and a &lt;a href=\"Golem-Building%20Book\"&gt;Golem-Building Book&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Golem-Building Book\u00a0has Lavok's personal notes as well as partial instructions for assembling the Guardian Golem, though the pages are burnt and do not entirely tell you what to do.\u00a0\u00a0Luckily, it's not complicated, you simply need to activate the three furnaces, have the Arm and Head pieces in your inventory, and interact with the console in the Lab to create and activate the Golem.\nThe purpose of this golem might be as a defender of the Sphere against hostile intruders.\nAs such, though it ignores the party, it will race off to confront the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt;, that has taken up residence within. Activating the golem rewards the party with ; those who carefully partake in the ensuing battle can also potentially win the for killing the Elder Orb, even as it ineffectively focuses on attacking the unkillable Golem.\nThis room exits north to the Furnace Room and east to the Rune Room. Be warned! In spite of what the Knights of Solamnia may have told you, there could be traps set in the room, and others in obvious narrow points like a corridor. Be careful.\nThe Furnace Room.\nThis room contains three magic enhanced furnaces that are used to power the Golem Laboratory. All three have burned low and need more Coal to be reignited. Each Furnace that is restored will\u00a0spawn a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Elemental\"&gt;Fire Elemental&lt;/a&gt; as a one-time creation, forcing the party to face three such fiery guardians ( each).\nAfter activating all three furnaces, you can head back to the Golem Laboratory and finish building the Guardian Golem.\nThe room also has two more Halfling Warriors who guard two mages, &lt;a href=\"Taibela\"&gt;Taibela&lt;/a&gt; () and &lt;a href=\"Necre\"&gt;Necre&lt;/a&gt; (). Check Necre for the &lt;a href=\"Stiletto%20of%20Demarchess\"&gt;Stiletto of Demarchess&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis room exits east to the Clock Room. Be careful! There may be a trap set in the corridor.\nThe Clock Room.\nPresumably serving some purpose for the eldritch machinery that powers the Planar Sphere, this chamber is guarded by a number of Golems depending upon character level, including &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone&lt;/a&gt; ( each), and perhaps even an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; () or &lt;a href=\"Adamantite%20Golem\"&gt;Adamantite Golem&lt;/a&gt; (25.000 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;). The center of the room has a container holding a &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Head\"&gt;Golem Head&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Piercing\"&gt;Arrows of Piercing&lt;/a&gt; , more Coal, and possibly gems (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Tchazar%20Gem\"&gt;Tchazar&lt;/a&gt; ).\nIn the center of the chamber when nearby the apparatus, a text display reads:\"\"The device in this room appears to be like the inside of a clock.\"\nThe Rune Room.\nThis room is dominated by four large runic designs on the floor, which seem to be feeding arcane power into a huge orb of energy-washed obsidian suspended from the central ceiling. \nThe central feature can be interacted with when close enough and a text display reads:\"Ancient writing encircles the floating obsidian sphere. \"These four runes are the key to opening the door to the lower levels. Touch each rune in the correct order. Fail and be punished by the guardian.\"\nWhen selecting a rune incorrectly the party member may see the following text displayed:\"When you touch this rune, it begins to glow. You have a sinking feeling that you have done something wrong.\"\nIf the party member get's the correct rune, a text says:\"When you touch this rune, it begins to glow. You feel as if you have done something right.\"\"\nThis runic puzzle creates a defensive seal around the stairway \"To the Power Core\" (as marked on the player's Automap), which leads to the Ice, Flame, &amp; Engine rooms. The seal to the next areas must be opened with the solving of the puzzle. Activating the runes in the correct sequence will deactivate the wards; selecting the wrong rune will blast whoever attempted the selection with a exploding Fireball Trap. Any in the area of effect may be harmed. The puzzle is now reset and awaits the next attempt.\nThe correct order to activate the runes is unknown to the party. Completing the puzzle awards the party with and grants access to the Sphere Core via the stairway to the South. If you are unable to figure it out, see the Spoiler content section near the bottom of the page.\nOnce all runes have been selected in the correct order, a text display reads \"You hear a noise to the side as the door unlocks and opens on its own.\"\nHeading east from the Rune Room leads to the Elder Orb Room. Heading south leads to the Power Core.\nThe Elder Orb Room.\nThis chamber holds a doorway in the east leading to the Navigator's Room. However, an Elder Orb is skulking here. It is much easier to create the Guardian Golem and let it attack and slay the Beholder than to approach the beast without the golem. Of course, if you want to face the monster, thus guaranteeing the XP reward for it, then be prepared for Beholder Blast attacks from its various eye stalks, including the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt;, Disintegrate beam, Death-ray, Domination, Slow and others. Once it is dead, though, the way to Lavok is open. Search the ground carefully; a corpse has two scrolls, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, and other treasure, possibly including &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Moonbar%20Gem\"&gt;moonbars&lt;/a&gt; , and throwing daggers . \nThe Navigator's Room.\nIn this chamber, &lt;a href=\"Lavok%20Corthala\"&gt;Lavok&lt;/a&gt; directs the path of the Planar Sphere. Angered by your intrusion of his home, the malevolent wizard attacks the party. He is a difficult opponent, having access to high-level spells such as the potentially lethal &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce defeated (mortally wounded but not yet dead) Lavok, regains his senses and the party splits . This transition to mortally wounded phase initiates when the Lavok has only 10% of his original HP remaining. Immediately afterwards new dialogue begins, and Lavok is transformed into a \"new\" creature file (LAVOK02.cre) and is healed with no animation. The new creature also retains the MINH1.ITM and cannot be killed, and the mage has a prone \"Sleeping man\" animation from now on.\nLavok explains that only he has a chance of returning the Sphere back to Athkatla, and he wants to go home to see the sun of his birth-world one last time before he dies. Since the alternative is being stranded in the Sphere, stuck in the Abyss, the party must agree. Lavok states that the Sphere has exhausted its power and needs the heart of a powerful Tanar'ri as a fuel source. As it has landed in the Abyss, the party need only find a Tanar'ri, and take its corrupt and evil heart from the demon's chest. This task may be tougher than it sounds.\nOnce the party has re-powered the Engine, they must return here. Lavok will return the Sphere to Athkatla, draining the power of the Engine entirely to do so, and then plead with the party to let him feel the sunlight before he dies. If they refuse, he gives up and dies, leaving the quest complete. If his wish is granted, he dies gratefully, giving you his &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Acuity\"&gt;Ring of Acuity&lt;/a&gt;, and granting each party member a Quest Award of of .\nThe confrontation with Lavok goes differently depending on whether or not Valygar is in the party.\nThis room connects to the Myconid Room by a door to the west, and to the Lizard Hideout by a door to the north.\nExploring the room will reveal a hidden stash containing a pair of scrolls, &lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20Self\"&gt;Polymorph Self&lt;/a&gt; and , and other treasure, possibly including &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Biting\"&gt;Bolts of Biting&lt;/a&gt; , , &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moonbar%20Gem\"&gt;moonbars&lt;/a&gt; .\nThe Myconid Room.\n Presumably a source of food for Lavok and any others he deigns to share it with, this chamber of lush greenery is protected by two &lt;a href=\"Spore%20Colony\"&gt;Spore Colonies&lt;/a&gt; ( each), which produce &lt;a href=\"Myconid\"&gt;Myconid&lt;/a&gt; guardians to attack intruders, such as the protagonist and party. A &lt;a href=\"Sling%20%2B2\"&gt;Sling +2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quarterstaff%20%2B1\"&gt;Quarterstaff +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bullet%20%2B1\"&gt;Bullets +1&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potions of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt; , and are secreted in the tree trunk. Return to the Navigator's Room by a door in the south.\nThe Lizard Hideout.\n The purpose of this chamber is unknown, possibly it is Lavok's sleeping quarters. Four angry &lt;a href=\"Lizard%20Man\"&gt;Lizard Man&lt;/a&gt; creatures ( each) armed with Halberds are immediately hostile to intruders. These strange beasts carry random minor and wealthy treasures. A container within the room can be searched, revealing:\nReturn to the Navigator's Room by a door in the south.\nThe Abyssal Plane.\nOnce Lavok has been defeated, he unlocks the outer door, allowing the party to exit the sphere and explore the Abyssal Plane where they have landed. Return to the Entrance Hall and use the front door to exit out into the Abyss.\n&lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;Imps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salamander\"&gt;Salamanders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quasit\"&gt;Quasits&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Mephit\"&gt;Fire Mephits&lt;/a&gt; abound, but the goal is to confront at least one of the two &lt;a href=\"Tanar%27ri\"&gt;Tanar'ri&lt;/a&gt; that roam the area and are worth each, in order to get their &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Heart\"&gt;Demon Heart&lt;/a&gt;. They are capable of innately launching &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gaze\"&gt;Death Gaze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silence%2C%2015%27%20Radius\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Touch\"&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/a&gt;. Another more powerful demon named &lt;a href=\"Lea%27liyl\"&gt;Lea'liyl&lt;/a&gt; (able to &lt;a href=\"Gate\"&gt;Gate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maurezhi%20%28The%20Abyssal%20Plane%29\"&gt;Maurezhi&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements) is worth (and has a demon heart to loot, as well). Maurezhi in turn (the 5 HD version is worth ), can call up &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements with &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party wishes to maximize the potential XP gain, then there is nothing preventing the destruction of all creatures in the area. This would be a fine opportunity for a Paladin to flex righteous power for Tyr, Torm or Helm.\nOnce you have at least one demon heart, you may return to the Planar Sphere, and head for the Engine Room which is accessible from the Power Core via either the Flame or Ice Rooms.\nPower Core.\nThe Power Core is accessed from the Rune Room via the doorway to the south. The first of three core rooms is entered through a large hallway in the southwest. Doors in the northwest and northeast lead to the Ice Room and the Flame Room respectively.\nA &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Tolgerias\"&gt;Tolgerias&lt;/a&gt; (who may previously have asked you to hunt down Valygar Corthala) and his assistant mage (), managed to stowaway aboard the Sphere before it plane-shifted away from &lt;a href=\"Faer%C3%BBn\"&gt;Faer\u00fbn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Valygar is in the party when first entering this area, Tolgerias will initially be neutral (although the assistant mage will become hostile quickly). Tolgerias and Valygar have a tense exchange of dialogue, leading to hostility from the wizard (and his assistant mage).\nThe two of them attack the party and must be slain. If a party member enters under stealth or a form of invisibility, it is possible that no dialogue will transpire until either mage actually sees an intruder. It is therefore possible to perform a surprise attack on either, and could render Tolgerias dead from this action very rapidly, such as with a backstab. If you wish to find out more from Tolgerias, the party will have to be visible and have a dialogue. He is after all, neutral at the start. Role play this as desired. \nTolgerias is worth and drops a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Ram\"&gt;Ring of the Ram&lt;/a&gt; (if not pickpocketed earlier).\nThe Ice Room.\nIn addition to the number of traps scattered around this chamber, it also has &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Salamander\"&gt;Ice Salamanders&lt;/a&gt; ( each), &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Mephit\"&gt;Ice Mephit&lt;/a&gt;s ( each) and &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Troll\"&gt;Snow Troll&lt;/a&gt;s ( each). The center of the room hides a cache containing a &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Helm of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, a Scroll of &lt;a href=\"Otiluke%27s%20Resilient%20Sphere\"&gt;Otiluke's Resilient Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Arrows of Ice&lt;/a&gt; .\nA door to the northeast leads to the Engine Room.\nThe Flame Room.\nIn addition to the number of traps scattered around this chamber, it also includes a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Fire%20Elemental\"&gt;Greater Fire Elemental&lt;/a&gt; (), an &lt;a href=\"Efreeti%20%28Noble%29\"&gt;Efreeti (Noble)&lt;/a&gt; (), a &lt;a href=\"Salamander\"&gt;Salamander&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Smoke%20Mephit\"&gt;Smoke Mephit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Mephit\"&gt;Magma Mephit&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Mephit\"&gt;Fire Mephit&lt;/a&gt;s ( each). The central container has treasure cache with a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Staff of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Falling%20Stars\"&gt;Shield of the Falling Stars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Arrows of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and Scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.\nA door to the northwest leads to the Engine Room.\nThe Engine Room.\n This room powers the potent magics of the Planar Sphere. Only by feeding this bizarre machinery a Demon Heart can the Sphere return to &lt;a href=\"Faer%C3%BBn\"&gt;Faer\u00fbn&lt;/a&gt;. A doorway in the southeast leads to the Flame Room, a doorway in the southwest to the Ice Room.\nThere is a trigger area on a platform in the corridor leading right from the chamber entrance. It causes a number of of all types and numbers to appear and attack. Their number and types depend on the &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;:\nA &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt; also waits in the northeast corner. Behind him, a trapped container hides a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Danger%20Sense\"&gt;Ring of Danger Sense,&lt;/a&gt; and an assortment of , plus &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Slayer%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;Bala's Axe&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nExamining the central structure provides a status message:\"This pulsing mass of flesh seems to be the power core for the sphere. You will have to find some way to repower it if you wish to return to Athkatla on the Prime Material Plane.\"Clicking the structure with a Demon Heart in inventory revives the engine, awards the party with to split, and gives another status message:\"For lack of a more obvious solution, you feed the demon's heart to one of the many mouths that are imbedded\" [sic] \"in the flesh of the structure. A moment later the sphere shudders and you can sense it powering up. The power core of the sphere roars to life, distorting space as it races through the planes. After a few minutes the sphere lurches, the power fades, and the power core fizzles. The sphere has taken its last planar jaunt.\"\nReturn to the Navigator's Room to report your success to Lavok and receive his reward.\nSpoiler content.\nAttention: Reading the solution is a \"spoiler\", don't expand the text if you want to try solving the puzzle without being provided the answer.\nThe correct order of activating the runes is:\nWhen completed, the southern transition exit can be accessed.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod will enhance the general artificial Intelligence (AI) of most creatures in the Planar Sphere. If you select the Smarter Mages component then this will noticeably increase the effectiveness of all spell casters in the Dungeon, especially Lavok, and all the spell casting Athas halfling cannibals. Entu will also use his SCS enhanced psionic abilities if given a chance. The Demons and various creatures in the abyssal plane will get the SCS Smarter Demon AI enhancements as well. Golems will haste and Clay Golems will have their \"cursed wound\" ability. Additional Golems, including Juggernaut golems will be present in the Engine Room. The Iron or Adamantine golem will be able to fit through doorways in the sphere, and all golems will relentlessly pursue the party until destroyed. The Noble Efreeti in the Fire chamber will be a tougher opponent, and regenerate in mist form if damaged.\nInstalling the &lt;a href=\"Expanded%20Mage%20Stronghold\"&gt;Expanded Mage Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; Mod will begin shortly after the original &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Stronghold\"&gt;Mage Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; questline is completed. Enter the sphere again and talk to &lt;a href=\"Teos\"&gt;Teos&lt;/a&gt; to initiate the expanded content. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20for%20BG2\"&gt;Unfinished Business for BG2&lt;/a&gt; mod restores the Hell Hound creatures into the mix of denizens within the Flame Room.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Quest Pack&lt;/a&gt; Mod adds a component called \"Sending the Solamnic Knights Home\" with an option for non-mage characters to send the Solamnic Knights in the Planar Sphere back to their home world. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Test%20Your%20Mettle%21\"&gt;Test Your Mettle!&lt;/a&gt; mod begins in the Clock Room. Instead of Golem guardians, the party will face a surprise group of Modron mechanical creatures, first introduced in the game. Defeating the guards will provide a device that can unlock the mod's quest. A very involved and tactical adventure, full of puzzles and challenging battles.\nThe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//weidu.org/item.html\"&gt;Item Upgrade Mod&lt;/a&gt; will have a component needed to enhance the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Fury\"&gt;Celestial Fury&lt;/a&gt; katana. The component is located in this sphere. Specifically, the party should take an extra &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Heart\"&gt;Demon Heart&lt;/a&gt; with them before they leave the Abyssal Plane. So, one Demon Heart for the Engine Room, and another for the player to use later as a component for &lt;a href=\"Cromwell\"&gt;Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; to use for the Katana upgrade.\nMod content gallery.\n\"Portraits from &lt;a href=\"Portraits%20Portraits%20Everywhere\"&gt;Portraits Portraits Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;\" (People involved in likely order of appearance)"}

There are more than a few nobles who would pay dearly for the opportunity to vex the Jae'llat, regardless of their worth.\"\nJaraxel then says: \"True enough. I wish I could be there to see the matron mother's face when she finds out we got our payment anyway.\"\nAt this point, Gorion's Ward exclaims \"Wait a minute!

I just wanted the payment I was due, as well as collecting the price of the matron mother's insult to the Bregan D'aerthe.\"\nHe continues: \"I have not only collected the soul gems of the matron who founded the Jae'llat, but you killed their ally Deirex, a member of their own House. I have collected for myself one of the most valuable possessions that the Jae'llat had... the soul gems of the matron who founded their clan. - I think matters between the Bregan D'aerthe and House Jae'llat are pretty much even now, wouldn't you agree, &lt;CHARNAME&gt;?\"\"\nAt this stage of the dialogue, the party has some reply selections it can make, but they boil down to two outcomes.\nThe first is to willingly or begrudgingly accept what has occurred, and if so, the party will hear some final remarks and explanations of just what can be done to raid &lt;a href=\"House%20Jae%27llat\"&gt;House Jae'llat&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Jae%27llat%20Wardstone\"&gt;Jae'llat Wardstone&lt;/a&gt;, and that Jarlaxel will ensure that the city will not intervene - and also that the party is free to return to &lt;a href=\"Deirex%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Deirex's Tower&lt;/a&gt; and use the &lt;a href=\"Lich%27s%20Tooth\"&gt;Lich's Tooth&lt;/a&gt; to pass into the tower's inner treasury.\nIf the party goes with this decision, they'll receive () for their daring mission, and .\nAlternatively, Gorion's Ward can say \"\"But you and I are not even. I am not one of your lackeys, and I demand payment!\" - and Jarlaxle will then reply - \"But I am allowing you to keep your little secret, &lt;PRO_RACE&gt;. Is that worth nothing to you? Dance amongst the drow as long as you wish; I care not - As for what you choose to make of your encounter with me, that is up to you. You may choose to be bitter, or you can take advantage of your situation.\"\"\nThe party then has the &lt;a href=\"Gilded%20Rope\"&gt;Gilded Rope&lt;/a&gt; removed, but also receives an additional .\nSome parting remarks are made and the party is transported back to the exterior of Deirex's Tower.\nThe second choice is to not accept how Jarlaxel has taken advantage of the party, and to threaten him repeatedly, for example, \"\"I'll kill you for trying to manipulate me!\", and after he warns you to let it go, he'll say - \"You do remember that my men are not imprisoned... we are able to protect ourselves from the likes of you. Do you truly wish to pursue this foolishness?\"\nIf the party persists and says \"I'm going to kill you, drow, and nothing's going to stop me!\"\nWith this tone and conviction, Jaraxel will say \"A shame. Your funeral.\"\"\nAnd with that, both the drow turn hostile and attack the party, to the death. \nWith this action the party receives no reward money or quest experience points, however the combat XP for Visaj and Jaraxel can be had, and if the party is quick enough their bodies can be looted before being transferred from the pocket plane conference room.\nIn any case, you will be teleported back to the Ust Natha pathway outside the tower. \nThe quest journal also resolves with:\nThus ends the side quest.\nInside Deirex's Tower.\nIf the party is in possession of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%27s%20Tooth\"&gt;Lich's Tooth&lt;/a&gt;, then it is now possible to bypass the wards to another doorway of Deirex's Tower into the &lt;a href=\"Deirex%27s%20Cave\"&gt;Deirex's Cave&lt;/a&gt; area. Enter and find the lich's other treasures (x 3475 y 2730), within a pool of water, including:\nHouse Jae'llat.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Jae%27llat%20Wardstone\"&gt;Jae'llat Wardstone&lt;/a&gt; in your possession, you may now bypass the magical wards against intrusion and enter &lt;a href=\"House%20Jae%27llat\"&gt;House Jae'llat&lt;/a&gt;, the wardstone will open two warded doors and allow you entrance (x 3260, y 1460). Using the wardstone to enter the house is an optional action, and the player can refrain from entering the area at all if they desire.\nIf entry to the house is undertaken, then of course this will lead to a fairly large battle against many drow warriors and spell casters, including a mage and at least two priestesses (each worth () - it just wouldn't be a drow House without those elements, and this is only the first battle, there is another one when moving to the lower platforms, which involves &lt;a href=\"Hindra%20Jae%27llat\"&gt;Hindra Jae'llat&lt;/a&gt; () and &lt;a href=\"Ist%27tar%20Jae%27llat\"&gt;Ist'tar Jae'llat&lt;/a&gt; (). If you succeed in taking down the occupants, search the place for treasure, detailed on the &lt;a href=\"House%20Jae%27llat\"&gt;House Jae'llat&lt;/a&gt; page.\nBugs.\nIf you return to Ust Natha after taking the dragon eggs from the temple of Lolth, Jarlaxle will still refer to you by your pseudonym. Retrieving &lt;a href=\"Deirex%27s%20Gems\"&gt;Deirex's Gems&lt;/a&gt; will teleport you back to the pocket dimension into a tower \u2014 from which Jarlaxle will disappear soon after, leaving you unable to escape. Unfortunately, the game files will allow this to happen. Best to finish this questline before taking the Dragon Eggs to ensure no continuity problems."}
{"id": "54168", "revid": "53053884", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=54168", "title": "Inventory", "text": "\"Inventory\" may refer to the player character's inventory, a &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; member's inventory, or any other creature's inventory. Only the party member's inventories are accessible during the game though, not counting cases of partial access such as pickpocketing someone, dealing with them in some manner through dialogue (getting quest rewards, buying/selling items), or killing them in order to loot their belongings.\nThe game sometimes refers to a player character's inventory as a \"pack\" or backpack on occasion, although this isn't everything the inventory manages. Everything a creature has equipped or is in its possession is being handled through its inventory, and various effects of them on the creature can be observed there, like a breakdown of the current &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; potential. The max and current hit points, the total weight currently being carried and the max weight before being encumbered are also shown there, as well as the party's amount of gold coins.\nThe inventory is a series of slots and spaces available to allocate objects or stacks of objects. Objects are also \"items\".\nParty member inventory.\nThe inventory is accessed on the individual party member record screen. There is quite a bit of information on this screen, but here is where \"item management\" takes place. The screen allows the display of those items to be viewed, selected, sorted, changed, and moved about. \nFrom the player's party game screen/combat display select the desired party member to inspect and then click on the Inventory Icon on the left side of the screen, or just press the \"I\" key. This will open another screen - the \"Inventory Screen\".\nOn the screen there are several categories of inventory slots:\nQuiver: 3 slots - For different ammunition types such &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolt\"&gt;Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bullet\"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt;. One stack of each type per slot.\nQuick Weapons: Up to 4 Slots (Determined by character class) - For different weapon types, such &lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword\"&gt;Long Sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quarterstaff\"&gt;Quarterstaff&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Crossbow\"&gt;Heavy Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;. One weapon per slot.\nQuick Items: 3 slots - for certain consumable items such as a &lt;a href=\"Wand\"&gt;Wand&lt;/a&gt;, potion, or a scroll. Potions and scrolls with a stacking quantity assigned can be placed here. \nGold (gold coins icon): Shows the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Piece\"&gt;Gold Piece&lt;/a&gt; quantity possessed by the party in total.\nBackpack (pack/bag icon): 16 total slots to store any item {or stacks of an item if they have a stacking quantity rating) - such as &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Holding\"&gt;Bag of Holding&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Familiar\"&gt;Familiar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boo\"&gt;Boo&lt;/a&gt;, special item, book, scroll, potion, suit of armor etc.\nGround: This slot area is for viewing and moving items to and from the ground (picked up from the ground/chest/container or placed in a pile next to the selected character). There are 10 slots shown, but when there are more than ten items present in a given stockpile (pile, container etc.) then the Ground inventory has a sliding selector bar to move up or down.\nPaper Doll: In the center of the display screen is \"paper doll\" of the character, a depiction of the character's form that will reflect the worn clothing, armor and items equipped in the hands, or worn on the head and feet. It will change with any items added or subtracted from the paper doll slots.\nThe doll has the following slots available for a single item in each:\n- Torso Slot: For a suit of armor, or a robe.\n- Hands Slot: Gauntlets, bracers or gloves go here. One slot for both hands.\n- Head Slot: A helmet, Ioun stone, circlet, bandana, cowl or similar headgear would go here.\n- Neck slot: This is for a necklace, clasp, pendant, amulet and similar items worn on or near the neck.\n- Off-hand Slot: An off-hand weapon, shield, or buckler would go here. If an item in the Quick Weapons Slot requires two hands to use, then this slot can be closed off from use.\n- Right Ring Slot: a single ring, or perhaps an item such as &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Symbols\"&gt;Holy Symbols&lt;/a&gt; belong here.\n- Left Ring Slot: Same as above.\n- Waist Slot: A belt or girdle will go here.\n- Cloak Slot: A cape, shroud or cloak is placed here.\n- Feet Slot: Boots, shoes and footwear are placed here.\nSelecting/moving items.\nAny item can be selected in any of the slots discussed above with a cursor or applicable function key (depends the game platform, such as PC, Nintendo Switch, Playstation, Mobile Device). Once selected the item can be \"dragged\" to another slot such as from the off-hand to the backpack, or the Right Ring Slot to a Bag of Holding in the backpack slot.\nItems with stacks applicable can be selected, and by clicking a specific quantity from the stack selected and moved.\nMoving items between party members can be done by dragging items from the donating characters inventory screen to the recipient party members portrait. The item will always be placed in the receiving members Backpack slot. If that backpack has no empty slot, then the item won't transfer. There is a distance limitation for this function. Party members transferring items must be within that distance or they are \"too far away\".\nItems on the ground or from the \"Quick Loot Bar\" can be moved to any eligible slot, such as a found diamond to a Gem Bag, or dozen arrows to a Quiver Slot.\nCreature inventory.\nThe game's .CRE or creature files for any kind of non-player-controlled entity has a similar structure to that of the player character inventory. For example, there are quick items slots, head slot, ring slots and more. \nThis information is not visible to the player, however for the game developers, modders and users of editing tools these .CRE files can be viewed and edited. The rules for what kind of item is allowed in a specific slot can be contorted with this kind of access. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Kangaxx\"&gt;Kangaxx&lt;/a&gt; has the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Gaxx\"&gt;Ring of Gaxx&lt;/a&gt; placed in an armor slot instead of a ring slot. This prevents it from being pickpocketed yet will be available as dropped loot when the creature is defeated. "}
