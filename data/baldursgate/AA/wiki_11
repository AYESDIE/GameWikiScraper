Strange chirping noises may be heard right before an Ankheg emerges to attack. It is generally recommended that low-level parties use extreme caution in areas where they are known to thrive, and to fight only one or two at a time. They generally attack very quickly, with either melee or ranged attacks, both of which contain acid and are easily capable of doing ~20 damage per hit. When one is killed, it will drop some high-quality treasure along with an &lt;a href=\"Ankheg%20Shell\"&gt;Ankheg Shell&lt;/a&gt;. The shells may be sold for a large sum, but transporting them poses significant difficulty, as each shell weighs 100 lbs.\nTactics.\nCombat.\nIt's risky to attack an ankheg with a character with low hitpoints.\n&lt;a href=\"Kagain\"&gt;Kagain&lt;/a&gt; at level 3 or 4 will have enough hitpoints to survive a hit from an Ankheg. He also has good saving throws.\nAnkhegs are especially vulnerable to the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Sleep\"&gt;Wand of Sleep&lt;/a&gt; (usable by nearly any companion) and the mage spell &lt;a href=\"Sleep\"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt;. The priest spell Command can help too.\nIf an ankheg is not asleep, beware its lethal ranged attack. &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt; allows a melee fighter to approach quickly. Having at least one backup fighter can help.\nTo inflict damage quickly on Ankhegs:\nOther party members can use ranged weapons such as bows.\nTo protect a tank melee fighter:\nShells.\nAssuming you find more than a few, there are two people you can sell them to - one within the city of Baldur's Gate (&lt;a href=\"Fenten\"&gt;Fenten&lt;/a&gt;), the other in Beregost (&lt;a href=\"Taerom%20Fuiruim\"&gt;Smith Taerom&lt;/a&gt;) offering the creation of a unique &lt;a href=\"Ankheg%20Plate%20Mail\"&gt;Ankheg Plate Mail&lt;/a&gt;, which in BG1 prevents any future sales of such shells to him (not in EE). In any case, you will have to haul the 100 lbs. stacks, which is when companions with high Strength can be really helpful, such as &lt;a href=\"Dorn%20Il-Khan\"&gt;Dorn&lt;/a&gt; (500 lbs), &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt; (320 lbs) and &lt;a href=\"Shar-Teel%20Dosan\"&gt;Shar-Teel&lt;/a&gt; (250 lbs). \nTo increase Strength and therefore carrying capacity:\nLastly, each character may carry 20% more than their maximum capacity and still stay mobile, albeit significantly slowed.\nIn you can have &lt;a href=\"Cromwell\"&gt;Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Athkatla Docks&lt;/a&gt; fashion &lt;a href=\"Ankheg%20Plate%20Mail\"&gt;Ankheg Plate Mail&lt;/a&gt; from it for 5000.\nLocations.\nBaldur's Gate.\nThey are primarily found in the Farmland &lt;a href=\"Area%20North%20of%20the%20Friendly%20Arm\"&gt;Area North of the Friendly Arm&lt;/a&gt;, though will rarely appear on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Gullykin\"&gt;Gullykin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Area%20North%20of%20Carnival\"&gt;Area North of Carnival&lt;/a&gt;. As with most mobs, they spawn in numbers proportional the strength of one's party. At lower levels a party should only encounter one per spawn, while a group averaging level 5 may encounter three, and only the most advanced parties will encounter more.\nBaldur's Gate II.\nThey will rarely appear in the &lt;a href=\"Windspear%20Hills\"&gt;Windspear Hills&lt;/a&gt; area, but likely alone. Along with a higher level party, they're no longer such a significant threat.\nCorrupted Ankheg.\n A nest of six corrupted ankhegs can be found to the east of the great tree by some glowing crystals at the bottom of Resurrection Gorge during &lt;a href=\"Dorn%20II-Khan\"&gt;Dorn Il-Khan's&lt;/a&gt; quest."}

He will charge you to make the armor and you need to help him for a day. You can do this more than once.\nGameplay.\nIn the base game, Ankheg Plate armor is unique as it's the only plate armor made from the shell of an animal, rather than metal. That makes it highly valuable to certain characters/classes, and less so for others. (: In SoD and BG2, more lightweight, non-metallic armors become available such as &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Beetle%20Plate\"&gt;Rhino Beetle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Armor\"&gt;Dragonscale)&lt;/a&gt;. \nDruids: In , Ankheg Plate is the best armor &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt; can wear since it is non-metallic. If a Druid is in your party this armor is very valuable for the AC it provides, especially if taking the role of 'combat medic', since cure spells have to be cast at touch range. \nFighters: By raw numbers, Ankheg Plate is weaker by 2 AC vs. piercing/missile weapons, and 1 AC vs. slashing compared to &lt;a href=\"Full%20Plate%20Armor\"&gt;Full Plate Armor&lt;/a&gt;, but equal vs. crushing weapons.\nAdditionally, in the classic game you can't wear protection items such a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Princes\"&gt;Ring of the Princes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Protection%20%2B1\"&gt;Cloak of Protection +1&lt;/a&gt; with Ankheg Plate Mail. Full Plate Armor is a better choice if you also want protection gear for armor and saving throws bonuses.\nLow Strength value: Ankheg armor is nearly as strong as Full Plate, but as light as &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Leather%20Armor\"&gt;Studded Leather Armor&lt;/a&gt;. Its low &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; requirement of 8 also allows weaker companions like &lt;a href=\"Viconia%20DeVir\"&gt;Viconia&lt;/a&gt; to wear it and gain decent protection. The low weight also makes it a good back-up armor for Fighter / Mages and &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Cleric / Mage&lt;/a&gt;s to keep in their inventory and put on once they have exhausted their arcane spells, so as to survive better in melee.\nTrivia.\nAnkheg Plate Mail is most likely based on Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2nd Edition) Field Plate since they share the same modifiers, although the Ankheg Plate has a base AC of 1 instead of 2. This discrepancy is could be explained by being personally crafted for the player by a master armorer."}

His low &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; does him no favor, so it is advised to equip him with the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20Dexterity\"&gt;Gauntlets of Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; to boost his defense.\nHis starting &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;proficiencies&lt;/a&gt; depend on &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;'s level at the time of recruitment:\n^ Due to Cleric class restrictions, Anomen can no longer use spears.\nIn the Enhanced Edition, Anomen joins the party as a level 8 Cleric with\u00a07 levels as\u00a0Fighter.\u00a0 He is given a\u00a0one-time XP bonus to match\u00a0the average XP level of the party.\u00a0 The highest Cleric level he can reach\u00a0at the time of joining is 13.\u00a0 How to level him up from 8 is up to the player.\u00a0 While\u00a0joining, he has the following proficiency points:\nAs a dual-classed fighter, Anomen can achieve grandmastery in any cleric-specific weapon and can also invest three proficiency points in Two-Weapon Style. This makes him very\u00a0useful in melee combat and offers a lot of options for customization.\nItems.\nAnomen has the following gear when joining the party: &lt;a href=\"Mace\"&gt;Mace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Splint%20Mail\"&gt;Splint Mail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helmet\"&gt;Helmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sling\"&gt;Sling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bullets\"&gt;Bullets&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Delryn%20Family%20Shield\"&gt;Delryn Family Shield&lt;/a&gt; which can only be used by him.\n\"Throne of Bhaal\".\nProvided he is alive and has not chosen to part ways with Gorion's Ward, Anomen is a potential party member in Throne of Bhaal. His disposition varies based on how\u00a0his personal quest was completed in Shadows of Amn, as well as if he is in a romantic relationship with the player character.\nAnomen remains a stalwart devotee of Helm, and boasts that he is\u00a0among the most powerful of his god's servants to walk the realms. Throughout the\u00a0culmination of the Bhaalspawn Saga he reacts and offers input in accordance with his alignment. If Lawful Good, Anomen will maintain the moral high road and urges Gorion's Ward to pursue a righteous path. A Chaotic Neutral Anomen will entertain darker inclinations, admitting he feels a\u00a0thrill as\u00a0the brutal war and destiny churn around them.\u00a0\nRecruitment\nAs other companions, he can be summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28area%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane&lt;/a&gt;. If dismissed, he will wait there.\nGameplay.\nAs a dual-classed fighter with solid Strength and Constitution scores, Anomen's strongest position within the party is front- or middle-line support. In ToB he has access to Cleric high level abilities, and the cleric's fast progression table means he can quickly access the top-tier clerical spells (lv 31). Ideally, Anomen's spell scroll should contain powerful defensive spells and undead summons which bolster his effectiveness\u00a0before a fight starts. In battle, select offensive spells with short casting times as his role as a forward tank/support makes him susceptible to interrupts.\u00a0\nThough Anomen has fewer spells overall than high\u00a0Wisdom healers such as Cernd\u00a0or Viconia, his position helps offset this disadvantage by placing him near party members who take the brunt of the group's damage. This allows him to dole out healing spells\u00a0without spending precious seconds closing the distance to injured tanks, and he is less imperilled than other spellcasters should an enemy suddenly turn\u00a0its attention to him.\nRomance.\nIf in a relationship with Gorion's Ward, Anomen will attempt to offer his partner solace\u00a0whilst confessing that he\u00a0worries\u00a0about the future. He dreads the possibility that fate may tear them apart, especially concerned\u00a0his love may be forced to choose between divinity and mortality. Anomen acknowledges he cannot compete with godhood, but eventually proposes to Gorion's Ward with a family ring. She may accept or refuse. So long as she does not end their relationship, Anomen will insist she keep the ring as a token of his affection.\nUpon victory at the Throne of Bhaal,\u00a0Anomen will offer his thoughts upon whether Gorion's Ward should assume or deny their father's mantle. There he will again express his love but says he will not stand in the way of\u00a0destiny. The player's choice affects Anomen's final epilogue.\nEpilogues.\nAnomen has two epilogues. The second only prompts if he was romanced and Gorion's Ward chooses to remain mortal; the first occurs in all other instances.\nAchievements.\nI Dub Thee.\nSee Anomen join the Order of the Most Radiant Heart."}

Its precise components are unknown, but Thalantyr admits that it was at least partially based on the spell Reincarnation, and as such requires a &lt;a href=\"skull\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; taken from an undead &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; as a material component; this serves as the \"dead\" element that fuels the spell's efforts to alter the form of the target back into their human shape.\nDespite Thalantyr's best efforts, the spell was notably unstable, being as likely to messily kill the target as to successfully restore them to humanity."}

She has her own assigned cell. Her ability to see through the planes drove her mad and she will tell the player about the things she sees and even show them.\nThe party may initiate further dialogue by speaking with her in the inmate cellblock area. Various interjections are scripted by certain core party companions.\nDuring the first meeting with the inmates, including Aphril, the group are protected from death with the &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt;. They are essential to the plot script, and sometimes players recklessly try and kill everything everywhere. There will be plenty of blood spilling later in the quest, so no need to jump the gun.\nLater in the questline, Aphril will join with the party to defeat Irenicus in the final battle of the Asylum adventure. She will not be a controllable creature during the fight but will take spell casting action as scripted to defend herself and attack Irenicus and any hostile creatures in the battle zone. The conjurer has a well populated spellbook of memorized spells levels 1 through 7.\nLike all of the inmates, she later dies during the fight against &lt;a href=\"Irenicus\"&gt;Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Basement\"&gt;Spellhold Basement&lt;/a&gt;. This certain fate is scripted for plot purposes and can't be prevented.\nCross-references to other games:.\nMost notably she sees things from two other games, namely \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Neverwinter%20Nights\"&gt;Neverwinter Nights&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises Aphril's memorized spells and AI. The mod also randomly revises mage kit assignment on install, and she could be an Invoker or an Enchanter for example. This will allow a more robust initial pre-buffing of protective spells at the outset of hostilities, especially against Irenicus - who also has a deadlier initial attack phase. \nIn the unmodded game she is woefully unprepared to resist damaging spells of any kind. With SCS she has more staying power and can remain in the fight longer. The mod also furnishes Aphril with one or two potions for quaffing (two when fighting Irenicus).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod will change her spells to the mod versions."}

Frankly, this isn't explained very well in the game, but it really isn't a mystery that has to be solved in order to progress through the various tests and hurdles to be freed from the asylum discharge process.\nThere is a total of fifteen different .CRE files associated with the apparition appearances in the game. Many of these will only be produced based on dialogue choices made when the party is replying to questions from the Arbiter. Different tests have separate .CRE files and dialogue trees. \nIn general, the more non-compliant and combative or uncooperative the party is with the Arbiters, the longer it will take to get through the tests presented by these arbiters. In many instances being recalcitrant or unaccepting of their orders results in additional remedial challenges and tests. However, further tests provide more gameplay, and a way to gain further experience and even some loot.\nThese creatures are not meant to be attacked or faced in combat. They are designed to be immune to this sort of hostile action for plot purposes. It may be possible to actually cast a spell or fire a missile weapon at some of these creatures, but it won't gain any advantage and is really a waste of energy. Although difficult to do, breaking the game script will result in a reload scenario, so don't purposely foul up the game cohesion."}

There may be a group of Spiders (&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Spider\"&gt;Sword Spider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt; and 3 &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s) that has spawned in your path, so dispatch those and move to NW back side of the &lt;a href=\"Pai%27Na%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Pai'Na's Lair&lt;/a&gt; to the meeting place with &lt;a href=\"Haz\"&gt;Haz&lt;/a&gt; and his golem. \nMake entry into Bodhi's hideout.\nDescription: A grand hall, with different tile patterns on the floor lies ahead. Statues of Jackal headed figures are in neat rows along the main path. Colorful decorated upright sarcophagi \"heads\" are aligned along the outer walls. The entire tomb decor is reminiscent of an \"Egyptian\" crypt. Perhaps the tombs were built in devotion to a forgotten kingdom and unknown deity. At the end of the Hall are a closed pair of blue hued great stone doors. To either side of the doors are a pair of tall statues holding a crook scepter. These doors are to be opened by the Golem.\nHaz will greet the party and say \"\"At last, you've arrived. These spiders were starting to make me nervous. Allow me to open these doors for you.\". He then orders his golem forward toward some doors to the vampire hideout and says \"Fleshy! Go forth and open the doors! Now, you stupid creature! Now! &lt;CHARNAME&gt;, I trust you're prepared.\"\". Haz and the golem move forward and the party will probably observe several &lt;a href=\"Grimwarder\"&gt;Grimwarder&lt;/a&gt; creatures in front of the main hideout doors, who are rapidly charging toward Haz - who fearfully cries \"No! Stay back!\". At the same Instant a male vampire figure named &lt;a href=\"Lassal\"&gt;Lassal&lt;/a&gt; will shout at the party \"Fools! The mistress knew you would come! Fight then, and know you die for nothing!\". A few tics later Lassal will disappear with a Dimension Door animation, and the golem will lumber forward to open the doors into the hideout.\nIf the party is quick enough, they may be able to intercept and take down the Grimwarders before they slay Haz. If not, he'll die. If he is saved, he will say \"That is all I can do for you.\"\", and flees the area, along with his golem. If he is killed the golem will remain and fight as a neutral creature if attacked. Haz's corpse can be looted for some treasure and valuables. All total there are two &lt;a href=\"Grimwarder\"&gt;Grimwarder&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Grimward%20Archer\"&gt;Grimward Archer&lt;/a&gt; here to contend with. Note that the archers try to keep away from melee range so as to allow better missile fire attacks. The Grimwarder remains can also be examined for various weaponry, ammunition, helmets and valuables.\nBodhi's hideout.\nDescription: The next area is available for entry once the golem has opened the blue doors. Within is a large rectangular room with a high ceiling. It is lit by several oil lamps. a cluster of decorated urns are near the wall edges, but the most prominent feature is an ornate golden-leafed banquet sized table with matching high-backed chairs occupying the center of the chamber, with lit oil lamps placed upon it. There are two corridors connected to this area - one leading to the East and one to the West. A staircase doorway leads below on the NE wall. There is also a secret doorway that must be detected on the NW wall. This will not be apparent upon first entry into this room.\nCentral hall.\nAs a party member enters the room, they'll likely see a male &lt;a href=\"Fledgling%20Vampire\"&gt;Fledgling Vampire&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Ghoul\"&gt;Greater Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;, and again Lassal, who jeers at the party with a defiant declaration saying \"Come then, come to your doom! Dare you breach the inner sanctum? I think not!\". He'll then move quickly and run away off the map, most probably heading for Bodhi's Lair (downstairs).\nThe Fledgling vampire and the ghoul will move toward the closest party member to attack. Now, it is also possible that the vampire &lt;a href=\"Gellal\"&gt;Gellal&lt;/a&gt;, who is tucked away in the Western corridor (coordinates 939.979) could detect the party at this point, and will most likely stride forward to attack, while snarling out a ferocious and guttural roar. The party should take down these undead creatures. If the vampires are destroyed, they will turn into gaseous cloud form and drift away to their respective coffins to reconstitute. The fallen ghoul may drop some treasure.\nCorridor to the room of blood and blades:.\nTo the party's right is a corridor that leads to the \"room of blood and blades\". About midway down the passageway will be found a Fledgling vampire with a female appearance (coord: 1991.670) and &lt;a href=\"Tanova\"&gt;Tanova&lt;/a&gt; {coord: 2121.683). In the unmodified game this version of Tanova is primarily a spell caster and has poor melee attack abilities. She'll immediately fire off a couple of protective buffs and then begin offensive spell casting at any detected party members, typically the closest to her. If you engage and destroy her, she will turn into a gaseous cloud and disappear from the map. Tanova will reappear again in in Chapter 6. If you desire to explore the room of blood and blades at this time, to see what is within and to clear the \"fog of war\" and reveal the map, the party may do so, but beware the insidious nature of this area which can prove to be a painful trek to walk through. Nothing can be done about the damage inflicted except for Stoneskin or physical damage resistance.\nCorridor to the Crypt and bed chamber:.\nWhen the party is ready and wishes to explore the corridor that Lassal came from, move ahead into a corridor with some sharp turns. It is also possible that Lassal will be blocking the party's path and will attack.\nCrypt chamber:.\nThe corridor has a passageway that leads to Crypt chamber with a hostile guardian &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt;, that is watching over three ornate sarcophagi (or coffins). Any of the coffins can be interacted with and \"clicked on\" but will only do something if a named vampire has already been defeated and fled here by gaseous cloud form. These are Durst, Gellal, and Lassal. When the cursor is placed over the coffin it may display a text message saying \"The vampire retreated to this coffin once you defeated it. If you have a wooden stake, you can try to kill it.\" If so, then a party member may use a &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Stake\"&gt;Wooden Stake&lt;/a&gt; upon the vampire within to permanently destroy it. \nEach staking awards the party extra 9,000 XP as well as a screen text message saying \"You pound the stake through the vampire's foul heart. The creature shall prey no more on the blood of others..\".\nBedchamber:.\nIf you go back to the original corridor where Lassal spawned, eventually the party will come to a sort of vampiric bed chamber, with an odd resting platform perforated with holes, cushions, urns, and a table as well as a chest. Two oil lamps provide illumination. There is an exit to the Athkatla Graveyard here as well, leading to the surface.\nThere are two containers that can be examined to see if they have anything within. See the Containers and loot section further below.\nBlood bath chamber:.\nThis room can be entered from a secret corridor from the Central Hall or another corridor connected to the Crypt chamber. Within will be &lt;a href=\"Durst\"&gt;Durst&lt;/a&gt;, a fledgling vampire (male appearance) and a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Ghoul\"&gt;Greater Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;SCS&lt;/a&gt; installed the fledgling vampire will attack from invisibility and attempt a backstabbing attack. If the party is able to destroy all the creatures here it will be possible to search this room unmolested. \nThe chamber looks like some kind of pleasure area for vampires, with cushions and pillows, various urns and vases, a comfortable chaise lounge, two oil lamps and a prominent raised bath with steps on all sides for ease of access. This macabre bath (or pool) contains uncongealed blood, and much of it. Hovering the cursor over the pool displays text saying \"The pool is filled with what is obviously blood. You can enter the pool if you dare.\" If a party member does enter, they will trigger some minor damage (10 HP) to themselves as well as receiving the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Disruption\"&gt;Mace of Disruption&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory - a text message displays \"You enter the blood pool and find a mace at the bottom. The blood makes you feel sick, however..\" \nWhen the party has finished the exploration, then they can transition below to &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Bodhi's Lair&lt;/a&gt; by taking the passageway and stairs leading below. The assault on the vampires must continue and can't end until they are evicted or destroyed.\nBodhi's Lair.\nEntry corridor:.\nThe party descends steps into another corridor, decorated in the same theme as the rest of the tombs. Two oil lamps provide some weak illumination. In the distance can be seen a dim figure moving rapidly toward the party. It's a Greater Ghoul. Further along the passageway after turning a right-angle corner is seen yet another one. Beyond the undead creature is a set of closed stone doors. When ready, open the doors and advance through the doorway to the next chamber.\nBlood lair:.\nWithin is an octagonal chamber that has a overwhelming odor of blood. Five pools of flowing blood are within, with an octagon-shaped one in the center. If you examine the pool with the cursor it displays: \"The central pool is full of fresh, constantly flowing blood from an unknown source. The room is thick with its smell.\" Giagantic carved stone heads are mounted on the walls. Four oil lamps provide illumination. Mosaic tiles on the floor dispaly a group of shrouded figures. Two set of doors are closed leading to unknown areas beyond. Not much time is available to take in the sights, as there are two female and one male Fledgling vampires, two Grimwarders, and two Grimwarder archers ready for battle.\nWhen the party is ready open the doors to the two attached chambers to this area. One room is cluttered with various tomb artifacts of the dead, and there are two containers that may have things within, an Urn and a chest.\nThe other room contains and altar, but also here is where a Lassal is waiting. Instead of attacking he makes some statements and dares you to find him in the room of blood and blades on the floor above, then vanishes yet again. The altar within is a container that can be searched.\nThe room of blood and blades.\nDescription: A very large circular chamber with cut stone walls on which are mounted gruesome faces peering toward the center. The floor slopes down toward the middle, where there is a pentagonal shaped drain. Great \"ship anchor\" sized chains are tightly suspended and fastened from the ceiling to the drain. If the player's cursor is placed nearby a text displays \"This hideous torture room is dominated by a blood-encrusted drain in the center. It appears as if victims are thrown in the room to bleed out their lives on the cruelly spiked floor. Why the blood is collected in this drain remains a mystery.\"\nInvisible to the party are five triggers on various parts of the room's floor. If walked over, the triggers launch a \"spear-spike\" trap thrusting upwards into the party member causing a great deal of piercing damage. The traps cannot be detected nor disarmed, and they will trigger over and over again if traveled across.\nFurther back in this huge room will eventually be found Lassal, who will verbally challenge the nearest party member in sight with \"Think yourself brave enough to stand before me? Perhaps bravery is not enough!\" Further back and forth dialogue will continue, mostly him spitting out threats, and then he'll begin to fight. See the &lt;a href=\"Lassal\"&gt;Lassal&lt;/a&gt; page for his abilities and details, as well as mod content. With the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;SCS&lt;/a&gt; mod, lassal will seek to make party members chase after him after shapeshifting into bat form (which is difficult to hit and has fast movement rate). While in bat form lassal regenerates. Running around the room chasing the bat will expose that party member to more trap damage. \nStake Lassal's coffin - facing Bodhi.\nWhen the party is able to defeat Lassal so it turns into gaseous form and retreats to his coffin, then the party can go to the Crypt and use the wooden stake to permanently destroy him. As soon as that is performed, Bodhi will appear in the crypt and begin her dialogue.\nShe'll initially be neutral and say to the nearest party member (she's actually addressing &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; as is apparent in the dialogue) \"Hmm... I had hoped it would not come to this, but you are set in your path, aren't you?\". Further questions and answers will play out, with the PCs dialogue choices determining how much. The party can actually learn quite a bit of information from Bodhi if patient and willing to engage in her responses. You will even learn that there is something unique about Imoen, though not exactly what. However, in the end, violence will ensue, and Bodhi will attack. When the battle begins, she'll engage in melee combat, and after two rounds attempt a &lt;a href=\"Domination%20%28Innate%29\"&gt;Vampire Domination&lt;/a&gt;. This will continue every two rounds. As she only has 102 HP in the unmodded game, it probably won't be very long until she stops the battle and says \"\"Well, that certainly was... educational. I have seen enough, and I am done with you... for now\".\" She will then vanish from the area. The Task for Aran is now complete. \nThe player's Journal will update:\n\"I have defeated the rival guild, full of vampires as it was, and have faced Bodhi. She claimed to know something of Imoen and seemed to be judging me in some manner before she left in gaseous form. All that remains now is to return to Aran and tell him that the guild is gone, even if their leader remains unkilled. I will have questions for him as well.\n\"One more troubling thing... Bodhi knew. She knew I am a child of Bhaal.\" \nWith the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;SCS&lt;/a&gt; mod Bodhi will be much more resilient and powerful. She may be accompanied by six &lt;a href=\"Grimward%20Archer\"&gt;Grimward Archer&lt;/a&gt; assistants after the battle begins. As these are missile firing creatures, they will keep their distance and fire at any in melee with Bodhi.\nFinal actions.\nCollect any treasures or dropped items you wish to keep, and when your party is ready, travel to the surface. Reporting your success to Aran Linvail will close out the quest and begin advancing the party towards Chapter 4 and traveling to &lt;a href=\"Brynnlaw\"&gt;Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt;. Each party member will also receive 50,000 XP as well.\nMod content.\nIf playing the &lt;a href=\"Alternatives\"&gt;Alternatives&lt;/a&gt; mod and the party decides to accomplish the last remaining task required by \"Aster\", the party will be undertaking the same mission as the Aran Linvail task, mainly to destroy the Vampires in their hideout. Instead of the mage &lt;a href=\"Haz\"&gt;Haz&lt;/a&gt;, the party will meet a mage named \"Zahl\" also with a golem named \"Fleshy\". The mod does not change the area, loot, or opponents. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod will make revisions to all enemy creatures encountered on this page. If the \"Improved Vampires\" component is installed, that will be the most noticeable change for the player. See the &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; page and Mod content section for more information. Each named vampire may have additional SCS mod notes as well. Note that &lt;a href=\"Tanova\"&gt;Tanova&lt;/a&gt; will be potentially pose a much greater challenge as SCS has made significant changes to her.\nIf the \"Tougher Bodhi\" component is installed, then it will be vastly more difficult when facing her compared to the unmodified game, similar to the early \"Tactics Mod\" but updated a bit for the EE games. Be careful facing her with that component. She has some mod only powers and abilities above and beyond the \"Improved Vampires\" capabilities. This can be problematic for a party member attacking with melee weaponry, as Bodhi's \"Deathly Shroud\" deals cold damage to the attacker, and lowers saving throws by 1 (lasting 36 seconds) upon each attack on her. There are other powers as well which can be used by this iteration, but all of them can be used in the final battle with Bodhi in chapter 6."}

There are three tasks that must be performed in order for the party to receive Aran's help in reaching the island of &lt;a href=\"Brynnlaw\"&gt;Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt;. \nYour initial meeting with Aran leads to the following &lt;a href=\"Journal\"&gt;Journal&lt;/a&gt; entry in the quest section:\nTask No.1 \u2014 Mook.\nGo down to the south end of the &lt;a href=\"Docks%20District\"&gt;Docks District&lt;/a&gt; at night and meet with &lt;a href=\"Mook\"&gt;Mook&lt;/a&gt; at the Shipyard Docks. She will fill you in on her previous encounter with a strange man that she's observed casing the area. A cut scene will begin and a creature named &lt;a href=\"Lassal\"&gt;Lassal&lt;/a&gt; will appear. Mook will attempt conversation and Lassal will kill Mook and attack your party. When Lassal reaches a low enough hit point level, he'll revert to his gaseous form and leave. \nThis leads to the following Journal entry:\nWhen you return to Aran and report what took place, he seems genuinely bummed that she was killed.

Conversation will either lead to them believing your story of being other recruits or attacking you. During the beginning of the fight, Caehan may blurt out the name of the guild contact (Gracen). The guild contact will also arrive and ask what's going on. Depending upon your charisma, he'll either tell you the location of the guild or attack. He carries a &lt;a href=\"Contact%27s%20Note\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; from Lassal that also provides the guild location. \nThis leads to the following Journal entry:\nReturn to Aran and inform him of what you have learned. He'll inform you of Bodhi's attack upon the guild and send you to the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Graveyard District&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Bodhi and the vampire guild.\nThis leads to the following Journal entry:\nTask No.3 \u2014 Defeat Bodhi and her guild.\nGo to the Graveyard and head for one of the three entrances that leads to the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt;. Watch out for a potential appearance of &lt;a href=\"Pai%27Na\"&gt;Pai'Na&lt;/a&gt;'s spiders (should they randomly spawn again), and then meet up with the mage &lt;a href=\"Haz\"&gt;Haz&lt;/a&gt; and his flesh golem near the entrance to the vampire guild hideout. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Grimwarder\"&gt;Grimwarder&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Fledgling%20Vampire\"&gt;Fledgling Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s, then go after the remaining mature vampires. Defeat &lt;a href=\"Durst\"&gt;Durst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gellal\"&gt;Gellal&lt;/a&gt; and Lassal and stake all three of them in their coffins. When you have finished staking Lassal, Bodhi will appear and after some conversation, she will attack. Once she's lost enough hit points, she'll turn gaseous and flee. Return to Aran and make a report.\nThis leads to the following Journal entry:\nReturn once more to Aran and he will set you up with &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; who will captain the ship that will take you to the island of Brynnlaw.\nThis ends the quest with the following Journal entry:"}

He can be found in a secret room in his &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;hideout&lt;/a&gt; that's connected to the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves%20Guildhall\"&gt;Shadow Thieves Guildhall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Docks&lt;/a&gt; area. Access to the hideout is gained with a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thief%20Cellar%20Key\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; obtained from &lt;a href=\"Gaelan%20Bayle\"&gt;Gaelan Bayle&lt;/a&gt; after paying him the required sum of or killing Gaelan for it.\nThere are two InfoBoxes on this page. The top one reflects Aran if not sided with &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;. The second one is the creature faced if siding with &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; and is the most likely version a party will face in any combat situation. \nAttacking Aran or any of the guild area Shadow Thieves outside of the \"sided with Bodhi\" situation is not recommended due to the punishing attack(s) the unkillable &lt;a href=\"Arkanis%20Gath\"&gt;Arkanis Gath&lt;/a&gt; unleashes upon the party. \nGameplay.\nDialogue and plot are different depending on whether the party sides with the Shadow Thieves or Bodhi. Aran's dialogue and plot behavior are different as well based on these two paths, and that changes the necessary quests and tasks for the party and the opening of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%203\"&gt;chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf for any reason the party has come into conflict with Aran and the Shadow Thieves, then Aran will respond in a combat situation as a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as Aran is alerted and detected an enemy party member near his lair he will apply the following buffs:\n&lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Evil&lt;/a&gt; and then a &lt;a href=\"Cacofiend\"&gt;Cacofiend&lt;/a&gt; gate will be attempted.\nMore spell casting will be attempted from memorized spells listed in the InfoBox, including disabling types like &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20Field\"&gt;Teleport Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Confusion\"&gt;Confusion&lt;/a&gt;. Aran will also try to strike any detected enemies in melee range from invisibility, which will be a &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;. If injured or needing to quickly turn invisible again, Aran is scripted to use his carried potions. He also may stay out of melee range and fire bolts from distance. Beware use of the &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Biting\"&gt;Bolt of Biting&lt;/a&gt;. \nAran is not without help in his lair, so he will enjoy at least a few rounds of support from other thieves and cleric of cyric.\nIn Chapter 6.\nAssuming Aran is still alive during &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%206\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 6&lt;/a&gt;, the party can seek out Aran in his hideout and attempt to ask for assistance for &lt;a href=\"The%20final%20battle%20with%20Bodhi\"&gt;The final battle with Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrough dialogue exchange, Aran might agree to help, or not, depending on dialogue selections and trust between he and &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party failed to destroy Bodhi in Chapter 3, or if &lt;a href=\"Hexxat\"&gt;Hexxat&lt;/a&gt; is a party companion, both issues will affect the decision, as can the tone of the dialogue and if Aran is threatened.\nIf Aran agrees, the players journal updates as follows:\nAnd if Aran says no to providing help, the journal is updated with this:\nNotes.\nAran's alignment was changed from True Neutral to Lawful Evil in .\nMod Content.\nMods.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod provides Aran with a unique enchanted weapon known as the \"Dagger of Accumen\". It is a handy weapon for any kind of Rogue. You'll need to either pickpocket him for it (extremely difficult) or take it from him by force.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes modest changes to Aran, but the main revisions will be to the AI scripts for smarter spell casting behavior, and additional backstabbing plans. His spellbook is changed in terms of memorized spells. \nAran's initial protective (previously cast) buffs are: &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI Divination&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/SpellRevisions/spells/arcane/level-5/dispelling-screen\"&gt;Dispelling Screen&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR mod&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe'll be able to deploy a prepared &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; during the battle. Aran can cast &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Word\"&gt;Secret Word&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; to take down player enemy protections. He has a mixed assortment of offensive damage and disabling mage spells as well. With the Icewind Dale spell component, he has two spells for use from that component.\nExpect backstabbing attacks if his AI finds a detected party member. He'll go for the vulnerable and can turn invisible several times in the heat of combat.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, all Aran's arcane spell will be the SR version. The SR &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/SpellRevisions/spells/arcane/level-3/non-detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt; spell makes Aran immune to divination attacks like &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20Purge\"&gt;Invisibility Purge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alternatives\"&gt;Alternatives&lt;/a&gt; mod provides additional decision pathways to deal with the Shadow Thieves/Aran Linvail and Bodhi and her vampire coven guild war - An alternative path allows the player to destroy both the thieves AND the vampires before taking transportation to &lt;a href=\"Brynnlaw\"&gt;Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt;."}

The hideout is located in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Athkatla Docks&lt;/a&gt; district and is accessible from inside the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thief%20Guildhall\"&gt;Shadow Thief Guildhall&lt;/a&gt;, as well as from the outside of the guildhall after you first enter it from the guildhall.\nGaining access to this hideout is possible by one of two ways:\nLayout (side w/ Aran).\nWhen you first enter the hideout from the guildhall, you will travel down a staircase that opens to a dining area filled with tables, crates, and baskets. Here you will meet the shadow thieves &lt;a href=\"Cuchul\"&gt;Cuchul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mitsu\"&gt;Mitsu&lt;/a&gt; along with Linvail's girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Tassa\"&gt;Tassa&lt;/a&gt;. There are two doorways at either end of the room and a secret entrance that's located across the room almost opposite from a short hallway that leads to the streets. A third doorway is found along the wall of the room just to the left of the hallway entry point.\nThe southern doorway leads to the torture chamber where the dwarf &lt;a href=\"Booter\"&gt;Booter&lt;/a&gt; is busy \"working\" on a prisoner. The doorway along the wall leads to a room where prisoners are kept. The northern doorway opens to another short hallway the \"T's\" to yet another short hallway. To the left is the coat check room where &lt;a href=\"Missy\"&gt;Missy&lt;/a&gt; the coat check girl is waiting to take your coat. To the right is the beginning of the training area that's located within the hideout.\nThe training area is comprised of several different types of setups, all designed to keep shadow thieves in tip-top shape for their respective tasks that they are required to perform for the guild. The sergeant &lt;a href=\"Pelanna\"&gt;Pelanna&lt;/a&gt;, Mistress of the Run, is busy with a trainee in the area that resembles a city location and several other thieves are also found practicing throughout this whole area. The area with the elongated, rotating, spiked walkways does contain a few traps so beware.\nExploring all of this segment of the hideout will eventually lead you to another room that's filled with creates, tools, and a several more tables. The hallway that parallels this room leads to a secret escape/entrance way that exits to a nondescript location of the Docks District.\nAran Linvail's Lair.\nTraveling through the secret entrance from the main dining area reveals a long hallway that eventually takes a left-hand turn. Traveling up a flight of stairs leads to a rusty metal walkway that leads to another doorway and a short hallway beyond that ends at the door that opens to Linvail's bedroom lair. You've now reached the Shadowmaster in all his famed glory.\nLayout (side w/ Bodhi).\nIf you have decided to side with &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; and her vampire guild, the area remains the same in its general layout. However, the cast of characters you meet will change. Now the hideout is filled with several different types of shadow thieves, along with the fighter &lt;a href=\"Dedral\"&gt;Dedral&lt;/a&gt; and the mage &lt;a href=\"Haz\"&gt;Haz&lt;/a&gt;. The torturer Booter is the only character that is still found in the hideout at this juncture. In the prison room, the turncoat thief &lt;a href=\"Tizzak\"&gt;Tizzak&lt;/a&gt; is found and he will provide the party with some valuable intel on how to access Linvail's now locked bedroom lair. Also, several spawn points located throughout the hideout will spawn mostly &lt;a href=\"orcs\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; and possibly more shadow thieves.\nMod Content.\nMods:.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Alternatives\"&gt;Alternatives&lt;/a&gt; Mod allows a different path to Brynnlaw and rescuing Imoen. Perhaps you don't want to side with the Shadow Thieves or Bodhi. This Mod allows you an alternative. If you take the \"alternative\" and agree to destroy the Shadow Thieves Guild in Athkatla, you will face similar enemies, traps and conflict as if you had sided with Bodhi.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes some changes to the Hideout, loot, and characters found within.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises the thieves, orcs, mages and guardians within. All weapon wielding humanoids have appropriate weapon proficiencies to match class and levels. All creatures get default SCS smarter AI scripts for more intelligent response and tactical combat decision making behavior. Much backstabbing will occur, so be prepared for that. Haz the mage has the \"Smarter Mages\" script and will have triggered spell casts and contingency buffs. Aran Linvail is upgraded as well. There may also be guardian &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; creatures in some areas based on the PC's accrued XP level."}

{"id": "5804", "revid": "31124876", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5804", "title": "Archaeological Site", "text": "The Archaeological Site, also known as the Area South of Lighthouse, is where Captain Brage, and Charleston Nib's archaeological site are found.\nArchaeology site.\nThough not technically a &lt;a href=\"Quests\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;, as it lacks appropriate entry in &lt;a href=\"Journal\"&gt;Journal&lt;/a&gt;, the events at the archaeology site function much like one. They begin when &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and party speak to &lt;a href=\"Charleston%20Nib\"&gt;Charleston Nib&lt;/a&gt;. After asking about your business there, Charleston asks you to assist him in protecting the site. You can push him into paying for your services with dialogue options 1, 1, 2, 3, 1.\nGallor's scheme.\nWhen he has gone, &lt;a href=\"Gallor\"&gt;Gallor&lt;/a&gt; will approach you and suggest an alternative use of your skills. He wants you to kill Charleston and his workmen so he can sell the artifacts from the excavation site. If you prefer his proposal, you should ensure you ask for a reward before agreeing. He will offer (dialogue options 2, 3, 3, 3). Alternatively, you can refuse Gallor outright.\nThe tomb.\nWhichever moral path you choose, you must talk to Charleston again outside the tomb for events to progress. You will be taken inside the tomb and, shortly after, the workers will go mad and attack. There is no other course but to kill them. Once they are dead, speak to Charleston again. You can raid the sarcophagus for the &lt;a href=\"Idol\"&gt;Idol&lt;/a&gt; of Kozah. If you're playing the original Baldur's Gate, you must do this \"after\" talking to Charleston or he'll take the idol from you. In the Enhanced Edition, however, he won't.\nOutcomes.\nHelp Charleston.\nIf you are helping Charleston, you can leave after the workers are dead and you have spoken with him again. Helping Charleston yields a reward of +1 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt;, and depending on your dialogue choices. Gallor can be talked to afterwards, causing him to leave or safely killed for 120 XP and minor loot.\nHelp Gallor.\nIf you are working for Gallor, kill Charleston. This will cause a serious Reputation decrease, unless you charm him in order for diggers (or your summoned creatures) to do the dirty work. When you leave the tomb with the idol, a &lt;a href=\"Doomsayer\"&gt;Doomsayer&lt;/a&gt; will try to approach you. If you are quick enough to give idol to Gallor (you can also drop the idol on ground temporarily), you will get a reward of and -2 reputation. Otherwise, Gallor and the Doomslayer will turn hostile. Defensive spells and summoned creatures can help repel their attack. Killing the Doomsayer will also get you 4000 XP.\nHelp yourself.\nIf you have no interest in either helping Gallor or Charleston, you can take the Idol of Kozah to the &lt;a href=\"ghost%20of%20Ulcaster\"&gt;ghost of Ulcaster&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ulcaster\"&gt;Ulcaster Ruins&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Armor\"&gt;ancient armor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Firewine%20Ruins\"&gt;Firewine Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. This will earn you the dubious reward of the cursed sword &lt;a href=\"The%20Vampire%27s%20Revenge\"&gt;The Vampire's Revenge&lt;/a&gt;. Also note that it is possible to agree to help Gallor but not kill Charleston. In that case, if you have the idol when exiting the tomb, Gallor will turn hostile and attack.\nCaptain Brage.\nCaptain &lt;a href=\"Brage\"&gt;Brage&lt;/a&gt; is in the central-southeastern part of the map, very near to the archaeological site and a caravan of slain innocents. He is the target of the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Tale%20of%20Captain%20Brage\"&gt;The Tale of Captain Brage&lt;/a&gt;, called 'Recovering Captain Brage' in classic &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Brage is in possession of the &lt;a href=\"Two-handed%20Sword%2C%20Cursed%20Berserking%20%2B3\"&gt;Cursed Sword of Berserking +3&lt;/a&gt;, which caused him to murder many people, including his own family. If you answer his riddle correctly, he will surrender and give you the sword. You can also choose to kill him and take his sword. The body can be brought to &lt;a href=\"Oublek\"&gt;Oublek&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nashkel\"&gt;Nashkel&lt;/a&gt; for a bounty.\nBa'ruk.\n&lt;a href=\"Ba%27ruk\"&gt;Ba'ruk&lt;/a&gt; is a hobgoblin wandering the area. Ba'ruk will greet the party and demand that they leave 'his' land. Whatever you say, he will attack with some &lt;a href=\"Kobold%20Commando\"&gt;kobold commandos&lt;/a&gt;. Killing Ba'ruk gives you 165 XP, a &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword\"&gt;Bastard Sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Composite%20Long%20Bow\"&gt;Composite Long Bow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt; x20, &lt;a href=\"Helmet\"&gt;Helmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor\"&gt;Leather Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"random%20treasure\"&gt;random treasure&lt;/a&gt;, as well as loot from kobold commandos, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Arrows of Fire&lt;/a&gt; if you can kill them quick enough (it is possible for them to instantly switch to their melee weapon if you manage to get to their spawn location before the dialogue begins).\nTransitions.\nOn the original &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;World Map&lt;/a&gt;, these travel times are entirely believable, but on the revised map for the \"\" it appears to be quite impossible that travel to the Red Canyons area could be faster than to the Fisherman's Lake area."}
{"id": "11182", "revid": "271003", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11182", "title": "Archer", "text": "Archer is a &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt; kit. Archers have full access to all five proficiency levels of any bow type, but can only have one proficiency point in any melee weapon. This includes weapons such as &lt;a href=\"dagger\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;s which can be used as ranged or melee weapons. Archers can have two proficiency points in other ranged weapons like &lt;a href=\"sling\"&gt;sling&lt;/a&gt;s. Unlike other &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s they are limited to &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Leather%20Armor\"&gt;studded leather&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hide%20Armor\"&gt;hide armor&lt;/a&gt; and have no &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Animal\"&gt;Charm Animal&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; can become archers. Archers have three prime requisites: &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wisdom\"&gt;Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;. They can dual-class with &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s, though such combination has fewer benefits than the vanilla &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Ranger\"&gt;Cleric / Ranger&lt;/a&gt;. A Cleric/Archer is restricted to slings as a ranged weapon and thus loses some of the benefits of the Archer kit.\nIn the non-Enhanced version of \"Baldur's Gate II\", archers could not dual-class with Throne of Bhaal installed.\nIf the player character is an archer and commits a murder, for example, they will become a Fallen Ranger, which is a ranger without the special abilities - effectively a &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt; without the benefits of grandmastery and slower levelling. Only in and at the end of &lt;a href=\"Ranger-Protector%20of%20the%20Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Ranger-Protector of the Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt;, they can become normal archers once more.\nCharacter abilities table.\nNotes:\nSpecial abilities of the archer.\nStealth.\nRangers can hide in shadows if they wear leather armor, studded leather armor or no armor. Every ranger starts with 15% in both move silently and hide in shadows, modified by racial and dexterity bonuses at level 1 to successfully hides in shadows. Attempting to hide in shadows during the day or while not in shadows incurs a penalty to the hide check. Melee attacks receive a +4 to-hit bonus if performed while hidden.\nRanged Bonuses.\nArchers receive a 1 point increase to hit and damage with any missile weapon for every 3 experience levels they obtain up to and including level 18. This slows down to once every 5 levels thereafter, reaching a +9 to-hit and damage at level 33. This bonus applies to all missile weapons, including thrown weapons and missile weapons from polymorphs such as the ranged attack of a &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20Jelly\"&gt;Mustard Jelly&lt;/a&gt;.\nCalled Shot.\nGains one use at level 4 and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter. All successful ranged attacks made by the Archer within the next 10 seconds acquire the following effects besides normal damage:\n\"Note: As an \"innate spell\", &lt;a href=\"Multi-class\"&gt;multi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dual-class\"&gt;dual&lt;/a&gt;-classed characters \"cast\" Called Shot at the average of their class levels, rounded up.\"\nThere is no save against these effects and they ignore magic resistance. They are also cumulative, i. e., hitting an enemy several times while this ability is active applies its effects multiple times.\nRacial enemy.\nArchers tend to focus on a particular racial creature, having a +4 to hit attack bonus roll versus the racial enemy. Some of these are not available in original Baldur's Gate or Tales of the Sword Coast and were added when Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal were released. Several low-level groups are only available in the first Baldur's Gate games. When importing a character from BG1 into BG2, you can choose a new racial enemy when you start a new game. The player chooses one of the types of creatures listed below:\n1 Not available in Baldur's Gate 1 (EE).\nPriest Spellbook.\nAt level 8, the priest spellbook unlocks for archers. They can use the following spells from that moment. The spells the archers are able to use are the same as &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. They can learn up to level 3 spells. Their number of spells is determined by their level and is not affected by Wisdom.\nRelated items.\nItem better for Archers:\n&lt;a href=\"Archer%27s%20Eyes\"&gt;Archer's Eyes&lt;/a&gt; \nAchievements.\nIncreasing the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;proficiency&lt;/a&gt; with any ranged &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; to five points, becoming a \"Grand Master\", will unlock an &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; in the \"\"."}

It can be damaged, but never die.

Only a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt; will temporarily halt the effect.

Arkanis will shout an oath:\nit is possible to attack the Shadow Thieves leading to other comments from Arkanis. Depending on if you have already helped &lt;a href=\"Renal%20Bloodscalp\"&gt;Renal Bloodscalp&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Mae%27Var\"&gt;Mae'Var&lt;/a&gt; or have sided with the Shadow thieves or Bodhi already there may be some other dialogue. Arkanis is nearly identical to the ARKINSG InfoBox, except he's equipped with the &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt;, so can't be killed and he'll escape if attacked.

For example, leather armor has a base AC of 8 and studded leather has a base AC of 7 (lower numbers are better).\u00a0\u00a0\nDepending on the materials used to construct a type of armor (or how those materials are assembled)\u00a0the\u00a0degree of protection offered for certain types of physical damage may be better or worse than the base armor class. For example, on balance leather armor is easier to pierce than to slash or crush and chain mail is much harder to slash than it is to pierce or crush.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the game, you'll see variations in physical-damage protection reflected in two ways.\u00a0The armor's description will report the base armor class and include any exceptions in parenthesis after it. For example, the description of leather armor shows:\n Armor Class: 8 (10 vs. piercing and missile)\nThe inventory screen and character record\u00a0will report an overall AC of 8 and document the variations in the \"Armor Class Modifiers\" section:\n Armor Class Modifiers \n Missile: +2\n Piercing: +2\nNote that a character's overall AC and damage type modifiers can\u00a0also be affected by other gear the character is wearing.\u00a0 See the main &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; article for more details. Important: Armor class only lowers the chance for the enemy to hit. If a hit does connect, high AC does not lower the damage that is suffered. This would only be done by &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;damage reduction&lt;/a&gt;, which is a percentile value and only given by very few special armor, items and abilities.\nThe table below shows the AC values for each category of armor across all the physical damage types.\u00a0 By comparing the Base column to the individual damage columns, you can see what modifiers will be reported for the armor.\u00a0 For example, Leather armor shows a base of 8, which means it will report a +2 modifier for piercing and missles. Robes have been omitted from the table since they offer no base protection from physical damage.\nIf a piece of armor has a +1 enchantment, it means the AC values listed in the table are reduced by 1. For example, basic plate mail offers an AC of 3 (0 vs. slashing), and Plate Mail +1 offers an AC of 2 (-1 vs. slashing). When dealing with unique pieces of armor, the overall AC value will still adhere to this rule, but there may be variations in the bonuses. For example, &lt;a href=\"Delver%27s%20Plate\"&gt;Delver's Plate&lt;/a&gt; +2 retains the typical plate mail damage profile, offering an AC of 1 (-2 vs. slashing). &lt;a href=\"Gorgon%20Plate\"&gt;Gorgon Plate&lt;/a&gt; +4, however, has the expected AC of -1, but its slashing protection is -7 instead of -4.\nUsage Restrictions.\nEach class has different needs and preferences when it comes to the types of armor its members wear.\u00a0 Thieves for example, require\u00a0armor that is quiet and flexible as it facilitates their stealth abilities.\u00a0As members of the Priest class group, Druids could possibly wear metal armors but their ethos forbids it.\u00a0\nA class kit may impose additional restrictions on what armor can be worn, but it is never more permissive.\u00a0For example, like all Druids, Avengers cannot wear metal armor, but they take the restrictions much further and only permit the use of leather armor.\nThe following table summarizes which classes (by kit) can use which armors.\u00a0The Armor Group column\u00a0shows the highest category of armor a group can wear. For example, kitted rangers and shaman can wear leather, studded leather or hide armor so their group is called \"Hide\".\u00a0 The group (for Druids) includes all armors up through to Hide, but only and &lt;a href=\"Ankheg%20Plate%20Mail\"&gt;Ankheg Plate Mail&lt;/a&gt; from the higher categories.\u00a0 If a kit is not listed, it inherits its parent class's armor group.\nA class may permit its members to wear armor of a particular category, but that doesn't mean they can wear all pieces of armor in that category.\u00a0This can happen for a few reasons:\nFurthermore, the following restrictions apply while wearing armor, even when the character can wear it:\nHigh-level &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thieves&lt;/a&gt; (including multiclasses, and dual classes if their Thief class reaches 3 million XP) can learn to &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;use any item&lt;/a&gt; and override their class restrictions as well as alignment and &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; restrictions. This does however not override the minimum required strength scores, nor the limits on spellcasting and thief skills.\nArmor can not be changed during combat, this is disabled in the inventory screen.\nList of All Armors.\nThe following table lists all the armors available to the party.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.gibberlings3.net/mods/items/fullplate/\"&gt;Full Plate &amp; Packing Steel&lt;/a&gt; mod can make several changes to how armor works in the BG Games. The biggest change will be the ability of armor to provide variable &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance to blows, depending on the armor type.

{"id": "9894", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9894", "title": "Armor Class", "text": "A creature's Armor Class, or AC, represents its ability to dodge, block or parry physical blows without getting hurt. It stands opposite to an attacker's &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;, which describes the accuracy of a creature's physical attacks.\nLike THAC0, the lower the AC is, the better.\nTo-hit formula.\nAn attacker is able to perform up to 10 &lt;a href=\"attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;. For each attack, they roll a 20-sided die whose result will support their THAC0 in trying to overcome the defender's Armor Class, so that they can land a blow. However, regardless of AC and THAC0, rolling a 1 always translates to a miss, and rolling a 20 always translates to a &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;. A roll that is neither a critical hit or miss will result in a miss if AC is good enough \u2014 low enough \u2014 to validate this inequality:\n Armor Class &lt; THAC0 - Attack roll\nIn other words, if the value of the die is not big enough to make the THAC0 fall as low as or lower than AC, the attack roll has failed and the defender wins the pass.\nThe four types of AC.\nAs far as game mechanics go, there are four types of &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt; and four types of AC to match: AC vs Slashing, vs Piercing, vs Crushing, and vs Missile damage. When an attacker is attempting to strike with a weapon, its physical damage type will determine which AC will need to be overcome. The other 3 will be ignored.\nWhen it comes to game interfaces, this reality is not advertised as straightforwardly, preferring to talk about an AC value and then about a type modifier. This often leads players to misestimate the value of armors with a large modifier.\nBreakdown of the AC value.\nEach AC type is made of three parts later called General AC, Type-exclusive AC and Situational AC.\nGeneral AC.\nAdvertised prominently in game interfaces and descriptions, this intermediate value contributes to all 4 types of AC. It is the sum of the following:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;s, General AC is displayed in the shield-shaped icon of the \"Inventory\" screen and in the \"Record\" screen's \"Combat stats\" tab as . In &lt;a href=\"original%20edition\"&gt;original edition&lt;/a&gt;s, the shield-shaped icon is present in both the \"Inventory\" and the \"Record\" screen, which does not have tabs.\nType-exclusive AC.\nOften advertised timidly in-game, this is the second component used in the calculation of each type of AC. As the name suggests, Type-exclusive AC contributes to only one type \u2013 so there's actually Slashing-only AC, Piercing-only AC and so on. \nSlashing-only AC, to take it as an example, is the sum of the following:\nIn Enhanced Editions, one needs to scroll down in the top-right textbox of the \"Inventory\" screen to find Type-exclusive AC. It is also present in the \"Record\" screen's \"Combat stats\" tab as . In the original editions, the values are only listed in the \"Record\" screen and found by scrolling two-thirds down.\nSituational AC.\nLike General AC modifiers, Situational AC contributes to all 4 types of AC. But it is comprised of modifiers that only affect the to-hit roll when the attacker meets a particular criterion, and stay dormant and ignored the rest of the time. The \"Inventory\" and \"Record\" screens make no mention of this component of Armor Class.\nSituational AC is the sum of the following:\nMaximum AC by type.\nIn theory, the best AC is -48 for each type, except for AC vs Missiles where it's -50. Situational AC can boost these maxima down to respectively -54 and -56 if the attacker meets the right conditions.\nIn practical terms though, a defender's AC only needs to be 20 points below their attacker's THAC0 to ensure that only &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;s will ever connect. Keep in mind it's also possible to inflict penalties to an opponent's THAC0 with for example &lt;a href=\"THAC0%23THAC0-degrading_spells\"&gt;these spells&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 this is equivalent to a bonus to defender AC.\nAC formula.\nEach of the four types of AC is calculated like so:\n Final AC vs type =\n CAP( Base AC + General AC modifiers ) IN [-20, 20]\n \u00a0 + &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%23Scores%20table\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; modifier\n + &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency%23Effects\"&gt;Single-Weapon style&lt;/a&gt; bonus\n + &lt;a href=\"Blinded\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt; penalty in &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;EE&lt;/a&gt;\n + CAP( &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Type-exclusive&lt;/a&gt; AC modifiers ) IN [-20, 20]\n + &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency%23Effects\"&gt;Sword &amp; Shield style&lt;/a&gt; bonus\n + &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; bonus\n + Protection vs. creature type bonus\n + Unarmed or ranged weapon penalty vs. melee attacks\nLegend.\nEach element from the AC formula is described below. The game interface will display most of them in both the \"Inventory\" screen's top-right corner and the \"Record\" screen's \"Combat Stats\" tab. The \u201cAppears as\u201d cells in the table below describe how the game interface names the various elements.\nRundown of a large Armor Class.\ncodice_4 could be further improved against all Slashing attacks coming from &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;Evil-aligned&lt;/a&gt; creatures that cannot see the invisible: Should the Fighter / Thief use Improved Invisibility from the &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Cloak%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Improved Cloak of Protection&lt;/a&gt; and double down with &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil\"&gt;Protection From Evil&lt;/a&gt;, they would have the equivalent of an AC of -43.\nAC Bonuses.\nSpells.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Magic\"&gt;Arcane Magic&lt;/a&gt;:\nDivine:\nThere are approaches other than Armor Class to be protected against physical attacks: &lt;a href=\"Reflected%20Image\"&gt;Reflected Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; will absorb one/some hits, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Skins\"&gt;Iron Skins&lt;/a&gt; will absorb only the physical damage of some hits, mantles will make you immune to non magical weapons (&lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Normal Weapons&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Aura%20of%20Flaming%20Death\"&gt;Aura of Flaming Death&lt;/a&gt;) magical weapons (&lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;); weapons with an enchantment level inferior to 3 (&lt;a href=\"Mantle\"&gt;Mantle&lt;/a&gt;); 4 (&lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;); 6 (&lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Immunity\"&gt;Absolute Immunity&lt;/a&gt;).\nThere is also damage resistance approach (&lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, Damage Resistance).\nSome effects affecting the defender will essentially disable their AC, allowing the attacker to hit without an attack roll: &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Held\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sleep%20%28Status%20Effect%29\"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;, ...

They are numerous and haven't been listed.\nThe following equipment offers AC bonuses that can improve a creature's base AC. Items marked as restricted cannot be worn together or with most magical armors. See the section &lt;a href=\"%23Item%20restrictions\"&gt;Item restrictions&lt;/a&gt; for more details.\nItem restrictions.\nIdeally, we want to stack AC bonuses from as many items as possible, but in reality many of the items may not be worn together.\u00a0 Based on ITEMEXCL.2da, you cannot combine any of the items from the following sections.\nBGWiki writing formats.\nDue to inconsistency in how AC changes are described in-game, BGW will unify the format by writing \"-n bonus\" and \"+n penalty\" for modifiers and list the exact subdivided AC values (vs. slashing, crushing, piercing and missile) instead of their modifiers.\nMod content.\nWith &lt;a href=\"the%20Tweaks%20Anthology\"&gt;the Tweaks Anthology&lt;/a&gt; mod, the restrictions on protection items could be relaxed. An option is to allow the use of magical armor with one protection item.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod contains many spells that penalize an opponent's armor class rating. In addition, there are several boosts to armor class or specific damage type armor class bonus inducing spells provided with that mod installed, for arcane and divine casters, above and beyond the standard game's spell system.\nPerhaps the greatest armor class boosting spell, from any modification so far, can be realized as the replacement spell for &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, known as \"Moment of Prescience\".

Assassin poison helps cripple enemy casters as the poison tick will often cause them to lose concentration on their spells. The extra hit, damage, and enormous backstab multiplier allow you to inflict more damage per single hit than just about anything else in the entire game. However, the backstab multiplier bonus takes a long time to achieve and starting assassins will not have many points to distribute into your thieving abilities.

The race of the thief determines how many points are gained as a bonus. Halflings have the best best overall bonus to thieving ability points.\n&lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; determines how many points are added to each skill during the game as well.\nFind/disarm traps.\nA thief can find traps if they activate their find traps mode. Any found traps can then be disarmed if the find/disarm trap percentage is high enough.\nHide in Shadow/stealth.\nAll &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s and thieves can hide in shadows if they wear studded leather armor or lesser armor. A thief who is hidden in shadow can attempt to perform a backstab, which does increased damage. The modifier increases with the level of thief. The chance to hide successfully in the shadow depends on the time, at night this is much easier to than at daylight, whether the thief is standing in a shadow or not and the chance in percentage to hide in shadow from the character self.\nPick locks.\nA thief can lockpick locks from doors and containers to open them. The chance to open a door/container depends on the percentage of the character.\nPick pockets.\nA thief can steal items from characters. The chance to steal an item depends on the percentage.\nBackstabbing.\nWhen thieves are invisible, a thief can try to execute a backstab upon an enemy, which inflicts more damage than a normal hit, but it makes the thief visible once again.\nStronghold.\nIn , thieves can gain a stronghold during &lt;a href=\"Find%20Proof%20of%20Mae%27Var%27s%20Treachery\"&gt;Find Proof of Mae'Var's Treachery&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a number of gameplay revisions and changes to all Rogues, including their kits. It is a comprehensive modification to nearly all aspects of the Rogues (Bards and Thieves) abilities and strives to bring them closer to their Pen and Paper AD&amp;D counterparts. New and revised abilities are included, as well as new equipment and rogue specific items. Separate user installed components are available to customize selection of content and changes. Go to the link for further information.\nThe Mod addresses Assassin in many different aspects, including:\nAssassin\nThrough this revision, Assassins can no longer be good aligned, their bonus to hit and damage has been replaced with Poison Expertise, the Poison Weapon ability has been altered in order to properly scale with levels and a new Death Attack ability has been added at higher levels. The updated kit description reads as follows:\nASSASSIN: This is a killer specialized in discreet and efficient murder, relying on anonymity and surprise to perform his task. Training in anatomy, stealth and poison use allows an Assassin to carry out missions of death with terrifying precision. A clever Assassin might never be seen by his victim.\nAdvantages:\n- May use Poison Weapon once per day at 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter\n- Acquires Poison Expertise at 8th level. This ability improves further every 8 levels thereafter\n- May use Death Attack once per day at 16th level and every 8 levels thereafter\n- Backstab reaches x7 instead of x5\nDisadvantages:\n- Only 15% per level to distribute on abilities\n- Must be of evil or neutral alignment\nPoison Weapon:\nDue to the requirements of his profession, an Assassin becomes adapt at coating his weapons in poison early during his career. Any weapon prepared in this manner will deal an extra 1d3 points of poison damage upon contact. Furthermore, unless a saving throw vs. poison is made, the poison will be injected into the bloodstream of the victim dealing one additional point of damage per each level of the Assassin (up to a maximum of 20). The poison coating evaporates after 5 rounds. Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures cannot be poisoned.\nPoison Expertise:\nThrough training and experience, an Assassin gradually learns to utilize poison more effectively. Furthermore, due to the constant exposure to poison an Assassin slowly becomes desensitized towards it. Each time this ability is acquired, the Assassin gains a permanent +1 bonus to his saving throws vs. poison. At the same time, the saving throw difficulty class of his Poison Weapon ability improves by 1.\nDeath Attack:\nBy thoroughly studying the weak spots of his victim, an Assassin can focus all of his cunning and prowess into a single, deadly strike. The next attack he makes automatically becomes a critical hit and his victim must make a saving throw vs. death or die instantly. As the Assassin gains more experience, the lethality of the Death Attack increases. The victim saves with a -1 penalty at level 24, a -2 penalty at level 32 and a -3 penalty at level 40. Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures cannot be slain by a Death Attack."}

Weapon proficiencies are changed to 1 pip in short sword and one pip in single-weapon fighting style.\nA revised default AI script is assigned for better tactical behavior and potion use.\nThree potions are scripted for use to heal or boost abilities, and to reapply invisibility.\nThe creature begins already invisible and will attack and perform a &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; from that state.

It is the first and only district that &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Party\"&gt;Party&lt;/a&gt; can travel to after exploring &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%201\"&gt;Chapter I&lt;/a&gt; of the game.\nChapter II.\nImmediately after entering the Slums for the first time, Gorion's Ward encounters Gaelan Bayle. This encounter is unavoidable. Gaelan claims to knows how to rescue &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;, and will take the party to his home to propose a deal (for detail, see the page for &lt;a href=\"Gaelan%20Bayle\"&gt;Gaelan Bayle&lt;/a&gt;). After the deal is struck, a cut-scene plays, initiating &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%202\"&gt;Chapter II&lt;/a&gt; of the game. In short, Gaelan's deal involves raising a large fee for the information to rescue Imoen, so he provides a few suggestions to get started. His nephew &lt;a href=\"Brus\"&gt;Brus&lt;/a&gt; then leads the party to the Copper Coronet, a nexus for those in need of the Ward's skills.\nSlaver guards.\nDirectly outside of the Copper Coronet at night is a lone &lt;a href=\"Slaver%20Guard\"&gt;Slaver Guard&lt;/a&gt;, who has very little to say, making one wonder why he is there. If you ask what he is doing or guarding he'll say \"This? It's an inn. Copper Coronet. Go in an' ask fer yerself\". He is a precursor for what is to come later. If you don't like his tone, or are just feeling frisky, you can put this scum down, with no repercussions. Later on, at a certain point there will be a late-night encounter (hour 22 until dawn). More Slaver Guards are seen dragging a prisoner-slave through the streets. If the party intervenes and frees the slave by killing the leading and trailing guards, they are awarded with . For more detail, see the page for &lt;a href=\"Slaver%20Guard\"&gt;Slaver Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrade.\nEven if it seems that the Slums, being on the seedier side of town, would have a fence or three, there are none. Three of the five slums merchants hint at \"selling\" \"acquired\" goods, but they do not \"buy\" them. These include the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Market%20Thief%20%28Athkatla%20Slums%29\"&gt;Black Market Thief&lt;/a&gt; above the tavern, the &lt;a href=\"Storekeep%20%28Athkatla%20Slums%29\"&gt;Storekeep&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arledrian\"&gt;Arledrian&lt;/a&gt;, on the 2nd floor of &lt;a href=\"Gaelan%20Bayle%27s%20Home\"&gt;Gaelan Bayle's home&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the tavern, both &lt;a href=\"Bernard\"&gt;Bernard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joluv\"&gt;Joluv&lt;/a&gt; do legitimate business and have many useful items for sale. However, to fence, the party needs either go back to &lt;a href=\"Jayes\"&gt;Jayes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt;, or forward to the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20District\"&gt;Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Docks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Temple Sewers&lt;/a&gt; to find alternatives.\nCopper Coronet.\nMost of the slums is dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt;, a large tavern in the center of the district. Here, the party may buy, sell, rest, and recruit up to three more Potential Companions: &lt;a href=\"Anomen%20Delryn\"&gt;Anomen Delryn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korgan%20Bloodaxe\"&gt;Korgan Bloodaxe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nalia%20de%27Arnise\"&gt;Nalia de'Arnise&lt;/a&gt;.\nAsk around for work to accept a number of &lt;a href=\"Side%20quest\"&gt;side&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Companions\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; quests to raise funds (see &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Slums%23Related%20Quests\"&gt;Related Quests&lt;/a&gt; below). The tavern is also a great launch point for taking on the &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quests\"&gt;quest(s)&lt;/a&gt; most appropriate to Gorion's Ward class(es). \nOn the roof of the tavern is a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ilmater%20%28Slums%20District%29\"&gt;Temple of Imater&lt;/a&gt; for restorative cures that are more demanding than simple rest can provide.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod changes the for-sale inventory slightly, adding mod-only items, and also converts them into \"fences\", allowing the sale of stolen goods.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Ooze%27s%20Lounge\"&gt;Ooze's Lounge&lt;/a&gt; mod allows passage through the sewer grate in the slums to a new area with quests, a strange temple and new merchants. A key is needed to open it.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Quest Pack&lt;/a&gt; mod adds content to the slums regarding a Money lender in the Copper Coronet and a woman named \"Moiya\" in the slums.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Crawl\"&gt;Dungeon Crawl&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a necessary questline encounter with the \"Shadow Pack\" which occurs after sundown in the slums. This encounter is needed to advance the story.\nThe \"Rieng's Keyring\" mod takes place in the slums. You can get a \"keyring\" which is a container for keys (like a scroll case or gem bag).

Or go to the wiki gateway page &lt;a href=\"A%20Mod%20for%20the%20Orderly\"&gt;A Mod for the Orderly&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Assassination\"&gt;Assassination&lt;/a&gt; mod has two separate encounters/hit jobs initiated or finished in the slums.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alternatives\"&gt;Alternatives&lt;/a&gt; mod will have the party approached by a brightly garbed nobleman named \"Malficus\", who offers a passage to an exotic foreign land and a method to take care of Imoen's captivity by the Cowled Wizard's.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod adds various improved and or \"smarter\" AI scripts to various creatures encountered, from dogs, muggers, and all manner of conflicts."}

APR bonuses are multiples of 1/2. A 1st level warrior (1 APR) wielding a single long sword with which he is specialized (+1/2 APR or 0.5) will have 1.5 attacks per round. The game will display this as 3/2, meaning 3 attacks over 2 rounds.\nClass.\nMost class groups get a single attack per round. &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Class%20group\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt; (Fighters, Paladins, Rangers) and &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s get an extra +1/2 attack at levels 7 and 13. Warriors may get additional bonuses based on their level of &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;proficiency&lt;/a&gt; with their main-hand weapon (see following table). Monks also gain +1/2 APR at levels 4, 10, 16 and 19 when fighting unarmed, maxing at 4 apr at level 19.\nWhile some non-warrior classes can also advance to specialized or higher (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Swashbuckler\"&gt;Swashbuckler&lt;/a&gt;), they do not gain more APR from this, only THACO and damage bonuses.\n \"Note: No known method makes it possible for player characters to achieve grand mastery in the original BG1 even with , but enemies do benefit from it.\"\n \"Note: A dual-classed &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Druid%23As_a_Dual-Class\"&gt;Fighter-Druid&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Thief%23As_a_Dual-Class\"&gt;Fighter-Thief&lt;/a&gt; can achieve grand mastery within the 161,000 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; cap of , but the 5th proficiency point can only be added once one class levels up to at least 9.\nEffects.\nSeveral effects can increase a character's APR:\nWeapons.\nWeapons all have a Base APR assigned to them, and almost all melee weaponry like spears, swords or flails have a base APR of 1. The base APR is the lowest, or bottom value of the weapon's APR. That value can be modified by weapon proficiency skills or other effects, such as certain spells, innate abilities or worn items. Dedicated missile weaponry like darts or bows typically have a higher base APR value assigned (exception would be crossbows).\nThe following ranged weapon types\u00a0set the base APR of the weapon to 2 or 3:\nThe magical weapons listed below add an additional attack per round to the wielder in melee. All those weapons are edged, so &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Cleric\"&gt;Fighter / Cleric&lt;/a&gt; have no way of increasing their APR via weapons. Kundane, Belm and Ninjat\u014d of the Scarlet Brotherhood can be equipped in either hand, but only the main hand gets the extra APR (so if dual-wielding, a more powerful weapon may be held in the main hand).\u00a0The throwing daggers used in melee, however, can only be equipped in the main hand, but allow wielding another melee weapon in the off-hand. Weapon proficiency\u00a0modifiers still apply. Two of those weapons can be dual-wielded at the same time, for overall 4 base APR. \nThe weapons created by spells or abilities listed below set APR to a certain value, which can then be increased by effects such as &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; but are unaffected by weapon proficiency skills.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20Extraordinary%20Specialization\"&gt;Gauntlets of Extraordinary Specialization&lt;/a&gt; provide a bonus +\"\u00bd\" (0.5) APR.\nIn only, the following sources grant &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Weak Haste&lt;/a&gt;:\nDual Wielding.\nWielding an offhand weapon adds an additional attack per round with that weapon. All other attacks will be by the main hand.\nShapeshifting.\nWhen shifting form into another creature, the new one will override base APR. Those are cumulative with the bonuses from Warrior levels and haste effects, but override equipped weapons. Examples:\nAPR penalties.\nCertain debuffs can also lower attacks per round:\nCleave Mechanic/Bug.\nThe game possesses a hidden \"cleave\" mechanic (or &lt;a href=\"Exploits%23Extra%20Attacks%20Per%20Round%20.28breaking%20the%2010%20APR%20barrier.29\"&gt;maybe it's a bug&lt;/a&gt;) that allows a character to perform more attacks per round than they're supposed to by (seemingly) granting an extra attack per enemy killed if another enemy is nearby.\nThere seems to be some kind of limit/additional requirements for this to happen, but it potentially allows a character to attack significantly more in a single round than normal, as evidenced by this test footage of a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//streamable.com/n0jtxy\"&gt;Kensai with only 2 APR being able to do 6 critical strikes against 6 werewolves with a single cast of the ability (which lasts exactly 1 round)&lt;/a&gt;."}

During the pause in time, three to five spells with area of effect spread will be launched, so it might affect multiple creatures/party members. \nDuring the Time Stop he will also strike with the enchanted staff.\nThe creature may heal itself completely when its Hit Points are below 30% of original value, but it can only do this once.\nFor a breakdown of the conditions and general triggers used in the mage's AI, see the InfoBox.\nWhen the creature is killed, the corpse disappears from the map, leaving behind only the &lt;a href=\"Club%20of%20Detonation\"&gt;Club of Detonation&lt;/a&gt;, which it never uses in combat.\nBugs.\nThe Aurumach's regeneration ability timing mode is set as permanent, but that setting requires a duration to work, and it has no duration, and therefore it doesn't operate correctly. This is an issue throughout the game in several other creatures as well. This issue is included in &lt;a href=\"The%20Enhanced%20Edition%20Fixpack%20%28EEFP%29\"&gt;The Enhanced Edition Fixpack (EEFP)&lt;/a&gt; and is already identified to Beamdog for possible fixing in the future.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod provides this creature with a revised \"smarter\" AI script - capable of recognizing party member protections and vulnerabilities for better tactical behavior.\nThe experience and caster level are raised to 25/25/25.\nSCS retains all the immunities listed in the InfoBox, and adds a few more abilities to Aurumach, including:&lt;br&gt;\n- Immunity to &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\n- \"Teleport without error\" ability (instantly jump to another point on the map).\nSCS changes use of &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Fear%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Fear (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; and adds &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Stun%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Stun (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, and with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod adds &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/SpellRevisions/spells/arcane/level-8/symbol-of-weakness\"&gt;Symbol of Weakness&lt;/a&gt;.\nSCS adds use of an innate equivalent of &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; to strip protections from enemies as well."}

Azamantes is a powerful Lich and will be accompanied by three &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Skull\"&gt;Flaming Skull&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nGameplay.\nThe lich and three Flaming Skull allies will rise from the floor in various locations around the Final Seal and initiate hostile actions.\nAzamantes is able to innately &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the outset of appearing in the dungeon, as soon as the lich detects an enemy its initial preparatory protective spell chain is released with &lt;a href=\"Lich%20Fear\"&gt;Lich Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor other spell casting and associated conditions that trigger them, see the InfoBox.\nThe lich's spell triggers, sequencers and contingencies are not generally subject to being disrupted by suffering damage; however other spell casting is fair game.\nAzamantes has some unique damage resistances not normally found on the undead, and fire is one of these - this lich is best destroyed through physical and magical energy damage, although, the creature enjoys a very high &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; rating.\nOf particular note about Azamantes is that the lich cannot adjust his spell casting based on the party's protections (it has very minimal recognition scripting), and it also won't try to dispel or take down the party's spells/buffs. This is quite the limitation for such a high-level spell caster.\nThe lich's &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; which occurs early in the battle, is probably the most dangerous risk for an opponent - expect an &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; spell included along with a &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20Swarm\"&gt;Meteor Swarm&lt;/a&gt; and possibly a &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt; all released during the pause in time.\nMod content.\nDepending on the game difficulty selection, the lich will use mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; spell casts including &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Dragon's Breath (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe lich has prepared &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; ready to deploy instantly.\nExpect a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gate\"&gt;Gate&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nAzamantes can attempt to remove party protections (as it can recognize them) with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khelben%27s%20Warding%20Whip\"&gt;Khelben's Warding Whip&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod will change the lich's spell book to the SR versions.
