They have gathered on a large circular platform in &lt;a href=\"Ust%20Natha\"&gt;Ust Natha&lt;/a&gt;. The cultists will be hostile and attempt to slay any who intrude within range of their group. The mage is accompanied by another two drow priestesses.\nAt the outset of battle, the mage will attempt to turn invisible and then haste itself and nearby allies. After that it will look for targets it can observe to strike with &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt; spell casts. If need be, the mage can try and turn invisible again with a spell cast.

The default AI is changed to a \"Smarter Mage\" SCS version, which will allow for evaluating threats and looking for vulnerabilities in opponents, which in turn influences spell casting choice and attack/defense options. An entire new repertoire of available mage spells are included.\nSCS will trigger an opening preparatory self-buff including &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;. It will also recognize if a party member is invisible, under stealth or sanctuary, and then attempt an appropriate divination spell. All other actions are wide open depending on threat assessments by the Mage. As an Enchanter, the spell choices are weighted towards that School with this AI script set-up. \nSCS has assigned a ready to use &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; loaded up with two spells to fire.\nThe mage now is assigned one pip in quarterstaff proficiency, so it no longer is non-proficient like the unmodded version.

{"id": "6130", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6130", "title": "Remove Magic", "text": "A Remove Magic spell only affects the enemies of the caster.\nThis spell checks effects from different casters individually, meaning that effects received from a high-level caster are less likely to be dispelled than those from a low-level caster.\nThe target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell. The only way to defend against this spell is\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;: Abjuration.\nMechanically, the only difference between a Remove Magic vs. the &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic (priest)&lt;/a&gt;) spells is the projectile launched to apply the spell effects: the projectile from the former only affects non-party creatures, while that from the latter affects all creatures in the area of effect.\nGameplay.\nThe caster designates a point on the area map to which the spell's projectile will be directed to, using the targeting cursor.\nWhen the spell casting is complete a sparkling green projectile travels to the designated point and then instantly applies the &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect to enemy (red-circled) creatures in the area of effect, which is about a 15-feet radius (30' diameter).\nEnemy creatures in the area are exposed to the spell, and any dispellable effects present on each creature will be checked to determine if they are in fact dispelled, according to game's formula.\nWhether or not any effects are actually dispelled is not said or presented to the player by viewing the combat log, as any creature in the area would produce a text string that reads \"Dispel effects\" - sometimes it is visually obvious if the spell worked, for example, observing an active &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Blue%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Blue)&lt;/a&gt; just disappearing.\nDespite the in-game spell description cited above, the minimum odds of success are not 1% but 0%. A mage can never dispel magic whose caster is 5 levels above him. The maximum odds of success, though, are indeed 99%.\nThe target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell. The only way to defend against this spell is\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Abjuration&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Remove Magic is a level 3 Wizard (arcane) spell, the inner workings and coding of the spell are different than most. All the implemented internal effect codes that make the spell work and attempt to do what it says it should do, have an assigned &lt;a href=\"power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt; of 0. This is relevant since it allows the spell to bypass certain protections against magic, such as a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich's&lt;/a&gt; immunity to level 1 through 5 spells, or a &lt;a href=\"Rakshasa\"&gt;Rakshasa's&lt;/a&gt; immunity to level 1 through 7 spells. \nThis is also how a Remove Magic can have a chance to dispel magic even on targets protected by a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, which normally blocks spells and effects of levels 1 through 3.\nSome spells are unaffected by &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effects completely. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the caster level calculation, &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, scrolls and many item abilities use a default caster level of 10 (6 in BG1), making them very easy to dispel later in the game.\nIn addition to the ability to have a chance to remove any dispellable effect on an enemy creature, the Remove magic also will cure &lt;a href=\"Deafness\"&gt;Deafness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feeblemindedness\"&gt;Feeblemindedness&lt;/a&gt; regardless of the source and spell power level of the deafness or feeblemindedness. This occurs because the spell uses internal \"Cure\" effect codes.\nIn cases where a Remove Magic spell is cast from a dual or multi-class mage, the current mage experience level is used to determine the spell casting level. For example, a 4th level Mage dualed to a 7th level Fighter will cast this spell at level 4, not 7. The reason for this, is that the Remove Magic spell is classified as a \"Wizard\" spell. If a Thief with the &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; ability casts this spell from a scroll, the spell will be cast at the default scroll level of 10 for BG2 and BG2EE.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset has no equivalent Wizard spell to \"Remove Magic\". The BG video game spell version is a creation of Bioware. In the Pen and Paper game, only &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; is available for use, and there isn't a way for a caster to just target a group of enemies and not its own party with an area of effect dispelling function. This change by the game developers certainly simplified and allowed better coding outcomes for the AI, so it makes some sense for a workable video game dynamic.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, retitling it. The terminology of the \"Remove Magic\" spell is now \"Dispel Magic\". It otherwise is very similar. Spell Revisions has other ways for the party to get rid of status effects from its own members. Dispel Magic only works against enemies. See below for description:\nDispel Magic\nLevel: 3\nSchool: Abjuration\nRange: Long\nDuration: Instant\nCasting Time: 3\nArea of Effect: 20\u2019 radius\nSaving Throw: Special\nDispel Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.\nThe chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is above the level of the magic he is trying to dispel, his chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic he attempts to dispel, his chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; implements the Dispel Magic Fix: This component fixes the chance to dispel magic to match the spell's description (so there is at least a marginal chance of dispelling effects of a higher-level mage) and corrects conceptual problems caused by the automatic dispelling of all magically created items. If installed, there will always be at at least a 1% chance that dispel magic will work, regardless of the opposing caster level.\nSpell Revisions replaced &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/SpellRevisions/spells/arcane/level-5/dispelling-screen\"&gt;\"Dispelling Screen\"&lt;/a&gt; - this protective magic spell can be applied to self and allies in an area of effect and will shield against one exposure to any Dispel Magic effect or one &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; spell - and then the screen will be consumed."}

Regardless of class, &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; will also say that he needs to see Renal as soon as the party enters the Docks District.\nIf the protagonist speaks with Renal, and agrees to perform a task for him, he will provide a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%20Transfer\"&gt;Letter of Transfer&lt;/a&gt; to help infiltrate and to spy upon &lt;a href=\"Mae%27Var\"&gt;Mae'Var&lt;/a&gt; satellite thieves guild operation. &lt;a href=\"Mae%27Var%27s%20Guildhall\"&gt;Mae'Var's Guildhall&lt;/a&gt; is located east of the Shadow Thieves guildhall.

In the \"\", his own skill of 100 has to be subtracted from that of any , attempting to claim the potions or rings.\nRenal can be killed for his loot without spawning &lt;a href=\"Arkanis%20Gath\"&gt;Arkanis Gath&lt;/a&gt; or even turning any Shadow Thieves hostile by charming him, moving him near the area transition door (use the door, not the stairs!), killing him instantly (for example, with finger of death) and then going outside fast enough. To increase your chances of pulling this off, make sure to stand in the precise spot in the doorway where the area transition happens, so that your character doesn't need to walk.\nRenal can also be killed for his loot without spawning Arkanis or turning any Shadow Thieves hostile by casting feeblemind on him and then killing him. This won't aggravate or affect any other thieves' guild members at all.\nAlso Renal will disappear if you will side with Bodhi while Chapter 3, so if you want to kill Renal for loot you need do this before meeting with Bodhi."}

{"id": "4100", "revid": "31124876", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4100", "title": "Reputation", "text": "Reputation represents the general perception of the party as a force for either good or evil. It affects interaction and outcomes with the NPC's and creatures you meet, how your party members treat you, as well as the price of goods in shops. There are many ways to manipulate reputation in game.\nReputation is expressed as a number ranging from 1 to 20, however, the lowest reputation means you are infamous for being a villain, not that you are not known - that would be a value of 10: people cannot tell if you're good or evil through your (documented) actions. A reputation of 10 either means people have not heard of you or you've been operating very balanced - doing both evil and good deeds.\nIf the party's reputation is very bad, the authorities will assume that it has acted unlawfully, which means that guards and enforcers in large cities will attempt to arrest or execute the party on the spot, even though it is possible to reach such a terrible reputation with a &lt;a href=\"Lawful%20Neutral\"&gt;Lawful Neutral&lt;/a&gt; behavior.\nEffects of reputation.\nCompanions' reaction.\n&lt;a href=\"Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt; react to the party's reputation according to their &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;alignments&lt;/a&gt;, making comments to indicate their mood, and may even leave the party if pushed far enough. During the \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" campaign, if you manually remove them when they're \"Serious\" or if they leave after \"Break\", it means their permanent disappearance; during the ' and ' campaigns, they'll temporarily depart to their usual waiting spots after \"Break\" until they find the party reputation suitable again to join; during ', they won't leave at all, although companions from the ' will break up under usual conditions if you ask them to wait. In evil companions do not permanently disappear upon breaking point due to reputation or if manually removed while being \"Serious\" (though a journal entry will be made, like \"Good Riddance to Bad Rubbish \"). They simply go back to their waiting point and can be recruited back once a suitable reputation is achieved. A good and safe way of lowering reputation for keeping an evil companion is by killing an isolated neutral creature.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCivilians' reaction.\nHighers reaction means better attitude, sometimes it's used in conversations to open more dialogues trees, yielding better quest outcomes, even unlocking new quests when the value is high. &lt;a href=\"Charisma\"&gt;Charisma&lt;/a&gt; also adjusts reaction furthermore.\nIn Shadows of Amn, instead of Flaming Fist soldiers, a group with very low reputation will be attacked by four &lt;a href=\"Amnian%20Legionary\"&gt;Amnian Legionaries&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Amnian%20Centurion\"&gt;Amnian Centurion&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Enforcer\"&gt;Cowled Enforcers&lt;/a&gt;. \nUnlike Flaming Fist soldiers, these authorities can be killed without further reputation loss. You can also use arcane magic in this encounter without being warned / attacked by the Cowled Wizards. \nA beginning or middling experienced party may find this group a challenge. Beware dropping below reputation 4 at that stage of the adventure.\nit is also possible the party will be sought out by an enforcement group of Knights from the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Noble%20Order%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt; when the party's reputation falls to 3 or less.\nThe group can instantly appear after a message display on the combat log reading \"Guards approach. Obviously, word of your misdeeds have reached the authorities.\"\nNote that this group is quite powerful. Should the party best the knights in combat, the last remaining member will vow that this isn't finished, and they'll hunt the party down again. \nThat Radiant Heart member will then quickly disappear off the map. And true to their vow, they'll be looking for the party again on different areas of Athkatla's streets.\nIt might be prudent to donate sufficient coin at a temple and improve reputation - just to get these knights off the party's back.\nShop prices.\nShopkeepers start selling their items at a lower price (markdown) when the party reaches reputation 15, and keep lowering prices at a constant pace until the maximum reputation of 20. Conversely, they sell at a higher price (markup) at reputation 9 and below.\nShopkeepers will alter the reputation multiplier based on the &lt;a href=\"Charisma%23Scores_table\"&gt;Charisma&lt;/a&gt; of the character whose portrait is in the uppermost position (party leader). This modifier will never increase prices - only lower them from 16 Charisma and up.\nOn top of this charisma &amp; reputation markdown (or markup), each shopkeeper has its own &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23S\"&gt;store sell markup&lt;/a&gt;, usually 150% of the initial price displayed in an item's wiki article. In any case they never sell for less than . The full formula is:\nformula_1\nExample: A party with 8 reputation (codice_1 1.2) and 16 charisma (codice_2 -0.05) will receive an extra 15% markup in all shops. Should a specific store sell at 150% of the codice_3 (codice_4 150), the party will pay 1.72 times the codice_3, rounded down. (e.g. 8668 for an item with a codice_3 of 5040)\nWhen it comes to buying items from the party, shopkeepers don't let charisma or reputation affect the price they offer. But they do have their own store buy markdown: They will usually buy at 50% of the initial price in Baldur's Gate I, and 30% in Baldur's Gate II.\nDream abilities.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate I&lt;/a&gt;\", reputation also determines which special abilities &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; can gain though &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;dreams&lt;/a&gt;, with the \"good\" abilities unlocking with reputation of 10 or above, and the \"evil\" abilities with reputation 9 and below. All the special abilities from dream will eventually be replaced by the one and only &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;, and none of the Bhaalspawn abilities can be used in both of \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Pits\"&gt;the Black Pits&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMinimum for paladins and rangers.\nIf the main protagonist is a &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; (except &lt;a href=\"Blackguard\"&gt;Blackguard&lt;/a&gt;) and the party reputation drops below 8, they are permanently stripped of their status and become a \"Fallen Ranger\" or \"Fallen Paladin\", respectively.\nDoing so leads to a permanent loss of all class-related and special abilities. In \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate I&lt;/a&gt;\", there's no way to revert this state, although in \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II&lt;/a&gt;\" the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; may seek and attain redemption by completing their class-specific : &lt;a href=\"Ranger-Protector%20of%20the%20Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Protector of the Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Stronghold%20Duties\"&gt;Paladin Stronghold Duties&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nStarting reputation.\nWhenever you start a game either by &lt;a href=\"Character%20Generation\"&gt;generating&lt;/a&gt; a new character or by &lt;a href=\"Importing%20a%20Character\"&gt;importing&lt;/a&gt; an existing one, your starting reputation will be adjusted by the &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; of the first character you created.\nWays to change reputation.\nActions and deeds.\nReputation is lost whenever the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; commits a crime, ranging from theft to trespassing. For the serious crimes, such as assaulting, murdering and killing &lt;a href=\"innocents\"&gt;innocents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"authorities\"&gt;authorities&lt;/a&gt;, reputation will drop even if they go unwitnessed. How high this loss is will depend on the party's current reputation. \"Injuring &lt;a href=\"innocents\"&gt;innocents&lt;/a&gt;\" in the table below excludes non-lethal attacks without witness. Trying to bribe members of the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist\"&gt;Flaming Fist&lt;/a&gt; incurs a -1 penalty.\nReputation can be gained by donating &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Piece\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; at , up to a score of 18.

If you have &lt;a href=\"Keldorn\"&gt;Keldorn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Anomen\"&gt;Anomen&lt;/a&gt; in the party, after the battle they\u2019ll identify one of the dead monsters as the paladin &lt;a href=\"Ajantis%20Ilvastarr\"&gt;Ajantis&lt;/a&gt;, one of your former companions who, along with his squire and several other knights, were under an illusion that made them all appear as monsters. &lt;a href=\"Garren%20Windspear\"&gt;Garren Windspear&lt;/a&gt; will appear and following a brief dialogue he\u2019ll invite you to his &lt;a href=\"Windspear%20Cabin\"&gt;cabin&lt;/a&gt; where he'll provide you with a place of temporary sanctuary while he sets off to try to clear your name by contacting some of his former friends within the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Noble%20Order%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough (abbreviated).\nConfronting bandits.\nWhile Garren is away, his child will initiate a brief dialogue that culminates in a rest period cut scene. Upon awakening, the halfling &lt;a href=\"Jum\"&gt;Jum&lt;/a&gt; will appear and warn the party of approaching bandits. A second cut scene will begin and five bandits will appear inside the cabin. Immediately after they arrive, one of the bandits (the elven mage) will teleport Garren's child away while the leader, &lt;a href=\"Plath%20Rededge\"&gt;Plath Rededge&lt;/a&gt;, will engage the party in some dialogue that hints at part of the reason behind &lt;a href=\"Firkraag\"&gt;Lord Firkraag's&lt;/a&gt; interest with &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;. When the dialogue ends, the remaining four bandits will turn hostile and attack.\nGarren returns.\nAfter killing all of the remaining bandits, Garren will return to the cabin and lament the loss of his child; at first blaming the party, and then reconciling with the fact that it's his enemy Jierdan Firkraag who's truly behind the child's disappearance. He'll implore the party to find and safely return his child to him. He'll also reveal the Radiant Heart has heard his plea of the party's virtue and they demand justice for the slain knights, so that is now the party's task. \nOnce the party agrees to rescue Garren's child, the quest becomes official with an entry in the quest section of your &lt;a href=\"Journal\"&gt;Journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, the halfling Jum will make a second appearance and deliver a &lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Challenge\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; to the party before disappearing for good. Now it's time to seek out this Lord Firkraag and rescue that child. When you\u2019re ready, head for the &lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Entrance\"&gt;Dungeon Entrance&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast section of the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Entrance\"&gt;Firkraag's Entrance&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou find yourself in a Hobgoblin ambush, led by orog &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20DigDag\"&gt;Chieftain DigDag&lt;/a&gt;, who briefly shouts and then retreats to warn the other area defenders. If you intercept and kill him (difficult to do), he drops &lt;a href=\"Delver%27s%20Plate\"&gt;Delver's Plate +2&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hobgoblin%20Shaman\"&gt;Hobgoblin Shaman&lt;/a&gt; will turn back neutral and flee the battle. Further in, to the west, is a pit which is guarded by &lt;a href=\"Ogrillon\"&gt;Ogrillon&lt;/a&gt; creatures. To the south of them is a cavern with pools of water and stalagmites teeming with various &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Mist\"&gt;Vampiric Mist&lt;/a&gt; and possibly &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Death\"&gt;Crimson Death&lt;/a&gt; creatures within. There are two hidden niches, you may search for items, including: &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Protection%20%2B1\"&gt;Amulet of Protection +1&lt;/a&gt; and gems. \nA doorway on the center north of the main cavern is guarded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Kamikaze%20Kobold\"&gt;Kamikaze Kobold&lt;/a&gt; fanatics led by a &lt;a href=\"Ruhk%20Transmuter\"&gt;Ruhk Transmuter&lt;/a&gt;. The Kobolds will charge any detected party member and detonate themselves in a fiery explosion. The Rukh will defend the doorway with sword and spells. This Rukh possesses the &lt;a href=\"Batalista%27s%20Passport\"&gt;Batalista's Passport&lt;/a&gt; ring.\n&lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Firkraag's Maze&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnter through the main door to &lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Firkraag's Maze&lt;/a&gt; and encounter another ambush - the party is in the middle of a room, under the crossfire of Orc Archers letting loose &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Arrow\"&gt;Flaming Arrow&lt;/a&gt; missiles at the party from behind a barrier with arrow loopholes. There are secret doors on each of the walls that can be lockpicked or forced opened to allow melee attacks and even the odds somewhat. Afterward, open the main door (x 1860 y 2180) and go through that into an empty debris ridden room.\u00a0There is another door past this, open it and go through into an east-west corridor.\nDepending on the PC's XP level, you will face a &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Adamantite%20Golem\"&gt;Adamantite Golem&lt;/a&gt; here, otherwise a few &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt;s. If the party takes a right in the corridor a dilapidated kitchen is seen with a common tongue speaking\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Troll%20Cook\"&gt;Troll Cook&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 The troll engages in dialogue, some of it is classic Baldur's gate humor. The party can kill or set free the troll (if you\u00a0killed DigDag earlier then there will be different dialogue choice to do that). Search the broken table to find some enchanted arrows and bolts, and the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Cookbook\"&gt;Orcish Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;. This book offers advice as to what types of monsters' reside here and mentions a potential treasure in a well. The attached with a closed door and small descending stair run has an &lt;a href=\"Otyugh\"&gt;Otyugh&lt;/a&gt; inside it. Perhaps this is the Dungeon's garbage disposal room. There may be another band of hobgoblins with the Otuygh as well, depending on the protagonist's XP level.\nReturn to the corridor; at the western end are two more closed doors - pass through these (x 2050 y 1680) and find a room where two orcs are cowering. These are &lt;a href=\"Derg%20the%20Orc\"&gt;Derg the Orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flaylan%20the%20Orc\"&gt;Flaylan the Orc&lt;/a&gt;. They don't want you to kill them, yet they obviously fear Firkraag even more. Dialogue allows the party to demand information. Or the player can summarily attack them. Another option allows them to flee if feeling merciful, and they will leave, never to return.\nFrom the main corridor where the golems were encountered, there is a closed door to the North. Enter that room, which may be uninhabited or possibly have further orc defenders (depends on PC's XP level). Go further to the north into corridor with a locked door to the west, and an open passage to the east. The locked door requires a key. It can't be bashed. To the east leads to a large room covered in debris and stinking with the sickly-sweet odor of the dead. Within can be seen a huddled coven of &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mummy\"&gt;Mummy&lt;/a&gt; and ghast undead. They will promptly attack if any party members are detected and seek the blood and flesh of the living. There's one locked and trapped chest in here with treasure.\u00a0Follow the passage right to another room with a closed door. Within is a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Wraith\"&gt;Greater Wraith&lt;/a&gt; and possibly some other shadow creatures. Search the debris on the floor to find the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20Key\"&gt;Chapel Key&lt;/a&gt; and some bullets (x 3140 y 2630). This is the key needed to go further into the Maze.\nGo back to the main passage and open the locked door with the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20Key\"&gt;Chapel Key&lt;/a&gt; (x 2600 y 1400).\u00a0A female warrior clad in armor named &lt;a href=\"Samia\"&gt;Samia&lt;/a&gt; will speak to you. \nGo through the south door (x 2450 y 1400), within this passage are several wolfweres that rush the first detected party member in a frenzy of slashing claws and bared fangs. Continue down this corridor and find a single closed door. Pass through (check for traps!) this door and within is another large chamber with a well, and great crevasse into the depths of the earth, a makeshift causeway leading to another corridor, and another passage leading elsewhere. If desired, click the well's winch twice (x 1250 y 1230) to raise the bucket. In the bucket is found the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Helm\"&gt;Dragon Helm&lt;/a&gt;, also a hostile &lt;a href=\"Air%20Elemental\"&gt;Air Elemental&lt;/a&gt; is drawn out as well.\nFurther along there is an opening to a cavern, inside can be observed an ongoing argument between a Human male, a small troll and an orc. Observe the fight and hear their argument or join the battle and kill them all if desired. No one in this place seems to be particularly friendly. There is a secret passage here (x 500 y 1050) along the north wall. Enter and observe three golems (including an &lt;a href=\"Adamantite%20Golem\"&gt;Adamantite Golem&lt;/a&gt;) which will animate and attack if any in the party are detected. At the far end of the room (x 800 y 450) is treasure niche: Within is found the &lt;a href=\"Heartseeker\"&gt;Heartseeker&lt;/a&gt; long bow and gems.\nReturn to the previous passage and through the door to the south.\u00a0Upon entering the next chamber is discovered two human male adventurers by the name &lt;a href=\"Grancor\"&gt;Grancor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falik\"&gt;Falik&lt;/a&gt;. They address the party and ask for urgent help with healing their other partners further in the complex. The party can agree to help, or perhaps ask some questions first.\nThrough dialogue or other actions, it won't take long to realize these two acting suspiciously and are actually lycanthropes under disguise. Grancor is a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Wolfwere\"&gt;Greater Wolfwere&lt;/a&gt;. Two additional wolfwere are in the next bed chamber. If the party prevails against these blood thirsty beasts, a third and final room has containers with various valuables, such as: &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Undead\"&gt;Hold Undead&lt;/a&gt; scroll, &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Monster\"&gt;Hold Monster&lt;/a&gt; scroll, &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; scroll, and the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Blasting\"&gt;Horn of Blasting&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow it's time to cross that previous makeshift bridge across the chasm. Continue on and various defenders will be present, including more Orog warriors. A closed door is found in a smallish chamber with various junk, and crates/barrels. Passing through the door is seen a winding stone staircase descending to another closed door. Always search for traps. \nDescend the stairs, open the door and observe several orcs. &lt;a href=\"Tazok\"&gt;Tazok&lt;/a&gt; will be present, and so will Chieftan DigDag if he was able to escape earlier. There will be some statements, dialogue and threats made leading to hostilities. Have a look at their creature pages for potential carried loot. Be sure to check this room for treasures, for there are good gems and spell scrolls.\nYou will find Garren's child in the right jail cell (x 2380 y 700). However, the door is locked and cannot be freed by conventional methods. You can have dialogue with the prisoner (&lt;a href=\"Iltha\"&gt;Iltha&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Taar\"&gt;Taar&lt;/a&gt;) and promise to return with the key to liberate them.\nFind the transition to stairs leading below to the next area map. On the player's Automap Notes this is marked as \"Entrance to the Cavern\".\n&lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;Firkraag's Hideout&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party enters a large stone stairway descending to a great hall. This is &lt;a href=\"Firkraag\"&gt;Firkraag&lt;/a&gt;'s lair.\u00a0Move forward and all becomes apparent, Firkraag is a Dragon, a red Dragon to be more specific.\u00a0He initiates dialogue when a party member is within detection distance. Standing beside the dragon is a human mage named &lt;a href=\"Conster\"&gt;Conster&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrough dialogue, if the party doesn't attack Firkraag or Conster his mage, then there is a chance for the party to make known that you aren't leaving without Garren's child. The dragon permits this, but first commands his mage back to the previous level, to defend the area to the death. This is as much a test for Conster as it will be for the party to perform the rescue of Garren's child from the jail cell.\nIt is also possible to preemptively attack Firkraag and or Conster from long range before any dialogue can begin. \nAnother option is through dialogue choices. The party can also just goad Firkraag (and by default: Conster) to become hostile, right here and right now. You can get the key needed to free Garren's child from Conster's body. Fighting the dragon and Conster at the same time is the greatest challenge level.\nIf the PC is a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter freeing Garen's child, return to his cabin. Garren and child will thank you (each party member receives 44,500 XP), and if &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; is a paladin he will also send good words for you to the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Noble%20Order%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt;. When back in Athkatla, visit &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Wessalen\"&gt;Prelate Wessalen&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to begin your &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Stronghold%20Duties\"&gt;stronghold duties&lt;/a&gt;. If you are a Fallen Paladin (or Fallen version of other Paladin class kits) you will regain your Paladin abilities upon completion of this quest when speaking with Garren (This is in addition to the later possibility of regaining Paladin powers during the Stronghold questline)."}

She has asked the party to help defend them against any \"extra-planar creatures\" (such as &lt;a href=\"Quasit\"&gt;Quasits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Elemental\"&gt;Fire Elementals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fiend\"&gt;Shadow Fiends&lt;/a&gt;) that step through the portal. Afterwards, hostile &lt;a href=\"Aawill\"&gt;Planar Bounty Hunters&lt;/a&gt; appear to abduct Raelis and her troupe, including &lt;a href=\"Haer%27Dalis\"&gt;Haer'Dalis&lt;/a&gt;. After the fight, you can either follow them directly into the portal, or take some time to prepare (rest, sell/buy, reform party, etc.) as the portal remains open.\nAfter entering the portal, you will arrive at Planar Prison and are immediately challenged by the same group of planar bounty hunters and who absconded with the actors. After the fight, be sure to loot the bodies (see the section below on Notable Loot).\nFor a detailed walkthrough of the prison itself, see the page for &lt;a href=\"Planar%20Prison\"&gt;Planar Prison&lt;/a&gt;.

It seems the only way to freedom is to kill the to the north who runs this place, but it\u2019s too dangerous to face the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; directly. You should detour to the east, find and kill the &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Thralls\"&gt;Master of Thralls&lt;/a&gt; (16,000 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;), grab his &lt;a href=\"Mastery%20Orb\"&gt;Mastery Orb&lt;/a&gt; and toss it into the blazing hot brazier located just to the east of the portal entrance. Destroying the Orb frees the thralls, making it much easier to defeat the Warden (10,000 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;). Be sure to loot the Warden for his items, including the &lt;a href=\"Planar%20Prison%20Cell%20Key\"&gt;Planar Prison Cell Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are also strange, \"fleshy\" traps that pull you down into pits to fight various groups of enemies for extra loot and experience. \nAchievements.\nPlanehopper.\nRescue &lt;a href=\"Haer%27Dalis\"&gt;Haer'Dalis&lt;/a&gt; from a grim fate.\n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Gorion's Ward is a &lt;a href=\"bard\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt; with no other strongholds, Raelis will give the permission to let you &lt;a href=\"Running%20the%20Five%20Flagons%20Playhouse\"&gt;run the Five Flagons playhouse&lt;/a&gt; before her departure."}

She will most likely support &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; in this matter. So, the party can do as it wishes, or at least try to.

She has some innate passive Harper powers, as described in the InfoBox. \nAs a competent fighter she will accurately engage in melee with her enchanted halberd, striking often and with dangerous damage dealing potential. If she is wounded to a preset threshold, she'll attempt to quaff a potion of healing for increased staying power, and may also imbibe the &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Potion of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.\nReviane's Harpers.\nAlong with Reviane, Jaheira and &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; may have to deal with the other Harpers that Reviane has brought along for Backup.

The items he sells here are of higher quality, and he'll pay more gold than normal for items sold to him.\nNotable goods:\nNotes.\nWhen Gorion's Ward is being imported to BG2EE along with Varscona, then this sword is found in &lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irenicus's Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. This also happens in some cases with a newly created (not imported) character who finds Varscona in Irenicus's Dungeon (there have been at least two reports - from a Kensai and a Fighter/Mage). In those cases, Ribald gets a Long Sword +2 instead, which in some(?) cases can be pickpocketed from him.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.blackwyrmlair.net/lofiversion/index.php/t1629.html\"&gt;Ribald's Genie&lt;/a&gt; mod installs an option to buy a magical flute from Ribald that can summon a genie that allows the party to transport back to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer%20Mart\"&gt;Adventurer Mart&lt;/a&gt; once per day, and then return back to where the party was.

It inflicts the &lt;a href=\"Confused\"&gt;Confused&lt;/a&gt; status effect on a single target.\nGameplay.\nThe caster selects a single target and casts this spell towards it.\nThe target creature is allowed a &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; versus Spell, or it will be affected by the Rigid Thinking effect, lasting 1 turn.\nRigid Thinking makes the target &lt;a href=\"Confused\"&gt;Confused&lt;/a&gt;; however, the combat log will display a text string reading \"Rigid Thinking\" rather than \"Confused\".\nRigid Thinking has its own unique portrait icon (applicable only to player characters).\nThis spell can be blocked with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;, or low-level spell protections such as &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Enchantment&lt;/a&gt; will also block the spell.\nThe spell can be removed with &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect, and the Confused state can be cured - see the status effect article.\nIf a neutral creature successfully saves vs. Rigid Thinking, they will not turn hostile in the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;. They will in the &lt;a href=\"original%20edition\"&gt;original edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the effect of this spell expires on a neutral creature (or it's dispelled) they will turn hostile. This also means that the creature won't turn hostile (i.e. will remain neutral) until the effect expires (even if they're attacked by the player), so any crimes (e.g. murder of innocents) committed by the confused creature won't penalize the player.\nThe scenarios described above apply to general cases. Keep in mind that some specific creatures have different AI conditions for \"turning red\" (i.e. becoming hostile), so you might end up with different results from time to time. For example, the Watcher's Keep party of helmites turns red whenever any of them die, under almost any circumstance, so you can't easily use Rigid Thinking to get away with a crime there.\nNote.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition spell \"Rigid Thinking\" is designed to do something much different than what is implemented in the game. A few parameters were accurately taken from the ruleset by Bioware, but many were not. See the external links for more.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has not changed this spell - other than some internal &lt;a href=\"Opcode\"&gt;Opcode&lt;/a&gt; additions to ensure better performance with other game and creature scripts.

Expect a fight to the death.\nRilloa is located on the first platform of the house, along with six other female &lt;a href=\"Jae%27llat%20Guard\"&gt;Jae'llat Guard&lt;/a&gt; warriors.\nGameplay.\nRilloa begins the scenario on the upper platform. Her opening self preparatory buffs (which cannot be interrupted) include &lt;a href=\"Chant\"&gt;Chant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strength%20of%20One\"&gt;Strength of One&lt;/a&gt;. Note that these allied friendly AoE spells will also buff her nearby &lt;a href=\"Jae%27llat%20Guard\"&gt;Jae'llat Guard&lt;/a&gt; companions (of which there are several on the platform with her).\nShe will initially attempt a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt; on the nearest opponent, and then a &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Cloak of Fear&lt;/a&gt; self-buff.\nAfterwards, whether engaged in melee combat or not, she can attempt a &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Cure\"&gt;Mass Cure&lt;/a&gt; if wounded to a certain threshold (which may also heal allied creatures in the AoE). If an allied drow is seriously wounded she can try and cast a &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Serious%20Wounds\"&gt;Cure Serious Wounds&lt;/a&gt; to assist. If she is seriously damaged herself, she can attempt a self &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; spell cast.\nRilloa can also launch a &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Hold Person (priest)&lt;/a&gt; at an enemy. That is about the extent of her spell casting scripted actions. All those other memorized spells listed in the InfoBox aren't used.\nIf pressed into close quarters combat, she will resist with her relatively good armor class and &lt;a href=\"Drow%20Flail\"&gt;Drow Flail&lt;/a&gt;. Many hostile spells may fail against her, as she has very high magic resistance. \nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a few changes to this creature. Her weapon proficiencies are corrected to 1 pip in flail and 1 pip in single weapon style. A complete compliment of divine spells is memorized from levels 1 through 7. Some of the spells are different than the unmodded creature. A default SCS cleric AI script is installed for \"Smarter Cleric\" behavior. An SCS random treasure is in the creature's inventory as well. Rilloa will now aggressively cast as many spells as possible unless disrupted or killed. She will heal herself, cast Invisibility Purge and self-buffs, and summon creatures.\nWith SCS Hindra will launch a group of preparatory protections (cast previously) including: &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Free Action (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer first attempted spell cast after buffing will be &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt; to bring forth a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; ally for assistance.\nFrom this point on, further clerical spell casting choices are driven by the AI's threat assessment and party vulnerability evaluations. Various offensive spells such as &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Word\"&gt;Unholy Word&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cause%20Serious%20Wounds\"&gt;Cause Serious Wounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Poison (spell)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slay%20Living\"&gt;Slay Living&lt;/a&gt; are valid options. \nShe will use &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; on self if she meets certain conditions, as well as &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; if original HP are reduced to 60%. \nIf the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod is installed, the drow's memorized spells will be the SR versions."}

Some of the introduced changes will be applied immediately but, for best results, you should start a new game after installing this mod.\nThe mod is divided into multiple components all of which can be installed separately and are completely independent of each other. More detailed descriptions of all mod components can be found in their respective readme files.\nIt is compatible with BGEE as of v4.60, BG2EE as of v4.64, and IWDEE as of v4.80 (beta).\nThe mod has many adjustments, tweaks and revisions, and some compatibility and install order notes that should be reviewed by the player.

All of these come with additional dialogues and some with additional quest lines / encounters that can only be accessed through the romances.\nThe entirety of the series offers a dozen different romanceable characters. Eight for male protagonists and six for female ones, ten offer opposite-sex relationships and four offer same-sex relationships.\nGirdle of Masculinity/Femininity &amp; Wild Surge.\nIt is possible to bypass the gender restrictions on romances if the protagonist's sex is changed through magical means such as the &lt;a href=\"Girdle%20of%20Masculinity/Femininity\"&gt;Girdle of Masculinity/Femininity&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge\"&gt;Wild Surge&lt;/a&gt;. The change doesn't have to be permanent, it is enough to switch, start the romance and then switch back again. However, the companion in question will still refer to the protagonist as whichever sex they officially can romance (i.e. Anomen will always think the protagonist is a woman, even if they are male).\n&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;\"Baldur's Gate\"&lt;/a&gt; &amp; \"\".\nThe protagonist can not romance any of the companions in the game.\nInter-character relationships.\nThe \"Enhanced Edition\" adds three companions the protagonist can get closer with, but these romances only act as an introduction to the ones in \"Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition\". There are two romance options for male characters and two for female characters. Male protagonists get both a male and a female romance option, whereas female protagonists only have male romance options.\n\"\".\nThis game features eight different romanceable characters, four options for female protagonists and six options for male ones. Unlike in the previous game, these romances all go to the point where a legitimate relationship between the companion and the protagonist is formed (in one form or another). There are male and female options regardless of the protagonist's gender.\n' &amp; '.\nThis game first introduced romances to the series. There are three options for male protagonists and one option for female protagonists. All of these romances are for the opposite sex only and all come with racial restrictions. That means that there are no romances for dwarves and for female gnome and half-orc protagonists.\nJaheira.\nWith Khalid's death, Jaheira will turn towards a male protagonist for consolation, making it possible to romance Jaheira, provide he is &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"halfling\"&gt;halfling&lt;/a&gt;. This romance has the most dialogues and is intertwined with the Harper quests. If their romance continues, Gorion's Ward may eventually have to deal with a group of bandits led by &lt;a href=\"Ertof%20Dand\"&gt;Ertof Dand&lt;/a&gt; who have heard that the pair have amassed quite a lot of great items to steal. While resting outdoors, Ertof's band wake the party with a blade at Jaheira's throat, and an ultimatum to hand over all their possessions or else. Gorion's Ward will then have a few dialog options to try, which may affect the outcome of the romance.\nAnomen.\nIt is possible to romance Anomen. The requirements for the protagonist are to be female and either a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"halfling\"&gt;halfling&lt;/a&gt;. The player does not have to brownnose him but he doesn't like being made fun of and sometimes he will get angry for seemingly no good reason.\nIn \"Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn:\"\nAnomen will begin the romance by saying \"I prithee, my lady...\" and will continue to talk to her about his heroic accomplishments and his past, as well as ask her about her adventures at Baldur's Gate. After five conversations, he will begin the next dialogue with \"My lady, I feel most terrible about my burst of temper the previous day...\" After this conversation, the next time you return to an outdoor area, a messenger named &lt;a href=\"Terl\"&gt;Terl&lt;/a&gt; comes to Anomen telling him that his sister was murdered, and Anomen asks to speak with his father about how this happened. Upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Delryn%20Estate\"&gt;Delryn Estate&lt;/a&gt;, Anomen's father, &lt;a href=\"Cor%20Delryn\"&gt;Cor Delryn&lt;/a&gt;, claims that a man named &lt;a href=\"Saerk%20Farrahd\"&gt;Saerk Farrahd&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for the murder, and orders Anomen to go to &lt;a href=\"Estate%20of%20Saerk%20Farrahd\"&gt;Saerk's estate&lt;/a&gt; and kill him. You must then choose to either advise Anomen to listen to his father, or let the law handle it and move on (see Anomen Returns Home After his Sister's Death for more information). After that quest, Anomen will begin again with the lovetalk. Soon, he will start a conversation with \"My Test is coming very soon, my lady.\" at which point, you may go to the Order for Anomen to take his test. Depending on the decision you made earlier about his NPC quest, he will either pass or fail the test. It is possible to continue the romance either way.\nSeveral days after that, Anomen is again approached by Terl, who reveals the real murderer(s) of Moira (see Anomen Returns Home After his Sister's Death for details).\nAfter that, Anomen will continue with a few more lovetalks in which you will officially start 'dating'.\nAfter returning from the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;, when you reach the graveyard district, &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; will abduct Anomen from your party and turn him into a vampire (if you have successfully completed the romance with him) and you will be forced to kill him. Don't panic! There's a way to get him back! Visit &lt;a href=\"the%20final%20battle%20with%20Bodhi\"&gt;the final battle with Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; to find out how.\nIn \"Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal\"\nAnomen's romance will continue in \" if you meet these requirements:\nIf you meet all of these requirements, then the romance continues. Anomen will become increasingly nervous about your destiny. All you have to do is calm him down and tell him that you love him and want to be together forever. He will eventually ask you to marry him!\nFor a full walkthrough of the detailed conversations, see the Anomen Romance video here: \nThe \"Enhanced Edition\" continues the romances that have been started in the first game. However, at this point there is no direct continuation for the romances started in \"Siege of Dragonspear\", which leads to a mild disconnect between the romances in \"SoD\" and \"BG2:EE\".\nThe additional romances introduce a same-sex option for protagonists of either gender and come with no racial restrictions. There are three options for female protagonists and two options for male protagonists.\nExternal Links.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//yiya.de/games/baldursgate2/html/b2_dlgjah.htm\"&gt;Extensive guide for the Jaheira romance&lt;/a&gt;, including all dialogues, quests and lovetalk variable counting, in the german walkthrough site from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//yiya.de/index.htm\"&gt;Yiya&lt;/a&gt;."}

She can only be encountered if the party accepts &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt;'s offer of help after they escape from the maze below &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;, during the quest &lt;a href=\"Escaping%20the%20Asylum\"&gt;Escaping the Asylum&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nOnce the party begins &lt;a href=\"The%20prophecy%20of%20Sekolah\"&gt;The prophecy of Sekolah&lt;/a&gt; quest - by slaying an &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt; and being recruited to eliminate &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Villynaty\"&gt;Prince Villynaty&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the sahuagin rebels. Priestess Senityili will implore the party to stop by and speak with her before they go to the rebel-held portion of the city.\nIf the player speaks to her, she reveals that she is secretly a supporter of the Rebel Prince; she recognizes that &lt;a href=\"King%20Ixilthetocal\"&gt;King Ixilthetocal&lt;/a&gt; is insane, and fears that he will cause the doom of the city's population. As such, she has been working with the rebels to try and overthrow him, but to no avail; she asks the party to speak with &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Villynaty\"&gt;Prince Villynaty&lt;/a&gt; and aid him in toppling the mad king, thus saving the city's blood-line and rebuilding the critically low spawn rate. \nIf the party agrees to speak to the rebel leader, she will give them a &lt;a href=\"Rebel%27s%20Orb\"&gt;Rebel's Orb&lt;/a&gt; as a token to earn an audience with Prince Villynaty, though she warns it will not protect them from being attacked by the random rebels wandering the streets and skirmishing with the king's forces.\nLike most sahuagin here, she has the SAHHCITY script assigned. If she is attacked, it will cause all the other creatures with this script to also become hostile to the party. That will end any open quests in the City of Caverns, nix dialogue opportunities, and shut down any temple services. \nIf the Priestess ever does become hostile, she will use all of those spells scripted for use in her InfoBox, if able, and not disrupted.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod changes this creature to possess a fully populated Cleric spell book commensurate with her experience level. \nShe'll open hostilities with a group of previously cast buffs to include &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire (priest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Mirror\"&gt;Physical Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Archons\"&gt;Shield of the Archons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Free Action (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther spell casting selection will be determined by the AI opponent vulnerability and assessment script. \nThe cleric will hast self-healing spells when damaged to a predetermined threshold.

Only one spell protection will be removed (from the list in the spell description above). \nA &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; will block this spell, and then the shield will be consumed.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Alteration&lt;/a&gt; will not block this spell, even though Ruby Ray of Reversal is an Alteration school spell.\nA Ruby Ray may be cast on a target who is invisible, sanctuaried or hidden.\nThe spell will bypass an illusionary protection such as &lt;a href=\"Reflected%20Image\"&gt;Reflected Image&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, even though the internal spell effects are not flagged to do so.\nThe spell description is missing &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Archons\"&gt;Shield of the Archons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Resistance%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Magic Resistance (spell)&lt;/a&gt; as spell protections that can be removed by Ruby Ray.\nCasting a Ruby Ray of Reversal on a neutral creature will turn them hostile, and perhaps others in the same vicinity.\nSpell removal order.\nWhen a creature is protected by multiple spell protections, a Ruby Ray spell will remove one of those in the following order:\nIf two or more spell protections have equal spell levels, the Ruby Ray will randomly determine which spell protection is removed.\nExample: - An enemy &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; is protected by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;. The party Paladin uses the &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Rod of Reversal&lt;/a&gt; to launch a Ruby Ray of Reversal at the undead monstrosity. The spell removes the Spell Trap, and the Spell Turning and Spell Immunity remain active on the lich.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset Wizard spell \"Ruby Ray of Reversal\" is based on the transmuter\" Nezram's ruby ray\". Every time the ray is used, a ruby worth at least 1,000 GP is required. The ray has several possible uses in the Pen and Paper game, but it really isn't an anti-spell protection remover as implemented in the BG video game. For example, a ruby ray can spring mechanical and magical traps, untie knots, open Wizard locked and held portals, melt away a patch of webs, revert transformed individuals polymorphed or petrified and many other uses. Contrary to what the Bioware developed spell does, the Pen and Paper version explicitly states that a ruby ray cannot pierce an anti-magic shell or prismatic sphere. See the External link for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects, and description. See below:\nRuby Ray of Reversal\nLevel: 7\nSchool: Alteration\nRange: Long\nDuration: Instant\nCasting Time: 5\nArea of Effect: 1 creature\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is cast it will dispel one spell protection of any level on the target. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first. If a target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.\nThe spell protection spells dispelled by Ruby Ray of Reversal are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, Mind Blank, and Spell Trap.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod Ruby Ray of Reversal can't target invisible or hidden creatures (with SCS or SR or both mods) without first exposing or revealing the target creature."}

They are positioned in front of it facing towards where a visitor will enter. The creatures are hostile.\nWhen a party member is detected, the Rukh will attempt to spell cast and target the nearest enemy with a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, then a sequentially try and cast a &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;.

It is one of several spawn points. Search the small stone container nearby for &lt;a href=\"Amuana%27s%20Bones\"&gt;Amuana's Bones&lt;/a&gt; and mundane missiles: Arrows , Bolts , Darts , and Throwing Axes . \nShadow Prison.\nOn the opposite side is a prison overseen by a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Jailor\"&gt;Shadow Jailor&lt;/a&gt;. Take its key to rescue and potentially recruit &lt;a href=\"Mazzy%20Fentan\"&gt;Mazzy Fentan&lt;/a&gt;.

This chamber is a spawn point for shadows. A corridor leads on from here to the Pedestal of Light. A scroll describing the &lt;a href=\"Morn%20Ritual\"&gt;Morning Ritual&lt;/a&gt; is hidden in within the central column.\nStatue of Ritual.\nTo the northeast of the Prison stands the Statue of Ritual. Investigating the statue reveals, in a status message:\"This bust is a depiction of the sun god, Amaunator. The caption on the pedestal reads as: 'Let not Holy Ritual be derided. None is worth of His Grace without first paying homage in the manner that He Himself has prescribed. Learn the Ritual or face His Punishment.'\"Scattered around the dungeon are broken tablets describing the three holy rituals that Amaunator's faithful performed to honor dawn, midday, and dusk. Interacting with the statue allows the player to perform each ritual in turn, with each ritual comprised of three steps. If all steps are completed successfully for a given ritual, the party gains 45500 XP. If the ritual is failed, the party member interacting with the statue is struck by a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nOnce all three rituals are completed, the party gains the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Ray%20Symbol\"&gt;Sun Ray Symbol&lt;/a&gt;, one piece of the holy &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Amaunator\"&gt;Symbol of Amaunator&lt;/a&gt;. The completed symbol is needed to enter the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dragon%20Lair\"&gt;Shadow Dragon Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nA southern corridor here leads to the Pedestal of Light room, where you can also complete the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20final%20battle%20with%20Bodhi\"&gt;The final battle with Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Black%20Heart\"&gt;Bodhi's Black Heart&lt;/a&gt;.\nPedestal of Light.\nThe Pedestal of Light emits an aura of holy radiance that instantly destroys any shadows or related creatures that enter the area. Its power stems from a Sun Gem, which must be removed in order to defeat the first Shadow Door. Once taken, the pedestal loses its powers.\"The gem that sits on the pedestal easily penetrates the unnatural shadows of this place. You could take the gem if you wish to. When you take the gem from the pedestal, the illumination lessens considerably and the shadows of the room deepen.\"Once the first Shadow Door has been dispelled, the party can enter deeper into the dungeon via the once-blocked corridor.\nShadow Door Corridor.\nThrough the first Shadow Door is a corridor that curves south, then east, in a horseshoe-shaped arch. Two more Shadow Doors close off access to the other side of the corridor, limiting your choice of direction.\nBridge and Lava Rooms.\nTake a left into the first room, across a bridge towards the room beyond. Shadows and Shade Wolves appear and attack when the lead party member trips a silent trap near the middle of the bridge.\nThe bridge leads to a chamber filled with bubbling lava, so hot that it causes minor heat damage to those who linger too long within it. Two small elongated crannies within the lava conceal &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Bolt's of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Pearly%20White%20Ioun%20Stone\"&gt;Pearly White Ioun Stone&lt;/a&gt; in one, and &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Arrows of Ice&lt;/a&gt; and an item of &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure%23Average%20treasure\"&gt;average random treasure&lt;/a&gt; in the other.\nOn the wall on the far side of the chamber is a trapped bas relief that contains a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Wand of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dart%20of%20Wounding\"&gt;Darts of Wounding&lt;/a&gt; .\nUndead Room.\nTo the right of the bas relief is a narrow doorway that leads to an empty chamber with a trapped pyramid-shaped column that contains a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Wyvern%20Call\"&gt;Wyvern Call&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Amaunator\"&gt;Tome of Amaunator&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Noontide%20Ritual\"&gt;Noon Ritual&lt;/a&gt; scroll, and &lt;a href=\"Bullet%20%2B1\"&gt;Bullets +1&lt;/a&gt; . This room is the first of two places within the dungeon where a silent trigger (this one is near the entrance to the dungeon) spawns different groups of undead depending upon current experience points accrued by &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmuana's Tomb.\nAcross the lava chamber from this empty chamber (along the nearside wall) is another narrow doorway that leads to the Amuana's tomb chamber where the party will encounter the ghosts of two dead Amaunator priests; &lt;a href=\"Badon%27s%20Ghost\"&gt;Badon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dettseh%27s%20Ghost\"&gt;Dettseh&lt;/a&gt;. If presented with Amuana's bones from the Shadow Wolf Lair, they will pass back on to the afterlife, granting the party 17750 XP. &lt;a href=\"Amuana\"&gt;Amuana&lt;/a&gt;'s ghost will then grant the party a second piece of the Symbol of Amaunator, the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Light%20Symbol\"&gt;Dawn's Light Symbol&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dragon%20Wardstone\"&gt;Shadow Dragon Wardstone&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to bypass the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dragon\"&gt;Shadow Dragon&lt;/a&gt; in the penultimate chamber. Once she has departed, the party may also take the &lt;a href=\"Sunstone%20Bullet\"&gt;Sunstone Bullets&lt;/a&gt; , a Scroll of &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt; and from her tomb. Be sure to check Dettseh's corpse for an additional 250 .\nExit the tomb to the southeast towards the shadow door corridor by crossing the chasm, which sets off another spawn trigger. South in the corridor is a side hall to the left where another group of undead have spawned from the trigger you set off. These will be the same as listed above, depending upon Gorion's Ward's current XP.\nTile Room.\nFrom the shadow door corridor, take the short hallway northeast into the Tile Room, and a silent trigger will display a status message:\"As you approach the letter-tiled floor, a voice intones: 'Only the Name of the master shall keep thee from the Power of the Darkness!'\"In the room beyond, the floor is covered in tiles that are each emblazoned with a single letter. The status message gives you a clue to \"follow the path of Amaunator\". To cross safely, each party member must only step on the tiles that spell out AMAUNATOR; stepping on a wrong tile triggers a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt;. It is best to disable Party NPC AI to cross here as these flame strikes are brutal.\nChapel.\nBeyond the tiles are two doors. The one on the left leads to a Chapel, which contains a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Golem\"&gt;Bone Golem&lt;/a&gt;. An easy way to dispatch this is to have a &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;hasted&lt;/a&gt; party member lure it back onto the tiles, where it will stumble around and be bombarded with Flame Strikes until it is destroyed. The chapel contains a statue. Clicking on the top half provides a clue for another quest (see &lt;a href=\"The%20final%20battle%20with%20Bodhi\"&gt;The final battle with Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;).\"This statue depicts a woman whose eyes blaze with light. She appears to be waiting for something to be placed in her arms.\"The bottom half of the statue has a treasure stash with the &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20Ritual\"&gt;Dusk Ritual&lt;/a&gt; scroll, Sunstone Bullets , &lt;a href=\"Arla%27s%20Dragonbane\"&gt;Arla's Dragonbane&lt;/a&gt;, a Sun Gem, and scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection from Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe door on the right leads to a cell where a shadow tries to convince the player to take it across the tile room. If pressed, it will reveal that a shard of the Symbol of Amaunator, the &lt;a href=\"Lightstone%20Symbol\"&gt;Lightstone Symbol&lt;/a&gt;, is hidden in the back of its cell. If the shadow is taken across, however, it betrays the party and attacks.\nOnce all three of the shards of the Symbol of Amaunator are gathered, they fuse together, granting the full item and 21250 XP for the party to split.\"When you place the three symbols together the [sic] meld into the Symbol of Amaunator. This should be the key that will gain entrance into the lower dungeon.\"The symbol serves as a key to unlock the door to the Shadow Dragon Lair, which is found by following the main corridor past the tile room and all the way around to the east.\nShadow Dragon Lair.\nIn the Shadow Dragon Lair, the party will encounter &lt;a href=\"Thaxll%27ssillyia\"&gt;Thaxll'ssillyia&lt;/a&gt;; if they have the Shadow Dragon wardstone from Amauna's Tomb, the dragon will not attack as long as they do not try to interact with it. If the party is of insufficient level, it might be a good idea to pass by the dragon first and come back later - the shadow dragon does not disappear until it is killed.\nAltar of Amaunator.\nA door in shadow dragon lair leads back up to the Temple Ruins outdoor an area that is currently closed off by an impenetrable wall trees and vegetation. A defiled Altar of Amaunator stands in the grove, where the party must confront the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Lord\"&gt;Shade Lord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Patrick\"&gt;Shadow Patrick&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Altar\"&gt;Shadow Altar&lt;/a&gt; and a swarm of &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;s. The altar spits out a continuous stream of shadows until destroyed.\nIf Mazzy Fentan is present in the party, then there will be extended dialogue between her, the Shade Lord, and Shadow Patrick. Otherwise, the shadow undead will attack immediately.\nOnce they have all been destroyed, their loot can be recovered from their bodies, and the party can return to &lt;a href=\"Imnesvale\"&gt;Imnesvale&lt;/a&gt; to report success to &lt;a href=\"Minister%20Lloyd\"&gt;Minister Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;, completing the quest to &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20the%20deaths%20in%20the%20Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Investigate the deaths in the Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nRituals of Amaunator.\nMorning Ritual:\nNoon Ritual:\nDusk Ritual:"}

An unpickable locked door to the southeast leads to the Ritual Room. A passageway southwest leads past several storerooms and living chambers, with two such chambers connected to the main hall in the southeast. Several &lt;a href=\"Worg\"&gt;Worg&lt;/a&gt;s lurk in the room further southwest.\nThe uppermost of the southeastern rooms from the main hall contains a group of four cultists. They will ignore the player if left alone, and if spoken to will also leave them alone if Gorion's Ward claims to be a new cultist, otherwise, they will attack. They will drop &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, and the (sometimes trapped) containers in the room contain a random gem, 20 &lt;a href=\"Bullet%20of%20Electricity\"&gt;Bullets of Electricity&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Agility\"&gt;Potion of Agility&lt;/a&gt;, which can be taken without aggravating the cultists.\nThe lower of the south-eastern rooms from the main hall contains a band of three hostile &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Stalker\"&gt;Invisible Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s, which guard a chest containing 20 &lt;a href=\"Dart%20of%20Wounding\"&gt;Darts of Wounding&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeading south, the first room on the left contains more cultists. These cultists, and the ones following, will only become hostile if an ally in the same room is attacked, allowing elimination one by one. The first room on the right contains a &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Cultist\"&gt;Mad Cultist&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;) who is busily attacking the bookcases. Scattered around this room on the floor and on the shelves are assorted books, as well as scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Serious%20Wounds\"&gt;Cure Serious Wounds&lt;/a&gt; (x2), &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action\"&gt;Free Action&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Neutralize%20Poison\"&gt;Neutralize Poison&lt;/a&gt;. The cultist himself drops a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Explosions\"&gt;Potion of Explosions&lt;/a&gt; when slain. Following the corridor around brings the party onto a trap in the corner, past a locked lower chamber (more cultists) and an upper chamber with a trapped chest with a &lt;a href=\"Parchment%20%28BDMISC50.itm%29\"&gt;Parchment&lt;/a&gt; and scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Critical%20Wounds\"&gt;Cure Critical Wounds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Identify\"&gt;Identify&lt;/a&gt;). The corridor ends at &lt;a href=\"Ziatar\"&gt;Ziatar&lt;/a&gt;'s Chamber.\nZiatar's Chamber.\nInside, after a brief conversation, the half-dragon cultist will turn hostile, regardless of what is said to her. This will cause all other surviving cultists of Cyric in this portion of the temple to turn hostile as well. She drops a &lt;a href=\"Plate%20Mail%20%2B1\"&gt;Plate Mail +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Two-Handed Sword +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Wand of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Jail%20Key\"&gt;Jail Key&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Room%20Key\"&gt;Ritual Room Key&lt;/a&gt;, whilst a nearby table contains the unique books &lt;a href=\"Akanna%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Akanna's Journal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ziatar%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Ziatar's Journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Ritual Room Key, the player can now unlock the Ritual Room, and thereby gain access to the rest of the temple. Upon entering the Ritual Room, they will see a cultist of Cyric be slain by a &lt;a href=\"Neothelid\"&gt;Neothelid&lt;/a&gt;, with a second fleeing past them. Once the aberration is dead, the player may continue through a door in the southeast wall.\nThe resultant corridor leads southeast to the High Priest's Room and southwest to the Laboratory.\nHigh Priest's Room.\nThe High Priest's Room is currently occupied by High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Akanna\"&gt;Akanna&lt;/a&gt;, who has been driven mad by psionic emanations.\u00a0If you wait to enter until the &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt; has been slain, she will be grateful for saving her temple and offer you 200 gold as payment. You can also ask for the &lt;a href=\"Wardstone%20%28Siege%20of%20Dragonspear%29\"&gt;Wardstone&lt;/a&gt;. She can then be attacked for no penalty. If you don't defeat the Mind Flayer first, any dialog options will lead to battle . She will summon one or two &lt;a href=\"Aerial%20Servant\"&gt;Aerial Servant&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0 for backup. From her corpse, the player can take 20 &lt;a href=\"Bullets%20%2B2\"&gt;Bullets +2&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Club%20%2B1\"&gt;Club +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Sling%20%2B1\"&gt;Sling +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Leather%20Armor%20%2B1\"&gt;Studded Leather Armor +1&lt;/a&gt;. Inside a locked and trapped (with &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;) chest in the room there is also a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;Detect Illusion&lt;/a&gt; and some valuables. If encountered prior to defeating the Mind Flayer, the player and party can flee the room and avoid killing Akanna. Once the Mind Flayer has been defeated, the player can return to the (still hostile) Akanna and charm her, then speak to her to receive thanks for saving the temple and receive the Wardstone passively. She can still be killed for no penalty after this.\nLaboratory.\nThe laboratory has containers filled with lootable potions; the party can acquire an &lt;a href=\"Antidote\"&gt;Antidote&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Health\"&gt;Elixir of Health&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Fiery%20Burning\"&gt;Oil of Fiery Burning&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fire%20Giant%20Strength\"&gt;Potion of Fire Giant Strength&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Potion of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Genius\"&gt;Potion of Genius&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Insight\"&gt;Potion of Insight&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Perception\"&gt;Potion of Perception&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Potion of Strength&lt;/a&gt;.\nSarevok's Secret.\nProgressing south brings the player past a curved wall. If they gained the quest &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%27s%20Secret\"&gt;Sarevok's Secret&lt;/a&gt; by finding the &lt;a href=\"Page%20from%20Sarevok%27s%20Notes\"&gt;Page from Sarevok's Notes&lt;/a&gt; in the secret room of &lt;a href=\"Korlasz%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Korlasz's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, this is where it can be completed. In the protruding wall are mounted six gigantic domino masks, in two rows of three. If the masks in the slots 3, 1 and 4 are pressed in that order (the upper row corresponds to masks 1-3, the lower to masks 4-6, both in a left-to-right order), a secret door will open and reveal a hidden room containing a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Aspect\"&gt;Shadow Aspect&lt;/a&gt;. If this powerful foe is slain, a locked and trapped chest can be looted for a unique book, &lt;a href=\"Godsbane%20%28book%29\"&gt;Godsbane&lt;/a&gt;, and the unique magical &lt;a href=\"Short%20Sword\"&gt;Short Sword&lt;/a&gt; +3 &lt;a href=\"Fractal%20Blade\"&gt;Fractal Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nReliquary.\nThe corridor ends in a chamber in the south, with a door in its north-west that opens into the Reliquary. This contains the source of the temple's downfall: a Mind Flayer named &lt;a href=\"Darskhelin\"&gt;Darskhelin&lt;/a&gt;, and its band of thralls - a former party of four adventurers, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Jhan%20Redmoons\"&gt;Jhan Redmoons&lt;/a&gt; (Enchanter), &lt;a href=\"Mohad%20Flintborn\"&gt;Mohad Flintborn&lt;/a&gt; (Berserker), &lt;a href=\"Shallen\"&gt;Shallen&lt;/a&gt; (Archer), and &lt;a href=\"Teth%20Se-Nehi\"&gt;Teth Se-Nehi&lt;/a&gt; (Kensai). At higher difficulties, there are also two &lt;a href=\"umber%20hulk\"&gt;umber hulk&lt;/a&gt;s waiting. All of them are hostile and will attack on sight. If defeated, their remains can be looted for 40 &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s +1, the unique amulet &lt;a href=\"Archer%27s%20Eyes\"&gt;Archer's Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe%20%2B1\"&gt;Battle Axe +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20of%20Defense%20AC%207\"&gt;Bracers of Defense AC 7&lt;/a&gt;, 20 &lt;a href=\"Dart%20of%20Stunning\"&gt;Darts of Stunning&lt;/a&gt;, the unique katana &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Dawn\"&gt;Crimson Dawn&lt;/a&gt; +2, a &lt;a href=\"Large%20Shield%20%2B1\"&gt;Large Shield +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Longbow%20%2B1\"&gt;Longbow +1&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Power\"&gt;Potion of Power&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Quarterstaff%20%2B1\"&gt;Quarterstaff +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Short%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Short Sword +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Leather%20Armor%20%2B1\"&gt;Studded Leather Armor +1&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Traveler%27s%20Robe\"&gt;Traveler's Robe&lt;/a&gt;. The reliquary also contains a lootable table (bearing a &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20%2B1\"&gt;Dagger +1&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Male%20Body\"&gt;Male Body&lt;/a&gt;) and a locked, trapped chest containing a Scroll of &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBefore the death of &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;, this hidden temple was dedicated to his glory, and attracted worshippers from the area around &lt;a href=\"Boareskyr%20Bridge\"&gt;Boareskyr Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. One day a team of Harpers invaded the temple, and it is hinted - in certain dialogue lines with &lt;a href=\"Madele\"&gt;Madele&lt;/a&gt; - that Gorion's Ward might have been one of the children they rescued from this place. After Bhaal's death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Cyric\"&gt;Cyric&lt;/a&gt;, worshippers of the new God of Murder stormed the temple and slaughtered its remaining faithful; only Madele remains of the original band of priests. Currently, the temple has come under stealthy attack by a &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Darskhelin\"&gt;Darskhelin&lt;/a&gt;, who was given complete information on the temple as revenge by Madele, and began preying on the temple's occupants, killing some and driving others to insanity.\nDuring the Shining Crusade of &lt;a href=\"Caelar%20Argent\"&gt;Caelar Argent&lt;/a&gt;, a Cyricist priest from this temple stole the &lt;a href=\"wardstone\"&gt;wardstone&lt;/a&gt; for the teleportation circle into &lt;a href=\"Bridgefort\"&gt;Bridgefort&lt;/a&gt;. A team of Crusaders that went looking for this wardstone has been imprisoned in the temple {&lt;a href=\"The%20Missing%20Patrol\"&gt;The Missing Patrol&lt;/a&gt; quest). This is when Gorion's Ward enters the temple."}

This means that accepting this offer will lock away any other &lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0options if available.\nBenefits.\nNext is a list of the events that take place after each week has passed (except during chapters 4 and 5 for obvious reasons).\nProblem one: The angry merchant.\nThe first problem to attend to is the matter of an angry merchant, &lt;a href=\"Tolmas%20Bendelia\"&gt;Tolmas Bendelia&lt;/a&gt;, who blames &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; for not policing the land suitably, as he was attacked by bandits whilst traveling through. He demands reparation and an assurance that this will never happen again, or else he will not only cease coming to the Keep's holdings, but he will also foreclose on any properties he owns here - and he has quite a number, as the Majordomo warns the player.\nThe dialogue options and outcomes for this quest can be found in the game file KPMERC01.DLG.\nDealing with the merchant.\nThe first test for the player requires a choice - how the party will react to the merchant's requests for reparations. They may choose to pay him either or , to send him away with nothing, or to have him executed. Paying will satisfy him and make no difference to the happiness of the peasantry. If the protagonist has a &lt;a href=\"Charisma\"&gt;Charisma&lt;/a&gt; score of 15 or higher, paying has the same effect. If the charisma isn't high enough, he won't accept and insist on the full payment. Refusing payment or having him executed will cause civil unrest towards \"Revolt conditions\" to increase by one point. \nSummary of options:\nThe choice of whether to have the merchant executed also affects the &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; bonuses from the second half. See below.\nDealing with the bandits.\nNext, the player has to choose what they will do about the bandits. They can either pay to get some expert mercenaries to clear them out (grants positive attitude), pay for some lower-skilled mercenaries who will winnow their ranks, but won't exterminate them (no bonus or penalty), or pay nothing (Revolt increases). If the angry merchant had been sent to be executed, then this step can grant experience points.\nSummary of options:\nProblem\u00a0two: The thieving guard.\n&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Cernick\"&gt;Captain Cernick&lt;/a&gt; has caught one of his guards, &lt;a href=\"Lastin\"&gt;Lastin&lt;/a&gt;, stealing money from the Keep's coffers. The player must decide how to deal with Lastin for this. You can have him executed immediately, expel him immediately, or ask for his side of the story. When asked, he will reveal that he was trying to raise money for expensive medicine needed for his wife to survive. At this point you may choose to pay for the medicine, which costs . Regardless of whether you help his wife, you can choose to have him executed, expelled, or forgiven.\nSummary of options:\nProblem\u00a0three: The priest of tempus.\n&lt;a href=\"Bolumir\"&gt;Bolumir&lt;/a&gt;, a wandering Cleric of Tempus, wants permission to set up a shrine in the Keep. The player is asked if they will allow this.\nProblem\u00a0four: Lord Roenall's demand.\nA &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Messenger\"&gt;messenger&lt;/a&gt; sent by the majordomo will inform you that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Farthington%20Roenall\"&gt;Lord Farthington Roenall&lt;/a&gt; has come to the Keep asking to speak to the player.\nIf the player refuses to see him, then one of his &lt;a href=\"Roenall%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; will enter and make a threat to Gorion's Ward, trying to intimidate the Ward into giving up the Keep, before leaving.\nIf the player sees him, again, Lord Roenall demands that the player surrender the de'Arnise Keep to him. The player may either acquiesce, losing their Stronghold permanently, or throw him out (continues the Stronghold storyline).\nProblem\u00a0five: The maid &amp; her suitors.\nOne of the Keep's maids, a woman by the name of &lt;a href=\"Chanelle%20the%20Maid\"&gt;Chanelle&lt;/a&gt;, is caught in a love triangle between the poor Ranger &lt;a href=\"Jessup%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Jessup&lt;/a&gt; (whom she loves), and the wealthy landowner &lt;a href=\"Malvolio\"&gt;Malvolio&lt;/a&gt; (whom she dislikes). Gorion's Ward is asked to resolve the matter.\nDeclaring she is to marry neither of them will make the peasants angry, increasing Revolt.\nDeclaring she is to marry Malvolio makes him offer you a \"gift\" of . Accepting, however, robs you of the 11500 XP you receive for refusing and makes the Revolt increase even further than the increase already provided by declaring Malvolio as Chanelle's husband.\nDeclaring she is to marry Jessup grants 15500 XP, but makes them mention that the \"old lord\" promised them a dowry. The player may give them either or for a favorable reaction from the peasantry; the bigger the dowry, the happier they people are with their generous new lord.\nProblem\u00a0six: The moneylenders.\nA pair of suspicious individuals have approached the castle, claiming to be moneylenders to whom the \"old lord\" owed . Whilst the Majordomo is convinced that their claims of a debt owed by the Lord of de'Arnise Keep are fraudulent, they do have friends who will apparently collect on debts owed by the local peasantry.\nThe player may pay either the full , or convince them to accept half that fee, both of which complete the quest but award no XP.\nAlternatively, the player may either throw the moneylenders out, or execute them, and then consider paying the debts of the peasants themselves:\nProblem\u00a0seven: The flood.\nA terrible flood has swept through the lands governed by the de'Arnise Keep. Four &lt;a href=\"Citizen\"&gt;representatives&lt;/a&gt; of the local farmers have come to seek financial assistance in restoring the ruined lands, as well as to ask for the new lord to build dikes to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\nIf the player accepts to pay it grants 15500 XP.\nIf the player offers to pay a portion it grants 4500 XP and asked how much to contribute:\nIf the player refuses to pay anything, then a serious amount of Revolt is gained.\nAfter this has been sorted, the player can either pay to build dikes or pay nothing (Revolt increases).\nProblem\u00a0eight: Invasion!\nLord Roenall finally makes his move, attacking the Keep with his forces. The player and his party must meet Lord Roenall at the gate and kill him to stop the invasion. Success in this completes the Stronghold Quest for de'Arnise Keep and awards the player 50000 XP. The player may also loot Lord Roenall's body for &lt;a href=\"Full%20Plate%20Armor%20%2B1\"&gt;Full Plate Armor +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Bastard Sword +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Large%20Shield\"&gt;Large Shield&lt;/a&gt; and some gold. If you kill his lackeys before you kill Roenall you can get two &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Mail%20%2B1\"&gt;Chain Mail +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20of%20Defense%20AC%208\"&gt;Bracers of Defense AC 8&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Wand of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Arrows of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Arrows of Ice&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a bunch of mundane equipment."}

They are not especially durable, but they can inflict considerable damage if they successfully pull off their Backstab. They can also &lt;a href=\"see%20the%20invisible\"&gt;see the invisible&lt;/a&gt; and have various immunities (follow the link for their &lt;a href=\"RING95.ITM\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; for more details).\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises these creatures. A SCS Thief AI script is assigned for smarter tactical behavior, threat recognition and opponent vulnerability assessment logic. The Fighter/Thief is now a kitted &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;. Weapon proficiency is changed to just one pip in short sword, as well as one pip in single weapon fighting style (which boost AC by 1 and critical hits on a 19). Not only that, but the target selection determined by the script looks for vulnerable party members - examples include: those with no stoneskins, those with no helmet critical hit protection, those not protected against magical weapons, and especially mages.\nThe Assassin has the following special assigned abilities and effects: Sees invisible creatures by script, starts the battle invisible, gets +1 THAC0 and +1 extra damage. The Assassin can use and will use the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Weapon\"&gt;Poison Weapon&lt;/a&gt; kit innate ability in combat. The potion of speed will be used to provide 4 &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;. If damaged over 50% the &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt; will be consumed. The thief can apply normal invisibility as required each round. In addition to this, the creature has SCS random treasures in their inventory.\nMore Rune Assassins are encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Azengaard\"&gt;Azengaard&lt;/a&gt; mod.\nSeveral additional enemy Rune Assassin guardians are summoned in the &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Rune%20Hideout\"&gt;Twisted Rune Hideout&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing the &lt;a href=\"Tactics%20for%20BG2EE\"&gt;Tactics for BG2EE&lt;/a&gt; mod."}

If any Crusader patrols are within view of the fight, they will turn the entire area hostile.\nA few rounds after Strunk dies, a &lt;a href=\"Nereid%20%28SoD%29\"&gt;Nereid&lt;/a&gt; will appear, having been seeking Strunk with the intent of slaying him for enslaving her elemental companions. If the player has not killed any of the water elementals, she will thank them for their mercy; the elementals will return to the Elemental Plane of Water and the nereid will reward the party with and the &lt;a href=\"Purification%20Stone\"&gt;Purification Stone&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, if the player has killed even one water elemental before she arrives, she will attack them in a rage; upon her death, she grants the party and drops the Purification Stone.\nAchievements.\nKilling Strunk will most likely prevent gaining the achievement &lt;a href=\"All%20the%20Enemies\"&gt;All the Enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nThis quest name is a play on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style\"&gt;Elements of Style by Strunk and White&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known manual of style for writing in English."}

The player needs to get the necessary items to enter the palace and then find, and defeat Irenicus.\nEnemy spawns and game difficulty settings.\nThroughout the city are placed hidden (not detectable by the player) proximity triggers that initiate spawned groups of enemies, and also NPC's in various sectors of the map.\nThe behavior of the game difficulty settings in an unmodded game are still applicable in Chapter 7 and all the encounters in Suldanessellar.\nHowever, the game will look at the total accrued experience assigned to the main character &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;, and that will determine the composition of spawn groups triggered in the city.\nMost likely, the PC will have accumulated over 2 million XP at this stage of the saga, and therefore the highest and most difficult numbers and creature type will be presented during the adventure here.\nIf the PC has less than 2M XP, there are actually three lower difficulty spawn tiers that are presented. In short, the actual game difficulty slider available to the player doesn't influence the determination of the spawned enemy groups. \nSee the Mod content section below - where this dynamic is changed.\nResting in the city.\nResting indoors in Suldanessellar is prohibited. The exception to this is The Palace interior.\nResting/camping outside is permitted but will be interrupted by attacking invaders - usually by &lt;a href=\"Maharajah\"&gt;Maharajah&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rakshasa\"&gt;Rakshasa&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nEven resting right next to Elhan at the city entrance platform isn't safe from being attacked/disturbed.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Rillifane\"&gt;Avatar of Rillifane&lt;/a&gt; has been awakened, and the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Spirit\"&gt;Guardians of Rillifane&lt;/a&gt; have been released into the streets, it is safe to rest in the city outdoor areas without interruption.\nGameplay/Walkthrough.\nEnter the city.\nGorion's Ward and company enters the gate leading to Suldanessellar revealed by Elhan in the Forest of Tethir. Elhan had preceded them in order to see for himself what had been wrought by Irenicus and the invading forces upon the elven city.\nA cutscene will play very soon after entering showing some animation of the tree top city, and then a Chapter 7 narration will occur. Afterwards, the party is adjacent to Elhan and some of his \"\"Elite War Guards\" on the entryway platform. Elhan speaks in his somber voice:\nThe PC may interject and ask a question here, perhaps trying find out the best way to proceed, or how to minimize damage to the city. Elhan will reply:\nWhen the PC replies, Elhan will send forth his guards ahead and say:\nAt this time the player's journal registers the &lt;a href=\"Getting%20inside%20the%20Palace%20in%20Suldenessellar\"&gt;Getting inside the Palace in Suldenessellar&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nThe House of the Horn.\nThe nearest structure to the entrance platform is north, from a relatively short pathway, labelled as &lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20the%20Horn\"&gt;The House of the Horn&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere aren't any spawned creatures to impede the party on the short journey to the building, nor any hostiles outside the building.\nTake the stairs up to the doorway and enter the house. See the House of the Horn link for what's inside.\nNorth past the House of the Horn.\nA pathway leading north from the House of the Horn id defended by an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;. An invisible or hidden party member could sneak past. Note the golem appearance in the basic game will be the same as a Adamantite Golem. The screenshot displays the &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;GCFS&lt;/a&gt; mod and the Icewind Dale Iron Golem sprite.\nThis creature is not affected by the instant slaying ability of the &lt;a href=\"Crom%20Faeyr\"&gt;Crom Faeyr&lt;/a&gt; war hammer. Other +3 enchanted weapons can strike it though.\nTaking out this construct is a good idea at the moment, so it can't respond to \"Calls for Help\" from other enemies on the map. Watch out for its innate &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Cloud\"&gt;Gas Cloud&lt;/a&gt; ability, as shown in the screenshot. Further north beyond the golem is &lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;The House of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; platform.\nTake the Northwest path.\nFrom the city entrance platform where Elhan is positioned - the party can move Northwestwards, perhaps heading toward &lt;a href=\"Demin%27s%20House\"&gt;Demin's House&lt;/a&gt; as a goal, as advised by Elhan.\nFurther down this path is a side pathway heading north - what's up that way?\nA hidden or invisible party member could scout up there and have looksee.\nThe side path leads to a dead-end circular platform with multiple golems stationed there (numbers and type determined by PC's XP level). \nIf any party members are detected, they will likely follow and attack mindlessly. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt; will haste themselves and other golems, so watch out for that. The &lt;a href=\"Adamantite%20Golem\"&gt;Adamantite Golem&lt;/a&gt; can take a lot of punishment, and dish it out too.\nAnother golem group by an unnamed house.\nThe party will find another group of various golems outside of an unnamed house, with a staircase leading to the roof structure.\nA hidden party member can avoid detection.\nThe composition of the hostile golem group is determined by the PC's experience point total. \nThese mindless automatons will follow and attack any detected party member. \nBest to take care of these threats and not leave them lurking in the city.\nAfter they are destroyed, consider having a look up the stairs and on the roof of the house.\nThe rooftop rescue.\nUp the stairs to the roof of the unnamed house reveals a roof garden of sorts in a gazebo.\nFortunately, no enemies are observed, however two frightened elven children are cowering here.\nA small female child &lt;a href=\"Girl%20%28Elf%29\"&gt;Girl (Elf)&lt;/a&gt; cries out in dismay as she sees the armed party member. \nHer &lt;a href=\"Boy%20%28Elf%29\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt; tries to soothe her that the party aren't monsters. These two are worried, and don't know where their parents are.\nIt's up to the party to decide how to handle this situation with dialogue. It would be best if they were told to hurry back to Elhan for safety.\nSouth platform troll battle.\nSouth of the unnamed house is a short walkway leading to a circular platform (a dead end).\nThe party observes an &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Battle%20Mage\"&gt;Elven Battle Mage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Warrior%20%28Suldanessellar%29\"&gt;Elven Warriors&lt;/a&gt; in combat with &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; invaders.\nHelp them out if you desire. Some XP can be had if you are able to defeat the trolls. The elves might be able to kill some of them.\nThe battle mage will know that fire is needed to take down the beasts. Don't get zapped by the &lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the trolls are dispatched the elves move on (they actually leave the map).\nTemple of Rillifane exterior.\nA group of rakshasa stand guard in front of the great doorways to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Rillifane\"&gt;Temple of Rillifane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe composition of this group is determined by the PC's total experience points.\nIt might be up to seven &lt;a href=\"Maharajah\"&gt;Maharajah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rajah\"&gt;Rajah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rakshasa\"&gt;Rakshasa&lt;/a&gt; enemies. \nApproaching in stealth is possible in the unmodded game. \nIf the enemies are able to spot the party, they will most probably get a few preliminary spell casts off at the outset of hostilities.\nThe raks will move toward party members to engage in swordplay - and probably cast offensive spells, as well as battlefield AoE attacks, like &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party is able to destroy these evil predators, the temple doorway can be opened, and may enter within when ready.\nIt may be prudent to anticipate that hostile forces are inside this temple.\nSuch an important facility was likely targeted by Irenicus's invaders.\nPreparatory spell casting and buffs could be a smart plan before moving inside.\nTemple of Rillifane interior.\nStepping inside the party quickly takes in the beauty of this house of worship to the leaf lord, Rillifane.\nHowever, the foul presence of a fiendish &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Glabrezu&lt;/a&gt;, a hulking &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Rakshasa\"&gt;Rakshasa&lt;/a&gt; - as well as an unknown mage - spoils the scene.\nBefore any action can be directed, the male human mage named &lt;a href=\"Suneer\"&gt;Suneer&lt;/a&gt; addresses the party. He seems impressed by the audacity of entering their conquered temple. \nExpect a fight over this area. Suneer has use of several dangerous spells. If the party is able to persevere, loot the mage's body. Of note is that the Altar to Rillifane is found inside the temple. You understand that this is where several artifacts must be placed in order to awaken the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Rillifane\"&gt;Avatar of Rillifane&lt;/a&gt;. Return to this temple when ready to execute that action.\nHouse of the Talisman.\nOutside a structure that hasn't been yet explored, the party is relived to no find any enemies.\nThe structure is labelled with two Automap notes.

Visit the link to see a description.\nThe Priest's House.\nThe party can climb the stairs outside the House of the Talisman to enter through the door to &lt;a href=\"The%20Priest%27s%20House\"&gt;The Priest's House&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee the link above for a description of what's within the second-floor house.\nElven warriors vs. skeleton warriors.\nA round platform in the southwest part of the city can be traversed by the party on the way to &lt;a href=\"Demin%27s%20House\"&gt;Demin's House&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party will first hear and then see a heated battle beginning which pits &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Archer\"&gt;Elven Archer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Warrior\"&gt;Elven Warrior&lt;/a&gt; forces against a trio of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party can lend a helping hand if they wish. When the skeletons are destroyed, any remaining elves will move out and disappear off the map.\nThe undead drop enchanted weaponry and sometimes have a &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt; and helmet.\nThe Harpist's House.\nAt some point the party will need to visit the Harpist's House.\nAs the party nears the structure, a confrontation between &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Warrior%20%28Suldanessellar%29\"&gt;Elven warriors&lt;/a&gt; and a mixed group of golems is seen.\nThe composition of the enemy golem group is determined by the PC's total accrued experience points.\nHelp out the elves, or they will eventually be killed. When the golems are destroyed, any surviving elves will move away and leave the map.\nEnter &lt;a href=\"The%20Harpist%27s%20House\"&gt;The Harpist's House&lt;/a&gt; when ready. See the link for what's inside.\nThe House of the Moon.\nFor quest completion purposes, the party must visit and enter The House of the Moon.\nAs the party approaches, they'll observe a confrontation between a &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Battle%20Mage\"&gt;Elven Battle Mage&lt;/a&gt; group and several &lt;a href=\"Rakshasa\"&gt;Rakshasa&lt;/a&gt; enemies.\nThe battle between the adversaries begins immediately. Both parties cast preliminary buffs. The elves shout oaths and battle cries at the rakshasa.\nIt may be necessary to intervene in this battle on behalf of the elves, as they are outclassed. Help them persevere by attacking the Rak's.\nAny surviving elves will leave after the battle and eventually move off the map completely.\nGather any dropped loot from the fallen elves and rakshasa.\nWhen ready, assemble the party and ascend the stairs on the exterior of the house.\nEnter through the doorway. See &lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;The House of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; page for what's within.\nDemin's House.\nThe party has been told by several elves including Elhan that the High Priestess Demin has important information to be had.\nWhen ready, visit her home. When the party nears the structure, they'll spot a &lt;a href=\"Nabassu\"&gt;Nabassu&lt;/a&gt; and a male drow mage patrolling outside the perimeter.\nAs the party draws closer the mage &lt;a href=\"Raamilat\"&gt;Raamilat&lt;/a&gt; will shout out a challenge if the party is detected. Even if hidden, the fiend can detect invisible or hidden party members.\nAfter some repartee, the mage and the demon attack. The drow will launch a series of protective buffs to begin the fight.\nThe mage is quite capable, so expect a challenge if he is able to get his buffs up. When defeated, he drops some gear.\nIt is time to take the stairs up to the house doorway, enter, and see what has become of the High priestess. See the &lt;a href=\"Demin%27s%20House\"&gt;Demin's House&lt;/a&gt; page for what's inside.\nThe Forest Clearing.\nAll the way to the western side of the city is a transition point to the Forest Clearing area. Several elves have given verbal clues that they have seen \"The Exile\" riding astride a great black dragon over the city.\nApparently, the clearing is where the dragon landed to discharge its passenger. The party must enter this place, as one of the three artifacts needed is likely here.\nWhen prepared, enter the clearing. Note, that the party can leave the clearing whenever they like, and reenter as well.\nDown a set of wooden steps, the party emerges in a small meadow surrounded by trees. Further along as the party edges forward a hulking black dragon faces the party eyeing you with interest.\nIf attacked from afar, the dragon will turn hostile. When within normal detection range, the black dragon will initiate contact with a guttural and booming challenge.\nSee the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Nizidramanii%27yt\"&gt;Nizidramanii'yt&lt;/a&gt; page for details of the encounter.\nApproach to the Palace gates.\nAdjacent to &lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;The House of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; is a large double gate that is locked. An &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Warrior\"&gt;Elven Warrior&lt;/a&gt; stands guard before it. Beyond the gate is a pathway to the Palace leading to the north.\nThe gate guard is concerned the party is an illusion. The Rakshasa often employs subterfuge and illusions to trick their opponents. This elf can be reasoned with. There are options to allay his fears. Letting him know that Elhan sent the party can help. Note that the party spokesperson's INT, WIS, and or CHA can influence the elf's decision to believe the party. If he believes the party, he will unlock the gate for you, and then move on to find Elhan.\nIf the party has already awakened the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Rillifane\"&gt;Avatar of Rillifane&lt;/a&gt;, which releases &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Spirit\"&gt;Elven Spirits&lt;/a&gt; into the city - then the elf will automatically recognize the help the party has helped provide aid and he'll open the gates for you. This is one way to get the gate opened if for some reason you failed to convince the guard earlier.\nThere is also a less obvious \"backdoor\" pathway to get near the palace without having to pass through the main gates. Over by &lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20the%20Horn\"&gt;The House of the Horn&lt;/a&gt; is a narrow meandering pathway that was quite possibly ignored by the party earlier. The downside of taking this path is missing out on the scripted plot events that are set up to be discovered if you take the \"correct\" path through the palace gates.\nThrough the first gate to the palace.\nMoving onwards the party observes a group of elves near a wonderful statue of an elven hero and a hound. One warrior is obviously prone and heavily injured, another stands nearby with bandages, also wounded. An attending elven female is administering healing, and an elven male dressed in high quality mail stands ready, looking at the party.\nSpeak with any or all of them if desired. They do not initiate conversation. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aduo%27on\"&gt;Captain Aduo'on&lt;/a&gt; for information about the city's battles so far. Talk with &lt;a href=\"Reirra\"&gt;Reirra&lt;/a&gt;, who can offer healing to party if required. Each &lt;a href=\"Wounded%20Elf\"&gt;Wounded Elf&lt;/a&gt; has some remarks about the difficulties and horrors they have endured.\nNorth of this group is another locked gate, and the Palace exterior is beyond.\nThrough the second gate to the palace.\nThis gate can be lockpicked, forced open with brawn, or a &lt;a href=\"Knock\"&gt;Knock&lt;/a&gt; spell will suffice.\nan &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Warrior\"&gt;Elven Warrior&lt;/a&gt; group is near the palace main doors and face an infernal &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt;. The party has arrived in the nick of time to lend a hand/sword and assist these valiant but probably doomed elves.\nWhen the fiend is destroyed, any surviving elves make their way off the map. Attempting to open the palace doors will result in a text message reading \"Locked\" unless the party has already awakened the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Rillifane\"&gt;Avatar of Rillifane&lt;/a&gt; earlier, who unseals the doorway. \nEnter the Palace.\nWhen ready to do so, the party can press on with its mission to find Queen Ellesime, The Tree of Life, and Irenicus. \nThe path to this goal lies within. See &lt;a href=\"The%20Palace\"&gt;The Palace&lt;/a&gt; page for what lies ahead.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes changes to almost all creatures found in this area. From new AI scripts, potion usage, to weapon proficiencies and fighting styles. Spell casters and creatures with innate abilities have revisions, including some with assigned kits, new spell books, and prepared sequencers and triggers.\nThe player's game difficulty selection AND the PC's total accrued experience points both influence the randomly spawned groups of Golems and Rakshasas in the city, differing in the tiers, numbers, and content of the enemy groups from those found the unmodified game. Instead of only four different group compositions, now there are seven."}

The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for him for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature\u2019s will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster.

This quest has three additional names depending on different stages, listed below as headers.\nJaheira Renounces her Harper Status.\nMeronia.\nRight after &lt;a href=\"Xzar\"&gt;Xzar&lt;/a&gt; is killed, and after &lt;a href=\"Lucette\"&gt;Lucette&lt;/a&gt; explains to the party why she killed him, &lt;a href=\"Meronia\"&gt;Meronia&lt;/a&gt; should appear (unless a particular bug is encountered--see the &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs\"&gt;\"Bugs\" Section&lt;/a&gt; below). \nMeronia informs Jaheira that her presence is required by the &lt;a href=\"Harpers\"&gt;Harpers&lt;/a&gt;, after which she explains it to &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; (it is recommended to reply with dialog option #1 and allow her to leave without complaint).\nGalvarey.\nSleep somewhere to trigger Jaheira's return, then accompany her to &lt;a href=\"Galvarey%20Estate\"&gt;Harper Hold&lt;/a&gt; (aka Galvarey Estate) in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Docks District&lt;/a&gt;, where the protagonist will be questioned by &lt;a href=\"Galvarey\"&gt;Galvarey&lt;/a&gt;. He sees what he wants to see, regardless of dialog choices. Soon it becomes obvious that he means harm to the &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt;. Stand with Jaheira and kill the twisted Galvarey () and his cohorts, &lt;a href=\"Bessen\"&gt;Bessen&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Iko\"&gt;Iko&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Kail\"&gt;Kail&lt;/a&gt; (), and &lt;a href=\"Nadinal\"&gt;Nadinal&lt;/a&gt; who wears a &lt;a href=\"Reaching%20Ring\"&gt;Reaching Ring of Wizardry&lt;/a&gt;.\nReviane.\nAfter some time has passed, perhaps a few days, &lt;a href=\"Reviane\"&gt;Reviane&lt;/a&gt; appears, backed up by a group of four other Harpers to call Jaheira into account for the events at Galvarey Estate. This encounter may happen anywhere in the wilderness, or within populated areas.\nWith a high enough reputation (16 or higher), and the right dialogue choices (1,2), Reviane can be convinced to stand down. Otherwise, prepare for battle. Beware of crossfire injuring innocents, if she appears within in a town or city, as this may cause other characters to join in the battle, including the Military. Reviane and her group are worth a total of if slain. There is no XP reward if combat is avoided.\nDermin.\nAfter more time has passed, perhaps three days, an old acquaintance of Jaheira named &lt;a href=\"Dermin%20Courtierdale\"&gt;Dermin Courtierdale&lt;/a&gt; appears, \"not...to rehash our friendship... I have been sent to kill you, or otherwise seek your downfall... you travel with a killer of Harpers... your own have died. What do you intend to do about it?\" This gives the \"killer of Harpers\" a chance to respond:\nChoose options 1, 2 or 4. Ultimately, Jaheira renounces her standing as a Harper, and she says goodbye to Dermin. Gorion's Ward then has a final dialog choice:\nChoose options 2 or 3. The player's Journal updates under \"Jaheira renounces her Harper status\" and Dermin leaves for now.\nThe Return to Harper Hold.\nSix days later Dermin\u00a0returns and warns that Jaheira's death has been arranged unless she goes with him, which she agrees to think about. The player's Journal updates under \"The return to Harper Hold\" and Dermin leaves again.\nUpon waking up, after resting the next time in the wilderness, the protagonist finds that Jaheira has departed. Soon a strange Mage named &lt;a href=\"Elminster%20Aumar\"&gt;Terminsel&lt;/a&gt; arrives with &lt;a href=\"Jaheira%27s%20Note%20for%20Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Jaheira's Note for [Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;] urging the ward not to follow, explaining why she has left, and her destination; Harper Hold. You can pickpocket Terminsel for &lt;a href=\"The%20Guard%27s%20Ring\"&gt;The Guard's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Protector\"&gt;The Protector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20to%20the%20Death\"&gt;Bracers to the Death&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Spirit%27s%20Shield\"&gt;The Spirit's Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to Galvarey Estate and deal with two groups of &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20%28Galvarey%20Estate%29\"&gt;Dermin's Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;. The first group of three Fighters is on the ground floor. Go upstairs to welcome Jaheira back to the party. Go to the dormitory and search the chests to finally solve the mystery of what happened to Montaron for 20,000 XP. Head back downstairs to deal with a second group (two Fighters, a Half-Orc Thief, a Cleric, and an Elf Mage). All mercenaries are worth a total of . Notable loot includes a &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20%2B2\"&gt;Dagger +2&lt;/a&gt;, a few +1 arms and armor, potions, and Well-Off to Wealthy &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random Treasure&lt;/a&gt; on each mercenary.\nThe Harper Plot Revealed.\nAfter at least two days, sleep eight hours outdoors. Dermin appears a third time, but now with backup: &lt;a href=\"Lennah\"&gt;Lennah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thenry\"&gt;Thenry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jeremon\"&gt;Jeremon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chrost\"&gt;Chrost&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaheira and him have it out with a war of words, then the battle begins. Afterwards, Jaheira seems quite upset about this recent turn of events.\nAfter a long, long time has passed since the battle with Dermin, Terminsel shows up again and asks Jaheira a series of questions. Jaheira's firm answers leads to:\nTerminsel's name is an anagram for... &lt;a href=\"Elminster%20Aumar\"&gt;Elminster&lt;/a&gt;. Impatient? Force Terminsel appear via &lt;a href=\"console\"&gt;console&lt;/a&gt;:"}

He'll say:\nWhen the party is ready to do this task, move to the east down a pathway and speak with the breachgnome. He'll say:\nYou may now enter the problematic mining shaft chamber.

See that creature's page for stats and information.\nIf the beast is defeated, then use the stoneshape scroll (activated from a party members quick item slot) and cast forth the magic. The scroll's power shakes the player's display screen image and seals the shaft for good.\nReturn to report your progress to Goldanader, who has some remarks and closing comments.

He'll know the party did it. He angrily says:\nIf the party decided to not help the gnomes with their problem, and just didn't do the quest, and or pickpocketed or killed Goldanderfor the light gem - then Adalon will know this, and comment on it when the party visits her.

{"id": "14290", "revid": "283752", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14290", "title": "Swashbuckler", "text": "Swashbucklers are melee combat specialized thieves. Please see &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt; page for the basic thief information which will not be redundantly listed here.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantage:\nComparisons to similar class roles.\nIn a departure from the norm, this page begins by explaining the reasons not to choose the Swashbuckler class kit, followed by the niche of this beloved class's benefits. Skip to equipment section if other classes and in-depth game mechanics\u00a0are already\u00a0well understood.\nIf high melee damage is the goal.\nMany new players fail to realize that it is possible to have multiple attacks per round (APR) and that warrior classes get an extra .5 attack at levels 7 and 13 and an additional .5 attacks at 2 and 5 points of &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20proficiency\"&gt;Weapon proficiency&lt;/a&gt;. This means that a warrior can get 4 attacks per round dual wielding their proficient weapon types\u00a0compared to a Swashbuckler's 2 attacks per round. With even a &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; of 19 the bonus of +7 damage makes the extra attacks per round far more important\u00a0than a\u00a0Swashbuckler's damage advantages (until Swashbucklers get more attacks as discussed in equipment section). The &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; cap of 10 for thieves compared to warrior classes THAC0 of 0 roughly negates\u00a0the to-hit bonuses a Swashbuckler gets.\nIf tanking physical damage\u00a0with 100% magic resistance is the goal.\nA Swashbuckler may eventually wear any armor after taking the high level ability &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt;. While a Swashbuckler's\u00a0-9 bonus to AC of is a boon when also trying to wear equipment towards other effects such as 100% magic resistance, a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt; class can get 100% magic resistance and with buffs hit the -20 AC (+&lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; adj.) cap as well. The Swashbuckler kit does not get extra hit points from a &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; score above 16 nor physical damage reduction like &lt;a href=\"Hardiness\"&gt;Hardiness&lt;/a&gt;. So Swashbucklers must (or get to) use scrolls, item effects, or even traps, before physical damage boss fights (until their AC bonuses are high enough to achieve an effective 95% damage reduction as discussed in equipment section).\nReasons to choose Swashbuckler.\nThe best reason for a thief, is that they can open any lock guaranteed and pickpocket many valuable items (such as &lt;a href=\"Twinkle\"&gt;Twinkle&lt;/a&gt;) making them very useful to a party. The bonus XP from thieving actions, the trap detection and disarming, the\u00a0incredibly powerful Detect Illusion skill (usable in combat), the endless supply of potions and gold from &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, and the infinite spells from recharging &lt;a href=\"wands\"&gt;wands&lt;/a&gt; (by selling to and buying back from\u00a0vendors) make a thief worth having.\u00a0If not wanting to waste time micromanaging hiding in shadows for sneak attacks, then the Swashbuckler is the perfect thief choice. Also, while &lt;a href=\"Assassination\"&gt;Assassination&lt;/a&gt; may be chosen only once by other thieves, &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Whirlwind Attack&lt;/a&gt; may be chosen multiple times allowing superior bursts of melee damage even against targets that are immune to back-stab.\nUnlike Monks (&lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; restricted), Swashbucklers gain access to &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Evasion\"&gt;Greater Evasion&lt;/a&gt; which allows for the best saving throws in the game. Swashbucklers may also select any race such as &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Halfling\"&gt;Halfling&lt;/a&gt;s to get benefits like -5 to Death/Wand/Spell &lt;a href=\"%22Shorty%22%20Saving%20Throws\"&gt;\"Shorty\" Saving Throws&lt;/a&gt; bonuses (helpful against special abilities and area of effect (AoE) magics which are unhindered by magic resistance).\nThe ability to deal comparable melee damage to that of any other class (with proper gear as explained below) without having to put more than 2 points into a weapon skill, allows for the most diverse offensive playing style of any martial class. Trap laying, the use of magical items/arrows, the ability to cast any spell from scrolls or wands, and the ability to equip items normally class and alignment restricted further extends the range of possibilities beyond what any other single class can\u00a0come close to doing.\nEquipment Section and Recommended Proficiency Points.\nImportant Offense Equipment.\nSince lack of attacks per round (when not using &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Whirlwind Attack&lt;/a&gt;) is the biggest issue for Swashbucklers' damage:\nImportant Defense Equipment.\n-24 or -25 &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;AC&lt;/a&gt; (-20 general cap plus &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; bonus) will not be hard to achieve by mid game for a Swashbuckler, especially with &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Evasion\"&gt;Greater Evasion&lt;/a&gt;. Any creature with -4 or -5 THAC0 will be unable to land a blow without a critical hit then.\nTable for experience, weapon proficiency points and hitpoints.\nFor more information, see &lt;a href=\"Experience%20tables\"&gt;Experience tables&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a number of gameplay revisions and changes to all Rogues, including their kits. It is a comprehensive modification to nearly all aspects of the Rogues (Bards and Thieves) abilities and strives to bring them closer to their Pen and Paper AD&amp;D counterparts. New and revised abilities are included, as well as new equipment and rogue specific items. Separate user installed components are available to customize selection of content and changes. Go to the link for further information.\nThe Mod addresses Swashbuckler in many different aspects, including:\nSwashbuckler\nThe Swashbuckler kit now uses the Fighter's THAC0 advancement table (i.e. THAC0 improves by one point at each level up) when wielding melee weapons, as described in the \"Complete Thief's Handbook\" 2E AD&amp;D supplement. Note that this trait replaces the \"+1 to hit per 5 levels\" bonus which was present in the unmodded game. Furthermore, Swashbucklers no longer receive an innate damage bonus, cannot dual-class to Fighters (they can still dual-class to Mages or Clerics though) and can no longer benefit from an increase to the backstab multiplier provided by items (such as the revised Short Sword of Backstabbing). The updated kit description reads as follows:\nSWASHBUCKLER: This rogue is part acrobat, part swordsman and part wit: the epitome of charm and grace.\nAdvantages:\n- Gains +1 bonus to armor class for every 5 levels\n- Uses the Fighter's THAC0 progression table while wielding melee weapons\n- Can specialize in any melee weapon that a thief can use\n- Can acquire the Whirlwind ability at higher levels\n- Can acquire the Insightful Strike ability at higher levels\nDisadvantages:\n- Cannot backstab\n- Cannot dual-class to a Fighter\n- Cannot acquire the Assassination ability\n- Cannot acquire the Crippling Strike ability\nInsightful Strike (replaces Scribe Scrolls, Swashbuckler only)\nAn experienced Swashbuckler can use the knowledge of his opponent's weak spots to gain an advantage in combat. During the round when this ability is activated, the Swashbuckler receives a +5 bonus to his critical hit rolls and deals maximum damage with each attack."}

{"id": "16361", "revid": "35642161", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16361", "title": "Sword Coast Stratagems", "text": "Summary.\nSword Coast Stratagems (SCS) adds about 90 optional components to (including ), , , &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20Trilogy\"&gt;Baldur's Gate Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"BG1%20Tutu\"&gt;Baldur's Gate 1 TUTU&lt;/a&gt;, mostly focused around improving monster AI and encounter difficulties, but also including a number of cosmetic and ease-of-use components, tweaks to abilities and spells, and a full implementation of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-stratagems.html%23iwdspells\"&gt;Icewind Dale spell system&lt;/a&gt; in Baldur's Gate. On the lowest difficulty settings, SCS mildly improves the intelligence and immersiveness of the game's enemy AI (and makes full use of the Icewind Dale spell system or the Spell Revisions spell system, if you have them installed). At higher difficulty settings, you should notice enemies behaving much more intelligently and realistically. \nMod Description.\nOverview.\nSword Coast Stratagems is a collection of mini-mods for Baldur's Gate series of games. It is compatible with the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate I and II, the original edition of Baldur's Gate II with the Throne of Bhaal extension, with the \"EasyTUTU\" conversion of Baldur's Gate to the Baldur's Gate II engine, and with the 'Baldur's Gate Trilogy' and 'Enhanced Edition Trilogy' combinations of the two games. (It is not compatible with the original BG1, or with the original BG2 without Throne of Bhaal.)\nSword Coast Stratagems contains many optional tweaks to various aspects of gameplay, including a full implementation of the Icewind Dale spell system, but at its core it is a tactical/AI mod. It carries out a fairly systematic restructing of the games' core artificial intelligence, affecting spell and proficiency choices, kits, high-level abilities, and most importantly enemy AI scripting, with a full install rewriting the AI of practically every creature in the game, though in most cases without significantly affecting their core abilities. It further offers a large number of tailored components that modify individual set-piece encounters at various points throughout the two games. The idea throughout is to make combat more challenging, interesting, and most importantly immersive and realistic, insofar as that can be done with a 1990s-vintage game engine - I focus on trying to get enemies to use their abilities intelligently and effectively, and in the harder parts on making moderate changes to their powers and spells, rather than the brute-force method of increasing hit-rolls, saving throws and the like.\nSince there are a lot of tactics mods out there, of very different styles, it's probably simplest to describe the distinctive features of SCS. (I don't want to suggest that all of these are automatically advantages: there are lots of different styles of play, and different mods fit different people.)\nOverall, playing SCS shouldn't exactly feel like a whole new game - it should feel like the old game, but with your foes acting much more intelligently and realistically.\nSCS also makes a number of small tweaks to the spell system, all intended to modify the game in small ways that are helpful from the point of view of tactical challenge - some make the game a little easier, others make it a little harder. These spell tweaks are installed by default since the AI scripts assume that they are present, but advanced users can deactivate them. (See under Spell Tweaks for the details, and under Customisation for how to fine-tune them.) If you are playing with Spell Revisions, almost all of the tweaks are skipped.\nSCS also incorporates, as an optional component for the Enhanced Edition only, most of the new spells in Icewind Dale, which will be used intelligently by the AI if they are installed.\nFinally, SCS contains a few miscellaneous tweaks to gameplay, a few ease-of-use features (notably, an ease-of-use player AI script with a large number of convenience features) and a few \"flavour\" features that don't really affect gameplay but hopefully aid the feeling of immersion in the game world.\nInstallation.\nBatch mode installation option.\nSCS, like any multi-component mod, normally asks about a component, installs it, then asks about the next component. Since some of SCS's components can take a while to install, this can be tedious. Version 34 ships with an experimental 'batch mode': if you select this (by installing the 'batch mode' component, which should be the first component offered to you) then SCS will ask about all components first, then install all of them. After you've done this, a file (stratagems.bat) will be created in the weidu_external/batch subfolder in your main game folder; clicking on it will uninstall and reinstall all your chosen options. Batch mode is currently only available for Windows installs (basically because I don't know how batch files work in OSX or Linux and don't have a testing environment for them).\nSpecial Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG.\nGood Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1\"&gt;Modmerge&lt;/a&gt; on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod."}

They are fairly rare, usually only found within the depths of various forests, and are distinguishable from their brethren by way of a blue body with black legs.\nGameplay.\nLike most spiders, they are immune to &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;, yet lack the gradual &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; that most other spiders are known for. Instead, this spider is naturally under a &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Normal Haste&lt;/a&gt; effect, granting it 5 &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest course of action for the player is to distract the spider using a companion with a high AC vs piercing attacks and focus fire with the rest of the party. Most specimens encountered in-game are pre-generated, meaning that there likely won't be a consideration made for the strength of the player, making for a very difficult fight regarding unprepared low-level parties.\nSummoned.\nSword spiders can be summoned by a 12th or higher level &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; casting the 4th level Wizard spell &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Spawn\"&gt;Spider Spawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayer controlled Sword Spiders can be extremely effective against enemy Mages. With four attacks per round they quickly chew through &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;s, and then continue to interrupt enemy spell-casting with consecutive hits."}

It is a number that represents the chances that a physical attack hit its target. Lower numbers are better.\nHow it works.\nEvery time a creature makes a physical attack, the game simulates an attack roll, which is the roll of a 20-sided die. A roll of 20 is always a successful hit, a roll of 1 always a miss. Otherwise, the minimum roll required to hit successfully is obtained by subtracting the target's &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; from the attacker's THAC0.\n Attack roll \u2265 THAC0 - AC\nFor example, a character with a THAC0 of 17 trying to hit a target with an AC of 1 needs a roll of at least 17-1=16 to succeed. This is a chance of 5/20, or 25%. A character with a much lower THAC0 of 5 trying to hit the same target needs a roll of at least 5-1=4. This is a chance of 17/20, or 85%.\nCombat log.\nThe game has an option that displays information on to-hit attempts in the combat logs. It can be enabled through the Options menu, Gameplay section, Feedback subsection. Once done, the logs will show information on attack rolls:\n Attacker name: A + B = C : Hit (or Miss)\nWith A being the number rolled by the 20-sided die, and B the static bonuses to the attack roll. The higher the resulting C is, the better for the attacker.\n\"Check the for an in-depth view of what\" codice_1 \"contains, and the top of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forums.beamdog.com/discussion/comment/1020831/%23Comment_1020831\"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for what is done with\" codice_2\".\"\nWith the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/Argent77/A7-HiddenGameplayOptions/releases/tag/v4.1\"&gt;hidden gameplay options&lt;/a&gt; mod, the detailed modifiers affecting B can be shown in the combat log by installing \"Show extra combat info\" and then activating it in the game options (\"Gameplay &gt; Feedback &gt; Feedback Messages)\".\nWays to use it from a player's perpective.\nAs a player trying to assert which kind of AC I can reasonably hit, I could reword the equation to:\n THAC0 \u2264 AC + Attack roll\nIf I am only ready to accept missing about once out of seven attacks against AC -10 (~85% chance to hit), that means I need to aim for the following THAC0:\n AC + (1 - Desired_Chance_To_Hit) x 20 + 1 = THAC0 \n -10 + (1 - 0.85 ) x 20 + 1 = -6\n85% chance to hit AC -10 will be achieved if I can reach -6 THAC0.\nSimilarly, as a player trying to assert which kind of AC I need in order to reasonably resist against a given THAC0 value, I could reword the equation so that it describes to-miss rolls rather than to-hit. To miss, AC needs to be:\n AC &lt; THAC0 - Attack roll\nIf I am only ready to accept getting hit once out of five against opponents with THAC0 7 (80% chance to miss), that means I need to aim for the following AC:\n THAC0 - Desired_Chance_To_Not_Be_Hit x 20 - 1 = AC\n 7 - 0.8 x 20 - 1 = -10\n80% chance to make a THAC0 of 7 miss is achieved if I can reach -10 AC.\nTHAC0 Progression.\nTHAC0 improves by leveling up the character. \nThere're four different THAC0 progression rates by &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; level:\nRegardless of a creature's THAC0, in Second Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a roll of 20 is always a critical (guaranteed) hit while a 1 is always a critical miss, both are 5% chances.\u00a0 See the &lt;a href=\"Critical%20hit\"&gt;Critical hit&lt;/a&gt; article for more details.\nThe previous progression rate gives the following table for THAC0 progression (note, that there are no further changes from level 22 on):\nSeveral classes and kits gain additional THAC0 bonuses beyond their base group:\nThe following classes and kits gain additional THAC0 bonuses against specific enemies:\nRacial bonus.\nElves get a THAC0 bonus of 1 when using &lt;a href=\"longbows\"&gt;longbows&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Composite%20longbow\"&gt;composite longbows&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Shortbow\"&gt;shortbows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"short%20swords\"&gt;short swords&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Long%20Swords\"&gt;long swords&lt;/a&gt;. Halflings get a bonus to &lt;a href=\"slings\"&gt;slings&lt;/a&gt;.\nImproving and worsening THAC0.\nBeyond simply leveling, THAC0 can be improved in a number of ways:\nTHAC0-boosting equipment.\nNot included in the table above is the upgraded version of the scimitar &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Brand\"&gt;Spectral Brand&lt;/a&gt;, which has a daily charge\u00a0ability that will improve THAC0 by 10 for 3 rounds. Also not included, the composite longbow &lt;a href=\"Heartseeker\"&gt;Heartseeker&lt;/a&gt;, which has a daily charge ability that will improve ranged THAC0 by 7 for 1.5 rounds.\nSituational THAC0-boosting equipment.\nItems above, including weapons, give THAC0 bonuses to both hands when dual wielding.\nWith the exception of the Gauntlets of Crushing, these situational THAC0 bonuses are all applied through a somewhat unusual status effect called &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/opcodes/bgee.htm%23op178\"&gt;\"THAC0 vs. type bonus\"&lt;/a&gt; (ID 178), which is a THAC0-equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Damage%20vs%20type%20bonus\"&gt;Damage vs type bonus&lt;/a&gt;. An attack roll cannot be modified by more than one \"THAC0 vs. type bonus\". So for example if an attacker is currently benefiting from a -2 THAC0 bonus vs. Evil, a -3 bonus vs. Chaotic and another -5 bonus vs. Evil, and they're all applied through effect 178, then only one of these three bonuses will boost THAC0 against a Chaotic Evil defender. It is likely going to be the oldest effect to be evaluated by the game among equipped items.\nTHAC0-degrading spells.\nDegrade Thac0 due to &lt;a href=\"Blinded\"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt; effect (-4), not cumulative:\nBGWiki writing formats.\nOn Baldur's Gate Wiki, THAC0 value in , if not specified, is always the THAC0 after applying the class bonuses, but before &lt;a href=\"Ability%20Scores\"&gt;ability scores&lt;/a&gt; and other factors, as shown in &lt;a href=\"Near%20Infinity\"&gt;Near Infinity&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a creature with a THAC0 of 6 wields a weapon with \"THAC0: +2\" in its in-game description, the adjusted value will be 6-2=4, for this reason, weapons' \"THAC0: +n\" and all kinds of THAC0 or to-hit bonuses from any other sources will be written as -n bonus, where \"n\" is the positive integer, and vice versa."}

When Ao discovered the Tablets of Fate were missing, he summoned all the deities and asked for those guilty to hand them over. When no one stood forward to admit to stealing the Tablets, Ao cast down all the gods from the heavens, taking their divine power in the process. None of the gods was allowed to return until the tablets were found. Ao tasked &lt;a href=\"Helm\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt; with guarding the Celestial Stairways, which would lead the deities back into their divine realms.

However, if the party asks about the demon's reference to the \"Blood War\", then more info can be gained, and the demon will give some background about their situation. \nIf the \"player1\" is of Chaotic Good, Neutral Good, or Lawful Neutral &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; - just as the demon appears to be asking for some kind of favor or to make a bargain, it'll say:\nAnd hostilities will begin.\nOn the other hand, if \"player1\" isn't good aligned or lawful neutral, Tahazzar will say:\nIf the party declines, then hostilities ensue. Or the party may inquire about any reward, and the demon will say:\nIf the party agrees to do the task, then the player's Journal will receive a new quest entry titled &lt;a href=\"The%20Blood%20War\"&gt;The Blood War&lt;/a&gt;. See that page for further information.\nTahazzar and demons are hostile.\nIf hostilities break out, then expect this Balor to cast several spells, depending on how quickly it is engaged. As long as Tahazzar is still functioning it can cast spells from its scripted arsenal of magic. See the InfoBox for a summary.\nGoing into melee combat with the demon can be hazardous, as it has a modest chance of striking a &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Kill target&lt;/a&gt; vorpal blow that will destroy the target (if gore is enabled in the player's game options it will \"chunk\" the character's body - no resurrection is possible).\nIf the party's level is at least 16, or if 18, then Tahaaar can create several more tanar'ri allies including &lt;a href=\"Maurezhi\"&gt;Maurezhi&lt;/a&gt; or another &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep/ToB%29\"&gt;Glabrezu&lt;/a&gt; allies, but not if the player has their game difficulty selection below \"Core\".\nWhen the demon is slain, the party can retrieve two items from its twitching body, one of which is needed to complete the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Radiance\"&gt;Scepter of Radiance&lt;/a&gt;. \nNotes.\nIf somehow (it is possible) the party has first encountered &lt;a href=\"Ka%27rashur\"&gt;Ka'rashur&lt;/a&gt; before Tahazzar, then a new dynamic will present in dialogue options. For instance, the party may already possess &lt;a href=\"Ka%27rashur%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Ka'rashur's Heart&lt;/a&gt;. Or the party already made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Baatezu\"&gt;Baatezu&lt;/a&gt; to obtain Tahazzar's heart, and therefor already has an entry in The Blood War quest. These divergent paths are anticipated and dialogue options to further the story are present in the game.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises Tahazzar, especially with the \"Improved Fiends and Celestials\" component. The demon is now a level 24/24/24 Hit dice creature and casts all spells at those levels. A revised AI script is installed with completely changed smarter and adaptive tactical behavior in combat.\nA revised repertoire of Innate, Wizard and Cleric spells is substituted for use, including: &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Stun%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Stun (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, innate \"Teleport Without Error\", &lt;a href=\"Implosion\"&gt;Implosion&lt;/a&gt;, innate &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, innate &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Domination%20%28Innate%29\"&gt;Domination (Innate)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese spells are \"ForceCast\" and generally aren't interruptible and almost instantly deployed. Some of these spells are cast \"at will\" and are launched when certain targeting criteria are met. Implosion and Firestorm are only useable once per rest.\nAs a Balor, Tahazzar will be wreathed in continuous &lt;a href=\"Aura%20of%20Flaming%20Death\"&gt;Aura of Flaming Death&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the demon has two weapons, the vorpal attack slashing flaming sword, and a +5 enchanted flail whip in the shield hand. The whip will strike once per round and can instill some negative status effects. SCS makes these demon attacks respond to weapon proficiency skills, and Tahazzar has five pips in both weapons he wields (similar to a long sword and a flail - think \"Balrog\" from the Lord of the Rings). The end result is more attacks per round, better THAC0 and damage.\nWith the SCS mod, it also changes the \"automatic kill\" dynamic of the demon's vorpal hit, and now allows a saving throw vs. Death at -4 penalty to negate.\nAnd finally, Balors with SCS get a +2-movement modifier as well as additional immunities to several spells, and status effects."}

His abnormal behavior shows signs of some sort of mental affliction. He's calling himself Yakman as well. Just who is this Yakman? Why is he here? How did he arrive?

{"id": "8111", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8111", "title": "Tanova", "text": "Tanova is a female &lt;a href=\"Vampires\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; and controlled by her mistress &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other vampires, she can cast spells in certain situations, making her a larger threat. Tanova will lead other lesser vampires from &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Vampire%20Coven\"&gt;Bodhi's Vampire Coven&lt;/a&gt; and will be encountered several times until she is permanently destroyed.\nRandom Encounter.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%202\"&gt;chapter two&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%203\"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; she will appear randomly around Athkatla between midnight and dawn and question your allegiance. She is well informed and lying to her will not help if you have already taken sides and decided on the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thieves&lt;/a&gt;; in which case she and her cold-blooded lesser vampires will become hostile. If you have no immunity to &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; this will likely be a very short fight (and not in your favor) as she will drain 4 experience levels at a time with a successful hit (and the accompanying vampires 2 levels at a time).\nIf you decided to go with supporting Bodhi's Vampire Coven, then your lies will be interpreted as an act of loyalty as surely you were trying to keep your involvement with Bodhi a secret.\nIf you haven't sided with either of them yet, (the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%27%20Guild%20Stronghold\"&gt;Thieves' Guild Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; does not count as allegiance to the Shadow Thieves, nor does having rejected Bodhi's offer) then you can claim this in dialogue, and she'll just warn you to not become an innocent bystander while she hunts for prey. But if you claim that you work for the Shadow Thieves, she and her company will attack the party.\nChapter Three.\nIf you sided with the Shadow Thieves in chapter three, when &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt; orders you to destroy the rival guild, she will be guarding the corridor to the \"room of blood and blades\" inside &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Bodhi's Hideout&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and she can be lethal to an unprepared party. Now she has the ability to cast spells with the trade-off being that she has lost her immunity to +1 and normal weapons and her physical abilities are reduced to that of a mage, losing 10 points of strength and 9 points of dexterity. In most aspects she is a level 16 spell caster now, with fledgling vampire attack and immunities. \nTanova will instantly self-buff with &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Electricity%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Protection From Electricity&lt;/a&gt; when a party member is detected.\nDepending on her ability to survive and being disrupted from spell casts, she will later add to or refresh those protections with &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt;. \nOffensively, the vampire will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Symbol, Stun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt; if she is silenced, &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; if an enemy is hidden/invisible, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; (which conjures an 8th level spell caster with female vampire animation) that initiates its own self buffs. \nIf able, after the simulacrum is created, Tanova will attempt to go invisible with a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;. Then further offensive oriented spell casts will be attempted, such as &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Fear%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word, Stun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt;. If an opponent has Spell Turning active she will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt; to remove it.\nIf Tanova's physical form is destroyed, she'll change into a gas cloud and flee the battlefield. She does not retreat to a coffin like &lt;a href=\"Durst\"&gt;Durst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gellal\"&gt;Gellal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lassal\"&gt;Lassal&lt;/a&gt; in this encounter. In fact, she will be present again in yet another iteration in Chapter 6. \nChapter Six.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%206\"&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/a&gt; Tanova will be in Bodhi's Hideout, along with &lt;a href=\"Hareishan%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Hareishan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meredath\"&gt;Meredath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salia\"&gt;Salia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valen\"&gt;Valen&lt;/a&gt;, five &lt;a href=\"Fledgling%20Vampire\"&gt;fledgling vampires&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Guard%20%28Vampire%29\"&gt;vampire guard&lt;/a&gt;; all of whom are defending Bodhi's inner sanctum from being accessed by &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and party (and some helpful allies). Once again Tanova's physical attributes are changed, as her strength is no longer 10, but up to 18/76. \nStrangely, she is also reduced to 8 Hit Dice, no longer has a mage class and cannot cast spells nor use any vampire innate abilities, can be struck with normal weapons and is nothing more than a basic melee attacker at this point. Although her combat capabilities are less than her previous Chapter 2 Random Encounter form, her touch attack can now drain 3 experience levels on each successful hit. If she can detect an enemy in range, she will move toward it and engage. That's all she can do. \nMod Content.\nMods:.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod with the \"Improved Vampires\" component revises all three appearances of Tanova. There is a stark contrast in tactical intelligence and capabilities from the unmodified game versions, and Tanova is a worthy opponent with this mod in place. See the &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; article and the \"Mod content\" section for a discussion of the mod's revisions to vampires (including Tanova) in the game.&lt;br&gt;\nWith SCS and the \"Improved Vampires\" component installed here are some notes specific to Tanova:&lt;br&gt;\nRandom Encounter version \u2014.\nTanova (version VVTANOV.CRE) is a level 13/13 Fighter/Thief with 147 HP. Her melee attacks (she has two quick weapons) that are +4 enchanted items and either drain 4 levels or 3 points of CON. Constitution loss lasts 300 seconds and will display \"Drinks Blood\". Has the innate &lt;a href=\"Domination%20%28Innate%29\"&gt;Vampire Domination&lt;/a&gt; gaze attack. New THAC0 is 3. She can shape change to bat or wolf form and summon bats/rats/wolves. +3 Enchanted weapons are needed to hit her. Watch out for her \"Cloud of Bats\" attack.\nChapter 3 version \u2014.\nTanova (BODTAN.CRE), is now a level 16/16 Conjurer/Vampire. She has 140 HP, STR 22, DEX 21 and CON 20. She is able to conduct 3 touch attacks &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;, THAC0 0, Armor Class -2. She regenerates as a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Ancient%29\"&gt;Vampire (Ancient)&lt;/a&gt; with 2 HP per second. Can only be struck with +3 or better enchanted weapons. Her melee attacks drain 2 levels or 3 CON. She uses the SCS \"Smarter Mage\" script and the \"Improved Vampire\" scripts in combination. Her AI script will pre-battle buff (cast previously) such as &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;. She'll also fire off the prepared sequencers and triggers as follows:&lt;br&gt;\nAn entire spell book of level 1 through 8 level mage spells are memorized and scripted for use, leaning in favor of school varieties.\nChapter 6 version \u2014.\nTanova (C6TANOV.CRE ) is similar to the Chapter 3 version with some differences. She is now a level 16/16 Base mage/vampire with 150 HP. Her Armor Class is -4. Her melee attack can drain 4 experience levels or 3 CON. She'll use the SCS \"Smarter Mages\" AI and the \"Improved Vampire\" scripts in combination.\nTanoval will open up with a slew of protective buffs when the enemy is detected. Her AI script will pre-battle buff (cast previously) such as Mirror Image, Improved Haste, Shadow Door, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Spell Immunity (Divination), Shield, Stoneskin, and Non-Detection.&lt;br&gt;\nHer spell casting will be different in terms of scripted spell choices, and has new prepared sequencers/triggers as follows:&lt;br&gt;\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod or &lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Dale\"&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/a&gt; spells installed, Tanova will use both of those spell versions. Examples include substituting \"Battering Ram\" for \"Gliiterdust\" and \"Dispelling Screen\" instead of \"Spell Immunity\". \"Icelance\" will substitute for \"Melf's Acid Arrow\" with IWD spells installed."}

Regardless, Tazok will be encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Temple of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the game whether he died or not.\nTazok's stats in the Bandit Camp are different from those when he's encountered in the Temple of Bhaal. The infobox mostly lists those later ones; divergences follow:\nThe original game's expansion \"\" improves Tazok's combat behavior, which is carried over into the Enhanced Edition: he now is able to shout for help or assist allies if they were shouting.\n\"Shadows of Amn\".\nDuring \"\", Tazok is found in &lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Firkraag's Maze&lt;/a&gt; which is located in the &lt;a href=\"Windspear%20Hills\"&gt;Windspear Hills&lt;/a&gt;.

Tazok will muster his &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt; ability at the outset of hostilities.\nThe mod provided a &lt;a href=\"HELMNOAN.ITM\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; to protect against critical hits, and Tazok now has 5 pips in two-handed sword weapon proficiency, as well as 2 pips in two-handed fighting style. This will improve his THAC0, weapon damage, speed factor, and critical hit chances. With the enrage ability, this will improve even more, plus protection from many status effects. With the Oil of Speed applied he may get as many as 4 attacks per round.\nTazok will be wielding the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Blade\"&gt;Dragon Blade&lt;/a&gt; if the &lt;a href=\"Importing\"&gt;Importing&lt;/a&gt; criteria is met - and if so, will gain the benefits of that weapon in combat.\n\"Throne of Bhaal\".\nTazok does not appear in the Throne of Bhaal, but he is referenced to by a script that handles the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28area%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane challenges&lt;/a&gt;, in his case specifically the second one, '. However, only his death is checked, and in the ' the related name comment is given as &lt;a href=\"Tamoko\"&gt;Tamoko&lt;/a&gt;. The latter appears in a cutscene during this challenge.

Tazok will muster his &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt; ability at the outset of hostilities.\nThe mod will label the creature as \"Tazok\" on the battle map. After the Enrage ability is mustered, Tazok will also launch &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt; as well as three uses of &lt;a href=\"Power%20Attack\"&gt;Power Attack&lt;/a&gt;.

As the name suggests, this is the most religious part of Athkatla. There are &lt;a href=\"temples\"&gt;temples&lt;/a&gt; worshipping &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Helm%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Lathander%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Lathander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Talos%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. The southeast quadrant is dominated by the &lt;a href=\"High%20Hall%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;High Hall of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt;, a Knightly Order. To the northeast is the &lt;a href=\"Pimlico%20Estate\"&gt;Pimlico Estate&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Guarded%20Compound\"&gt;Guarded Compound&lt;/a&gt;. Beneath the district are &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Sewers&lt;/a&gt;, accessed by one of three entrances along the bridges that connect all other buildings.\nThe Eyeless Prophet.\nUpon entering the district for the first time, an unavoidable cut-scene occurs with &lt;a href=\"Gaal\"&gt;Gaal&lt;/a&gt; who is both an iconoclast and a prophesying proselytizer. On the one hand he denounces all the Known Gods of &lt;a href=\"Faer%C3%BBn\"&gt;Faer\u00fbn&lt;/a&gt;, including the three major Temple District sects, &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Helm%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Lathander%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Lathander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Talos%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. He further declares that &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; are charlatans, and their powers do not derive from the \"so-called\" gods, who do not exist at all, but rather that they simply use &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, much as any &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; would use. The purpose? To fool the common people into donating their wealth to build their temples and support their clergy. On the other hand, he declares that the \"one true religion\" comes from his own god, the &lt;a href=\"Unseeing%20Eye\"&gt;Unseeing Eye&lt;/a&gt;. With yays or nays from citizens, peasants, and hecklers, &lt;a href=\"Dawnmaster%20Kreel\"&gt;Dawnmaster Kreel&lt;/a&gt;, a priest from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Lathander%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Temple of Lathander&lt;/a&gt;, stands in opposition to Gaal's supplications. Gaal then urges his new acolytes to follow him. Some citizens remain where they are, others wander off or follow Gaal.\nAfter the cut-scene, a priest of the same basic &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; will ask the protagonist to follow along to a temple to discuss what is required.\nIf it is Oisig, he will insist:\"This must not come to pass. The everseeing eye of Helm must be made aware of what they intend. You there. You have the look of a man/woman of faith. I would ask a service of you. If you perform well, you may gain the favor of the Temple of Helm. Follow me to the temple of Helm. I will discuss what is required of you there. Do not take too long; Helm requires you now.\"Ultimately, this scene is a precursor for the quest to &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20and%20Destroy%20the%20Cult%20of%20the%20Eyeless\"&gt;Investigate and Destroy the Cult of the Eyeless&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you choose to pursue this quest or not, an entry is made in your Journal, titled A Cult of the Eyeless?\"Some form of new religion or cult has been formed in the city, centered on a god called 'the Unseeing Eye'. A priest of some kind whose own eyes were missing spoke to a crowd, calling on them to shed their 'false sight' and join in the worship of this new god.\"\nSewer Access.\nAlthough there is one exit from the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Sewers&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20District\"&gt;Bridge District&lt;/a&gt;, the only way to enter the sewers is by three entrances here in the Temple District:\nContainers.\nThere are only three containers in this district; none have locks, traps or alarms."}

The building interior has a rectangular shape, its entrance located on the southern edge of the screen, with the temple's altar to the north. The western and eastern walls are decorated with lines of giant-sized statues of scythe-wielding robed figures. The eastern wall is also lined with stone sarcophagi which spawn &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Horror\"&gt;Battle Horror&lt;/a&gt;s where one draws near them. The symbol of Bhaal, a skull encircled with bloody tears is depicted in the middle of the area and is heavily trapped.\nIn this temple, the final battle of the &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; takes place, the battle against &lt;a href=\"Sarevok\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt; as well as his three closest followers &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Dosan\"&gt;Angelo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tazok\"&gt;Tazok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Semaj\"&gt;Semaj&lt;/a&gt;. The four are standing at the four edges of the altar to the north and are initially covered by a fog of war effect. Crossing the temple to engage Sarevok in combat is a difficult task, as the whole temple is filled with traps.\nStrategy.\nTraps.\nA map of all traps in this temple is available in the sidebar.\nThe only detectable traps in the room are two Lightning Bolt traps on the southwest side, and eight traps on the symbol of Bhaal in the center of the room. Of these, the only two which can be disarmed are the Lightning Bolt ones, which require rank 50 &lt;a href=\"Find%20Traps%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Find / Disarm Traps.&lt;/a&gt; Before moving to the north to begin the battle, it is wise to disarm the Lightning Bolt traps and detect the traps on the symbol so the party is at least aware of their location and can avoid them for the duration of the fight. The small \"blood drop\" parts of the symbol fire an arrow, and two separate sections of the skull cast &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull Trap&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong the east side of the room approaching the sarcophagi are four non-detectable traps that summon Battle Horrors. One additional trap of this sort is at the top northwest corner of the room. It is notable that these traps are not triggered if the party member crossing them is &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a series of five long, horizontal &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; traps in the approach to the altar at the north end of the room where Sarevok waits. However, these traps are unique in that they cannot be detected nor triggered by the party, only by NPCs, including the &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s roaming the area. In spite of this, they will still \"target\" the party when any party member is in visible range. The best way to deal with these traps is to walk through the room slowly, getting them in visible range without revealing Sarevok or his companions, and wait for a bat to trigger them. Once they have been activated, they will not trigger again.\nCombat.\nSarevok and his companions are high-level characters and dangerous opponents. A stealthy approach dealing with the traps as described above instead of direct assault is highly advisable. &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;'s party should try to lure the enemies one by one by appearing just on the edge of their sight range and quickly retreating towards the entrance. Using this tactic will guarantee that the party is not overwhelmed. To beat the game one has to defeat only Sarevok and given that this is the final battle chances are the party will already be at their experience cap and won't need the experience from killing Sarevok's goons.\nTazok can be seen, lured to the entrance, and killed, and the party will still be able to leave the room. However, it is not possible to leave the Temple once Sarevok has been spoken to, although Semaj can still be lured to the entrance and killed without Sarevok following. It will not be possible to save the game once this has been done, however, unless you have also defeated Sarevok.\nOne way to make the final battle easier is to lure Sarevok outside the temple and fight him in a six-on-one battle (not counting any random enemies that might spawn). Once you are inside the temple choose one character who has an area-of-effect attack, such as &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Wand of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, and is hastened (either by item or spell). Have that character move close to the altar but stay \"out of Sarevok's line of sight\", in order to not trigger the conversation. Use Fireball (or an item) to hurt Sarevok. This will cause him to attack the character, but will \"not\" trigger the conversation. Immediately pull your character back to the entrance, and then have all six characters leave the temple. Sarevok will follow them outside and trigger the conversation. After that fight him as normal.\nIf you do it this way the final cutscene will not trigger when Sarevok dies. Enter the temple once more and then it will trigger, after a short wait of a few seconds.\nEaster Egg.\nThe mural on the altar floor is taken from Fra Angelico's The Last Judgement portraying hell. The real and complete painting (tempera on panel) can be seen in the museum San Marco in Florence."}

It is currently presided over by a high priestess matron mother and handmaidens of Lolth linked to House Despana, the most influential House in Ust Natha.\nUpon entry to the temple, the party's nostrils fill with the slightly acrid and sickly-sweet aroma of strange spices - intermingled with the faint pall of smoldering incense. A barely discernable rhythmic chant can be heard from unknown chambers below.\nThe tall ceilings disappear into the shadows, where black eyes glisten from hundreds of fist-sized spiders above - eerily accompanied by arachnoid chittering and clicks. \nGrotesque and lurid frescoes on the walls depict &lt;a href=\"Drider\"&gt;Driders&lt;/a&gt; on the hunt, and scenes of surfacers being slaughtered. The intricately placed tiles and mosaic floor decor is stunningly detailed.\nGameplay.\nThe temple of Lolth is staffed by various guardians, and one Handmaiden of Lolth. The treasury doors are locked inside, with sentries posted. \nAll interior drow are currently neutral to visitors, and they do not seek out or initiate interaction. Speaking with the various creatures within nets the party mostly polite but stern comments that make it understood that this temple is not a tourist destination, and no funny business is tolerated. Causing any trouble or initiating hostile actions would be foolish.\nUnlike temples on the surface, the temple of Lolth in Ust Natha has no attending cleric to administer temple services.\nIf the party is visiting the temple because Phaere has told you that Matron Mother Ardulace wants to speak with Veldrin, see the note below:\nThe Treasury room.\nSpecial mention to the treasury room is made here. The room cannot be accessed without a special key obtained from Phaere. \nThere are two unique Egg Guard sentries posted at the foot of a small staircase leading to the room. The guards will become hostile if attacked, or if the treasury door is opened with the key. If the treasury door is opened and the guards are then made hostile because of this action, that does not mean the entire temple or city of Ust Natha will also become hostile. These guards can be bypassed with stealth (and left in a hostile state) or even better, slain. \nIntuitively this may seem impossible, as an alarm would be raised, right? Well, no it does not. If the guards are attacked without the key in possession of the party, then the guards will become hostile and trip the city-wide alarm. Also, if for some reason the city alarm has already been triggered, then these guards will be hostile too, just like almost all other drow Ust Natha inhabitants.\nIf entry is made into the treasury chamber, the guards become hostile, and a number of golems are observed within. The golems are not hostile until the container within has been pilfered of the contents - which are the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Eggs\"&gt;Dragon Eggs&lt;/a&gt;. Removal will make the golems hostile, and they will attack any detected intruders. If the party wishes to dispose of the golems then they can be fought and destroyed. Alternatively, the party could maintain stealth throughout the pilfering process, say with &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, or re-apply &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; after the eggs are taken - and then move outside the chamber, close the door behind, and just flee the area. There is more than one way to crack an egg. \nMod content.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod all the guards, except the &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Guard\"&gt;Egg Guard&lt;/a&gt; sentries, are assigned smarter AI scripts as well as revised weapon proficiencies and fighting styles commensurate with their class and experience level. The Hand Maiden of Lolth will use appropriate spell buffs if hostilities break out. Note that the \"Seek and Destroy\" scripts given to many golems in the game by SCS aren't used in this Temple, for plot mechanic reasons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod makes changes to the guardian golems in the temple treasury. Instead of the ordinary Stone and Clay golems, two are replaced with \"Greater\" Stone and Greater Clay Golems. These new varieties make for a tougher and harder hitting challenge. The Clay golems still use &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Haste\"&gt;Golem Haste&lt;/a&gt;, and the Stone use &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Slow\"&gt;Golem Slow&lt;/a&gt; innate abilities. The mod has some surprising \"On hit\" effects by these golem types not seen in the unmodified game. "}

One way to deal with the interruptions is to use &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;'s fast casting &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Light%20Wounds%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Cure Light Wounds (ability)&lt;/a&gt;, if they have it. \nAnother tactic is to cast multiple healing spells from more than one party members at the same time, if the party has the resources to do so.\nFurther within the temple is a non-obvious container that holds a healing spell scroll which can be used for this purpose as well (and a spell cast from a scroll cannot be interrupted).\nOnce the manifestation is suppressed and temporarily banished by the healing action, the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Amaunator\"&gt;Avatar of Amaunator&lt;/a&gt; will appear and address the party."}

As they weigh a combined 400 pounds, they may need to be moved one at a time or by different characters.\nJunia will then ask that &lt;a href=\"Tharantis\"&gt;Tharantis&lt;/a&gt;, brother of Kendra, be notified of her passing. He is standing guard inside the walls of the fort, through the exit to the southwest. His feelings can be handled a number of ways, but eventually he will ask after his sister's golden necklace, which was not on her body, and Junia will need to be asked about it.\nWhen Junia is told of the missing jewelry, she will reveal that she has been suspicious of a supposedly cleric of &lt;a href=\"Chauntea\"&gt;Chauntea&lt;/a&gt; that vanished around the time the drawbridge was drawn up, and suggests the party go look for him in the forest to the east of Bridgefort.\nDuring the conversation, Junia is pressed, she will start making some mistakes regarding her faith in &lt;a href=\"Lathander\"&gt;Lathander the Morninglord&lt;/a&gt;, which she claims is due to exhaustion. If is a Paladin or Cleric or &lt;a href=\"Glint%20Gardnersonson\"&gt;Glint&lt;/a&gt; is in the party, they will be able to point these out, eventually culminating in her revealing her allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Velsharoon\"&gt;Velsharoon&lt;/a&gt; and summoning 3 &lt;a href=\"BDWIGHT.CRE\"&gt;Wight&lt;/a&gt;s. When killed, she too will become a &lt;a href=\"Junia%20%28ghoul%29\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce killed a second time, the party will only have to talk to Tharantis, which while leaving much of Junia's actions and motivations a mystery, will skip to the end and the &lt;a href=\"%23reward\"&gt;reward for this quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party heads north and then west from the forest side of the teleport circle, they will be able to see &lt;a href=\"Ymori%27s%20Body\"&gt;Ymori's Body&lt;/a&gt; in a small clearing. If the body is picked up, it will animate into a &lt;a href=\"BDYMORI\"&gt;Wight&lt;/a&gt; and 6 &lt;a href=\"ZOMBIE.CRE\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s will erupt from the ground and attack. After being re-killed, there will be &lt;a href=\"Ymori%27s%20Head\"&gt;Ymori's Head&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kendra%27s%20Chain\"&gt;Kendra's Chain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Herdrin%27s%20Short%20Sword%20%2B2\"&gt;Herdrin's Short Sword +2&lt;/a&gt;, on the ground.\nIf either &lt;a href=\"Edwin\"&gt;Edwin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt; are in the party, they will recognize the signs of &lt;a href=\"Velsharoon\"&gt;Velsharoon&lt;/a&gt;, a deity of dark magic and a patron of necromancers, on the corpse.\nReturning to Junia, she explains that Ymori was the cultist of Velsharron and the one stealing from the dead, so she had to kill him and cleanse the area of his foulness. If the explanation is accepted, it's time to return to Tharantis, and gain your &lt;a href=\"%23reward\"&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf instead one of the multitude of conversation topics is chosen that accuses her, Junia reveals her allegiance to Velsharoon and summons 3 &lt;a href=\"BDWIGHT.CRE\"&gt;Wight&lt;/a&gt;s. When killed, she too will become a &lt;a href=\"Junia%23Wight\"&gt;Wight&lt;/a&gt;. Any difficulty of this combat is offset by the nearby &lt;a href=\"Frair%20Tajik\"&gt;Frair Tajik&lt;/a&gt;, who immediately begins casting beneficial spells, first on himself, and then those that will affect the party, including &lt;a href=\"Chant\"&gt;Chant&lt;/a&gt;.\nReward.\nTalking to Tharantis will offer a range of choices that will determine the reward. Giving back the necklace without mention of a cost will gain and +1 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt;. If instead, money is demanded, he will offer and a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Petrification%20%28protection%20scroll%29\"&gt;Protection From Petrification scroll&lt;/a&gt;, and the party will still gain the experience but lose 1 Reputation. If THAT offer is declined, the Reputation loss still occurs, no experienced is gained, and Tharantis attacks, as well as three other &lt;a href=\"Bridgefort%20Defender\"&gt;Bridgefort Defender&lt;/a&gt;s, one of which is in a tower and cannot be manually targeted.\nGoading Tharantis into attacking is the only way to keep the necklace with it's +5% resistance to slashing, as the necklace is not placed in his inventory, so it cannot be pickpocketed or taken from his body later."}

The spell is pretty clear that the wizard eschews any activities that aren't of a berserk physical attack while transformed. Part of the spell casting process requires consumption of a Potion of \"heroism\" (or \"superheroism\"). See the external links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects, and description. See below:\nTenser\u2019s Transformation\nLevel: 6\nSchool: Alteration\nRange: Personal\nDuration: 1 round/level\nCasting Time: 6\nArea of Effect: Caster\nSaving Throw: None\nTenser\u2019s Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power. For when the mage casts the spell, he undergoes a startling transformation which alters his body and his mind into that of a warrior. The wizard gains 2 hit points per caster level (up to a maximum of 40), and all damage he sustains comes first from the magical points gained. The armor class of the caster is 4 better than he possessed prior casting the spell, and all attack rolls are made with the THAC0 of a fighter of the same level as the caster. The mage gains extra attacks as a fighter of the same level, thus an extra half attack per round at 7th level and another half attack per round at 13th level. Furthermore, each attack is made at +2, each successful hit in combat inflicts an additional 2 points of damage and saving throws against death/poison are made by the caster with a +4 bonus, but casting speed is penalized by 2 and saving throws against spell are made by the caster with a -2 penalty.\nNote: this spell does not give any extra attacks to multiclassed or dual-classed fighter/mages, as they normally gain additional attacks per round due to their fighter levels."}

However, if you have already spoken with Firebead, then he'll know that you are looking for Firebead's scroll.\nNotes.\n=Chapter Six=\nDuring chapter six, Tethtorial is encountered three different times; the first time is inside the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;, the second is during the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; cut scene, and third time is during the parties escape through the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Catacombs\"&gt;catacombs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nLibrary.\nWhen you return to Candlekeep in chapter six, Tethtoril is found on the sixth floor of the library in the bedroom to the right of the stairs. He will approach the party upon sight and speak of items left for you by Gorion (although you may have already spoken with &lt;a href=\"Piato\"&gt;Piato&lt;/a&gt; on the fifth floor and have these items in your possession). And although Tethtoril mentions that he'll speak with you again later in regards to your father, he has no more to say until the barracks cut scene.\nBarracks Cut Scene.\nThe cut scene begins with the party locked up in the jail cell. &lt;a href=\"Ulraunt\"&gt;Ulraunt&lt;/a&gt; enters and formally accuses you of murder and states that you are to be sent to Baldur's Gate where your punishment will be handed down. After he exits the scene, Tethtoril will enter the building and speak with the party during your wait in the cell. When the dialogue ends, he'll teleport the party down to the catacombs located beneath the keep.\nDialogue.\n\"Hello young one, I am sorry to see thee in such terrible circumstances. I know thee well enough to see that you have been falsely accused. Tomorrow Ulraunt will most likely sentence thee to be sent to Baldur's Gate. There, thou wouldst receive the death penalty for these actions. I know that Gorion would not want to see his only child killed a scant few weeks after his own death. 'Tis as a favor to his memory that I will help thee escape. Make thy way through the catacombs beneath the library, but disturb them not. I have your possessions with me, you must take them and go with haste.\"\nCatacombs.\nTethtorial is finally encountered on the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Catacombs%20Level%202\"&gt;second level&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Catacombs\"&gt;catacombs&lt;/a&gt; that are located beneath the citadel. He is standing in a wide hallway along with Gorion and &lt;a href=\"Elminster%20Aumar\"&gt;Elminster&lt;/a&gt;. During the dialogue with Elminster, he will try to add credence to the convincing tale (which does contain minor elements of truth) Elminster and Gorion are spinning concerning the reappearance of Gorion here in the catacombs and the evils that have befallen you in your return to Candlekeep. However, it all leads to naught as all three of them are really &lt;a href=\"Doppelganger\"&gt;doppelganger's&lt;/a&gt; in disguise and all dialogue leads to them revealing their true form and attacking the party."}

The door faces eastward towards the water. He can forge any item more than once, provided he has the base component, however, the game typically only provides one of each, except for the &lt;a href=\"Ankheg%20Shell\"&gt;Ankheg Shell&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nInitiate conversation with Cromwell to find out what smithing services he offers.\nHe can sort through your gear and inventory to assess if there are any components or items that he can reforge or create. If he finds an item that he knows how to improve, but the party is missing a component, he'll tell you what is needed (but not where it can be found).\nIf an item can be upgraded, and the components are possessed by the party - then Cromwell will tell you how much he'll charge and how much time it may take. The party can agree or decline for now. Cromwell strangely knows if you don't have enough gold on hand.\nStealing items from Cromwell can be attempted but if caught might foul up the relationship with him for later. The city guards may respond to theft in his smithy. \nMod Content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"The%20Tweaks%20Anthology\"&gt;The Tweaks Anthology&lt;/a&gt; mod will add Allow Cromwell to Upgrade Watcher's Keep Items (\"BG2EE, EET, BG2, BGT\") \nThis component will allow Cromwell to forge items found in Watcher's Keep using the same formulae as &lt;a href=\"Cespenar\"&gt;Cespenar&lt;/a&gt;. (Note that only the formulae using items you can legally obtain in SoA are implemented; if you cheat in a component from Sendai's Enclave you'll still be out of luck.) This component will allow the party to obtain some high-level items in Shadows of Amn, so be warned that this may ruin the balance in SoA and make the remainder of the game fairly easy. The component will make one minor tweak to Cespenar as well--normally, he can only add the electric head to the Flail of Ages after the poison head has been attached. This component will allow him to add the heads in any order. \nAdjust Cromwell's Forging Time (\"BG2EE, EET, BG2, BGT\")\nWhen you commission Cromwell for a special item, he says the forging will take a day to complete. In BG2, the forging is actually instant and in BG2EE the forging actually takes 24 hours (16 hours of work plus 8 hours of sleep). This component allows you to choose the length of forging time to be instant (like BG2), a full 24 hours (like BG2EE), or a third option that takes a workday (eight hours) to forge items.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; Mod allows Cromwell to upgrade various items added to the game by this Mod. You'll need the correct components and pay a fee as usual.\nYou can still install the classic (with fixes and modernization) and mostly workable Item Upgrade Mod.

You have the option to accept or ignore this. The exact wording of accepting mercy is for her to \"Give us all of your possessions and then get out of my sight\". This will place the diary and letter into the inventory of one of your characters. If you decline and kill her, these items will be found on her body.\nIf you offer her mercy, she will attempt to walk into the side room and disappear, while walking, she will remain a hostile target. As she has very low health it is very easy to \"accidentally\" kill her at this point. If you do so, the diary and letter will not be on her body as she will have already handed them to you.\nDialogue.\n\"Mmmmm... so you've come back. If you were smart, &lt;GORION'S WARD&gt;, you would have left well enough alone. I don't know how you escaped my lord's trap at Candlekeep, but you won't be getting any farther than here. Why did you come back here? I would have thought that you'd go after Sarevok directly?\""}

Dalok has 1 pip in club weapon proficiency and 1 pip in single weapon fighting style.\nThe Druid will most likely open with a defensive buff and then either a &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Fire%20Elemental\"&gt;Conjure Fire Elemental&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Insect%20Plague\"&gt;Insect Plague&lt;/a&gt; spell. &lt;a href=\"Call%20Woodland%20Beings\"&gt;Call Woodland Beings&lt;/a&gt; will happen later, if able. It is probable that a &lt;a href=\"Call%20Lightning\"&gt;Call Lightning&lt;/a&gt; spell will be attempted to make the battlefield hazardous. If necessary, Dalok will conjure a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Blade\"&gt;Flame Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and then engage in melee combat. \nWith SCS, Dalok is also equipped with a Shapeshift token, allowing instant shifting into a Bear, Great Cat or Wolf. All forms have additional advantages and some limitations. This ability can't be prevented or disrupted.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod will change the spells to the SR versions, which in general, are much improved for Druidic magic over the unmodified game versions."}

It is the main way to kill a &lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt;.\nInflicted for the most part by , &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"traps\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; or other abilities, it can be further divided into 10 main damage types independent from one another: Slashing, Crushing, Piercing, Missile, Fire, Cold, Electricity, Acid, Poison and Magic.\nThe first four types are regrouped under the notion of &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt; due to their unique role. The next five are conceptually seen as &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20damage\"&gt;Elemental damage&lt;/a&gt;, functionally identical to the last one, &lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;Magical damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreatures can or be to one or several damage types.\nStunning damage.\nStunning damage refers to what is known as \"nonlethal\" or \"fist\" damage. It is a cousin of &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt;, affected by codice_1 and codice_2 (as granted by &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%20of%20the%20Hills\"&gt;Destroyer of the Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roranach%27s%20Horn\"&gt;Roranach's Horn&lt;/a&gt;, for example).\nStunning damage is almost exclusively caused by unarmed attacks. Where all other damage types would kill a creature as they lower its &lt;a href=\"hit%20point\"&gt;hit point&lt;/a&gt;s below 1, that one can only bring them \"to\" 1, making the victim fall unconscious for a short period instead of dealing a killing blow.\nMagical cold and Magical fire damage.\nThe games sometimes refer to Magical cold or Magical fire damage, and even grant resistances to them. But in fact, nothing in the Baldur's Gate series ever causes such damage. They can be flat out ignored.\nFor , be wary about using them in the original edition. According to the &lt;a href=\"IESDP\"&gt;Infinity Engine Structures Description Project&lt;/a&gt; (IESDP), killing a creature with either of these two damage types could crash the game at least in the first opus. This shouldn't be an issue in &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;s and in fact some mods did start using them.\nDamage roll.\nMelee attacks against unarmed creatures or creatures using ranged attacks get an additional 4 points of damage. This bonus applies even against critters like &lt;a href=\"Ankheg\"&gt;Ankheg&lt;/a&gt;s when they keep using their ranged attack as party members reach them.\nFor weapon attacks, a detailed breakdown of the damage roll and modifiers can be shown in the combat log with the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/Argent77/A7-HiddenGameplayOptions/releases/tag/v4.1\"&gt;hidden gameplay options&lt;/a&gt; mod, by installing \"Show extra combat info\" and then activating it in the game options (\"Gameplay &gt; Feedback &gt; Feedback Messages)\".\nAn explanation of the modifiers that appear in the combat log with this option (critical hit damage is not included, so double the result in case of a critical hit):"}
{"id": "4316", "revid": "254731", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4316", "title": "Damage Control", "text": "Reduction and avoidance of damage is often given more scope than damage output. The trend in more recent games is towards more weapon or magic types and abilities\nHealing.\nIn the early part of Black Isle's Fallout series, the power of healing items in inventory was balanced with a cost of Action Points; players had to allocate resources between damage output and damage control; it cost points to use items, and points to access the Inventory. Diablo and Diablo II sped things up considerably, increasing damage while removing any tactical cost for using healing items. The only resource required is game money, and healing potions can be used almost instantaneously and infinitely. PS:T likewise is fast damage. As in Fallout, a similar tactical resource, namely time, is required to use items from the 'quick' inventory, but access to the main inventory is almost unrestricted, if the spacebar or Autopause functions are used to pause the game. Healing others with items again takes time, but items can be traded from one character to another within a wide radius, and the recipient can use the item(s) on themselves, all while the game is paused.\n&lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s use &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; to heal. Potions and the magic berries created by Druids can heal as well, the latter being very good at avoiding Overkill.\nSome weapons confer a heal-on-hit ability - notably the Sword of Chaos, 2HE\u00a0(BG2) which is found from completing a quest for a genie in the confines of Irenicus' dungeon in chapter 1, and Adjatha the Drinker, LS (BG2) which is used by the Warden in the Planar Prison (Five Flagons Inn)\nRegenerative items provide significant healing value out of combat such as the ring of regeneration, or Kangaxx' ring. The former of which can be (with mod packs) rebuilt into more useful rings with AC/saving throw bonuses. Some weapons also provide regenerative abilities which do not require landed hits such as the Axe of Unyeilding.\nLastly, while not exactly a healing 'item' but provides regenerative polymorphs should also be listed. The cloak of sewers, for example, which allows a troll shapechange can refill HP in a few minutes of unpaused gametime.\nDamage avoidance.\nTemporary Hit Points.\nSpells such as 'Cloak of Warding', 'Aid',\u00a0'Tensers transformation'\u00a0and 'Vampiric Touch'\u00a0provide extra hit points in a few different (and stackable) methods with tensers transformation doubling the hitpoints of the mage, which, when paired with an item like the girdle of fortitude can produce a near 200HP tank with stoneskin and all the other magical immunities (protection from normal/magical weapons, protection from normal missiles, fire/cold resist, improved mantle, etc.). However, they only exist for the duration of the spell, and then expire. If damage is sustained while they are active, they are used up as and before normal HP.\nResistance bonuses.\nThere are\u00a0a few ways to increase resistance bonuses in\u00a0BG and in Torment. In BG2, some characters have built in resistances that pair with shortcomings in stats, for example Haer Dalis has significant resistances to counter his low (9) constitution score. The PC gains some bonuses to resistances in the final chapter regardless of class.\u00a0\nIf a barbarian is chosen as PC, resistances to physical damage are gained at various levels confering a total of 20% resistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt; is the obvious choice to boost resistances in early game (5% at level 1, 10% at level 5, 15% at level 10 etc. )\nMany magical items provide non-physical damage resistances such as 40% fire resistance, or 25% fire/cold/acid resistance.\nArmor Class bonuses.\nSpells such as 'Armor' and 'Shield' increase the Armor Class of the target temporarily, making for a chance of damage being negated altogether (enemies missing). Items increase it while equipped, and a few rare permanent bonuses can be acquired throughout the game.\nArmor Class is cumulative with dexterity bonuses, armor, rings, weapons, shields\u00a0or other\u00a0magical items which increase the Armor Class.\nThe Armor Class\u00a0is added to 'to hit' rolls, if a 10 or above is rolled the target is struck, 20's or 19's and 20's in some cases when mastery with a weapon is applied will always hit.\nCrowd Control.\nTrue Crowd Control (CC) removes enemies' capacity to fight or move temporarily\nFinesse.\nWorking the game code to achieve a reduction in the number of enemies or the damage they inflict is more effective in Torment than in other games, and more necessary due to the scarcity of true Crowd Control options.\nAggression.\nThe code that directs monsters to pursue and attack targets, and choose which particular players or characters to attack first, is sometimes called Aggro, a British slang term which entered some games, with roots in the word Aggression.\nMonsters may be given a code which counts the number of hits, amount of damage, distance to targets, and other factors, to make them decide who they should be attacking.\u00a0In BG2, there are three types of AI, the first is a 'rigid thinking' type of behaviour which often accompanies other berserker attributes (high hit rate, high strength, low THAC0, some spell immunities) and generally means that as soon as a target is identified, that is the \"only\" target. This type of behaviour is exceptionally easy to outmanoeuver via &lt;a href=\"%23Kiting\"&gt;Kiteing&lt;/a&gt; around grouped\u00a0 friendlies, forming blockades, or by trapping the berserker. The second type of AI is adaptive and chooses new targets which are selected based on proximity to the attacker. The last type of AI is intelligent and varies between choosing weakened targets for power word type spells, to choosing targets with lower overall HP as the target of high damage spells which should produce a kill (i.e abi-dalzim's horrid wilting vs. a low hp mage), to using an appropriate casting selection, i.e. removing magic prior to casting confusion (remove stoneskin then confuse the fighters so they hack apart your unprotected mages).\nAggro Range is the distance within which a monster will pursue and attack a character or player. It may be the distance that a monster can see, or they may be able to see further or less far for other purposes.\nBring a Friend.\nMonsters commonly respond to physical or spell attacks on other monsters, particularly monsters of the same species. Many games do not code monsters to respond to other forms of attacks such as debuffs, and most do not code monsters to respond if one of their race merely sees and chases a player or character, ie \"comes into aggro range\". The code for which forms of alert will cause others to respond is sometimes called Bring a Friend, or BAF for short.\nPulling.\nPulling means to attract, or 'pull', one monster, or one of a group of monsters, to a location better suited to a player for fighting.\nIn the more common case of a group of monsters, this is to avoid the extra damage that they can inflict while the first is killed, and so on.\nThe most common, or at least preferable way is to attack monsters, on the edge of the group, that are far enough away from other monsters that they will not BAF. When this is not possible, pullers approach within &lt;a href=\"%23Aggression\"&gt;Aggro Range&lt;/a&gt; of a single enemy on the edges of the group, but out of the Aggro Range of others; this is known as Body Pulling.\nIn cases where monsters cannot be pulled individually, then the strategy is to ensure that the monsters do not use Concentration of Fire to do so much damage to a single party member that they die. This is done by getting their attacks (Aggro) onto other party members, by attacking them or commonly, with some sort of Taunting.\nKiting.\n&lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;s are an excellent choice of character for this, as they should have nothing to do if this is done perfectly. Given sufficient control, by means of autopause or manually pausing the game, it is hypothetically possible if not always feasible to kite five monsters around in a square, pentagon or hexagon and still be able to attack with one character. Note that there are diminishing returns to the lead that kiting characters have on their pursuers when running in a circle, as the monster will always be running in a smaller circle as it heads directly toward a target that is turning across its path. Similarly, because characters in Baldur's Gate will actually stop each time they are given a new command to move, there are diminishing returns to the number of times that they are micro-managed, and so near-perfect circles are actually significantly slower movement than hexagons, which may be slower than pentagons, which may be slower than squares, etc."}

It is a damage modifier that only kicks in against a certain type of enemies, typically targeting &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is usually granted either as a passive class bonus like an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Hunter\"&gt;Undead Hunter&lt;/a&gt;'s or as a passive damage boost provided by an item as long as it stays equipped.\n&lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;s make little use of this status effect, as the targeting feature can usually be achieved in other ways.\nMechanics.\nThis special kind of damage bonus only comes into play as weapon or fist damage. It gets doubled by &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;s just like natural weapon damage, but isn't affected by the &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; multiplier. The combat logs do not list this damage separately from natural weapon damage, and the damage estimation in the inventory screen of Enhanced Editions ignores it.\nWhen dual wielding, the bonus is applied to both hands even when it is granted by one of the weapons.\nUnlike other types of damage bonuses, only one instance of this effect can be used to increase damage in any given attack. So when an attacker is benefiting from a +3 vs. Dragons and a +6 vs Chaotic-aligned creatures, hitting a chaotic-aligned dragon will not result in a +9 bonus, but in either +3 or +6.\nEffect precedence.\nWill it be +3 or +6?

In that case, from oldest to newest it goes: helm, armor, off-hand, bracers, right ring, left ring, amulet, belt, boots, cloak, main hand, magically-created weapon, first active spell effects, second active spell effects, etc.\nAdditionally, as far as \"Damage vs. type bonus\" is concerned, equipped items win over the Undead Hunter and &lt;a href=\"Cavalier\"&gt;Cavalier&lt;/a&gt;'s class kit passives which get overridden.\nSources of Damage vs type bonus.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Enhanced Editions=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The main chamber provides a route between the temple and the exterior mountain peak and the side chamber contains two jail cells.\nMain Chamber&lt;br&gt;\nThe main chamber consists of a wide passageway that looks \"J-shaped\" with roughly vertical walls that appear rather smooth as though the corridor was hewn through the stone with dwarven expertise. There are multiple cages located throughout the chamber that contain &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bear\"&gt;Black Bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Gibberling\"&gt;Gibberling&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt;s. The wolves and gibberlings are paired up while the bears and spiders are solitary. The gibberlings are the only creature that are in a cage that can't be opened, making the killing of them relatively easy. Two pairs of &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20EE%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s are also found within the chamber.\nSide Chamber&lt;br&gt;\nThe side chamber looks like it may be a relatively newer excavation as the walls appear rough and uneven, particularly towards the rear of the chamber. There are two pairs of wolves that are in cages, similar to that of the gibberlings, which again makes for easy killing. This is also the area where two crude jail cells have been excavated into the northern wall of the chamber.\nThe Riddle Cages Trap.\nWhen you reach the vicinity of the jail cells, the occupants, a man named &lt;a href=\"Bassano\"&gt;Bassano&lt;/a&gt; and a second man named &lt;a href=\"Jasper%20Banff\"&gt;Jasper Banff&lt;/a&gt;, will call out and warn the party of the extreme danger that awaits if the doors aren't opened in the correct manner. The double whammy is the fact that, due to some magical rules that control the doors, they are unable to answer any questions as doing so would lead to an instant death by &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;. Only after they explain the rules to the party is one of them, and only one of them, allowed to answer only a single question. Then the party must decide if the person they choose to answer the question is telling the truth or lying and then make the correct choice of which door to open first.\nIf you make the wrong choice and open the wrong door, a fireball will strike the party member who's opening the door, killing both occupants and possibly your party member too. Any other members of the party who are in close proximity to the cages will not be harmed by the blast.\nIf you choose wisely then the doors will both open simultaneously when the correct door is opened. This leads to Bassano going invisible and escaping while Jasper begins a conversation with the party which reveals some limited information about the temple, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Moon\"&gt;Dark Moon&lt;/a&gt; monks and his suspicions of Bassano being a Dark Moon spy. Jasper then exits the area while Bassano is silently hiding in the shadows near the location of the cages that held the black bears, waiting to attack the nearest party member that comes into range with an invisible backstab.\nTreasure.\nThere are no lootable containers within the cave so the only treasure available are items dropped by Bassano, the goblins and the gibberlings."}

It is the evil counterpart to the &lt;a href=\"Planetar\"&gt;Planetar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dark Planetar uses the Solar animation and has a reddish tint.\nGameplay.\nCombat.\nWith 110 hit points, 10% physical damage resistance, immunity to cold/fire/electricity, 75% &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, 3 &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Globe of Blades&lt;/a&gt; and 3 &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; spells memorized as well as numerous effect immunities, Fallen Planetars are quite resilient, capable of holding their ground against both hard-hitting melee enemies and high-level spellcasters.\nFallen Planetars can &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; as an innate power.\nFallen Planetars are under a permanent &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;normal haste&lt;/a&gt; effect and, in &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;s only, have an extremely fast &lt;a href=\"regeneration\"&gt;regeneration&lt;/a&gt; rate of 8 HP per second (4HP/sec doubled by the haste effect). A celestial is considered \"gated\" rather than \"summoned\", and thus cannot be banished by a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe summoned Fallen Planetar wields a +3 &lt;a href=\"Magical%20item\"&gt;magical Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; that deals 2D10+3 &lt;a href=\"Slashing%20damage\"&gt;Slashing damage&lt;/a&gt;, with an extra +7 for the Planetar's Strength. The Sword is the item that gives the Planetar its Normal &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt;, raising its &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;APR&lt;/a&gt; to 4.\nThe Dark Planetar uses a script for melee combat that evaluates enemy use of &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and if the Planetar's weapon is ineffective (from some kind of spell or immunity). The Planetar's AI will look for alternate targets moving to the second, then third closest enemy it can detect.\nEach blow from this weapon has a 25% chance to:\nThese effects bypass &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpellcasting.\nThe Dark Planetar's primary class is Mage (level 25), but it also has a hidden default Cleric spell casting ability, meaning all Cleric spells will be cast at level 1, not level 25. This makes &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Fear%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Symbol, Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Word\"&gt;Holy Word&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; have their minimum possible effectiveness (which varies, as spells tend to scale starting from the level they're normally obtainable and others, like Holy Word, don't scale at all). This has been tested and confirmed for BG2EE.\nWithout player command, a Dark Planetar's &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23A\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; will only cast &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Restoration\"&gt;Lesser Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neutralize%20Poison\"&gt;Neutralize Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Fear\"&gt;Remove Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Disease\"&gt;Cure Disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; (including its scripted self-Heal ability) and &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; as needed; all other spells require the player to manually cast them from the creature's spellbook.\nIt will cast \"Heal\" if a party member is within detection range and hit points have fallen below 25% of maximum. The other curative spells are cast if the planetar detects &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;State: Poisoned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;State: Panic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;State: Diseased&lt;/a&gt;. If a player character is detected and under a &lt;a href=\"Charmed\"&gt;State: Charmed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Confused\"&gt;State: Confused&lt;/a&gt; it will attempt its caster level 1 Dispel Magic (don't count on that being successful).\nNotes.\nDark Planetars aren't encountered as enemies during normal gameplay. If, however, a player-summoned Planetar becomes hostile for some reason, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt; is one way to defend against the &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Vorpal hit effect&lt;/a&gt;. Spells that protect from +3 weapons (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;) also prevent the effect from triggering. Alternatively, increasing the defender's &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving Throw&lt;/a&gt; vs. Death (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;) to -1 or below will prevent the vorpal effect from killing the defender.\nThe physical and magical resilience of this creature, combined with its vorpal attacks, makes it useful for pretty much any combat encounter. As an example, if given the appropriate pre-buffs, it is entirely feasible for a Fallen Planetar to defeat high-level enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;beholders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;liches&lt;/a&gt;, or even a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dragon\"&gt;shadow dragon&lt;/a&gt; single-handedly.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20of%20Amn\"&gt;Shadows of Amn&lt;/a&gt; was initially designed without &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;high-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt; like Summon Planetar; player characters were limited to 2.95 million &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; and mages could only cast a few level 9 spells through rare scrolls. It was the expansion that retroactively unlocked the XP cap and introduced high-level abilities to Shadows of Amn, but the campaign was arguably not updated well enough to higher level parties. It can be useful for a player interested in normal to higher difficulty levels to know that using Throne of Bhaal content in Shadows of Amn can significantly scale back the challenge/difficulty, and it can become unbalanced in favor of the player. Summon Dark Planetar is one of the stronger abilities introduced by Throne of Bhaal, especially so in the Enhanced Edition with their rapid regeneration.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes changes to the summoned creature from the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt;. It brings the creature closer to the D&amp;D 2nd Edition ruleset. \nDark Planetar (18 Hit Dice):\nSTR 19, DEX 19, CON 18, INT 18, WIS 21, CHA 22; AL Chaotic Evil&lt;br&gt;\nHP 152, AC -7, THAC0 1, Saving Throws 3/5/4/4/6&lt;br&gt;\n3 Attacks Per Round, 2d6+10 Slashing Damage (Greatsword +3)&lt;br&gt;\nCombat Abilities:&lt;br&gt;\nVorpal: 15% chance target must save vs. death at -2 or die&lt;br&gt;\nSpecial Qualities:&lt;br&gt;\nImmune to weapons lower than +3 enchantment&lt;br&gt;\nImmune to charm, confusion, feeblemindedness, level drain, death, imprisonment, maze, petrification, &amp; poison effects&lt;br&gt;\nRegeneration: 2hp/round&lt;br&gt;\nFire &amp; Electrical Resistance 100%; Acid Resistance 50%; Magic Resistance 75%&lt;br&gt;\nSlashing, Crushing, Piercing, &amp; Missile Resistance 20%&lt;br&gt;\nMemorized Divine Spells:&lt;br&gt;\nLevel 1: Doom (x3), Resist Fear (x3)&lt;br&gt;\nLevel 2: Hold Person (x3), Find Trap, Know Opponent, Silence&lt;br&gt;\nLevel 3: Contagion (x2), Holy Blight (x2), Break Enchantment (x2)&lt;br&gt;\nLevel 4: Cause Critical Wounds (x2), Metal Domination (x2), Poison (x2), Cloak of Fear (x2)&lt;br&gt;\nLevel 5: Flame Strike (x2), Greater Command (x2), True Seeing (x2)&lt;br&gt;\nLevel 6: Blade Barrier, Dolorous Decay, Harm&lt;br&gt;\nLevel 7: Fire Storm, Unholy Word&lt;br&gt;\nThis Dark Planetar creature is now a multi classed level 18/18 Fighter-Cleric. It has no Mage spells. It is equipped with different undroppable items to change its abilities and immunities. It can see invisible creatures and can't be backstabbed. It cannot be hurt by &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt;. It now has a casting time modifier with a +10 speed bonus, and spells will be cast almost instantly. It is not under a haste effect anymore, and instead has a movement modifier bonus of +4. The Greatsword only has a vorpal effect now, with no dispelling function. It has a hidden helmet that gives it a Wings Animation and prevents critical hits. Its adjusted Effective THAC0 is now -3. The creature gets a revised and smarter AI, and aggressively uses Divine Spells while engaged in melee, automatically. The player can still control the Dark Planetar to command his spell casting as desired. As a Cleric, the Dark Planetar may attempt to Turn Undead using its appropriate button control, and since the creature is evil, it could take control of the undead. \nThe Dark Planetar gets a different animation than the unmodded game, looking less celestial and more infernal, with red wings and a more human physique. It also has some written dialogue in the info box, such as \"This is surely your end\" and \"Death shall be your reward, fool!\", and similar abyssal quips. \nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod with the \"Smarter Mages\" component will mean that the player may now face a Dark Planetar several times in the game, depending on the difficulty setting. Mages, Alhoons and Liches eligible to have HLA's will summon Dark Planetars to fight against your party - whereas in the unmodded game you may never face one, even in ToB."}

It contains the &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Keep\"&gt;de'Arnise Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which occupies most of the map from its center to the northwestern corner, and the nearby palisade. The keep is the ancestral estate of the de'Arnise family and is the center of interest of &lt;a href=\"Nalia%20de%27Arnise\"&gt;Nalia de'Arnise&lt;/a&gt;'s companion quest, as it has recently been besieged by and &lt;a href=\"Yuan-ti\"&gt;Yuan-ti&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe current state of the Keep is post-invasion. The keep is damaged and defiled. Victims of the internal slaughter are evident, with corpses impaled and hung on posts by the main entrance to the keep - a grisly warning for any who may try and enter. The Drawbridge is up and locked. The invaders are atop the battlements and keep a watchful eye. Attempting to scale the walls would be suicide.\nOverview and reason to visit.\nIn order for this area to become available to the party, they must first speak with Nalia in the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt;. She will request that &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and party assist her in slaying the monsters and driving them away from her home and is willing to lend her assistance as a party member in exchange for your help. With the right dialogue options selected, she will mark its location on the party's &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;World Map&lt;/a&gt;. This sets up the &lt;a href=\"The%20de%27Arnise%20Keep%20has%20been%20Invaded\"&gt;The de'Arnise Keep has been Invaded&lt;/a&gt; quest.\nOnce the keep has been cleared, Nalia will explain how she despises her betrothed, &lt;a href=\"Isaea%20Roenall\"&gt;Isaea Roenall&lt;/a&gt;, and how the Roenall family will undoubtedly attempt to claim the keep and its lands. For most classes, this serves as an explanation as to why she will continue to adventure with them if the party desires. For &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackguard\"&gt;Blackguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s, she offers them a chance to become a steward for the keep, allowing her to keep the Roenall family out. This unlocks the keep as a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeep Exterior.\nThis comprises all of the outer areas that surround the keep and is where the party appears whenever they travel to the area. The party starts in the southeast corner of the map, outside of the walls. Whilst the keep is besieged, there is a chance of encountering &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s as random encounters during exploration of the map. There are three hidden spawn locations outside the keep walls.\nThe Palisade.\nIn the southwestern corner of the area a moderately sized log palisade has been constructed which serves as a \"fort\" for the surviving souls who were able to escape and regroup to battle the invaders. It is a temporary defensive position that has been established by the defenders of the de'Arnise Keep now that they have been driven from the keep proper. The entrance is protected by two &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Guard%20%28Fort%29\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; and standing inside of the fort is their leader &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Arat\"&gt;Captain Arat&lt;/a&gt;. If Nalia is not in your party, she will be here as well.\nCaptain Arat will greet the party upon arrival and explain the situation in greater detail. Most importantly, he tells them how to access the keep interior by means of the secret passageway, warns them of the ability that trolls have to resurrect themselves unless dealt a fatal blow by fire or acid, and gives them twenty &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Arrows of Fire&lt;/a&gt; to help them in their task. In addition, he asks the party to lower the drawbridge so that he and his troops can assist in retaking the keep.\nSecret Entrance.\nThe only way into the keep whilst the drawbridge is up, is by way of this secret doorway and passage- which is initially hidden and must be detected. It is placed in the rock face to the north of the palisade.\nMod Content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Quest Pack&lt;/a&gt; mod can install New Fate For The Dryads\u2019 Acorns component:&lt;br&gt;\nAre all dryads the beautiful, innocent creatures they appear to be? Originally created by Bons, this component adds an intriguing twist to the quest to return Irenicus\u2019 dryads\u2019 acorns to the Windspear Hills. Evil players may delight in the new opportunities afforded here, including a delicious gourmet meal. The quest begins with a new encounter which will take place in the south of the de\u2019Arnise Keep if you have not already returned the acorns.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod, and the Tactical Challenges for BG2 \"Tougher de'Arnise Keep\" component will add more trolls to the keep, including some powerful spellcasting spirit trolls, and upgrades TorGal a bit. More and different invaders will be present inside and around the exterior of the keep. \nThe component, though not identical to the \"Tougher TorGal\" component of the Tactics Mod, is strongly influenced by it. The main differences from the Tactics version are a wider variety of troll reinforcements (not just spirit trolls) and a (hopefully!) cleverer, but slightly less tough, TorGal (who, in this version, has not stolen one of the flail heads)."}

Information on this page and that page overlap in some subjects, but both together will fill out the questline.\nFirst Floor.\nThe quest to liberate the keep from its occupying invaders begins here. \nUsing the &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Hold%23Secret%20Entrance\"&gt;Secret Entrance&lt;/a&gt; to enter the keep releases the party into a couple of secret storage chambers. These lead to the Servants Quarters where they are beset by a &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; after it kills a &lt;a href=\"Servant\"&gt;Servant&lt;/a&gt;. After slaying it, they can loot the various crates and barrels for a &lt;a href=\"Light%20Crossbow%20%2B1\"&gt;Light Crossbow +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20%2B1\"&gt;Bolts +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Bolts of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Potion of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20from%20Normal%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection from Normal Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, 5 &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potions of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt;, and some normal sling bullets and throwing darts.\nThe Armoury.\nIn this room, you will find the stable boy &lt;a href=\"Daleson\"&gt;Daleson&lt;/a&gt;, one of the keep's few survivors who will give you some details about the invaders. Specifically, he warns the party about how they broke into the keep in the first place - with the aid of strange, burrowing monsters that seem to have a mind-befuddling gaze - and notes that their digging monsters have a strange fondness for dog stew. This is a valuable clue for defeating the &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulks\"&gt;Umber Hulks&lt;/a&gt; in the basement. He also mentions the &lt;a href=\"Flail%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Flail of Ages&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful flail that would certainly be handy for slaying the trolls. He wishes to remain where he is, as the trolls leave him be as long as he does mundane chores for them.\nLooting the Armoury will provide the party with a &lt;a href=\"Longbow%20%2B1\"&gt;Long Bow +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Spear%20%2B1\"&gt;Spear +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Quarterstaff%20%2B1\"&gt;Quarterstaff +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Arrows of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Acid Arrows&lt;/a&gt; A secret door hidden in the north corner leads to the Forge room.\nThe Forge Room.\nIn addition to a chest containing a &lt;a href=\"Find%20Familiar\"&gt;Find Familiar&lt;/a&gt; scroll, this room is important; if one can retrieve the three flail heads hidden throughout the keep, they can be assembled here to create the Flail of Ages, a powerful magical weapon.\nWhen complete, the Flail of Ages is a flail with +3 enchantment that inflicts elemental Acid, Cold and Fire bonus damage. It's also possible to assemble the Flail piece by piece, in which case the enchantment bonus and damage bonus are based on the number of heads added; adding the Acid and Fire heads, for example, would create a Flail +2 that does Acid and Fire bonus damage.\nAssembling the complete Flail of Ages awards the party with 22,350 &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nA secret doorway in this room leads to the Trophy Room.\nThe Trophy Room.\nThis room contains 810 , a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Earth%20Control\"&gt;Ring of Earth Control,&lt;/a&gt; and the Flail Head (Cold) for the Flail of Ages.\nThe Main Hall.\nA number of Troll Guards stalk this chamber and must be defeated to progress. The outer corridor has at its southernmost corner, a chest holding 450 gold pieces a &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20%2B2\"&gt;Dagger +2&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nServant's Quarters.\nThis room may be occupied by some more trolls (depends on party experience Level). Within, examine the two privies for a secret compartment containing a &lt;a href=\"Star%20Sapphire\"&gt;Star Sapphire&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Quarters proper are several chests, with a &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Scroll of Breach&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Scroll of Protection from Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Kitchen.\nIf you have the four pieces of &lt;a href=\"Dog%20Meat\"&gt;Dog Meat&lt;/a&gt; from the Courtyard, you can cook up a pot of &lt;a href=\"Dog%20Stew\"&gt;Dog Stew&lt;/a&gt;, earning the party 11500 XP. The woodpile has some &lt;a href=\"Dart%20of%20Stunning\"&gt;Darts of Stunning&lt;/a&gt; concealed in it. It also has a door to an adjacent non-descript room which contains a staircase leading to the Second Floor. This room is inhabited with a troll terrorizing another hapless keep servant.\nCourtyard.\nThe courtyard is the external central area of the keep enclosed by the protective walls. The party cannot access the courtyard until they get inside of the keep and then work their way to the hallway that contains the exits to the courtyard.\nAn\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Otyugh\"&gt;Otyugh&lt;/a&gt; roams the eastern area of the courtyard and must be killed to allow &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Arat\"&gt;Captain Arat&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Guard\"&gt;troops&lt;/a&gt; access.\nIn the western area of the courtyard there is found the surviving &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Dogs\"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; of the keep. As Daleson mentioned when you spoke to him in the armoury, you can kill these dogs and take their meat to the kitchen to make dog stew, allowing for the completion of an unmarked side quest.\nOnce the Otyugh is killed, the stairs behind it lead to the keep's battlements, where a clockwise route takes the party to the drawbridge wheel. Lowering the drawbridge rewards the party with 29750 XP and triggers a battle that pits a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Yuan-ti\"&gt;Greater Yuan-ti&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Troll\"&gt;Giant Trolls&lt;/a&gt; against Captain Arat and his troops that the party may choose to interfere in, but which Captain Arat and company will win regardless.\nSecond Floor.\nThe Second Floor of the Keep hides a secret route down to the Cellar, and the player needs to travel through here to complete the quest. In addition, two of the three heads required to complete the Flail of Ages are to be found here.\nEnemies encountered in this general area consist of Trolls, Giant Trolls, Yuan-ti, Yuan-ti Mage, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Troll\"&gt;Ice Trolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Troll\"&gt;Spectral Trolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Study.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Key\"&gt;Keep Key&lt;/a&gt; that opens the Locked Chambers and the room in which Nalia's Aunt is imprisoned is to be found here. However, the party will need to overcome a \"Split Troll\", the Tiny Trolls it creates upon death, an Ice Troll, and a Yuan-ti Mage to retrieve it.\nThere are also scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Minor Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Lesser%20Earth%20Elemental\"&gt;Conjure Lesser Earth Elemental&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve here once the enemies are slain.\nLocked Chambers.\nThese chambers can only be accessed with the Keep Key. The northeastern locked door opens a series of secret passages that lead behind the study to a hidden room. There is a trap that needs to be disarmed here, but there is a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Wand of Frost&lt;/a&gt; hidden in the fireplace and scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; hidden in the chamber between this room and Glaicus's Prison.\nGlaicus's Secret chamber.\n&lt;a href=\"Glaicus\"&gt;Glaicus&lt;/a&gt;, a de'Arnise veteran retainer seemingly turned traitor, resides in this room. He is under the effects of an enchantment cast by one of the Yuan-ti mages, and if Nalia sees Glaicus first, she will drop a hint to this.\nGlaicus is a difficult fight, being a strong Fighter who drinks potions of &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fire%20Giant%20Strength\"&gt;Fire Giant Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt; to enhance his prowess. Killing him rewards the player with 9500 EXP and the Acid Head for the Flail of Ages.\nAn alternate option is to counter Glaicus's enchantment with &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; or a Charm spell of the player's own - &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Charm\"&gt;Dire Charm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; seem the best options, but the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Human%20Influence\"&gt;Ring of Human Influence&lt;/a&gt; will suffice as well. Successfully charming Glaicus is difficult but dispelling the effect is easy; in this case, he can be talked to and will explain what happened to him, giving the player the Acid Head and leaving. Breaking the enchantment and sending him to freedom rewards the player with 25,500 XP.\nNalia's Aunt's Quarters.\nThe southwestern door holds the chambers of Nalia's irksome aunt and her aggravated defender, &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Guard%20%28Hendron%29\"&gt;Hendron&lt;/a&gt;. She will comment in disgust on the party and then leave, giving access to the Small Chapel and to the spiral staircase leading to the Cellar.\nThe Small Chapel.\nThe Small Chapel houses three statues with enchanted weapons placed there for safekeeping - but also houses six golems to defend those items. Taking any weapon other than the Fire Flail Head will cause an associated set of golems to attack.\u00a0\nThe left statue carries &lt;a href=\"The%20Kneecapper\"&gt;The Kneecapper&lt;/a&gt; and the Fire Head for the Flail of Ages. Taking the warhammer releases one &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Golem\"&gt;Flesh Golem&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe middle statue carries the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Court%20Bow\"&gt;Elven Court Bow&lt;/a&gt;. Taking this releases one &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem.&lt;/a&gt;\nThe right statue carries the &lt;a href=\"Frostreaver\"&gt;Frostreaver&lt;/a&gt;. Taking this releases one Flesh Golem and one Stone Golem.\nThe Iron Golem is too large to fit through the door leading out of the chapel, so retreating there can be a valuable tactic.\nCellar.\nThe Cellar of the keep is where the dungeon concludes.\nThe first chamber contains a trapped chest holding a &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Amulet\"&gt;Shield Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, whilst the second houses three Troll Guards. The chamber beyond that holds the last defense before &lt;a href=\"TorGal\"&gt;TorGal&lt;/a&gt; himself; five Umber Hulks.\nA party can try and fight them, but there is an alternative. As Daleson hinted too when you encountered him, if you have a stealth-cloaked Thief or an invisible character carry the dog stew through the gaols to the hulk burrow, they can place the stew there to lure the Umber Hulks back into their burrow. Moving swiftly, they can close both doors into the gaols, trapping the Umber Hulks without having to risk their deadly confusion attack. Doing this completes the unmarked \"Doggy Stew\" side quest and awards the party 18750 XP.\nFinally, the party may confront TorGal and his Giant Troll bodyguards in the Family Chapel, a difficult battle indeed. However, the battle may be made easier if a thief or invisible creature enters the room where TorGal dwells. TorGal will follow the unseen assailant back to where the party waits, allowing the party to kill TorGal without his Troll Bodyguards. When TorGal falls, the column against which the former Lord de'Arnise is sprawled hides the treasure TorGal sought; 2126 , assorted gems, and a random scroll.\nAs a Stronghold.\nGoverning the keep is not too involving. A &lt;a href=\"Majordomo\"&gt;Majordomo&lt;/a&gt; is available to handle the small details, but he will need you to visit the keep every few weeks in order to handle larger issues; a &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Messenger\"&gt;Keep Messenger&lt;/a&gt; may appear in other areas to summon you to the Keep for such matters.\nBecause the keep has peasants loyal to it, it generates a weekly amount of tax - 500 , by default. The player may opt to raise this amount, but this will anger the local peasantry.\nAn invisible \"stat\" associated with the keep is \"Revolt\". This measures just how displeased the peasants are with the leadership provided by &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;; starting with a value of zero, if it reaches a value of 10, then the peasants will revolt - the player will be permanently barred from accessing the keep and will lose all benefits of the Keep.\nTalking to each of the four following individuals who inhabit the keep \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Metigo%20the%20Butler\"&gt;Metigo the Butler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Olma%20the%20Cook\"&gt;Olma the Cook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talira%20the%20Maid\"&gt;Talira the Maid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Cernick\"&gt;Captain Cernick&lt;/a&gt; - will provide a subtle clue as to how high the \"Revolt\" score is. The less happy they are, the less happy the peasants are.\nApproximately every seven to nine days, a notable problem that the player will need to handle will arise at the keep. There are eight of these in total, after which the keep no longer has quests associated with it, but it will continue to serve as a steady generator of .\nFor the specific mini-quests involved with the de'Arnise Keep as a Stronghold, see:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ruling%20the%20de%27Arnise%20Keep%20and%20Lands\"&gt;Ruling the de'Arnise Keep and Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nBugs.\nAs of BG2EE 2.6, several doors in various areas, including this one, would disappear when opened, leaving no way to close them. This is identified for correction in the pending Enhanced Edition Fix Pack (EEFP).\nMod Content.\nMods:.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Quest Pack&lt;/a&gt; mod can install New Fate For The Dryads\u2019 Acorns component:&lt;br&gt;\nAre all dryads the beautiful, innocent creatures they appear to be? Originally created by Bons, this component adds an intriguing twist to the quest to return Irenicus\u2019 dryads\u2019 acorns to the Windspear Hills. Evil players may delight in the new opportunities afforded here, including a delicious gourmet meal. The quest begins with a new encounter which will take place in the south of the de\u2019Arnise Keep if you have not already returned the acorns.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod, and the Tactical Challenges for BG2 \"Tougher de'Arnise Keep\" component will add more trolls to the keep, including some powerful spellcasting spirit trolls, and upgrades Torgal a bit.\nThe component, though not identical to the \"Tougher Torgal\" component of the Tactics Mod, is strongly influenced by it. The main differences from the Tactics version are a wider variety of troll reinforcements (not just spirit trolls) and a (hopefully!) cleverer, but slightly less tough, TorGal (who, in this version, has not stolen one of the flail heads).\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; Mod lets you have a chance to take control of one of the Golems in the Keep Chapel, assuming they weren't destroyed. You can see if any are available after you take the Keep as your Stronghold. These Golems are similar to a familiar and will travel with your party from area to area like a party member."}

{"id": "46524", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46524", "title": "Death Tyrant", "text": "The \"Death Tyrant\" is a type of &lt;a href=\"beholder\"&gt;beholder&lt;/a&gt; that is more powerful than the ordinary variety, but less so than an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hive%20Mother\"&gt;Hive Mother&lt;/a&gt;. In the game saga they are not used much - one spawns in &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Final%20Seal\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Final Seal&lt;/a&gt; the fourth time the green button is pressed on the globe machine.\nAnother one appears in a specific stage of the final battle with &lt;a href=\"Amelyssan\"&gt;Amelyssan&lt;/a&gt;, and the Death Tyrant is summoned in to battle the party (MELSUM03.cre), with her shouting \"Come to your mistress, minions of the Abyss!\"\nBackground.\nIn Dungeons and Dragons lore a Death Tyrant is actually a sort of &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; remnant of a beholder, and this is partially implemented in the game by assigning these creatures an &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; general designation rather than Monster. Although Undead, the game does not give the creature any of the typical Undead racial or class immunities. It is just a moderately more powerful variety of a standard beholder. The version encountered in the game also has the appearance of an ordinary beholder. Mod content (below) provides a coloration change to the Death Tyrant for differentiation purposes.\nGameplay.\nThe Death Tyrant combat script will target any creature it can detect with various eye stalks, each firing a different beholder blast projectile. The Death Tyrant can see invisible and hidden creatures by script, as long as they are in its visual detection range.\nThe creature launches one to two projectiles each round at a target. The eyestalk ray selection differs from the ordinary beholder, focusing on more direct killing, petrification or wounding attacks. It does not try lightning, fire or charming eye beams. See the list of scripted eye beams in the Info Box.\nThe creature's Cause Wounds beholder blast is the more potent &lt;a href=\"Hive%20Mother\"&gt;Hive Mother&lt;/a&gt; variety (SPIN551.spl), which bypasses magic resistance and has a &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; of 6, so will exceed a &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; and burn through other spell protections more rapidly. Each beam hit inflicts damage.\nThe creature will also bathe its target with the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt; during combat, typically within two rounds.\nMost Death Tyrant beholders are able to cast a single, uninterruptible &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; upon seeing a summoned creature in range. As such summoned creatures will most likely be banished. Using summoned creatures against a Death Tyrant isn't infeasible but may not be enough to win an encounter on its own. If multiple beholders are present in the same area, they will quickly destroy a group of summoned assailants.\nThe creature has a number of innate immunities as outlined in the InfoBox.\nMod content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod and the \"Tactical Challenges for BG2\" component makes major changes to the Death Tyrant creature. Most of these are covered in the Mod content section of the &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholder&lt;/a&gt; main article.\nWith this mod, beholders are given different colored animations to distinguish between ordinary beholders, Death Tyrant, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hive%20Mother\"&gt;Hive Mother&lt;/a&gt; varieties.\nSCS assigns the &lt;a href=\"RING95.ITM\"&gt;RING95.ITM&lt;/a&gt; item to Death Tyrants, as they are classified as &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;, so they will have all the immunities as most other undead in the game.\nThe Death Tyrant will employ the following beholder rays: &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt;, Cause Serious Wounds, Disintegrate, Paralyze, Fear, Flesh to Stone, Death Ray (summoned creatures) and Death Ray (other than summoned creatures). The game difficulty selection determines if the Death and Disintegrate eye beams are used. \nDepending on the player's game difficulty setting, typically additional Death Tyrant creatures will be placed with the &lt;a href=\"Unseeing%20Eye\"&gt;Unseeing Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and in the &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Cave%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Beholder Cave in Underdark&lt;/a&gt;. They will typically be two or more alongside a &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt; and or a &lt;a href=\"Hive%20Mother\"&gt;Hive Mother&lt;/a&gt; in several areas in SoA and ToB. \nNote that with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/SpellRevisions/spells/arcane/level-6/disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; beam will inflict massive &lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;Magical damage&lt;/a&gt; (35d6) with a missed saving throw with -2 penalty, and 5d6 if the save is made. The SR version does not actually process the &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate%20effect\"&gt;Disintegrate effect&lt;/a&gt; however, so the target will not be turned to dust."}

Any melee attack that connects with a target has a probability of applying the innate spell effect on that target. Any type of melee attack that hits can initiate the chance to trigger the effects of the ability. This would include a fist attack, dagger thrust or any other melee blow.\nWhen any melee attack successfully hits, there are two different and separate effects that can occur. Both effects will not occur simultaneously. The first is a 10% chance of a &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;, where the target creature is allowed a save vs. spell with a -4 penalty to negate it. If not, the stun effect has a duration of 2 rounds. It can't be dispelled. A combat screen text message displays \"\"Stunned\" if the save is missed.\nThe other ability has a 3% probability of affecting the target. When that occurs a text message displays on the combat screen indicating \"Deathbringer Assault\"\". The effect applies 200 &lt;a href=\"Slashing%20damage\"&gt;Slashing damage&lt;/a&gt; to the target (regardless of what type of melee weapon hit the target).\nBoth of these effects are not affected by &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;, spell protections such as &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; would block the slashing damage, and any sort of slashing damage resistance could mitigate it.\nSome creatures that are designed to be protected against this innate ability (not just the damage that prompts the message \"Deathbringer Assault\", the stun as well) are provided with the &lt;a href=\"SAREVIMM.ITM\"&gt;SAREVIMM.ITM&lt;/a&gt;."}

He knows you have the Gilded Rope with you and is unconcerned about its supposed magical protections. \nGameplay.\nThe first encounter with Deirex results in a cut scene in which the lich imprisons the PC - but instead of being entombed below the crust of the Faer\u00fbn, the party strangely is transported into a planar realm controlled by &lt;a href=\"Jarlaxle\"&gt;Jarlaxle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party returns to Deirex's Tower in order to fulfill the Jarlaxle questline to rescue the souls of his captured compatriots - as soon as the party enters the Lich will hiss:\nThe undead wizard will instantly apply a series of protective buffs that are uninterruptible, to include &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeirex has three separate contingency applications that add protections based on if a previous one is removed, or if a stoneskin has been reduced to just 1 skin. These include additional applications of Protection From Magical Weapons, Stoneskin and Spell Turning. Expect a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, and during that pause in time, a Spell Trigger that casts &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; and a buff on the lich.\nAll of the spells listed in the InfoBox are scripted for use, some in sequential order and on timed intervals. Some spells can be cast more than once, but most are single use only.\nThe script for the creature has little ability to assess the party's protections (other than Spell Turning), so any spells directed at the party or a particular target won't be based on any criteria other than if it is detected. So, in that regard, Deirex is not a smart opponent. If Deirex's Remove Magic fails to remove any protections from the party, then it has no way to strip away any protections and can't even cast a &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;. \nDeirex can see invisible and hidden creatures by script. The party can't hide from the lich if within its detection range.\nThe lich is equipped with two undroppable items, one in each Ring slot. These items are used by the game engine to provide the lich with various protections and immunities to &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;Status Effects&lt;/a&gt;, spells, specific damage types, weapon enchantment and other factors. The last item is the Lich's touch attack melee weapon. These items are:\nIf Deirex is defeated, then check its body for two items it drops, as you'll need these later.\nNotes.\nDeirex is not coded with &lt;a href=\"Cold%20damage\"&gt;Cold damage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Electricity%20damage\"&gt;Electricity damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance, as all other liches in the game are. Deirex's experience level is also well below the other liches found in BG2. Also, despite the fact that the lich used a &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; animation in the cut scene, and that various older forums warn that this lich can cast this spell, Deirex is not scripted to use Imprisonment at all, and won't in the unmodified game.\nMod content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod will improve Deirex's AI noticeably over the basic and unmodded EE versions of the creature. If the SCS Smarter Mages component is also installed, he will be even more formidable, in that it will utilize triggers, sequencers and contingency abilities. This component also works with the game difficulty settings, and this could mean that Deirex will also have access, and use, Mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt;. All SCS liches can see invisible creatures, and this cannot be blocked or dispelled.\nSCS may make Deirex a level 28 Invoker (or it could be a Conjurer, Necromancer or Enchanter - determined randomly at installation). No statistics or immunities are changed. However, spell selection and what spells are cast will differ from the unmodded game. Deirex will prove much more of a challenge than before, especially if it is able to get off its first series of defensive buffs, which include: &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blades%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Energy Blades (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20The%20Elements\"&gt;Protection From The Elements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI Divination&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Dispelling Screen\" with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR mod&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Magic Energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Mind Blank\" with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR mod&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeirex will cast spells based on the opponent's protections and vulnerabilities, and other factors. If the game difficulty setting is high enough, Deirex will use two High Level ability spells, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Dragon's Breath (spell)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;. Deirex can cast &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, summon multiple &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt; creatures, Cast &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nSCS Liches gain a fear aura ability (that can cause a &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; effect), an innate power they may use with a fairly large area of effect. A saving throw negates, but it is unaffected by spell level protections and magic resistance. This panic inducing aura tics continuously at intervals throughout the entire battle.\nIf the SCS More Consistent Breach component is installed, a level 5 &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; Spell can target a Lich, which it cannot in an unmodded game. However, SCS changes Breach to be blocked by all of the Spell Protection options such as Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning and Spell Trap."}

It will however select the second, third and so forth target if any of those targets are under a berserk/enrage effect.\nHowever, a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Undead\"&gt;Protection From Undead&lt;/a&gt; scroll can still provide protection, and the demilich can't target a party member under that effect.\nThe demilich can continue these spell casts until about 1-turn has transpired, then it might release a another Demilich Howl, and resume the Imprisonment spell casting cycle again.\nThis creature has no ability to remove protections from the party, nor can it heal itself.\nFrankly, as long as a party member is protected by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Abjuration&lt;/a&gt;, the creature can't do much except melee attack with its lich touch attack, which it is not very accurate with in terms of &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs this demilich is mostly impervious to all spells, due to its &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; immunity, the simplest method to destroy it is to strike it repeatedly with +4 weaponry until it is slain.\nDue to its inherent 90% physical damage resistance, expect to inflict only 1-3 damage per hit.\nUnfortunately, this demilich is not affected by any instant death effects, such as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20of%20Disaster\"&gt;Black Blade of Disaster&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Disruption\"&gt;Mace of Disruption&lt;/a&gt;, so just beat it down with anything on hand that can hit it.\nOnce the creature is felled, recover any loot desired, as well as an enormous sum of gold.\nThe sarcophagus also contains some valuables.\nNotes.\nIf the party leaves the crypt once the demlich has engaged with the party, there is a chance it will follow the party to the Githyanki Encampment area to continue the battle. It probably won't leave the Crypt while any other party members remain with it.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes major revisions to this creature, and the encounter.\nFirst, entry into this crypt is changed. The party can still decide to enter the crypt with one or more party members, but once the characters transition into the space, no one else may enter the crypt, and no one may leave until the demilich is destroyed. \nA text is displayed reading \"A vast block of stone has slammed down across the exit.\", this of course precludes any reinforcements or fleeing the area.\nThe demilich design is also revised, it is now a &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, level 35, with 57 HP and 100% &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe creature has an innate casting speed factor which reduces spell casting time by 4, the same as afforded by wearing the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Vecna\"&gt;Robe of Vecna&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis mod version of the demilich is a fully functional spell casting mage with an entire spell book of memorized spells of many varieties.\nEven with a large arsenal of memorized spells, the demilich still retains the abilities of the unmodded creature and is scripted to use a more potent &lt;a href=\"Demilich%20Howl\"&gt;Demilich Howl&lt;/a&gt; and SCS's \"Demilich Trap the Soul\" innate spells in between other spell casting.\nThe player's installed component choices for SCS will affect some gameplay with this creature. The \"More consistent Breach\", and the selected difficulty level play a big part on how dangerous this creature will be. \nOn higher difficulties, expect multiple mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; uses such as &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blades%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Energy Blades (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Dragon's Breath (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe demilich will also have prepared &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; to instantly deploy. The creature has the capability to strip away party defenses with &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt;, and more than one use of &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed alongside SCS, the party may find this creature requiring additional steps to dispel or to even target, due to use of the SR mod's spell versions.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//artisans-corner.com/shadow-magic/\"&gt;Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt; mod is installed, this creature has the \"Nosferatu\" tome in its inventory.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Afaaq%20the%20Djinni%20Companion\"&gt;Afaaq the Djinni Companion&lt;/a&gt; mod is installed, the creature has the \"\"Skull of the demi-lich\"' item in its inventory."}

Can be used in same round as a spell.&lt;br&gt;\nNote from the SCS Mod Author:&lt;br&gt; \nIn addition, Demogorgon has a gaze attack (either a charm or a confusion effect) which he can use each round in addition to his spells. The Beguiling Gaze ability is a level 6 spell effect, that does not bypass MR and can be negated with a Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty. The Insanity Gaze is an AOE level 8 spell effect that does not bypass MR. It can be negated with a -2 penalty to Save vs. Spell. Note that these gaze attacks also reduce magic resistance and Saving Throws vs. Spells, and those cannot be blocked and have no save. The end result of this is a cumulative erosion of magic resistance and saving throws. When Demogorgon uses the gaze a text on screen says \"Feel my beguiling gaze\" or similar. My original version of Demogorgon also had a Time Stop usable once per day (as in Ascension), but I worried that this was too much; if you want to turn this back on, enter SetGlobal(\"DMWWDemogorgonTS\",\"GLOBAL\",1) at the console.\nRecent update to the SCS, with or without the Ascension Mod has now improved the initial deployment of the first wave of fiends summoned - and will show in the combat log that Demogorgon initiates \"Summon the Infernal Host\". Your game difficulty setting determines if this component is enabled. If you see this message, you may have to deal with a &lt;a href=\"Marilith\"&gt;Marilith&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt;, one or two &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep/ToB%29\"&gt;Glabrezu&lt;/a&gt; and a special fiend that looks like a Cambion/Demon Knight. This fiend is a unique creature with advanced spell casting abilities and is actually a level 20/20 Fighter Mage class with a 50% resistance to physical damage. The \"Improved Fiends\" component will also allow the Marilith and Balor and especially the unique Cambion to also self-buff with contingency spells, such as PFMW, Stoneskin and Shield. \n&lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; also restores Demogorgon's innate Time Stop, which deploys not too long after the start of hostilities. Be warned, that a party member can be killed quickly by the Demon Prince's melee attacks during this period, unless the target is made invulnerable to magic weapons or other advanced protection. \nGameplay (community).\nDefeat Demogorgon:"}

Being the aggro of Demogorgon is dangerous and one should always try to kill him as fast as possible, as he hits very hard, has serious disables, high regeneration, strong defenses, and can summon demons to top it off. Therefore, having some decoy, even if short lived, is essential. This method was tested with a Cavalier solo (+3 to hit and damage against him). For this strategy, you will need some instances of Greater Whirlwind, Summon Deva, Carsomyr and the Helm of Vhailor.\nUse the Helm of Vhailor to cast Simulacrum. Summon a Deva if you wish, with the clone or the original. Draw Upon Holy Might with you and the clone, and protect from evil yourself, the clone and the Deva. Use Greater Whirlwind with the clone and yourself and have Demogorgon appear. Once he is summoned, show that baboon headed who is the real boss of this realm, hack and slash him and only him. Pay no mind to the other demons around. The Deva will aggro some of them or even Demogorgon and will buy you some precious seconds of free hits. Carsomyr will constantly disable his defenses, so reuse Greater Whirlwind as needed. Mind, however, that even after Demogoron's body is destroyed, you need to deal with the hasted demons he summoned. The fight should last 10-20 seconds if handled properly. Avoid dragging beyond that, as Demogorgon and his demons hit hard and you need the Simulacrum and yourself hitting him constantly. The enemies are very deadly, so several retries may be necessary.\nAfter being successful, write your name in history as the most powerful mortal ever, able to kill the Prince of Demons all by yourself.
