It is initiated within the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Slums\"&gt;Athkatla Slums&lt;/a&gt;.\nAquisition.\nThe player can get two clues regarding the back rooms.\nOne bit of information comes from one or both of the &lt;a href=\"Bouncer%20%28Copper%20Coronet%29\"&gt;Bouncer (Copper Coronet)&lt;/a&gt; guards posted in front of the locked doors on the northside tavern wall. Basically, they say if you need anything, see &lt;a href=\"Lehtinan\"&gt;Lehtinan&lt;/a&gt;. The bouncers don't answer any questions or elaborate.\nAnother potential lead is to buy a drink for &lt;a href=\"Garoll\"&gt;Garoll&lt;/a&gt;, who's seated at a table with a fellow drunk tossing back some ale. Speaking with him and asking the correct questions can lead to some details about what could be behind those doors. But in the end, even Garrol and his sloshed companion make it clear that they should probably shut up about this subject, and you need to see Lehtinan.\nIf a party member does speak with Lehtinan (the Copper Coronet owner), then there are many dialogue choices presented. If the correct ones are selected, and the player persists about wanting to spend some coin, and is curious about the rumored entertainment options available - then eventually he'll have enough trust to allow entry into the back rooms. Seems as though there is some questionable activity going on in the restricted part of the Inn.\nAt this juncture the player's Journal registers this quest, reading as follows:\nWalkthrough and gameplay.\nOnce the party has the quest - it simply implies that back rooms can now be entered and investigated, with no specific goal. \nSo, when ready to do so go ahead and travel to one of the previously locked doors, and go through. If speaking with one of the bouncer guards, he'll say:\nVisit the back rooms and explore.\nThe party can visit with anyone they wish back in these rooms. Perhaps speaking with &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Nin\"&gt;Madame Nin&lt;/a&gt; would be interesting - she's upstairs and can facilitate some \"companionship\" for a fee. Depending on what is said, some party members may disapprove or make other interjections.\nOn the ground level door is opened, a Copper Coronet guard will approach and say:\nGoing through a door to the east leads to the Gladiatorial fighting pit arena. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Frankie\"&gt;Frankie&lt;/a&gt;. Going further within can lead to the &lt;a href=\"Announcer\"&gt;Announcer&lt;/a&gt; initiating a current match in the arena which the party will watch via a cutscene. Some party members may disapprove and make interjections. The fights back here are probably kept secret due to their illegality.\nA corridor leading north on the ground level may indicate two secret passageways (each party member passing by these has a chance to identify their presence). Entering the first is a comfy room adorned with cushions. various hookah pipes are seen. The air is thick with incense. There are some patrons here, and two are awake but are obviously in some kind of abnormal state. One giggles if spoken to, the other says to \"sit down and join is for a spell\". The third is sound asleep and snoring. Could this be some kind of black lotus den?\nThe second passageway leads to a doorway with steps leading downward to the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Slums%20District%29\"&gt;Sewers (Slums District)&lt;/a&gt;. The door is unlocked.\nAt the end of the corridor is a closed door to the north. Opening this door is an east west lateral passageway with various jail style cell doors. A coronet guard will move towards the party and issue a verbal challenge. It seems you aren't supposed to be here. If the party agrees to go back, then all is well. Any other questions or protests lead to hostilities. Several more guards will appear and assault you. Should the party fend off the attacks, one of the occupants of the cell seems quite excited and calls for help. He says he's &lt;a href=\"Hendak\"&gt;Hendak&lt;/a&gt;, a warrior from the far North, and forced to perform in deadly gladiatorial fights. There are other occupants barely visible in other cells, including children.\nSpeak with Hendak.\nIf the party agrees to see what they can do to get Hendak out of this situation, you'll receive the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Hendak%20and%20the%20slaves\"&gt;Free Hendak and the slaves&lt;/a&gt; questline. Several party companions support this action and say so.\nOn the other hand, the party can refuse to help Hendak. Several party companions will admonish CHARNAME if this occurs. If the PC doesn't agree and says he can't help right now the Journal updates:\nIf the party speaks with Lehtinan again.\nRegardless of the decision, if the party returns to speak with Lehtinan at this time and reports what was said, then Lehtinan will hear you out. This can be done even though those guards were killed, and whether the party told Hendak they'd try and free him. There are a few dialogue paths here after you tell him about Hendak.\nFirst, Lehtinan will be appreciative of the information and then ask that you do him another favor and perform a task for him. Return to his cell and kill Hendak. He'll say:\nIf you agree, he'll give you a &lt;a href=\"Beastmaster%20Key\"&gt;Key&lt;/a&gt; to open the cell and then kill the rebellious slave. The player's Journal updates:\nIf you say that you have already performed a service (by telling him of Hendak's plans), and ask for payment, and only then will you consider his other request - Lehtinan says:\nHe bestows a suit of &lt;a href=\"Plate%20Mail\"&gt;Plate Mail&lt;/a&gt; reward, and let's it be known that he wishes Hendak dead. If you agree, the key is provided, all that is left is to go and do the deed.\nOr you can refuse to get involved, and he'll have his \"soon-to-be-fired guards\" take care of it - and wish you a pleasant stay at the Inn. Hendak is now killed by script, which shutters any chance of getting the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Hendak%20and%20the%20slaves\"&gt;Free Hendak and the slaves&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nIf the player agrees to kill Hendak and receives the key, the player's Journal updates with:\nReturn to Hendak.\nUse the key to open Hendak's cell. This allows dialogue. The PC can tell him he's to be killed, and then attack him, and the gladiator he shares his cell with. Once the PC attacks, the party receives .\nOr, don't attack him and tell Hendak that obtaining the key was a ruse, and he's free to take his revenge. Hendak will rejoice and immediately he and fellow slave gladiators will move out and start attacking the Copper Coronet guards and working toward finding Lehtinan. The party receives .\nIf Hendak is killed, return to Lehtinan.\nIf the PC kills Hendak, return to Lehtinan and inform him of the deed, he'll say:\nThe PC is rewarded with &lt;a href=\"Plate%20Mail\"&gt;Plate Mail&lt;/a&gt; (unless provided earlier) and the bastard sword &lt;a href=\"Kondar\"&gt;Kondar&lt;/a&gt;. Also, due to the morals of society at large, a -1 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; penalty."}

The priest's identity depends on &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; and whether they are a &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt; (including dual- and multi-class):\nIf it is Oisig, he will insist:\"This must not come to pass. The everseeing eye of Helm must be made aware of what they intend. You there. You have the look of a man/woman of faith. I would ask a service of you. If you perform well, you may gain the favor of the Temple of Helm. Follow me to the temple of Helm. I will discuss what is required of you there. Do not take too long; Helm requires you now.\"Whether you choose to pursue this quest or not, an entry is made in your Journal, titled A Cult of the Eyeless?\"Some form of new religion or cult has been formed in the city, centered on a god called 'the Unseeing Eye'. A priest of some kind whose own eyes were missing spoke to a crowd, calling on them to shed their 'false sight' and join in the worship of this new god.\"In any case, you must enter the sewers to find where &lt;a href=\"Gaal\"&gt;Gaal&lt;/a&gt; has taken his new acolytes.\nWalkthrough.\nFinding the Cult.\nTransition through the exit in the NW sector of the sewers, nearby the location of &lt;a href=\"Keldorn%20Firecam\"&gt;Keldorn Firecam&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Tunnels\"&gt;The Old Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;.\nPotential Companion.\nWhile exploring the sewers, you will probably find &lt;a href=\"Keldorn%20Firecam\"&gt;Keldorn Firecam&lt;/a&gt;, a potential companion, outside of a short tunnel that branches off to the northwest, which leads to &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Tunnels\"&gt;The Old Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;. Keldorn is figting a lowly &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;. You may assist him, or wait until he defeats it. Either way, he greets you. You might tell him that you are investigating the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Eyeless\"&gt;Cult of the Eyeless&lt;/a&gt;. You may also enlist Keldorn even if your party is full. If you remove a Companion, a chance will be given for you to ask him or her to meet you later at the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Slums\"&gt;Slums District&lt;/a&gt;.\nConfronting Gaal.\nYou will eventually find Gaal, flanked by two of his &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Guard\"&gt;Elite Guard&lt;/a&gt;. For more details about navigating Gaal's Stronghold, see the page for &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Tunnels\"&gt;The Old Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, first Note:\n\"Their machinations be damned, I have decided to take a more direct route with this cult. Brute force will earn their respect, though the violence has apparently summoned their god, the blind beholder itself.\"So to make the most out of the game, talk to Gaal and complete his task as requested. Given a chance, Gaal will initiate dialog.\"Hold, you tread on sacred ground! Only those who serve the Unseeing Eye may enter. I am Gaal, High Priest of the One God.\"You may ask him if there is a way to join the cult without becoming \"Eyeless\". He wants you to retrieve a rod for him and will give you the key to the lower levels.\nChoosing the \"peaceful\" route, or even being rude by replying, \"I'll go where I like, priest\" gives you the opportunity to go and talk to his followers to learn more about the Cult, the \"Lower Places,\" the \"Holy Artifact\" that the Unseeing Eye wants them to retrieve, and the \"Pit of the Faithless.\"\nIf you accept Gaal's offer to retrieve the artifact, he will leave the entrance hall and can be found again in his living quarters.\nFirst half of the Rift Device.\nIf you do not have &lt;a href=\"Gaal%27s%20Key\"&gt;Gaal's Key&lt;/a&gt;, you will not be able to retrieve the rod. Otherwise, take Gaal's Key back to the entrance hallway and use it on the door with the unconventional lock.\nFor more on that section of Gaal's Stronghold, refer to the detailed walkthrough of &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Tunnels\"&gt;The Old Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;. Once you pass through that section, you will find a circular stairwell that spirals down to the next level, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Reaches\"&gt;The Lower Reaches.&lt;/a&gt;\nTo the Lower Reaches.\nAfter navigating the Lower Reaches, and defeating an Emphathic Manifistation in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Forgotten%20God\"&gt;Temple of the Forgotten God&lt;/a&gt;, an avatar of a fading god named &lt;a href=\"Amaunator\"&gt;Amaunator&lt;/a&gt; will speak with you, and give more information on the rod, its use, and its ultimate destruction. The party may or may not also gain experience points based upon how they respond to the avatar's initial question.\nFor more on obtaining the rod from the avatar, refer to the detailed walkthrough in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Reaches%23The%20Forgotten%20God%20Amaunator\"&gt;The Forgotten God Amaunator&lt;/a&gt; section of the page for &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Reaches\"&gt;The Lower Reaches.&lt;/a&gt;\nWhen the Avatar has finished the conversation, he will give you the first half called the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Device%20Part%20%28first%20part%29\"&gt;Rift Device Part&lt;/a&gt;, and your Journal will be updated. He will ask you to use it only once, and then return it to him so that he may destroy it, thereby releasing his perpetually suffering guardians.\nAfter you have obtained the first part of the device, return to The Old Tunnels to speak again with Sassar.\nSecond Rift Device Part.\nAfter returning from the Lower Reaches, &lt;a href=\"Sassar\"&gt;Sassar&lt;/a&gt; will speak to you again and tell you how to obtain the second half of the rod. For more details on his dialog and your Journal update, see &lt;a href=\"Sassar\"&gt;Sassar's page&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo the Lair of the Unseeing Eye.\nSassar says, speak to &lt;a href=\"Tad\"&gt;Tad&lt;/a&gt; with the passphrase \"\"The Eye is Blind\". Tad\" is stationed near the area labeled \"To the Lair of the Unseeing Eye\" on the player's map. See &lt;a href=\"Tad\"&gt;Tad's page&lt;/a&gt; for more detail on his dialog and another Journal update. With the first &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Device%20Part%20%28first%20part%29\"&gt;Rift Device Part&lt;/a&gt; in inventory, talk to Tad as directed. You can then ask him more about what to expect before going down into the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20the%20Faithless\"&gt;Bottom of the Pit of the Faithless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Town\"&gt;Ghoul Town&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Hideout\"&gt;Beholder Hideout&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote also, entering the pit will not allow you to return the same way. Once you are down at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20the%20Faithless\"&gt;Pit of the Faithless&lt;/a&gt;, a status message will be all you see upon clicking the \"exit\" behind you. You will need to find another way out, as this way is now closed to you.\"The pit above is too steep to climb back up. Numerous corpses lie below that have been picked clean.\"When you are prepared, enter the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20the%20Faithless\"&gt;Pit of the Faithless&lt;/a&gt;. Refer to that page for details. Once in the pit, fight through the various undead, which, depending on level, might include &lt;a href=\"Mummy\"&gt;Mummies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghouls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Lord\"&gt;Ghoul Lords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warriors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fiend\"&gt;Shadow Fiends&lt;/a&gt;. An optional area called &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Town\"&gt;Ghoul Town&lt;/a&gt; north of the pit has a treasure stash containing the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20Dexterity\"&gt;Gauntlets of Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. A suit of Leather Armor +4 called &lt;a href=\"Skin%20of%20the%20Ghoul\"&gt;Skin of the Ghoul&lt;/a&gt; is also dropped by the Mayor of Ghoul Town, &lt;a href=\"Theshal\"&gt;Theshal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you are through with the pit and Ghoul Town, head east to enter the Lair of the Unseeing Eye, also known as &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Hideout\"&gt;Beholder Hideout&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the lair are many &lt;a href=\"Gauth\"&gt;Gauths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholders&lt;/a&gt;. The center of the lair also have a number of &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Priest\"&gt;Blind Priests&lt;/a&gt; eager to fight. There are altogether four treasure stashes, one in each quadrant, in the small circular chambers. In the northeastern stash is &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Dragon's Bane&lt;/a&gt;, a Halberd +3. The second &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Device%20Part%20%28second%20part%29\"&gt;Rift Device Part&lt;/a&gt; is southeastern stash.\nAs soon as you put the Rift Device Part into inventory, the two parts of the rod combine into the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Device\"&gt;Rift Device&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0which will appear in &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;'s inventory \"(See &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs\"&gt;Bugs&lt;/a&gt;)\". For joining the rod the party receives 26,250 XP. Have someone equip the Rift Device immediately in a Quick Item Slot, because joining the rod attracts the attention of the Unseeing Eye, who shows up to kill you and your party.\nDestroying the Cult.\nUltimately, to \"Destroy the Cult\" the party must kill the &lt;a href=\"Unseeing%20Eye\"&gt;Unseeing Eye&lt;/a&gt;, preferably within the &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Hideout\"&gt;Beholder Hideout&lt;/a&gt; below The Old Tunnels.\nOnce the Unseeing Eye is dead, leave the Beholder Hideout by the stairs in the south. This exit takes you back to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Tunnels\"&gt;Old Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, emerging behind the secret door that was previously locked and warded against spells. From there, go west to take the staircase down to the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Reaches\"&gt;Lower Reaches&lt;/a&gt; to talk again to the Avatar of Amaunator.\nIf you go back to Gaal, he and some of his Elite Guards will be waiting at their compound's entrance, and angry as they are because you killed their god, they will attack you. Kill them if you wish, it is not essential. If you go past them, whether you killed them or not (If you don't kill them, you can go through them with a stealthed/invisible party member, preferably capable of unlocking the chests further ahead), the rest of the cultists/guards you'll meet at their compound will just walk away and leave peacefully without a word upon seeing you. And this way you can loot all the goodies (gold, gems, arrows, spells, etc.) from their chests and containers without any trouble at all from them. You could say that they turn a blind eye...\nRewards.\nGo back to the robed Diseased One in front of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Forgotten%20God\"&gt;Temple of the Forgotten God&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of dialog choices, you will enter the temple with the Diseased One where the Avatar of &lt;a href=\"Amaunator\"&gt;Amaunator&lt;/a&gt; reappears. For returning the completed rod, and giving hope again to his followers, the party is granted 45,750 XP. He takes the rift device, but for your services he gives you a Medium Shield +3 called &lt;a href=\"Saving%20Grace\"&gt;Saving Grace&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you emerge from the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Sewers&lt;/a&gt; after killing the Unseeing Eye, outside of the &lt;a href=\"Guarded%20Compound\"&gt;Guarded Compound&lt;/a&gt; you might witness a scene in which a &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Knight\"&gt;Shield Knight&lt;/a&gt; proclaims\": \"The false god is dead and his foul prophets will fall with him!\"\". After that, the Shield Knight executes a nearby Cult Prophet who cries out with his last breath: \"The sightless shall rise again! Aaagh!\"\nReturn to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt; and the priest who hired you to receive 45,750 XP per party member and a +1 to Reputation. If Gorion's Ward is not a cleric, you will be further rewarded with the mace &lt;a href=\"Ardulia%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Ardulia's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. If Gorion's Ward is a cleric you will be offered a position in the temple, which, updates your Journal under \"Cleric Stronghold.\""}

Use it to open the cell and split 12,250 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; with the party. Mazzy Fentan will greet you, and be available for recruitment. Search the cell for a hidden treasure stash, and be sure to grab &lt;a href=\"Tombelthen%27s%20Journal%20%28second%20half%29\"&gt;Tombelthen's Journal (second half)&lt;/a&gt;, an item needed for the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-Protector%20of%20the%20Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Ranger-Protector of the Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt; quest.\nSun Gem Pedestal.\nCheck the pillar to the southeast of the prison for a scroll describing the &lt;a href=\"Morn%20Ritual\"&gt;Morning Ritual&lt;/a&gt;. Continue on to find a Pedestal of Light. After fighting off the shadows, grab the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Gem\"&gt;Sun Gem&lt;/a&gt; which you need to open the first Shadow Door back in the corridor.\nStatue of Ritual.\nTo the northeast of the Prison stands the Statue of Ritual. You will need find all the broken tablets describing the three holy rituals that Amaunator's faithful performed to honor dawn, midday, and dusk.\nThe statue will give you three tests. Complete all three successfully and the party will split .\nYou'll retrieve one of the three &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Amaunator\"&gt;Symbol of Amaunator&lt;/a&gt; fragments (1/3) after the tests, the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Ray%20Symbol\"&gt;Sun Ray Symbol&lt;/a&gt;.\nLava Pool.\nMake your way back to the entrance corridor and go through the first shadow door. You will find your way blocked again by another shadow door. Go back to a room with a wooden bridge and fight the shadows and shade wolves there.\nBeyond is a lava room with two treasure caches and a trapped mural. You can skirt the edges to help avoid fire damage, but it is recommended to boost fire resistance via spells or scrolls before attempting to cross.\nUndead Room.\nTo the east of the lava room is a small square chamber pyramid-shaped column/container. Before you can raid it for the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Amaunator\"&gt;Tome of Amaunator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Noontide%20Ritual\"&gt;Noon Ritual&lt;/a&gt; scroll, and a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Wyvern%20Call\"&gt;Wyvern Call&lt;/a&gt;, take care of the group of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. What type of and how many of them are encountered, depends on &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;:\nAmuana's Tomb.\nTo the west of the lava pool is another room with a tomb and two ghostly figures, Badon and Dettseh. They will trade &lt;a href=\"Amuana%27s%20Bones\"&gt;Amuana's Bones&lt;/a&gt; for the second fragment (2/3), the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Light%20Symbol\"&gt;Dawn's Light Symbol&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dragon%20Wardstone\"&gt;Shadow Dragon Wardstone&lt;/a&gt;. The party splits for the exchange. Be sure to check the tomb for a &lt;a href=\"Sunstone%20Bullet\"&gt;Sunstone Bullets&lt;/a&gt; and a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt;. Dettseh carried 250 . Head southwest across the chasm to the shadow corridor on the south side of the second shadow door, then turn left to proceed to the tile room.\nTile Room.\nTo the east of the corridor is a short passage into the Tile Room where another pack of undead (of the same types and numbers described above) awaits you. You can fight them here, or lead them back on the lava. Go east into the Tile Room after the fight.\nYou need to walk \"A - M - A - U - N - A - T - O - R\" in the next puzzle grid.\nInside a far room to the right is the last fragment. Either kill the &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; or help him to the other side where he tries to kill you anyway. The fragment is kept in his cell (3/3), the &lt;a href=\"Lightstone%20Symbol\"&gt;Lightstone Symbol&lt;/a&gt;. In the left room is a statue which is also a container. You can loot the container. Clicking on the statue will say that it looks like it's waiting for you to put something in its arms, but that is unrelated to this quest (see &lt;a href=\"The%20final%20battle%20with%20Bodhi\"&gt;The final battle with Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;). Either way, go to the cell to the west of where the Shadow was, defeat the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Golem\"&gt;Bone Golem&lt;/a&gt; and take the loot, which includes the Shadow's key that unlocks the barrier to the southeast.\nShadow Dragon Lair.\nThe exit to the southeast will lead to &lt;a href=\"Thaxll%27ssillyia\"&gt;Thaxll'ssillyia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Lord\"&gt;Shade Lord&lt;/a&gt;'s pet shadow dragon. With the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dragon%20Wardstone\"&gt;Shadow Dragon Wardstone&lt;/a&gt; it will not become hostile right away, allowing you to walk past and take the stairs outside. Or, you can use the time to prepare, before trying to kill the dragon. Note that in BG2EE versions, setting traps or summoning help may turn the Dragon Hostile (even if you have the Ward Stone).\nThe Shade Lord.\nOnce you get pass Thaxll'ssillyia, take the stair up to go back outside into a previously blocked area of the Temple Ruins. You will be confronted with the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Lord\"&gt;Shade Lord&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Altar\"&gt;Shadow Altar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Patrick\"&gt;Shadow Patrick&lt;/a&gt;. Have someone equip a sling with Sunstone bullets to kill the Shadow Altar in one hit. This will keep anymore shadows from spawning. Kill the Shade Lord who is worth , and Shadow Patrick worth .\nMerella the Ranger.\nYou will also find the dying Merella here. Talk to her once and she'll give up the ghost. Check her body for notable loot.\nBack to Umar Hills.\nHead back to report your success to Minister Lloyd for your reward. Regardless of dialog choices, your &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; increases by 1, and Lloyd gives you the &lt;a href=\"The%20Night%27s%20Gift\"&gt;The Night's Gift&lt;/a&gt; leather armor. Any additional gold, material, or experience awards depend upon the player's dialog choices:\nBugs.\nIt is recommended to complete Madulf's quest, &lt;a href=\"Madulf%20wants%20to%20make%20a%20deal%20with%20the%20village\"&gt;Madulf wants to make a deal with the village&lt;/a&gt;, before going to the Temple Ruins to free Mazzy. If you do not finish Madulf's quest before heading off to the Temple Ruins, and you later talk to Mayor Minister Lloyd with Mazzy in your party, she will have the extra dialogue with him, and you will no longer be able to send Lloyd to talk to the ogres to finished Madulf's quest. Also if you tell him you no longer want to do the quest Mazzy will get mad and leave the party.\nAlternatively, it is possible to visit Mayor's house while leaving Mazzy outside. This way you can still turn in Madulf's request and - after a while - come back (once again without Mazzy) to check for the result of the talk between the Mayor and the ogres. Afterwards you can report the Shadelord's death and finish this quest as well. Above limitations about the quest reward still apply.\nMod Content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Unfinished Business (Baldur's Gate II)&lt;/a&gt; Mod Restored Items component places the Bastard Sword &lt;a href=\"Taragarth%20the%20Bloodbrand\"&gt;Taragarth the Bloodbrand&lt;/a&gt; inside the Ranger Cabin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises all enemy creatures in the area and especially in the dungeons.

The spell's range is basically at touch distance.\nWhen the spell is finished, a text is displayed reading \"Invisible\".\nThe spell recipient will show a brief lighting effect and color fade graphic over their sprite, and a sound effect will audible.\nOnce applied, the recipient is under a state of normal invisibility for up to 24-hours.\nNotes.\nDifferent from &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Hide In Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, the invisibility state granted by spells or items behaves in similar fashion to the priest spell &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The following actions may be performed without breaking the invisible and sanctuary state:\nInvisible creatures cannot be targeted by spells that are directed at a single target - whether hostile or beneficial. An exception is discussed below.\nFor example, a priest cannot heal an invisible mage with a touch spell, but the mage can still receive buffs and cures that apply to the entire party. If an enemy is in the process of casting a single-target spell at someone who then turns invisible before the mage is finished, then the spell usually fails. \nHowever, one targeting exception in the unmodified game applies to Spell Protection removing spells (Magic Attack type). Spells such as &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Word\"&gt;Secret Word&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt; and others can target invisible and hidden creatures. The &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; spell on the other hand, can't target an invisible creature. These inconsistencies can lead to beginning player confusion. \nMaking a melee attack from invisibility gives a 4 point &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; bonus to the first attack, including against enemies that can naturally see through invisibility (eg dragons, planetars etc.).\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Divination&lt;/a&gt;: protects the invisible character from being revealed by any Divination Attack type spell or ability, such as &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20Purge\"&gt;Invisibility Purge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;Detect Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo quickly break the invisible &amp; sanctuaried state by having the character \"talk to itself\".\nPosition invisible party members to block the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23B\"&gt;choke point&lt;/a&gt; and attack from safety with extended reach two-handed weapons, missile attacks or spells. Other fun tactics include surrounding a single foe with four invisible party members, effectively locking it in place.\nThe more powerful version of this spell is &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, which has a shorter duration but additional benefits.\nSome supernatural creatures and powerful bosses can completely ignore any kind of invisibility/stealth and can still target you. Have a look at the &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; page for details.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Invisibility\" allows all highly Intelligent (Intelligence 13 or more) creatures with 10 or more Hit Dice or levels of experience to have a chance to detect invisible objects (they roll saving throws vs. spell; success means they noticed the invisible object).\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its duration. See below for description:\nInvisibility\nLevel: 2\nSchool: Illusion\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Special\nCasting Time: 2\nArea of Effect: 1 creature\nSaving Throw: None\nThis spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around him such as opening doors, disarming traps, or opening chests. An invisible creature can drink a potion or cast non-attack spells centered on himself and remain invisible, but he cannot attack nor cast spells on other targets without ending the spell.

Magic resistance does not affect this spell.\nFor the Druid/Ranger/Shaman classes, SR adds a new divine level 1 spell for use to find invisible and hidden enemies, as described below:\nFaerie Fire\nLevel: 1\nSchool: Evocation\nSphere: Weather\nRange: Long\nDuration: 4 rounds\nCasting Time: 1\nArea of Effect: 5\u2019 radius\nSaving Throw: Spell negates\nWhen this spell is cast, a pale glow surrounds and outlines all enemies within the area of effect, making their position and movements easily visible. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, invisibility, or similar effects, and suffer a -2 penalty to AC. Those who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell are totally unaffected by the spell. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined."}

They are akin to &lt;a href=\"Air%20Elemental\"&gt;Air Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s or the &lt;a href=\"Aerial%20servant%20%28creature%29\"&gt;Aerial servant (creature)&lt;/a&gt; and like their kin can be &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Stalker%20%28spell%29\"&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Material%20Plane\"&gt;Prime Material Plane&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s to do their bidding.\nAs elementals, Invisible Stalkers cannot be killed on the Prime Material Plane, but rather destroyed and banished back to the Elemental Plane of Air.\nGameplay.\nLike their name suggests, these creatures are able to remain invisible at all times, even while performing physical attacks and highly resistant to missile attacks. However, in terms of the actual effect of the invisibility, once the creature breaks it via an attack it can be targeted as any other non-invisible creature, and it never attains actual invisibility again, due to the method applied by the &lt;a href=\"MAGE01.ITM\"&gt;MAGE01.ITM&lt;/a&gt; ring it has equipped. \nInvisibility removing and divination attack spells or Dispel magic effects will remove the invisibility from the creature, as it is furnished by the ring it wears and not the creature file itself. The item it wears in a ring slot assists it with attaining initial invisibility. There is a different creature file Invisible Stalker that has always on &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the normal invisibility, but that variety cannot be summoned by the spell.\nThe player will observe a red circle with a shadow animation for the creature when it can be targeted by attacks. If it is a party summoned, then the circle will not be red.\nA stalker conjured by the &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Stalker%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Invisible Stalker (spell)&lt;/a&gt; arcane spell has a gender assigned as \"summoned\" and thus may be banished by a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn combat, the stalker receives a bonus to hit when attacking from invisibility. It does not perform a &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; in an unmodified game. The stalkers attack is classified as a +2 enchanted item for the purposes of what it can hit and inflicts crushing damage plus extra for its strength modifier. Under normal circumstances the Stalker only attempts one attack per round. Modded content may increase this, see below.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod's summoned \"Invisible Stalker\" is changed from the unmodified game:\nInvisible Stalker (8 Hit Dice):\nSTR 18, DEX 19, CON 14, INT 11, WIS 14, CHA 11; AL Neutral\nHP 64, AC -2, THAC0 7, Saving Throws 10/12/11/12/13\n2 Attacks Per Round, 2d6+4 Crushing Damage (Fist +2)\nCombat Abilities:\nSneak Attack: can backstab opponents with a x2 multiplier\nSpecial Qualities:\nHide in Shadows: 120%\nNatural Invisibility: constantly invisible as if affected by an Improved Invisibility spell\nImmune to charm, confusion, hold, poison, sleep, &amp; stun effects\nSlashing, Crushing, &amp; Piercing Resistance 20%; Missile Resistance 60%\nNote that this modded version of the stalker cannot be targeted by single-target spells and is actually under constant Improved Invisibility. The coding for this is implemented differently than the unmodified game creatures. Thus, the creature will also get the Improved Invisibility benefits, the same as the spell, and they cannot be removed by a dispel magic effect. In order to get the backstab to work, and the Hide in Shadows, the creature is assigned a Ranger Class like the Stalker Kit. A new script is assigned as well to regulate targeting, melee behavior and to prioritize attacks on helpless opponents."}

These magicians have an extended lifespan. Iqbal is part of Hexxat's second quest, to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20the%20Unproved\"&gt;Shroud of the Unproved&lt;/a&gt; for her master \"L\" (Larloch). \nGame Play.\nEach magician has some dialogue, which will begin when Hexxat enters the library, and if she is visible. All dialogue choices eventually lead to hostility with the magicians.\nOnce Hostile, the magicians cast Spell Deflection and Stoneskin, followed by an obscure reference to a \"Tatoo of Power' or other \"Tatoo\" variations - this is just embellished text for dramatic effect (there is no \"Tatoo of Power\" spell in the game). Mirror images may be cast, perhaps Power Word, Silence. Offensively they will use Greater Malison and Lightning Bolts or Chain Lightning. Most of their memorized spells are not used. They do not attempt to Breach a target, nor do they try and take down any spell protections. They will cast a single target spell at a party member that is protected from single target spells, like Spell Deflection or Spell Trap. \nOne peculiar thing about these spell casters is that thy all cast the same spell, at the same target, at the same time. For instance, you might be on the receiving end of three Greater Malison, or three Power Word, Silence spells.\nThe AI for these creatures is not very adaptable, and does not react to what spells or protections your party has up. They do not move out of clouds or AOE spells if there are no opponents in their visual range. If anyone is within their visual range they will attempt to close the distance to cast spells at them. They cannot open the door to the library if you close it, but they will follow the party if the door is left open. For example, you could fire a &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; into the library, then close the door, and you may slay the whole group without any dialogue being uttered. These creatures are humans, not Undead or ghosts of some sort. They have have no special immunities or secret buffs. Their undroppable amulet provides at least one instance of Stoneskin protection.\nAlthough Iqbal is a level 20 Sorcerer, he has no memorized 8th or 9th level spells. Iqbal also is provided with four memorized Cleric Spells.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod will update this creature's spell book to the SR versions. For instance, instead of the 5th level spell &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; cast at the party, it will be the SR spell \"Waves of Fatigue\". Instead of the 7th Level Spell &lt;a href=\"Mantle\"&gt;Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, it will be the SR version \"Prismatic Mantle\"."}

These include prisons, libraries, bedrooms and even laboratory cloning rooms. This base appears to be underneath &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; and may be part of the old sanitary/storm water sewer system of the City of Coin. This multilevel sprawling complex is a mixture of modified old sewers, abandoned temple areas, storage rooms. strange portals and newer workshops with furnaces and work bays. It is an underground lair of epic complexity. There is a connection to the still active sewer system, and once your character escapes this place, you end up in &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main character and a few starting companions are initially trapped here in the prison room (Area 1).\nRooms of the dungeon.\nAt the very start of the game (Area 1), Imoen has some how escaped from her cage-like cell and will let &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; free from his cell. Jaheira and Minsc are nearby, in two other cages or cells. Jaheira's door can be opened with a key located on top of the table in Area 2 (the Key item description says \"A typical cell key that one might find in any jail. This one may fit Jaheira's cell.\") - but Minsc's cell has no lock (the cage is welded shut) and the &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; has to be provoked to a fit of rage to break free. If there are player-created characters other than Gorion's Ward, they will be in this room as well. They do not require any extra effort to open the doors to their cells.\nIn the Weapons Room (Area 2), there are basic weapons and armors for the main character and his companions to use, because their original gear from the first Baldur's Gate game was taken away and presumably sold. There is also a hidden stash behind a trapped picture in this room where you can retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20%2B1\"&gt;Dagger +1&lt;/a&gt;, 3 &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Potions of Healing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Pantaloons\"&gt;Golden Pantaloons&lt;/a&gt; if the main character had them in the last game. Imoen\u2019s current thieving abilities will disarm and unlock this stash with relative ease. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Jailkeep%20Golem\"&gt;Jailkeep Golem&lt;/a&gt; that was not designed to attack escaping inmates (as it was not expected for anyone to escape), it will only tell you to get back into the jail cells. \nThe Portal Rooms (Areas 3 and 17) are magic portals that lead to the &lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27%20Dungeon%20%28Level%202%29\"&gt;second level of the dungeon&lt;/a&gt; once the key from Area 16 has been retrieved.\nThe Electricity Power Room (Area 4) is where a buzzing contraption that seems like a battery to produce electrical power and to spawn Lightning Mephits. It produces lightning that can harm the party. It can be turned off with a switch that will also grant 2000 &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crystal Room (Area 5) is a room full of pools and magic crystals that show images of cityscapes and presumably other things as well. &lt;a href=\"Aataqah\"&gt;Aataqah&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Genie\"&gt;Genie&lt;/a&gt; will be here to ask the player a question that will lead to different outcomes. See the &lt;a href=\"Aataqah%27s%20Question\"&gt;quest notes for the possible outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the genie will suggest to Gorion's Ward to seek out Rielev and then disappear.\nThe Laboratory (Area 7) has several tubes, a few of which contain strange creatures that appear to be in a state of suspended animation. These tubes can be powered by power cells collected from &lt;a href=\"Rielev\"&gt;Rielev&lt;/a&gt;. The creatures inside will provide mostly minor hints on the nature of &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;. The trapped locked box contains a &lt;a href=\"Quarterstaff%20%2B1\"&gt;Quarterstaff +1&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Storage room marked as Area 6 contains a &lt;a href=\"Sewage%20Golem\"&gt;Sewage Golem&lt;/a&gt; charged with cleaning the dungeon's sewers. As the golem has no eyes, it will mistake Gorion's Ward for Irenicus and offer to perform its services. Allowing it to do so will open the way to Area 13.\nBehind a closed door is Area 8. Within are two &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Lesser Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, that are standing in a dormant state. Perhaps they await orders or are currently inactivated.\nRielev's Chamber is Area 9 and in it is the glass container that contains Rielev. The creature inside will task the party with taking out the container's &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Cells\"&gt;Energy Cells&lt;/a&gt;, thus killing it for 4000 XP award. The energy cell can then be used to power several more tubes and containers at the Laboratory area.\nAmong the books in the Library (Area 10), a diligent adventurer will find some useful potions and scrolls. Further down the corridor some &lt;a href=\"Duergar\"&gt;Duergar&lt;/a&gt;s will challenge the party (Area 11). One of them, a Duergar known as &lt;a href=\"Ilyich\"&gt;Ilyich&lt;/a&gt;, wears &lt;a href=\"Mail%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Mail of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; (by default) or some other type of armor from the &lt;a href=\"Importing%20a%20Character\"&gt;list of imported items&lt;/a&gt; in case Gorion's Ward was imported from &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; wearing the armor. Also be sure to collect the &lt;a href=\"Acorns\"&gt;Acorns&lt;/a&gt; needed for the &lt;a href=\"Helping%20Irenicus%27s%20captive%20dryads\"&gt;Helping Irenicus's captive dryads&lt;/a&gt; quest.\nContinuing down the corridor from the Duergar room, a door is present on the left side of the corridor at the point where the corridor turns right (not marked on map). This is a portal to the Elemental Plane of Air and leads to the &lt;a href=\"freeing%20the%20djinni\"&gt;freeing the djinni&lt;/a&gt; quest. To activate the portal, the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Elemental%20Statue\"&gt;Air Elemental Statue&lt;/a&gt; must be in your possession.\nThe corridor ends at Area 12 where a &lt;a href=\"Cambion%20%28Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon%29\"&gt;Cambion&lt;/a&gt; is trapped inside a magical sphere. There is a strange machine in the center of the room. If a player examines the machine a text display reads:\nIf the player continues with the lever, a text says:\nThe Fiend attacks! Upon death it is worth 6000 XP and drops a &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Bastard Sword +1&lt;/a&gt;.\nArea 13 (now opened) contains a single &lt;a href=\"Otyugh\"&gt;Otyugh&lt;/a&gt; worth 5000 XP and leads to Irenicus' chambers.\nBeware of the traps in Master\u2019s and Mistress\u2019 Rooms (Areas 14 and 16). The Master's room contains the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Helm of Balduran&lt;/a&gt; in a trapped chest along with the Air Elemental Statue and other loot. Turning right out of the room leads towards a small grassy area with a single tree (as strange as that sounds underground) and three &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s. They will ask to be &lt;a href=\"Helping%20Irenicus%27s%20captive%20dryads\"&gt;set free&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the acorns held by &lt;a href=\"Ilyich\"&gt;Ilyich&lt;/a&gt; in Area 10.\nThe next area (the Mistress' Room) contains the key to the portals in Areas 3 and 17 and the &lt;a href=\"Pommel%20Jewel%20of%20the%20Equalizer\"&gt;Pommel Jewel of the Equalizer&lt;/a&gt;. Entering this room will also sound an intruder alarm and will turn the golems from Area 8 hostile (unless you have previously destroyed them). These golems will race on foot to wherever your party is located on the first floor.

It replaces the pathetic goblins with duergar (which I think has a better \"feel\" to it in any case) and it prevents you from sleeping more than once. (I allow you to sleep once because (i) it gives you a chance to choose your spells, and (ii) Imoen has some rest-related dialogue that I don't want to block.)\nThe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//artisans-corner.com/shadow-magic/\"&gt;Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a special ring [Ring of Black Light, +1 Constitution, +4 Save vs Death; requires 15 wisdom] to the equipment found at the very start of the dungeon, usable by a protagonist with one of the mod's added kits. It also adds a Shadow Chest to the Mistress Room. It can be opened by a protagonist with one of the mod's added kits. Doing so spawns a number of Shadows that attack the party, destroys the Chest, and grants four scrolls with Shadow spells. \n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/Argent77/A7-SkipChateauIrenicus\"&gt;Skip Chateau Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; allows the player to bypass the dungeon entirely while still receiving all the items and XP they would have gained.

This area appears to be underneath &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt; considering that, once your character escapes this place, you end up in Waukeen's Promenade.\nRooms of the Dungeon.\nThe adventure starts at the Portal Room (Area 1), which connects this area to the first floor of the &lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon%201st%20Floor\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving through the portal initiates dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Hunter\"&gt;Bounty Hunter&lt;/a&gt; who also appears to have been kidnapped by Irenicus, who offers to join the party in their escape attempt. Refusing Yoshimo's offer at this point will make him leave the dungeon on his own and relocate in the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt; where he can be recruited in .\nThe next room (Area 2) contains various Mephits spawning through four &lt;a href=\"Mephit%20Portal\"&gt;Mephit Portal&lt;/a&gt;s. Each portal spawns a specific mephit type (&lt;a href=\"Smoke%20Mephit\"&gt;Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Mephit\"&gt;Ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Mephit\"&gt;Magma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Mephit\"&gt;Radiant&lt;/a&gt;, in that order from nearest to furthest) and each mephit is spawned once the previous one is killed. Destroying a portal ceases Mephits from spawning from it and grants 5000 &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;. The dead body of &lt;a href=\"Khalid\"&gt;Khalid&lt;/a&gt; is laid down on a rack. If &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt; is in the party at that point, she will lament his loss and swear vengeance upon the murderer. She will refuse to &lt;a href=\"Harper%27s%20Call\"&gt;raise him&lt;/a&gt;, as his body was \"desecrated\". There are also several containers with various loot. One should carefully collect all the items as they will be needed soon. There are two doors on the Northern side of the room, leading to areas 3 and 4.\nThe Cloning Facility at Area 3 contains various containers holding clones of a &lt;a href=\"Ellesime\"&gt;particular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; woman. One of the clones has escaped and is battling an &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;. The party will have to kill the clone eventually and obtain its Wand Key.\nArea 4 marks the beginning of a long corridor. There is an assassin fighting a Mephit here, both are hostile to the party. The path leads to a trapped bridge (Area 5), which, in turn, leads to a broad hallway (areas 6 and 7). This area is heavily trapped. Another assassin is charging some &lt;a href=\"Duergar\"&gt;Duergar&lt;/a&gt; here but will inevitably trigger a trap and die. The duergar will then target the party and try to lure them into a trap. Using ranged weapons against them or luring them to trigger the floor traps themselves is advisable. Once the duergar are dead, the traps can be disarmed. To do so just activate the columns on the Northern wall with the Wand Keys. Upon usage, each Wand Key will turn into a regular Wand with just 1 charge. Once the hallways have been cleared, the party can loot the statue at the end of the hallway, which contains a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Princes\"&gt;Ring of the Princes&lt;/a&gt; +1.\nHere is a list of the Wand Keys for Area 7, which are scattered in various locations around the dungeon:\nFour doors lead out from the hallway. The northern-most hallway leads to Area 8 (the Vampire Room) where the &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ulvaryl\"&gt;Ulvaryl&lt;/a&gt; is encountered fighting some &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thieves&lt;/a&gt;. If the party is quick enough, it can defeat the vampire for 8000 XP. However, if the party's not quick enough, Ulvaryl will slay the thieves and escape.\nThe eastern-most hallway on the south wall leads to a room inhabited with &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s (Area 9), followed by a forge and Duergar smiths (Area 10). Looting the corpses and the stashes will provide the party with the &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%20of%20the%20Hills\"&gt;Destroyer of the Hills&lt;/a&gt; among the other (minor) loot.\nThe middle hallway leads to a glass walled cell where &lt;a href=\"Frennedan\"&gt;Frennedan&lt;/a&gt; is locked (Area 11). He will plead to be set free, which leads to a &lt;a href=\"Free%20Frennedan%20from%20his%20cell\"&gt;side quest&lt;/a&gt;. Besides from the XP award for solving the quest, there is some loot in the trapped containers in both the rooms, including some spell scrolls.\nThe fourth hallway will eventually lead the party to the above-ground exit. There are some Shadow Thieves that will attack the party around Area 12 as well as some traps along the way. Reaching Area 13 finishes and initiates a cut scene. Make sure you have taken all the loot you need and finished all quests before leaving, because the dungeon becomes inaccessible after exiting."}

He sought the destabilization of Baldur's Gate's political elites in order to get elected as the Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate. He would then use that position to start a war with Amn which would help him ascend to the throne of &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; through the massive amounts of death caused by such an endeavor.\nWhile the Sembian headquarters was aware of the plan to create a stranglehold on the iron ore trade along the Sword Coast, they were obviously not aware of Sarevok's plans and as communications with the Baldur's Gate &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Throne%20Headquarters\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; became more infrequent, they sent an &lt;a href=\"Kalessia\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; to determine why this branch of the Iron Throne has foundered.\nWhen the time came for Sarevok's coronation ceremony, a party of adventurers lead by another &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt;, interrupted the proceedings and exposed Sarevok's plans to the city's leaders and nobility who were gathered in the &lt;a href=\"Ducal%20Palace\"&gt;Ducal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. After a short battle, Sarevok fled to his &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;inner sanctum&lt;/a&gt; with the help of his mentor &lt;a href=\"Winski%20Perorate\"&gt;Winski Perorate&lt;/a&gt;. There Sarevok, along with his allies &lt;a href=\"Tazok\"&gt;Tazok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Semaj\"&gt;Semaj&lt;/a&gt;, fought a great battle with the Bhaalspawn and party and were eventually defeated and killed.\nThis brought and end to the Iron Crisis and the looming specter of war with the nation of Amn."}

They have Magic Resistance 100% (can be overcome by &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;), as well as immunity to &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage\"&gt;elemental damage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; will actually heal the golem instead of harming it. Iron Golems are completely invulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt;, and several other &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;Status Effects&lt;/a&gt; as identified in the Info Box. \nThe golem's melee attack dishes out 4d10 &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt;, with a +12 bonus due to their exceptional strength. The fist attack counts as a +4 enchanted item for the purpose of determining what it can strike. They strike once per round, and have a reach of 2 ft., the same as a &lt;a href=\"quarterstaff\"&gt;quarterstaff&lt;/a&gt;. If under the effect of &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Haste\"&gt;Golem Haste&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt;, they have two attacks per round.\nIron Golems possess the innate ability to create a &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Cloud\"&gt;Gas Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, which causes poison damage. See the link for details.\nThey can be found in several locations in the saga. \nGameplay.\nDue to their huge size, Iron Golems are prone to get stuck at doorways. One could use this to their advantage. Ranged weapons and missile fire could be employed to strike the golem and keep the party at a safe distance from the creature. As the golem's reach is 2 ft., it may not be safe for a party member to engage in melee combat, even if they also have weapon with a reach of 2 ft. On several internet forums and \"walk throughs\" it is suggested that &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteors&lt;/a&gt; are ideal to inflict damage at range to a golem, as they are a +6 enchanted item. However, as the missile also deals fire damage, this will actually apply a healing effect to an Iron Golem because of their 125% fire resistance. \nGallery\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod and the installation of the \"AI Enhancements\" component improves many aspects of creatures encountered in the game. In regards to golems, the mod implements the following:\nImproved Golems (BG2, BG2EE, BGT/EET)&lt;br&gt;\nThis component doesn't really make golems smarter (they're supposed to be stupid) But it streamlines their scripts a bit, gives their weapons a sensible range, makes them immune to \"Lower Resistance\" and to poison, and tries to prevent situations where golems get stuck behind barricades. It also fixes an animation glitch in the Iron Golem animation - this hopefully makes iron golems a bit prettier when they attack and blow clouds.\nIron golems are immune to the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt; spells.&lt;br&gt;\nIf you damage an iron golem, and then decide to back away and rest somewhere, to continue the fight later, the golem will be restored to full health.&lt;br&gt;\nThe golem has a advanced script allowing better targeting and tactical behavior. It will also apply its Gas Cloud at least every three rounds of combat&lt;br&gt;\nThe golem will do a better job of chasing down PC party members attacking from afar, as long as it can reach them via movement. It will follow and hunt down attackers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; Mod adds a necessary lootable component to Iron golems, so that the player can start amassing enough material in order to build its own \"lesser Iron Golem\", \"Iron Golem\", \"Greater Iron Golem or \"Perfect Iron Golem\". The mod also changes the appearance of the Iron golem, to differentiate it from the Adamantite golem."}

This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the druid in no way. The effect of this is to protect the druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. One skin is gained for every two levels of the caster. For each skin the druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against her but the sixth would affect her normally. The skins will remain on the druid until she is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.\nIt is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of inflicting some type of elemental damage can still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative."}

They have been known for attempted assassinations, thuggery and trading with enemies.\nThis organisation is responsible for the iron shortage around the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast\"&gt;Sword Coast&lt;/a&gt;, by killing workers in the &lt;a href=\"Nashkel%20Mines\"&gt;Nashkel Mines&lt;/a&gt; and making their ore unsuited for weapons and tools by contaminating the ore brought out of the mines with a certain substance and disrupting trade routes with hired &lt;a href=\"Bandit\"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt;s and blaming this on &lt;a href=\"Amn\"&gt;Amn&lt;/a&gt;. This plan was orchestrated to skyrocket the price of the iron ore and all products which require iron and thereby making a huge profit as well, at the cost of Baldur's Gate and other inhabitants of the Sword Coast region. This plan also required the elimination of rival merchants guilds, such as the Seven Suns.\nWhen the hostility between Baldur's Gate and Amn was high enough, the Iron Throne would offer a deal to the Dukes of Baldur's Gate to sell them good iron ore, weapon and armor, which they had stockpiled from their operations. The first one is from their hired mercenaries who raided caravans under the disguise of bandits and the second operation is the secret mine in the Cloakwood.\nAfter the Iron Throne would have made a huge profit, they would have made amends to lessen the hostility between Baldur's Gate and Amn and preventing them from going into war, because that would have been disastrous for trade in the Sword Coast. This plan would have succeeded if the insider, &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt;, who executed some\u00a0part of this plan, didn't have his own agenda in mind.

The party may decide to kill him for his &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Leather%20Armor%20%2B1\"&gt;Studded Leather Armor +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Short%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Short Sword +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Agility\"&gt;Potion of Agility&lt;/a&gt;, and , along with 975 &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe body of the real Emissary Tar is found in a room to the southwest.\nNone of the containers here hold anything except for the drawer to the southeast, which contains a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person\"&gt;Hold Person&lt;/a&gt;, a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Tuth%20to%20Rieltar\"&gt;Letter from Tuth to Rieltar&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Sarevok%20to%20Rieltar\"&gt;Letter from Sarevok to Rieltar&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay suggestion (community).\nThe mage spell &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; can make a character untargetable by enemy magic for a limited time. Other options include &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Shielding\"&gt;Potions of Magic Shielding&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Protection\"&gt;Potions of Magic Protection&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoof.\nTaking the stairway up from the fifth floor will lead to the rooftop which is empty except for a few objects to examine. This area is unique within the city limits of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, as the party is able to &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; safely here without being interrupted by members of the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist\"&gt;Flaming Fist&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasement.\nThe basement is accessed by a staircase down on the east side of the first floor. A guard will immediately approach and question the party.

The northern one contains , a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Acid%20%28scroll%29\"&gt;Protection From Acid&lt;/a&gt;, and a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Cold%20%28scroll%29\"&gt;Protection From Cold&lt;/a&gt;.

Also, she may appear when doppelgangers in Fuernebol\u2019s and/or Kiel\u2019s form shapeshift into her form during battle. So it is possible to confront up to a total of three or more Islanne\u2019s.\nThrone Room.\nDoppelganger forms of Fuernebol and Islanne will enter the room during Durlag's lament for Kiel. Once he finishes with his dialogue, all three will cast spells; Durlag and Fuernebol will cast &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; and Islanne will cast &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;.

It is possible that one of the two will be in Islanne's form. Once fighting begins, she will cycle through the spell progression and the same form progression as described above when receiving damage.\nIf the greater doppelganger form of Islanne is killed fast enough, she will drop a &lt;a href=\"Traveler%27s%20Robe\"&gt;Traveler's Robe&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Quarterstaff\"&gt;Quarterstaff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure%23RNDTRE05\"&gt;rich random treasure&lt;/a&gt;.

She will not speak until spoken to. All she offers is some final thoughts about Durlag and the tower, along with a fast way out of this level and back to the open sky.\nNotes.\nInfobox stats:\nBugs.\nIn the original ', Islanne is technically a &lt;a href=\"male\"&gt;male&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;.

They are usually considered a better alternative to running around naked, and come with several characteristics that may be of use to the morally dubious profession of adventurer.\nMagical.\nWhether an item is magical or not is relevant to weapons and ammunition, i.e. things you throw at people so they can become rotting corpses.\nEnchantment level.\nEnchantment level is another characteristic only relevant to weapons and ammunition.\nUsability.\nNot everybody can use every item. Whether you can make use of something usually depends on character &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ability%20score\"&gt;ability score&lt;/a&gt;s, and sometimes on &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt;.\nPower level.\nMost things in the world change through effects, and not through causes as you would expect. All effects have a power level, so this notion applies to items, but also spells and much more.\nCaster level.\nItems often have \"effects\" attached to them. Some of these effects are active at all times when the item is equipped \u2013 they are often called \"passive\" or \"equipped\" effects. Any other effect must be applied explicitly, through the use of the \"item ability\" they belong to. An item ability is a cohesive list of several effects, and this list possesses certain characteristics like a school of magic. So an item ability is very similar to a spell, and like a spell it can make use of the caster level.\nWhen it comes to item abilities, caster level is most often used to determine the odds that &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; will be able to remove the ability's dispellable effects. Sometimes it may also affect duration or potency, just like with spells. Unlike spells however, in most cases an item ability will not rely on the level of the character using it, but on a fixed value: level 6 in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and level 10 in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II&lt;/a&gt;. So a level 12 character trying to dispel effects from potions can expect a 60% chance of success in BGII even when the potion user is level 20.\nSome effects within item abilities are casting effects themselves. They will attempt to \"sub-cast\" something, and are sometimes set up to use a different caster level in that task. In that case, the \"sub\" caster level tends to either be the real level of the user\u00a0\u2014 it could well be the \"mage\" or \"priest\" level that is actually picked up, like with the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Atonement\"&gt;Cloak of Atonement&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2014 or a custom but fixed level, for example 20 for the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Dark%20Moon\"&gt;Cloak of the Dark Moon&lt;/a&gt;'s Protection From Magic Energy.\nDropping items.\nItems that get dropped on the ground disappear after 24 in-game hours, except for plot-critical objects. Items that are put into storage (chests, barrels etc.) remain there permanently.\nMod content.\nCaster level.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"The%20Tweaks%20Anthology\"&gt;The Tweaks Anthology&lt;/a&gt; mod and selection of a certain component enables the game mechanics to \"Cast Spells from Scrolls (and Other Items) at Character Level\". This option was originally part of the EET Tweaks mod and is incorporated as part of the Anthology. Obviously, for some PCs this can be a boon, and for non-casting PCs, a reduction in casting level."}

This is listed in the item or spell description. Restrictions based on abilities are listed in a section titled \"Requirements\" above the weight. This includes for example the requirement that &lt;a href=\"Mace\"&gt;Mace&lt;/a&gt;s need 10 strength to be wielded. A character can change these abilities fairly easy using potions or spells.\nClass and alignment restrictions are listed in a section titled \"Not usable by\". Class and alignment are for all intents and purposes immutable and therefore listed separately. This article describes that latter list. When the list of exclusion is considerably larger than the list of inclusion, this wiki may prefer to list \"Only usable by\".\nClass restrictions.\nThis list consists of classes and/or class kits that are not allowed to use the item and a number of rules apply, which follow from the class and kit rules.\nDual class.\nRestrictions apply to the \"active\" class, if the secondary class is \"disabled\" (due to the active class not being higher in level). If the secondary class is \"enabled\" it is treated as the respective multi-class.\nMulti-class.\nIf all classes the multi-class consists of are mentioned, the multi-class is not listed but implied:\nAlso implies the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf one of the classes is mentioned, but not the others, the restriction does not apply to the multi-class. The above restriction does \"not\" exclude the &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Fighter / Mage&lt;/a&gt; nor the &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Fighter / Thief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage%20/%20Cleric\"&gt;Fighter / Mage / Cleric&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Fighter / Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis follows from the class rules. The above applies to a :\nContinuing the example for a mace, the list also includes:\nThe Fighter / Druid has to be explicitly mentioned here, as the priest classes including Druid restrict the weapon options for it's fighter component. Cleric also restricts the options for a fighter, but since the cleric can use maces its multi-classes are not excluded.\nWhen a class is mentioned, it includes all class kits, so &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; includes all &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Specialist Mage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMage &amp; Sorcerer.\nWhen an item restriction mentions a mage, it also applies to the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, while it's technically not a class kit of the mage. This wiki may list both as a convenience, but when it's omitted it's not a bug or oversight \u2013 the game simply does not have a way to target the sorcerer for exclusion and its item restrictions are identical.\nSpell restrictions.\nRestrictions on spells are mentioned on their scrolls and include non-casters and classes using a different spellbook. For wizard spells it also includes the &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Specialist Mage&lt;/a&gt; of the opposite school(s).\nThese restrictions are no longer visible from the spellbook descriptions.\nAlignment restrictions.\nAlignment restrictions are less common, but can exclude specific alignments. The game will list all alignments that cannot use the item, while this wiki may use a descriptive term. Armed with knowledge about the &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;alignment axes&lt;/a&gt; it should not be hard to determine the alignments that apply."}

It is because of their pacifist doctrines that atrocities against nature continue, like the fool to the northeast that entraps animals and enslaves them for his petty tasks! As a Shadow Druid, I fight so that nature is left untouched; there is no room for society to live alongside! This must be enforced through fear, and the removal of the naive taint Jaheira and her kind have sown!\" (End - Hostile)\nWith Faldorn.\n\"Faldorn travels with you, and so you shall live to see the glory of tomorrow's sunrise.

I shall give Faldorn the honor of feeding him to his own captives.\" (End - Exit)"}

The attack produces a graphic effect using the \"acid blob\" projectile (No. 108), even though the range is only 1 foot.\nIt's on-hit effects include two potential hazards:\nThe first is a &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; effect on the target lasting 8 seconds. A &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; vs. Death with a +4 bonus is allowed to negate the effect. If the saving throw is failed, the target creature will have an indicator icon displayed on the character portrait, (No. 5, \"Poisoned\"), and a color effect is superimposed on the sprite for the duration of the effect turning the figure \"moldy green\".\nThe effect inflicts 2 &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt; per round for eight seconds. The effect bypasses &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; spell protections such as &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;. The condition is non-magical and can't be removed with a &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nThe second effect of a being hit by this weapon is exposure to an instant death effect &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Kill target&lt;/a&gt;, which is delayed for 10-seconds. The victim must make another saving throw vs. Death with a +4 bonus or be killed. The death type is a \"chunked\" death, rendering the victim's corpse destroyed. A chunked death means that resurrection/revival is impossible, and many items carried by the victim will be destroyed, permanently. \n\"Chunked\" death can be avoided by turning off the \"gore\" setting in Game Options. It can't be applied retroactively of course.\nThe item has no other abilities."}

The separated XP gain isn't an issue for her as &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s' high level scaling isn't good to begin with, literally \"capped\" at level 15 (3,000,000 XP). Meanwhile Jaheira gains more and more useful &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; type &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;HLAs&lt;/a&gt;.

Or she can use the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Rynn\"&gt;Staff of Rynn&lt;/a&gt; early in Shadows of Amn, only to switch to the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Ram\"&gt;Staff of the Ram&lt;/a&gt; in \"Throne of Bhaal\".\nJaheira also has some powerful offensive spells. She can cast &lt;a href=\"Insect%20Plague\"&gt;Insect Plague&lt;/a&gt; to disable enemy spellcasters, or she can use &lt;a href=\"Harm\"&gt;Harm&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt; to quickly kill powerful enemies.\nAchievements.\nRestored.\nFind a way to &lt;a href=\"Save%20Jaheira%20from%20Baron%20Ployer%27s%20Curse\"&gt;break Jaheira's curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nJaheira has a luscious European accent, and Khalid, a stammer. Their personalities are opposed in this way and others. Jaheira tends to be headstrong and very certain of her own ways, sometimes to the annoyance of other NPCs (Viconia, for example) or (depending on how the player character reacts at certain points) even the protagonist. Many companions refuse to be servile flunkies at the beck and call of the player, and Jaheira is no exception: \"Yes, oh omnipresent authority figure?\" (Which, of course means the player, not the character, unlike the other followers).\nJaheira's inconsistency with regards to party deaths is a perfectly ironic blend of true love for her mate and jaded neutrality to the fate of others. She is normally philosophical, even laconic, about the death of other party members, with a \"No tears shed for those lost in righteous battle\". Should Khalid die, however, she lets out an anguished wail."}

Depending on dialog choices, recruitment can be an adventure in itself, giving the player some options.\nIf your party is full and you don't want another companion just now, you can either say you don't have the time (allowing you to return here later to find Jan), or \"bite\" on his sales pitch. The latter triggers the encounter with Trax, after which you still have the option to have Jan join now or later. This allows you to play through the Trax encounter even with a full party. Naturally, with a full party, having Jan join still means dropping a companion for now.\nTrax the Taxman\nIf you agree to see what Jan is selling, &lt;a href=\"Trax\"&gt;Trax&lt;/a&gt; and a guard will arrive to arrest Jan \"in the name of the Amnian Revenue and Taxation Board\" for illegal sales and tax evasion. After the two talk, Trax asks just \"who might you be?\" which gives you 2 basic options (the third leading back to his original question): \nThrone of Bhaal.\nAs other companions, he can be summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28area%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nHe can be acquired as a level 7/8 Illusionist/Thief with &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;weapon proficiencies&lt;/a&gt; in: Short Sword, Dagger, Quarter Staff, and Crossbow.\nAs Jan has an Illusionist specialist mage kit automatically assigned (which is a game rule for the Gnome race), Jan may not learn Necromancy school of magic spells.\nJan, &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hexxat\"&gt;Hexxat&lt;/a&gt; are the only &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; which can keep improving their thieving skills, though as a multi-class character, Jan gains experience only half as quickly as a pure-class thief. To compensate for this, Jan's starting equipment carries bonuses to various thieving skills, with the &lt;a href=\"Jansen%20Techno-Gloves\"&gt;Jansen Techno-Gloves&lt;/a&gt; improving both Open Locks and Pick Pockets by 20 points, and the &lt;a href=\"Jansen%20Spectroscopes\"&gt;Jansen Spectroscopes&lt;/a&gt; improving Find Traps by 25 points and Detect Illusion by 20 points.\nWhen he joins the party, he has the following items which can only be used by him: &lt;a href=\"Flasher%20Launcher\"&gt;Flasher Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, 10x &lt;a href=\"Flasher%20Master%20Bruiser%20Mate\"&gt;Flasher Master Bruiser Mates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jansen%20AdventureWear\"&gt;Jansen AdventureWear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jansen%20Techno-Gloves\"&gt;Jansen Techno-Gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jansen%20Spectroscopes\"&gt;Jansen Spectroscopes&lt;/a&gt;.

He is renowned for his variety of interests, which include turnip farming, gadgetry and tinkering, turnip selling, bootlegging, vegetable peddling, playing practical jokes on others, turnips (naturally), angering griffins and coming up with hyperbolic stories about imaginary acquaintances, among other things*.\nHe loves to chat, but his stories are rarely coherent and make little logical sense. His stories usually revolve around made-up relatives that he makes up just for the given case and serve the sole purpose of amusing himself and/or his companions - or annoying a righteous Anomen. Thus, he avoids giving out any information about his true beliefs and goals (if there are any)."}

This is covered in the quest page. \nIf the party ever feels as if would like to attempt to attack or kill Jarlaxle, then it will soon be apparent that it is nigh impossible, as the scripted dialogue actions don't permit enough time to do much of anything - as there are no free time gaps that allow the player to control their PC's. \nAlso, if ever the city is hostile to the party, then so will be Visaj and Jarlaxle. This would effectively prevent this encounter with Jarlaxle from occurring. \nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes some changes to Jarlaxle's creature scripts, and abilities.

Jarlaxle now has 5-pips in Longsword weapon proficiency (and thus has improved to hit and damage, as well as APR). 2 pips in Dagger proficiency and 3 pips in two weapon fighting style. This is mostly moot, as fighting Jarlaxle is probably impossible during this questline.\nAnother appearance of Jarlaxle will occur if pursing the &lt;a href=\"The%20Sellswords\"&gt;The Sellswords&lt;/a&gt; mod.

In all other respects, jesters are identical to bards.\nAbility Scores.\nNote: For the information of this table the human race was used, because they have no character bonuses/penalties related to race and therefore act like a 'neutral'. For half-elves this is slightly different.

The song scales with levels, at lvl 15 it will also &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt; enemies that fail a save vs. spell and at lvl 20 it will also render enemies &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects%23unconsious\"&gt;unconsious&lt;/a&gt; if they fail a save vs spell with a +2 bonus.\n\"Important note\": The &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;HLA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Bard%20Song\"&gt;Enhanced Bard Song&lt;/a&gt; will replace the Jester Song if chosen from the HLA menu.\nPick pockets.\nA jester can steal items from characters. The chance to steal an item depends on the percentage which automatically increases with the Bard's level, up to a maximum score of 115 at level 16, plus dexterity modifier.\nLore.\nBards have the highest &lt;a href=\"Lore\"&gt;Lore&lt;/a&gt; rating of any class, allowing them to identify many of the magical items they or their party discover.

It is a comprehensive modification to nearly all aspects of the Rogues (Bards and Thieves) abilities and strives to bring them closer to their Pen and Paper AD&amp;D counterparts. New and revised abilities are included, as well as new equipment and rogue specific items. Separate user installed components are available to customize selection of content and changes. Go to the link for further information. \nBard kit revisions\nThis component will modify all Bard kits so that they match their PnP counterparts more closely, as described in the 2E AD&amp;D \"Complete Bard's Handbook\" supplement. The kits now get additional benefits but also receive new disadvantages. The default Bard song has also been altered (it was largely defunct in the unmodded game) and is now based on the PnP version of this ability. Furthermore, the hearing range of all battlesongs has been standardized and now extends slightly above the in-game visual range of the performing Bard.\nJester kit revisions\nJesters now have to be partially chaotic aligned (instead of partially neutral aligned) and are limited to the Thieves' weapon proficiency selection. The Jester's song has been slightly altered as well. Furthermore, Jesters gain two new innate traits: \"Fool's Luck\" and \"Chaotic Mind\", as described in the 2E AD&amp;D \"Complete Bard's Handbook\" supplement. The updated kit description reads as follows:\nJESTER: This bard is well versed in the arts of ridicule and hilarity and uses his abilities to distract, confuse and mesmerize his enemies, cavorting madly during combat. Many sages believe that Jesters live in a constant state of borderline insanity. It's known that they crave for attention and feel at ease only when they are the focus of events. All Jesters are chaotically aligned, since no mind attuned to law and order could possibly sustain such an odd personality. Due to their peculiar fighting style, Jesters tend to avoid large and unwieldy weapons.\nAdvantages:\n- Gains Jester's Song at first level. This ability further improves at 9th and 18th level\n- Gains Fool's Luck and Chaotic Mind as passive traits at first level\nDisadvantages:\n- Can only become proficient with weapons that are usable by the Thief class\n- Must be Chaotic aligned\n- Battlesong doesn't help allies\nJester's Song:\nA Jester's Song doesn't help allies. Instead, it distracts every opponent within hearing range. The effect of the song further improves as the Jester gains more levels:\n1st: Enemies must save vs. spells or become distracted (+4 save bonus)\n9th: Enemies must save vs. spells or become distracted (+2 save bonus) and confused (+4 save bonus)\n18th: Enemies must save vs. spells or become distracted (no save bonus), confused (+2 save bonus) and mesmerized (+4 save bonus)\nDistracted opponents have a 20% chance of spellcasting failure and suffer a 2 point penalty to their THAC0 and AC. Confused opponents either go berserk and attack the nearest creature, stand still and babble incoherently or wander about aimlessly. Mesmerized opponents have their flow of thoughts disrupted to such an extent that they are unable to take any rational actions while listening to Jester's song which effectively incapacitates them. However, even in that state opponents can still perceive danger on a subconscious level, so any hostile action taken against them automatically breaks this effect. The Jester's song has no effect on mindless creatures such as Constructs, Skeletons, Zombies and Slimes.\nFool's Luck:\nJesters are careless, foolish and given to whimsical decisions, yet they seem to possess some uncanny ability which allows them to survive in almost any situation. Fool's Luck adds a +1 bonus to the Jester's base Armor Class, a +1 bonus to all of his saving throws and a +5% bonus to his pickpocket skill checks.\nChaotic Mind:\nDue to their unique mindset, Jesters are innately immune to the effects of spells, items and abilities that cause Confusion.\nJester High Level Ability:\nEnhanced Jester Song (Jester only)\nThe Enhanced Jester Song affects all opponents within hearing range who must save vs. spells once per round or become distracted (-2 save penalty) confused (no save bonus) or mesmerized (+2 save bonus). The Jester himself becomes immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities while singing the song."}

He is an &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, originally from &lt;a href=\"Suldanessellar\"&gt;Suldanessellar&lt;/a&gt;. His henchmen managed to capture the protagonist shortly after the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\". At that time, the child of Bhaal was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khalid\"&gt;Khalid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt; during an ambush. The choices the player has made in the game do not affect this. During the ambush, Dynaheir was killed and Khalid was later killed in Irenicus's &lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. He imprisoned the party and started experiments on Imoen and the protagonist with the intent to get them ready for their souls to be taken away. Doing this would allow him and his sister &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; to live once again.\nBeginning of \"Baldur's Gate II\".\nWhen Jon appears the first time, you only know he is experimenting on you and Imoen in order to release the untapped power you have, which might be beneficial for you as well. When you escape his dungeon, you will find yourself in &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt; and see Irenicus battling some hooded figures, easily defeating them. A group of &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizards&lt;/a&gt; will appear for his use of illegal magic. He defeats the first group easily, but claims he has not the time for fighting and lets himself be taken in, but requests Imoen be taken in as well as she used a couple of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; spells on him. Irenicus is taken to the government building in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Government\"&gt;Athkatla Government&lt;/a&gt; and the judge calls him a deviant and orders him to rot in &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;. After a while in-game, Irenicus easily overpowers the cowled wizards of the asylum and becomes its caretaker. He then begins again experimenting on Imoen.\nBackstory.\nOnce a powerful elven spellcaster living in Suldanesellar, Irenicus was well-respected by his countrymen and loved by the elven queen &lt;a href=\"Ellesime\"&gt;Ellesime&lt;/a&gt;. However, Jon\u2019s hunger for power and ambition lead to an eventual downfall.\nAt one point, Jon, assisted by his confidante and \"sister\" Bodhi (their actual kinship is never verified) attempted to become a god but ultimately failed. For their deed, both Bodhi and Irenicus were stripped of their connection to the elven race and were cast out of the elven city. It is implied that the nature of the punishment significantly shortened Bodhi's lifespan, as she voluntarily turned into a vampire as means of survival. Irenicus was affected to a lesser extent, but was still left physically scarred by the experience; most notably, the pointy ears typical for his race are missing. \nIn the beginning of Shadows of Amn, Irenicus has not given up his plans to ascend to godhood. He has built a massive &lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon\"&gt;secret base of operations&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; from where he conducts experiments with the ultimate goal of restoring his soul and recreating the love he once felt towards Ellesime. The appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt; proves a unique opportunity to forward his plans and even get his revenge toward Suldanesellar by draining the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life\"&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/a&gt; as a source of divine energy. Ironically, the word 'Irenic' means aiming for peace and reconciliation; an irenicus would be someone aiming for said peace.\nMain Quest.\nIrenicus has captured &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and their party at the &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%201\"&gt;beginning of the game&lt;/a&gt;, killing Khalid and Dynaheir and torturing the rest. Jon's motives at this point in the game are unknown. He is later apprehended by the &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizards&lt;/a&gt; together with Imoen for their illegal use of magic and exiled to Spellhold. From then on, Gorion's ward is left to identify and pursue his captor.\nLater Gorion's Ward confronts him in Spellhold in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%204\"&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt;, but Irenicus prevails and steals the protagonist's soul essence. Another confrontation occus at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Escaping%20the%20asylum\"&gt;Escaping the asylum&lt;/a&gt; questline taking place in the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Basement\"&gt;Spellhold Basement&lt;/a&gt; and this is discussed on the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20with%20Irenicus%20in%20Spellhold\"&gt;Battle with Irenicus in Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; page. \nIrenicus escapes &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; ward and flees the asylum. &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; is freed as well. The protagonist must still pursue Irenicus and vampire sister &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt; and beyond.\nThe final showdown takes place near the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life\"&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/a&gt; and then in &lt;a href=\"The%20Abyss\"&gt;The Abyss&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%207\"&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nMods.\nIrenicus can join the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; during \"Throne of Bhaal\" and may be redeemed with the mod \"Longer Road\", available for the original game at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.onlinefiction.net/LR/LongerRoad.html\"&gt;Original Source&lt;/a&gt; and for the \"Enhanced Edition\" at &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/InfinityMods/LongerRoadEE\"&gt;Infinity Mods.&lt;/a&gt;"}
{"id": "55321", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55321", "title": "Jon Irenicus (Abyss)", "text": "This page is to detail &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; as he appears in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Abyss\"&gt;The Abyss&lt;/a&gt; scenario. \nHe is faced in battle upon setting the final &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tears of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; into the \"Watcher's Door\" or the \"Abyssal Door\" as it is also titled during &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%207\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt;, Part 2. This is a mandatory plot encounter that can't be missed or optionally avoided.\nThe InfoBox displays the creature which can be attacked and fought by the party, which has the Slayer Form appearance. Two other creature files used by Jon Irenicus in Hell are not documented because they are for plot purposes only during cutscenes or to display dialogue. Those files can never be attacked or harmed /affected in any way by the player.\nGameplay.\nOnce the final Tear of Bhaal is mounted on the Abyssal Door, the game script initiates the door being opened, and the emergence of Irenicus. This is all portrayed in a cut scene sequence that repositions the party, plenty of 3D graphic animations and lighting effects are displayed, and a forced knock-back of the party members to simulate a massive explosive force.\nIrenicus initiates dialogue, the bhaalspawn will have several dialogue selection options and replies available. All core Bioware and Beamdog companions have an interjection during this sequence as well.\nRegardless of the various replies and pre-battle rhetoric - Irenicus attacks. The game script allows him to morph into a Slayer Form (Irenicus's on screen label is now just \"Slayer\"). At the same time, two &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Glabrezu&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt; demons are summoned and appear as his allies. This is all accomplished before the player can issue orders or control the party. (Ref: CUT85C.bcs)\nMoments later, the battle begins, and the player may now take charge of the party members actions.\nIn general, the four demons are all 10-HD fiend versions - and they are not scripted to do anything except physical attacks. These demon versions are actually less powerful than other versions encountered anywhere else in the game series. As such, they are not a primary threat to the party. They also do not have the ability to see invisible or hidden party members by script.\nThe actions described in the InfoBox for Slayer-Irenicus are listed. It will be able to force-cast all of the preparatory and spell triggers/contingency spells without delay and aren't interruptible by any damage incurred by your foe. Individual attack spells from the slayer are subject to memorized quantity restrictions and can be interrupted.\nThe slayer will conduct spell casting and melee attacks if any party members get close to the creature. The game script provides a few periodic on map teleport moves to this creature. The creature will jump from one area of the map to another, at least twice during the battle. This gives the slayer time to cast a spell and to allow its passive 6 HP/s regeneration rate to heal some hit point damage.\nThe slayer's combat abilities in melee may prove daunting if a party member is repeatedly hit. The damage can be substantial. Be aware of this and take steps like &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, or use &lt;a href=\"Hardiness\"&gt;Hardiness&lt;/a&gt; and similar damage reduction spells when going toe to toe with the slayer.\nOf note is the creature's lack of any means to remove magic or dispel any party buffs. It isn't scripted or able to Breach or take down any party protections or boosted abilities.\nAs such, the party can stay immune and protected very well against the Slayer, and this will marginalize the actual risk to lose this battle, depending on the player's skill and group composition. \nWhen the Slayer's HP's drop to 1, another cutscene will initiate. Irenicus has some final dying words, changes back to normal form from the Slayer, and is actually killed for real.\nA cinematic will play focusing on Irenicus waking from his death in Hell. He finally gets his just punishment and fate. This transitions into a cut scene.\nA cutscene moves forward to a show the revival of the party in &lt;a href=\"Suldanessellar\"&gt;Suldanessellar&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Rillifane\"&gt;Temple of Rillifane&lt;/a&gt;, with Queen &lt;a href=\"Ellesime\"&gt;Ellesime&lt;/a&gt; speaking and summarizing the recent events. Miraculously, the entire party has been extracted from Hell, and divinely made whole and healed. A host of elves is present in a ceremony that pays tribute to the brave adventurers, and the bhaalspawn is awarded the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Seldarine\"&gt;Amulet of Seldarine&lt;/a&gt;. \nFor those players who have the Enhanced Edition installed, the story will continue on to the automatically, and the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%208\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 8&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod provides an updated and revised \"Smarter Mage\" script. Irenicus Slayer Form is redesigned as a Demonic Race and a level 20/30 fighter/mage class, which boosts the Slayer's melee &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;, and the spell casting level jumps to level 30 as compared to the unmodified version's 20.\nSCS retains all the immunities listed in the InfoBox, and adds a few more abilities to Irenicus, including:&lt;br&gt;\n- &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; and hidden creatures by script.&lt;br&gt;\n- A scroll of &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt; for scripted use.\nNew &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; are prepared and scripted for use.\nDepending on the player's game difficulty selection (typically on \"Hardcore\" and \"Insane\") gives access to scripted &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; use, to include &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Dragon's Breath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;. Most likely more than one will be used. These are very difficult to prevent.\nIrenicus can recognize most player active character protections and immunities with SCS, which modifies the script actions of Jon. For example, he may attempt to remove spell protections and or Combat protections with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;. He will not cast certain spells at a PC that has &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Magic Energy&lt;/a&gt; and select a different spell or another available detected target.\nDuring this battle a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; is very probable. If any party members are nearby the slayer, it will assess what combat protections are active, and make a decision to engage in spell casting or go into melee attack during the pause in time. If a party member has &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Immunity\"&gt;Absolute Immunity&lt;/a&gt; up, it will likely use &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; and launch several spells. Otherwise, the slayer may just start pounding with melee attacks (usually under a &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt;) and most likely get 10 or more hits on the character. This can be deadly, and if it's the bhaalspawn as the target, it might mean game over.\nSeveral summoned creature spell options are available to the Slayer, including twin &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt; creatures, a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt;, and others.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed, the mage's spells will be the SR mod's version. This means that he'll likely be protected with spells such as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/SpellRevisions/spells/arcane/level-5/dispelling-screen\"&gt;Dispelling Screen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/SpellRevisions/spells/arcane/level-3/non-detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/SpellRevisions/spells/arcane/level-7/prismatic-mantle\"&gt;Prismatic Mantle&lt;/a&gt;. Irenicus will not be breachable without at least three magical attack spell protection removers, that is if the player can even target the slayer with a single-target spell. \nThe allied demons with Irenicus are actually capable of casting several dangerous and protective spells. They have caster levels between 17 (Glabrezu) and 24 (Balor), and all the demons are capable of releasing a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;. The SCS Balor's have a potential &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Kill target&lt;/a&gt; vorpal melee attack and an always on &lt;a href=\"Aura%20of%20Flaming%20Death\"&gt;Aura of Flaming Death&lt;/a&gt;. Various power words and symbol spells are innately cast by the demons. All the demons can teleport without error on the map as needed and see invisible and hidden creatures by default."}

This is a mandatory plot encounter that can't be missed or optionally avoided.\nGameplay.\nThe Irenicus creature file PPIREN2 has all the dialogue to do with Irenicus in Spellhold beginning with &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; awakening in the laboratory, his soul essence being drained, the post &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;fourth dream&lt;/a&gt; dialogue, and finally the Spellhold battle.\nIrenicus is protected from overt or accidental destruction by most means since he has some file assigned immunities, but the &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt; is also equipped. This is for plot preservation purposes and to ensure script integrity so the game will progress properly and not fail. The game design does not intend for the player to be able to kill this version of Irenicus.\nAfter the various dialogue has played out at the outset of the final battle with Irenicus in the laboratory, then the creature will actually become hostile.\nIrenicus has two main scripts that he's using during the final battle. The first is PPJON.bcs. This will initiate the \"Spawned Clones\" of the party that occurs at the initial stages of the battle. Later on, when Irenicus has reached a \"Near Death\" damage state and certain dialogue is triggered, the script will destroy &lt;a href=\"Aphril\"&gt;Aphril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dradeel\"&gt;Dradeel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naljier%20Skal\"&gt;Naljier Skal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiax\"&gt;Tiax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wanev\"&gt;Wanev&lt;/a&gt; (unless they died before this). It also unlocks and opens the door to the laboratory to ensure that the &lt;a href=\"Murderer\"&gt;Murderer&lt;/a&gt; creatures can enter.\nThe main script used by the AI to control Irenicus combat behavior is PPJON2.bcs\nAll of the spells mentioned in the InfoBox are scripted for use. Some of these are not interruptible and are applied regardless of any disruptions that might be occurring to the creature from potential damage suffered, or even if under the effects of &lt;a href=\"Miscast%20Magic\"&gt;Miscast Magic&lt;/a&gt;. However, plenty of his spells are cast like any mage would and can be interrupted or fouled by miscast magic.\nIrenicus only attempts one &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; during the entire battle, no other spell or combat protection removers are even attempted.\nHis script can't recognize and does not look for spell protections or items during the battle after the remove magic has been launched. He doesn't react to summoned creatures specifically.\nGiven that Irenicus is a 30th level mage, his script is actually very forgiving and not particularly robust in terms of damage dealing spells. The party will probably have to deal with a Horrid Wilting, a &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20to%20Flesh\"&gt;Stone to Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Other offensive single target spells will also likely occur, and perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; or spiders will be conjured.\nWhen Irenicus's HP drops to near death, this triggers dialogue, the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; if he was a party member in Spellhold at one point, the attacking &lt;a href=\"Murderer\"&gt;Murderer&lt;/a&gt; thieves, the killing of the inmates, and eventually his teleportation and escape.\nMod content.\nMods:.\nWhen playing with the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod, Irenicus as he appears in this battle is revised in several ways by the modification. \nThe mod randomly assigns a mage kit to spell casters when installing the game. It typically uses one of the four choices: Conjurer, Enchanter, Invoker or Necromancer. Irenicus will have an assigned specialty mage kit.\nA new AI script replaces the PPJON2.bcs script provided in the base game. This new script implements the \"Smarter Mages\" component. This script vastly improves his ability to assess his enemies' protections and weaknesses so that appropriate spell casting is attempted to take advantage of that or to better protect himself.\nIrenicus is provided with a larger memorized spell selection than the original game. For example, he has almost 40 level 6 through 9 spells scripted and memorized, as well as 4 mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; uses.\nHe also has prepared a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; scripted to instantly deploy.\nIrenicus can recognize summoned creatures and can banish these (more than once) with a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;.\nDepending on the game difficulty selection, expect a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Dragon's Breath (spell)&lt;/a&gt;. Irenicus can take down combat and spell protections with &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf playing SCS with the &lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Dale\"&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/a&gt; spells component, then Irenicus will have some of those in his repertoire. \nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed his spell versions will be the SR ones. SCS and SR are compatible and designed to work together."}

This is a mandatory plot encounter that can't be missed or optionally avoided.\nGameplay.\nThe Irenicus creature file SUJON has all the dialogue and scripts and is activated when his previous creature form (SUJON2) is removed from the map when the final parasite is destroyed.\nIrenicus is protected from overt destruction by most means since he has some file assigned immunities, but the &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt; is also equipped. This is for plot preservation purposes and to ensure script integrity so the game will progress properly and not fail. The game design does not intend for the player to be able to kill this version of Irenicus before certain dialogue and globals are set.\nAfter the various dialogue has played out with Gorion's Ward and Queen &lt;a href=\"Ellesime\"&gt;Ellesime&lt;/a&gt; - Irenicus eventually becomes hostile, and the battle begins. At this time the player can take control of the party and issue commands.\nJon will be able to apply a chain of protective buffs at the outset of hostilities (they aren't interruptible) to include &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Immunity\"&gt;Absolute Immunity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Energy&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the battle, he is able to apply additional buffs by way of scripted contingency triggers that are initiated based on certain factors, such if he takes any damage. For instance, the first time he suffers any hit point damage a Contingency with &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Immunity\"&gt;Absolute Immunity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; occurs. Note that the combat log won't show all these spells as being applied, and it will identify &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; instead of the actual spell &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Immunity\"&gt;Absolute Immunity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second time he takes damage a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; is instantly applied.\nA Spell Trigger is scripted as well, when an enemy is seen, releasing a &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Summoning%20III\"&gt;Monster Summoning III&lt;/a&gt; on the nearest enemy - and &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Blue%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Blue)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; upon himself.\nA &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; is \"forcecast\" (uniterupptible) after about three rounds into the battle.\nAssuming Irenicus is still alive, he'll attempt a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; if there are at least two members in the player's party. If the spell is successful, during the pause in time he'll\ncast &lt;a href=\"Wail%20of%20the%20Banshee\"&gt;Wail of the Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; at the nearest party member (if there are 3 party members), and just Wail of the Banshee and Horrid Wilting if there are only two party members. In both cases he'll also apply another &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Immunity\"&gt;Absolute Immunity&lt;/a&gt; to self.\nIf Jon is silenced, then a &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt; countermeasure is scripted. If Jon detects a summoned creature, he'll attempt a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; cast and can do so multiple times.\nIf a Mage Class party member is detected, a Spell Sequencer will be released at them, containing &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere will be a second Time stop attempt if Irenicus is still functioning - and during the pause in time will cast &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; at the nearest detected enemy.\nAs for individual normal spell casting - Irenicus will target detected enemies (usually the closest to him) with all sorts of disabling and damaging spells, including: &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Spray\"&gt;Prismatic Spray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word, Stun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;. These spells are subject to what's memorized in his spell book and are cast normally, and thus are interruptible.\nWhen Jon's Hit points fall to 1, this triggers his death dialogue - and shortly thereafter a sequence of plot text, dialogue and a cut scene will transition the player's party to the next stage of the adventure (no time is allowed for the player to command or access the party during this period). \nSee &lt;a href=\"The%20Abyss\"&gt;The Abyss&lt;/a&gt; for the next section of the adventure.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod provides an updated and revised \"Smarter Mage\" script for Irenicus. He'll have a randomly assigned specialist mage kit assigned at the time of the mod's installation (either Conjurer, Enchanter, Invoker or Necromancer). The assigned kit governs the available AI script provided to irenicus.\nNew &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; are prepared and scripted for use.\nDepending on the player's game difficulty selection (typically on \"Hardcore\" and \"Insane\") gives access to scripted &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; use, such as &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIrenicus can recognize most player active character protections and immunities with SCS, which modifies the script actions of Jon. For example, he may attempt to remove spell protections and or Combat protections with &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;. He will not cast certain spells at a PC that has &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Magic Energy&lt;/a&gt; and select a different spell or another available detected target.\nMore frequent use of summoned help is likely, especially if Irenicus has a Conjurer kit, such as X2 Djinni at one time. More use of level 8 and 9 spells is scripted, with a larger variety, such as &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gate%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Gate (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIrenicus is furnished with two potions for use if damaged or to boost abilities.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed, the mage's spells will be the SR mod's version. This means that he'll likely be protected with spells such as \"Dispelling Screen\", \"Non-Detection\", and \"Moment of Prescience\". These spells will make it difficult to penetrate his defenses, make it hard to target Jon, and reduce the ability to even strike him with even high-level warriors due to impressive armor class ratings well above -20 AC."}

This list quickly becomes a rather unwieldy reference tool as it fills up with entries for completed quests, etc. The \"In your Journal\" sections for quests in this wiki still apply, except that the very brief Quest Titles and Entry Titles are not found there.\nThe rest of this article applies only to\u00a0, where major changes were made to the journal in a (mostly successful) effort to make it a more useful tool.\nThe structure and content of this journal would seem to be self-explanatory, and generally \"does\" behave as expected, which can cause confusion on the not-infrequent occasions when it behaves (or appears at first glance to behave) ... unexpectedly.\nOne section of the journal is set aside for you to record any notes you please. All other journal entries are managed by the game, always in response to actions that you make.\nWhen the game begins, your journal gets a single Journal Entry: \"&lt;a href=\"Finding%20Gorion\"&gt;Finding Gorion&lt;/a&gt;\" under the &lt;a href=\"Quests\"&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt; title \"\" in the Quests section of your journal, on a page dedicated to journal entries for the &lt;a href=\"prologue\"&gt;prologue&lt;/a&gt; stage of the main story or questline. The journal always opens to the Quests section, so this is what you'll see if you open it before the game makes any further changes to it.\nStructure.\nQuest-related journal entries.\nThe structure of quest-related journal entries, i.e. Quests and Done Quests is:\nEach Chapter has its own page in your journal, which you can scroll through using the arrows at the upper left and right sides of the journal pane, when they become available. The journal begins with only one page, for the prologue chapter.\nQuest Titles appear as expandable/collapsable lists of journal entries, each marked with a '+' or '-' as appropriate to its current state.\nJournal journal entries.\nThe redundantly named Journal section of your journal has one fewer layers of structure. These are entries that record events that are not related to any particular quest, and may seem trivial, inconsequential, incomprehensible and/or mysterious at the time, but you may want to look back at them later in light of future events. Lacking a related quest, they appear simply as single list of (sometimes titled, sometimes untitled) date-stamped journal entries. The game allows you to edit these entries, if you wish to record additional information.\nUser journal entries.\nAny notes that you wish to record for yourself in the User section of your journal appear as a single list of untitled journal entries, identified only by date stamp on the current Chapter page of your journal.\nThe \"current Chapter page\" means the page for chapter that you are currently playing, not the chapter page that you are currently looking at!\u00a0If you are looking at the &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt; page of your journal while playing in the &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20One\"&gt;Chapter One&lt;/a&gt; stage of the main quest line, and make a new User entry, it will appear on the Chapter One page and you will not see it when you click DONE, as you will then return to the Prologue page.\nShould the &lt;a href=\"Amnian%20Soldier%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;Amnian Soldiers&lt;/a&gt; or the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Guard%20%28Friendly%20Arm%20Inn%29\"&gt;Guards&lt;/a&gt; from the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Friendly%20Arm%20Inn\"&gt;Friendly Arm Inn&lt;/a&gt; ever take you into custody and demand to know where you were on the evening of 28 Marpenoth, you \"could\" go rooting through a maze of bureaucratically-generated and -maintained journal entries to eventually discover that you were flooding the &lt;a href=\"Cloakwood%20Mines\"&gt;Cloakwood Mines&lt;/a&gt; all day, with no surviving witnesses, but your best bet at having an orderly record of what you were doing when and where (if you care about such things) is to make frequent short User journal entries. User journal entries can, of course, also be used to record information that you may actually find useful at some point.\nQuests, side quests and journalistic mayhem.\n\"Well-behaved\" journal entries.\nIf you begin the game by opening and entering the door behind you, you will find yourself in the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Inn\"&gt;Candlekeep Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, if you speak to &lt;a href=\"Firebead%20Elvenhair\"&gt;Firebead Elvenhair&lt;/a&gt; he will ask a favour of you, and the text pane of the game window will inform you that you have been gifted with a &lt;a href=\"Firebead%27s%20Scroll\"&gt;Firebead's Scroll&lt;/a&gt; journal entry. In your journal, you will find the new &lt;a href=\"Firebead%27s%20Scroll\"&gt;Firebead's Scroll&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0journal entry under a new &lt;a href=\"Firebead%27s%20Scroll\"&gt;Firebead's Scroll&lt;/a&gt; quest heading! (Identical quest titles and entry titles is the norm, even when the available mechanic of separate titles could have been used to build a much more readable and orderly journal.)\nThis is a side quest, also called a subquest. It has no direct bearing on the main story, and so its completion is optional. It also has a clearly defined goal and, should you complete it, you will find that the &lt;a href=\"Firebead%27s%20Scroll\"&gt;Firebead's Scroll&lt;/a&gt; quest has moved from the Quests section of your journal to the Done Quests section, and that the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Firebead%27s%20Scroll\"&gt;Firebead's Scroll&lt;/a&gt; journal entry for that quest has been replaced by one that describes not what needs to be done, as it used to, but rather what happened when you completed it. Well-behaved, yes?\nMischievous journal entries.\nThe orderly movement of quests and their journal entries from Quests to Done Quests is interrupted frequently in a variety of ways. Some quests are not completable. Some quest entries do not get moved when the quest is completed. Some quests morph into or merge with other quests. Some quests cleverly conceal multiple sub-sub-quests that appear only in Done Quests! And some quests are not actually quests at all, such as:\nImportant Events: the Big Kahuna.\nImportant Events is a \"quest\" that behaves like no other in your journal. (Well, almost no other. There are one or two other oddballs, such as &lt;a href=\"Troubles%20in%20the%20Region\"&gt;Troubles in the Region&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rising%20Tensions%20with%20Amn\"&gt;Rising Tensions with Amn&lt;/a&gt;, which behave somewhat similarly, for somewhat similar reasons.) Important Events is a collection of hints, notes, reminders and nudges towards the eventual completion of goals that move the overall storyline forward. It can be thought of as either not a quest at all, or as the \"only\" quest. (Hence the terms\u00a0\"side quest\"\u00a0and \"subquest\".)\nImportant Events moves with you from chapter to chapter, and updates across chapters. It exists in Quests and Done Quests at the same time. It is, in a word, (again, \"almost\") unique."}

He'll request that you journey to the &lt;a href=\"Windspear%20Hills\"&gt;Windspear Hills&lt;/a&gt; and slay some ogres for a reward in the sum of .\nConfronting Monsters.\nUpon entering the area, you are immediately greeted by a group of neutrally aligned monsters; a &lt;a href=\"Baby%20Wyvern\"&gt;Baby Wyvern&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20Elite\"&gt;Gnoll Elite&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Mage\"&gt;Ogre Mage&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. One of the ogres will call out to the party...\nBelow is some information about these \"monsters\": \n&lt;br&gt;\nNone of the return dialogue lines will prevent the group from becoming hostile and attacking the party. After the battle, &lt;a href=\"Garren%20Windspear\"&gt;Garren Windspear&lt;/a&gt; will appear and claim that he witnessed ogres fighting ogres, but in death there are human bodies where the monsters fell.\nHe will then explain that these slain knights were members of the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Noble%20Order%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt; and that the priests of &lt;a href=\"Helm\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt; will not look kindly upon the party for this atrocity. He offers to give the party sanctuary in his &lt;a href=\"Windspear%20Cabin\"&gt;cabin&lt;/a&gt; where he'll provide the party with a better idea of the 'what' and 'why' of the horrific events that they just took part in.\nAfter speaking with Garren in his cabin, he'll set off to try to clear the party's name by contacting some of his former influences within the Radiant Heart.\nGarren will return following the battle with the bandits responsible for the kidnapping of his child. He'll lament the loss of his child and ask the party to &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Garren%27s%20child%20from%20Firkraag\"&gt;rescue his child&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Firkraag\"&gt;Firkraag&lt;/a&gt;'s men. He'll also inform the party that he was successful in convincing the Radiant Heart of the party's innocence. However, the Order will demand justice for the slain knights and the party is now officially tasked with rescuing Garren's child.\nThis is the point where this quest gets merged with \"Rescue Garren's child from Firkraag\" side quest; both of which are a prerequisite for obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Stronghold%20Duties\"&gt;Paladin Stronghold Duties&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; protagonists."}

{"id": "56106", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=56106", "title": "Juggernaut Golem (Manual)", "text": "The Juggernaut Golem is summoned from using the &lt;a href=\"Juggernaut%20Golem%20Manual\"&gt;Juggernaut Golem Manual&lt;/a&gt;. This article is about that specific creature, and not the other &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; versions.\nThe Juggernaut Golem Manual is only available in the original and Enhanced Edition portion of .\nGameplay.\nThe golem is a controlled creature. It is best used by the player directing its movement and who/what to target.\nWhen the golem detects an enemy creature, it will automatically attempt a &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Cloud\"&gt;Gas Cloud&lt;/a&gt; ability, fired over itself and potentially affecting adversaries and party members in the area of effect.\nIf left to make decisions on its own during battle, the script it is furnished is very simplistic and may not perform to the player's liking.\nThe golem will act as a basic melee fighting creature usings its bludgeoning fists to beat on a target.\nThe golem does brutal damage with its fists and strength, although they only strike as +2 enchanted items. See the InfoBox for its on-hit effects.\nThe golem can be useful as a distraction, especially against magic spell casting oriented creatures, such as a mage, lich, or beholder, due to its immunities and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis golem can be buffed by the party to increase its effectiveness, such as with a &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Evil (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nThe golem will disappear from the map when 1 turn expires, or die when the summoners' special \"golem stoneskins\" application decreases to zero.\nA &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; will destroy/banish this golem, as its gender is \"summoned\".\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; makes a few revisions to this particular golem.\nIn the unmodded game, Iron and Adamantine golems are prone to being stuck in certain doorways. SCS changes this to allow movement through these openings.\nThe default AI script is modified, so that if the golem is allowed by the player to do its own thing, it has a decision logic that evaluates if an enemy is protected by &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and then may try a different available target to pummel.\nIt also recognizes when its fists get a \"weapon ineffective\" result and will look for a different target.\nThe SCS AI will be aggressive keeping after its chosen target, relentlessly pursuing it.\nThe AI will cast &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Cloud\"&gt;Gas Cloud&lt;/a&gt; every three rounds of combat, as long as the creature is functional. \nThe mod makes the golem immune to the spells &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plant%20Growth\"&gt;Plant Growth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt;. It is also immune to being &lt;a href=\"Webbed\"&gt;Webbed&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod changes the appearance of Iron golems (which the Juggernaut golem uses), to differentiate from the &lt;a href=\"Adamantite%20Golem\"&gt;Adamantite Golem&lt;/a&gt;."}

The tome is placed in a character's \"Quick item\" slot (such as where a wand or scroll is placed), and then the player selects the manual and triggers the power of the item.\nNext, place a targeting cursor within 30 feet of the character to designate where the golem will appear on the map.\nA summoning animation plays at that location, and a few moments later a golem appears, in the prone position, and then it stands, ready to obey commands.\nThe golem lasts for one turn, and when time expires, disappears from the map.\nAdditionally, when the tome's power is unleashed, the user of the manual has a color glow and spell animation played over the sprite, and a unique &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; effect is applied.\nThe book user is protected with five golem stoneskins. Note that if the user already has a regular stoneskin spell active, this new application will be placed alongside the previous application (it uses a different &lt;a href=\"Opcode\"&gt;Opcode&lt;/a&gt;). Any blows against the character must burn through all the stoneskin layers from both spells before it reaches zero skins and triggers the death of the golem. \nThis dynamic is the only instance in the game where a party member can be protected with multiple stoneskin applications. Use this to advantage!\nThis version of stoneskin can't be dispelled and is immune to a &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe golem stoneskins have a duration of 1 turn.\nIf and when the character's golem stoneskins are reduced to zero, the Juggernaut golem is scripted to destroy itself. When the golem is destroyed, it's body remains on the map like any corpse.\nThe manual recharges and can be used again, after a standard 8-hour rest period.\nThe Juggernaut golem uses the Iron Golem animation sprite. \nJuggernaut Golem Description.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Juggernaut%20Golem%20%28Manual%29\"&gt;Juggernaut Golem (Manual)&lt;/a&gt; page for stats and description of the summoned creature from this manual."}

{"id": "9802", "revid": "49135869", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9802", "title": "Backstab", "text": "Backstab is an ability that allows attacks made while concealed and behind a target to perform additional damage. The additional damage is substantial enough to often kill targets in a single blow. This ability is available to &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; (except swashbucklers), and &lt;a href=\"Stalker\"&gt;stalkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics.\nIn order to attempt a backstab, the character must be:\nAny attack made while these conditions are met will be treated as a backstab attempt. Regardless of whether the attempt is successful or not, the attacker will immediately become visible. If the attack roll is successful, the target will suffer a &lt;a href=\"Backstab%23Backstab%20Damage%20Formula\"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; of the weapon's normal damage.\nIf the attacker is dual-wielding, the backstab attempt will be made with the weapon in the main hand. If that weapon isn't suitable for backstabs, the attack may still succeed but it will only result in normal damage. Since the first attack usually breaks concealment, the character's &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;APR&lt;/a&gt; is not relevant.\nBackstabbing while invisible will ignore the enemy's &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; bonus to armor class.\nWill the Party get Backstabbed?\nAny enemy with a backstab multiplier (eg a character with Thief levels) who attacks the party from either invisibility or hiding will attempt to backstab the party (one can easily test this by simply casting invisibility on any enemy with actual Thief levels). This means that enemies do not require positioning like players do to perform backstabs.\nWhile your average Mugger (a lot of whom use ranged weapons, that can't backstab) probably won't try to hide-in-shadows or go invisible, actual Shadow Thieves, assassins and other kinds of more skilled enemies are scripted to either try to hide (if no enemy is nearby) or, more commonly, drink Potions of Invisibility or use the &lt;a href=\"MAGE01.ITM\"&gt;MAGE01.ITM&lt;/a&gt;'s invisibility at the start of combat.\nSome rogues have the HIDE.BCS script that simply checks if the creature is invisible or not, and if not, it tries to Hide, using the available &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; percentage. Most Hide in Shadow and Move Silently skills assigned to thieves are quite marginal. Thus, attaining a hidden state is typically achieved by the AI through invisibility items or consumable potions.\nSome examples of enemies (ie it's not an exhaustive list) who might try to backstab the party - mostly in Shadows of Amn portion of BG2EE are:\nEnemies immune to backstab.\nThis is a (mostly complete) list of enemies immune to backstab. If an enemy isn't listed here, odds are it's vulnerable to backstabs (keep in mind that monsters that ignore invisibility like most Liches and Demons might seem immune at first, but they aren't):\nGeneral creature types:\nSpecific enemies:\nPrimary enemies:\nBackstab Eligible Weapons.\nBackstabs can \"only\" be performed with fists or melee weapons that a pure Thief would be able to use:\nEven if a weapon falls into one of the above categories, it may \"not\" be used for backstabbing if:\nAny spell-conjured melee weapon \"is\" eligible for backstabbing, regardless of its apparent weapon class. This includes weapons created by spells such as &lt;a href=\"Spiritual%20Hammer\"&gt;Spiritual Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20of%20Disaster\"&gt;Black Blade of Disaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorthy of note, Ogre form from &lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20Self\"&gt;Polymorph Self&lt;/a&gt; and Iron Golem form from &lt;a href=\"Shapechange\"&gt;Shapechange&lt;/a&gt; deal significantly more damage and can be used to backstab. \n&lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;, which all protagonists get, can also backstab.\nBackstab Damage Formula.\ncodice_1\nwhere:\nFor most characters, the backstabbing weapon with the most damage potential is the upgraded &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Ram\"&gt;Staff of the Ram&lt;/a&gt;, which does 1d6 +12 crushing + 1d4 piercing points of damage per hit. A &lt;a href=\"Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt;, however, has access to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20of%20Disaster\"&gt;Black Blade of Disaster&lt;/a&gt; which can do 2d12 +5 (and +5 more from Grandmastery in Longswords in the EE) points of damage per hit, Ogre form from &lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20Self\"&gt;Polymorph Self&lt;/a&gt; which does 4d6 + 1 points of damage and Iron Golem form from &lt;a href=\"Shapechange\"&gt;Shapechange&lt;/a&gt; which can do 4d10 points of damage.\nBackstab Success Chance.\nSince a backstab occurs with a successful hit, success chance can be increased by improving &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee the general article on &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; for ideas on how this attribute can be improved. Taking the Single Weapon or Two-Handed &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20proficiency\"&gt;Weapon proficiency&lt;/a&gt; improves the critical hit chance, ensuring a 10% chance to hit. Since backstab is usually tried from &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; (unless using Assassination HLA), you also gain a +4 THAC0 bonus.\nAs members of the warrior group, &lt;a href=\"Stalker\"&gt;Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s are much less likely to suffer from THAC0 issues than &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;. See the class page for &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; for ideas on how to improve their THAC0. In terms of general advice (applicable to both), be wary when dual wielding since the main-hand weapon will suffer a THAC0 penalty until the character is specialized (2 points) in two-weapon fighting. In the late game, a weapon that increases &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"Angurvadal\"&gt;Angurvadal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Crom%20Faeyr\"&gt;Crom Faeyr&lt;/a&gt; might compensate that even if as a plain &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt; you only have access to one proficiency point in that style. Also, consider playing as an &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt;, since they receive a +1 to-hit racial bonus when using and .\nSome effects, mostly from spells, allow an attacker to automatically hit the enemy, thus guaranteeing a successful backstab attempt. These effects include:\nAdditional backstab opportunities.\nInstead of using Hide-in-Shadows, a thief can use &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; to create a backstab opportunity. The advantage to this method is that it can be done while in the direct line of sight of enemies while in the midst of combat. Various wizard spells would work for this purpose, as would drinking a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;Potion of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. See the section on &lt;a href=\"Backstab%23Invisibility\"&gt;Backstab#Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; later in this article for a complete list of items and spells.\nThe high-level ability &lt;a href=\"Assassination\"&gt;Assassination&lt;/a&gt; allows for a full round of attacks using the backstab multiplier (without the need for concealment). Increasing &lt;a href=\"APR\"&gt;APR&lt;/a&gt;, such as with the &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt; spell and wielding &lt;a href=\"Belm\"&gt;Belm&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Kundane\"&gt;Kundane&lt;/a&gt;, is the key to getting the most out of this ability. Assassination is often best used after a &lt;a href=\"Set%20Time%20Trap\"&gt;time trap&lt;/a&gt; triggers to ensure that all attacks automatically hit, each one of them a backstab.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; spell allows characters to attack without breaking concealment. As a result, every attack they make (including with the offhand) are treated as backstabs as long as they stay behind their target. While this option is only directly available to the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Fighter / Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt; classes, any thief with the Use Any Item high level ability can use scrolls of Mislead as well.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod makes some adjustments to the backstab modifiers depending on the rogue kit. During gameplay, thieves, assassins and such perform backstabbing on a more frequent basis against the party than in the unmodified game.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises almost all thief and eligible kits to be scripted to prioritize backstabbing attacks in combat. These will be attempted everywhere hostile thieves and assassins are encountered. Thieves in general are poor melee fighters, and backstabbing is one of the only special abilities the game engine has to use them effectively. This will be a real threat to the party when their hit points are on the low to moderate side. Plan accordingly.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; creatures in SCS can backstab with their touch attacks, as long as they attack from stealth or if invisible. These creatures' class is changed to Fighter/Thief by the mod.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mods summoned &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Stalker\"&gt;Invisible Stalker&lt;/a&gt; will Sneak Attack and can backstab opponents with a x2 multiplier. As this creature is always invisible, it gets the modifier on nearly every strike it lands which will be with their 2 Attacks Per Round, 2d6+4 Crushing Damage (Fist +2).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tactics%20for%20BG2EE\"&gt;Tactics for BG2EE&lt;/a&gt; mod and the &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Rune%20Hideout\"&gt;Twisted Rune Hideout&lt;/a&gt; component add backstabbing &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Assassin\"&gt;Rune Assassin&lt;/a&gt; enemies to the encounter.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Azengaard\"&gt;Azengaard&lt;/a&gt; mod add backstabbing Rune Assassins to a specific encounter.\nThe &lt;a href=\"CoM%20Encounters\"&gt;CoM Encounters&lt;/a&gt; mod places a group of backstabbing rogues in the &lt;a href=\"Sewers%20%28Slums%20District%29\"&gt;Sewers (Slums District)&lt;/a&gt;."}

It revolves around\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ajantis\"&gt;Ajantis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shar-Teel\"&gt;Shar-Teel&lt;/a&gt;, who try to track down &lt;a href=\"Eldoth\"&gt;Eldoth&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\n&lt;a href=\"Ajantis\"&gt;Ajantis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shar-Teel\"&gt;Shar-Teel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eldoth\"&gt;Eldoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kivan\"&gt;Kivan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiax\"&gt;Tiax&lt;/a&gt; are traveling though the &lt;a href=\"Cloakwood%20Forest\"&gt;Cloakwood Forest&lt;/a&gt; \u00a0towards &lt;a href=\"Amn\"&gt;Amn&lt;/a&gt; as protectors of a young soon-to-be bride of an Amnish Lord. However, the convoy gets attacked by a large band of hobgoblins. They fight valiantly but most everyone dies, including Kivan and Tiax. Ajantis receives a blow to the head, which knocks him unconscious. Shar-Teel wakes him up after the battle and he learns that Eldoth apparently kidnapped the bride and stole the dowry, which is several sacks full of riches, including platinum.\nThe two of them then set out to track them down, which leads them to Baldur's Gate. Their first stop there is a tavern, where they try to get some information on Eldoth's whereabouts, but no success. They leave the place and outside a human man with an eye-patch confronts them, who tries to sell them information. Shar-Teel however isn't having any of that and simply threatens him into giving them the information for free, which in return leads to Ajantis getting upset with her.\nThe newly acquired intel leads them to another inn where they find two men (possibly half-orcs) and the bride, the latter one laying dead in her own blood on the bed. Shar-Teel kills one of the men on the spot and Ajantis goes to interrogate the other one, who turns out to be working for Eldoth.\nTheir next stop is then the &lt;a href=\"Undercellar\"&gt;Undercellar&lt;/a&gt;, which they enter violently. At at table they find Eldoth who was playing poker but flees as soon as he spots his former party members. The duo tracks him into the sewers, where he is awaiting them with a group of hobgoblins at his side, resulting in another bloody battle. Ajantis and Shar-Teel kill the hobgoblins and the paladin wounds Eldoth. Eldoth sitting in his own blood, Ajantis tries to get an explanation from him. Just as he reveals that he had a partner whom he betrayed as well, Shar-Teel kills him.\nAjantis calls her out on being Eldoth's former partner which she calls nonsense. Evidently in anger, she then takes the dowry from Eldoth's corpse and hands one of the sacks to Ajantis, blaming him for accomplishing what Eldoth couldn't: because of his righteous accusations, their group now is really dead. She storms off, leaving Ajantis behind.\nThe comic then cuts to Ajantis visiting an appraiser who tells him that the sack is mostly filled with copper coins. The next scene shows Shar-Teel out in the wild on a horse, grinning at one of the copper coins from the dowry in her hand. She playfully snips the coin behind her as she keeps on riding.\nOut-of-character moments.\nThere are some things in the comic, that do not add-up to what we know about the characters from the game.\nCameos.\nThe comic features a number of cameos in the form of background characters.

The game takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Realms\"&gt;Forgotten Realms&lt;/a&gt;, a high fantasy campaign setting, using modified Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (AD&amp;D) 2nd edition rules.\nThe story follows the player character's journey along the\u00a0Sword Coast, which lies on the west coast of the continent &lt;a href=\"Faer%C3%BBn\"&gt;Faer\u00fbn&lt;/a&gt;, as he or she grows up following the cataclysmic Time of Troubles. Character development occurs through dialog and battle. The game rewards the player character according to his or her moral choices.\nGameplay.\nThe game was programmed within the licensed ruleset of the Forgotten\nRealms role-playing setting, using the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition rules, though various elements from the ruleset were modified to allow the game to be executed in real-time. Each character is in constant action, while the game can be paused at any time.\nDuring the game, past and present events are related to the player through dialog, written text, journal entries, or cut scenes. Dialog is initiated when the player clicks on bystanders. This generates written and sometimes spoken dialog with selectable responses. Such interactions can lead to quests or missions.\nThe game is separated into seven chapters intercut with interludes of spoken dialog. Free exploration of the world map is allowed in every chapter, though some areas are not unlocked until the player character advances to a certain point in the game. The player begins as a weak character, poorly equipped and without allies. As players progress they discover new and more powerful weapons, armor, and spells, and can form a party of up to six characters (including the player character). Experience points gained through completing quests and killing monsters improve the abilities of the main character and other party members.\nThe flow of time during the game is expressed by changes in lighting and by the closure of most shops and the increased likelihood of encounters during the night. Taverns are open during the night, but there are no changes in the presence of customers or the barkeeper to reflect the flow of time. The troupe of characters controlled by the player do become fatigued after traveling for a full day, which requires rest to recover.\nPlot.\nWorld settings.\nThe western shore of &lt;a href=\"Faer%C3%BBn\"&gt;Faer\u00fbn&lt;/a&gt; along the Sea of Swords contains a multitude of ecologies and terrain including mountains, forests, swamps, marshes, plains, cities, and ruins. Collectively called the Sword Coast, it attracts adventurers for good and evil alike, and provides the backdrop for this grand adventure. The region encompassed by the game is roughly bordered to the South by the Cloud Peaks, the East by the Wood of Sharp Teeth, the West by the Sea of Swords, and the North by &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; (the largest and most affluent city in the region). The characters travel the countryside, exploring the various areas such as towns, dungeons, mines, forests, castle ruins, and the city of Baldur's Gate. The main story involves the characters investigating a conspiracy, confronting the clandestine plots of organizations like the &lt;a href=\"Zhentarim\"&gt;Zhentarim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wizards%20of%20Thay\"&gt;Red Wizards of Thay&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Throne\"&gt;Iron Throne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist\"&gt;Flaming Fist&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href=\"Chill\"&gt;Chill&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href=\"Blacktalons\"&gt;Blacktalons&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Harpers\"&gt;Harpers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as finding out the main character's own ancestry and history.\nStory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; and their friend &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; have grown up together since childhood under the tutelage of their guardian, the mage &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt;. As orphans, they were raised in &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient fortress-turned-library in the rural &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast\"&gt;Sword Coast&lt;/a&gt; region, which lies south of the city of Baldur's Gate. However, strange things are afoot on the Sword Coast: iron production has virtually halted, metal already produced quickly crumbles, and bandits scour the countryside hunting iron over any other treasure. Strangest of all, even inside the secure walls of Candlekeep there are mercenaries with designs on the main character's life. Gorion knows what is going on but will not tell the player character, and instead decides to leave Candlekeep and journey with the player character to a hiding place. However, the night after leaving Candlekeep they are ambushed by a group of bandits led by a mysterious \"armored figure\". When Gorion refuses to hand over the player character, he is attacked by the bandits; Gorion defeats them but dies in doing so. The player character soon runs into Imoen, who had been following in secret after reading a note about the journey on Gorion's desk. She too saw Gorion's murder, and now insists on accompanying the character.\nThe nearest cities are closed to the player: Candlekeep demands a unique, valuable book as its admission fee, and the city of Baldur's Gate is closed off to outsiders for fear of the bandit hordes. Seeking safety, the player character teams up with other adventurers, and soon he or she sets out to find the cause of the iron shortage by traveling to the source of the iron, the mines of &lt;a href=\"Nashkel\"&gt;Nashkel&lt;/a&gt;, and in doing so begins to unearth a deeper conspiracy. Kobolds have been contaminating the iron in the mine, and documents at the Nashkel mine connect the mine operation with the iron-hunting bandits, and ultimately lead the main character to the secret campsite of the bandits. They appear to be mobilized mercenary companies employed by the Iron Throne, a mysterious organization which is aggressively expanding its influence. The Iron Throne intends to gain control of the Sword Coast by diverting the iron supply to its own armies exclusively, and stockpiling all plundered iron at the only working iron mine in the region, deep in the &lt;a href=\"Cloakwood\"&gt;Cloakwood&lt;/a&gt; forest. As the main character sabotages the mercenary installation in the Cloakwood mines, the pressure on Baldur's Gate is relieved enough for the city to be re-opened to outsiders, and the player character can confront the local Iron Throne leaders at their headquarters.\nAt Baldur's Gate the player character is enrolled by the Flaming Fist city guard to investigate the Iron Throne, but as no damning evidence is to be found the player character returns to Candlekeep to spy on a meeting of the Iron Throne leaders. Much has changed in Candlekeep since the player character left, and it is soon discovered that the fortress has at least partially been taken over by Doppelg\u00e4ngers. The player character also encounters a mysterious man named Koveras. Soon after leaving the company of Koveras, the player character is charged with the murder of the Iron Throne leaders (which may be true or a set-up, depending on the player's actions). The only route of escape is through the catacombs below the monastery. The player character manages to escape the catacombs, and returns to Baldur's Gate. But things only get worse, as the player is still on the run for the (real or framed) murders in Candlekeep, and must stay hidden as the player character works to uncover the truth and finally uncovers a grand scheme masterminded by the \"armored figure\", &lt;a href=\"Sarevok\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeking to confront Sarevok, the characters find out that he is actually half-brother to the main character, both of whom are children of the dead Lord of Murder, &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;. The main character's Bhaalspawn ancestry explains much about their past and raises questions about their future. Sarevok's plans turn out be much more sinister, as the Iron Throne is just a fa\u00e7ade for his real intentions. Through manipulation of politics and resources Sarevok plans to start a war of sacrifice between Baldur's Gate and the kingdom of Amn to the south, causing enough carnage to become the new Lord of Murder. In the end the player character defeats their brother Sarevok and sends his tainted soul back to Bhaal.\nGallery.\nScreenshots.\n&lt;a href=\"Interplay\"&gt;Interplay&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/19990224101315fw_/http%3A//www.interplay.com%3A80/bgate/hall.html\"&gt;Hall of Wonders&lt;/a&gt;\"A collection of , featuring Ima DeathBringer as &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;. \"(Now archived.)\"\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"Infinity%20Engine\"&gt;Infinity Engine&lt;/a&gt; games:"}
{"id": "10944", "revid": "5345812", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10944", "title": "Baldur's Gate (novels)", "text": "Baldur's Gate, also referred to as the \"Baldur's Gate novels\" or the \"Baldur's Gate trilogy\", is a series of novels loosely based on the games of the same names respectively.\nThe first book, \"Baldur's Gate\", was written by Phillip Athans and released in July 1999 followed by \"Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn\" in September 2000 by the same author. \"Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal\" was written by Drew Karpyshyn and released in September 2001.\nPlot Summary.\nBaldur's Gate.\nThe story focusses on &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; in the form of the mercenary Abdel Adrian, a 7 foot tall &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; with superhuman strength. He tries to to unravel the events behind the manipulation of the iron mines along the Sword Coast. He has an affair with &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt;, who later dies, and he stabs &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok Anchev&lt;/a&gt; to death\u00a0in Candlekeep.\nBaldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal.\nAbdel Adrian has gained invincibility but Illasera has cursed arrows that can harm even him. Sarevok gets resurrected and tries to join Abdel.\nNotable Inaccuracies.\nThe novels feature a large number of inaccuracies, most notably (SPOILERS):\nCanon.\nThe novels were set as the official version of the events described in the franchise in regard to the overall &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Realms\"&gt;Forgotten Realms&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0setting. Wizards of the Coast have however slowly started retconning this in the recent years. Now the canon is a mix of both the events in-game (including the ) and the novels, though a lot of details are left ambiguous. Abdel Adrian is still the official version of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther elements ignored from the novels by future sourcebooks are the deaths of characters such as Khalid, Jaheira, Imoen, Grand Duke Eltan among many others, and the lack of presence of characters such as Minsc who didn't appear in the first novel and only made a cameo during the second. Later sourcebooks and media would establish these characters more in line with the games than the novels, not only in personality but also in their role in the story.\nReception.\nThe novels were widely criticized by fans of the games for being too inaccurate to the original story and spirit, even though they are said to be on par with most other novels of the genre.\nSome of the points of contention revolve around the characterization of the characters, most notably Adrian Abdel, the novel's version of Gorion's Ward, who was written as an ill-tempered, impatient and naive human fighter who tended to resolve any problems with violence or intimidation."}

In this chapter you will be trying to escape &lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irenicus's Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.It is assumed that your &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" consisted of your player character, &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khalid\"&gt;Khalid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou will wake up in a cell on the 1st floor of &lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon%201st%20Floor\"&gt;Irenicus' Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; and will see &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; trying a few 'experiments' on you. He is then interrupted by a golem that informs him of intruders who have entered the complex. He will go off to find them, whilst Imoen will sneak in and unlock you from your cell. Your adventure will then begin.\nAfter you have been released, enter the room to the west and take the weapons and armor you want, and the &lt;a href=\"Jail%20Key\"&gt;Jail Key&lt;/a&gt; from the room. Minsc and Jaheira will be also be trapped in cells and you will see them east of yours. Use the key you collected to unlock Jaheria's cell and goad Minsc into his berserker rage and he will break the bars of his cell.\nLeave through the south passageway. Along the way you will see a machine that will create Lightning Mephits. Flip the switch in the northwest wall to turn off the machine. In the next room you will meet &lt;a href=\"Aataqah\"&gt;Aataqah&lt;/a&gt;, who will &lt;a href=\"Aataqah%27s%20Question\"&gt;ask you a question&lt;/a&gt;. If you answer it, you will have to fight some enemies but afterward he will reappear and advise you to seek out Rielev.\nIn the sewer section on the left side of the area, you will find &lt;a href=\"Rielev\"&gt;Rielev&lt;/a&gt;. Take the &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Cells\"&gt;Energy Cells&lt;/a&gt; from his life support and he will pass on. Take the &lt;a href=\"Activation%20Stone\"&gt;Activation Stone&lt;/a&gt; from the table and use it to control the &lt;a href=\"Sewage%20Golem\"&gt;Sewage Golem&lt;/a&gt;. It will open the warded doors to the central sewer area so it can perform its duties, and thereby allowing you to continue to explore the rest of the dungeon.\nTake one of the long narrow passages to the center of the area. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Otyugh\"&gt;Otyugh&lt;/a&gt; and take the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Frost%20Key\"&gt;Wand of Frost Key&lt;/a&gt; from its body and then take the north passageway. At the end you will see Irenicus' chamber. Be wary of traps. Take the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Lightning%20Key\"&gt;Wand of Lightning Key&lt;/a&gt; from this room and then go east.\nYou will meet some &lt;a href=\"Dryad\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;s who will ask you to help save their trees. This is optional, helping them is not necessary to help you escape. Keep going south and stop when your reach Irenicus' mistress' chamber. This room will be flooded with traps, so tread with care. Take the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Key\"&gt;Portal Key&lt;/a&gt; from this room and return to Irenicus' chamber.\nWhen you are back to Irenicus' chamber go east and you will see a portal. Go through the portal and you will reach &lt;a href=\"Irenicus%27s%20Dungeon%202nd%20Floor\"&gt;level 2&lt;/a&gt; of the dungeon.\nAt the beginning of the second area, &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; will offer to join your party so that you can all escape together. In the first room, leave the Mephits alone and attack the four portals. Once each portal is destroyed the Mephits that came from the portal will die. The body on the table is Khalid's. Jaheira, his wife, will mourn for his loss and Imoen will say some disturbing things. Take the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Cloudkill%20Key\"&gt;Wand of Cloudkill Key&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Fire%20Key\"&gt;Wand of Fire Key&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Summoning%20Key\"&gt;Wand of Summoning Key&lt;/a&gt; found in this room. In the next room, you will see a clone trying to escape but she will attack your party. Take the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Missiles%20Key\"&gt;Wand of Missiles Key&lt;/a&gt; from her body.\nAt the end of the next passage, you will enter a throne room with several symbols on the floor and pedestals on the side of the room. Place the keys you have found into each of the pedestals, whereby you'll receive the corresponding magical wand (each w/ 1 charge) and the traps in the floor will be disabled. Note that you can walk around the traps in the center of the floor so do not worry if you don't have all six keys. Take the first passage on the right and follow it to the exit.\nWhen you leave the prison, you will come face to face with Irenicus who will use magic to destroy his enemies. When he tries to use magic against Imoen, several &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizards&lt;/a&gt; will appear and arrest him for illegal use of magic in the city. He will surrender even though it seems he could easily destroy the wizards. Imoen will be taken away as well for her part in the magical battle.\nYou will be in &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt; where there are several stores with different kinds of items for sale. When you have bought what you want, journey to the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Slums\"&gt;Slums District&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs soon as you reach the slums you will meet &lt;a href=\"Gaelan%20Bayle\"&gt;Gaelan Bayle&lt;/a&gt; who can provide some information on the whereabouts of Imoen and will take you to his &lt;a href=\"Gaelan%20Bayle%27s%20Home\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; for further discussion. Once inside, Gaelan will tell you that he knows of a group who can locate where the Cowled Wizards have taken Imoen and who will help you rescue her for 20000 gold pieces. You have no choice but to accept this offer, since the Cowled Wizards are too strong for you to confront on your own. Bayle will give you a few tips on how to earn this gold. &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%202\"&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt; will then begin once this interaction has ended."}

After defeating the five, learning your past and learning of the truth behind &lt;a href=\"Amelyssan\"&gt;Melissan&lt;/a&gt;, you are staged at the final place of your destiny. The gaining of your power is moments away, but you must defeat a very powerful enemy first...\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Throne%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;The Throne of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter defeating the five, completing the five challenges and leaving the Pocket Plane for the last time, you find yourself in the Throne of Bhaal, facing Amelyssan the Blackhearted, who has already absorbed most of &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;'s essence and saying you are far too late.\nAfter a short bit of dialogue, Amelyssan will attack you so she can gain every drop of Bhaal's essence. She is a Cleric (30) / Mage (30) and will often summon monsters of the abyss to aid her. You should just concentrate on Amelyssan as all the monsters she summoned disappear when she flees. She is also unaffected by &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;. When she is near death, she will say she shouldn't be wasting time on you and will jump into the pillar to absorb more of Bhaal's essence. While Amelyssan is absorbing the Bhaalspawn essences, you can heal and prepare as much as you want, the time you take will make no difference. You cannot rest here though, unless you have a &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; spell and get lucky with the option to \"Make it as if the entire party has just rested a full night and rememorized all their spells.\"\nWhen she has jumped into the pillar, you need to go to the left platform and defeat air elementals and the vampiric wraiths. When the monsters are killed, click on the pool in the center to cut off Amelyssan's flow for the time being. She and the party will then move to where you began.\nAmelyssan will attack again and continue to summon monsters of the abyss. This time however, when she first starts attacking she will start off with a powerful kick that sends everybody backwards and unconscious for a short time. Again, when she takes enough damage she will jump into the pillar.\nThis time you will have to go to the platform on the right. On this platform there will be an Ice Elemental as well as a couple of Frost Salamanders and Ice Trolls. Cut off her flow again.\nAmelyssan will then attack again, and after taking too much damage, again she will jump to the pillar to absorb more bhaalspawn essences.\nThis time you will have to to the top-right platform. There will be a Fallen Solar, two Marileths, an Alu-Fiend, and a Succubus. The Marileths are immune to normal weapons and cast protection to magical weapons to add to that, so spells like &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt; and critical here. When you have killed those monsters, cut off her flow again.\nAmelyssan will then attack for the final time. As this is the last fight in the game you should use whatever you have on her. When she is near death, the Solar who helped you on your way here will appear and tell Amelyssan and you that the gods have decreed &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; as the victor. Amelyssan will protest, but to no success. You then have a choice. You can either release Bhaal's taint out of you and allow Solar to get rid of all of Bhaal's taint permanently, or you can take all of Bhaal's essence for yourself and become a god. The rest of your party will give their say. When you have made your decision, the act will be carried out and the game will end.\nEpilogue.\nCongratulations, you have completed the whole of the Baldur's Gate saga, all the way from &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt; to the Throne of Bhaal.

His nephew, &lt;a href=\"Brus\"&gt;Brus&lt;/a&gt;, will direct you to a place where you can find work related to your character's class. You need to raise money to fund the rescue of &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;. To get this money, you will need to sell, raid and complete sub-quests.\nThroughout this chapter, there are many interesting guild-war encounters that can happen at night in &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Slums\"&gt;Athkatla Slums&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Athkatla Docks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20District\"&gt;Bridge District&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Government\"&gt;Athkatla Government&lt;/a&gt; district. Many encounters have timers and other conditions, so they may take time or the completion of tasks in order to appear. Some scenes portray vampires fighting shadow thieves, and some will attack the party. You will meet the vampires in a certain order: &lt;a href=\"Hareishan%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Hareishan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salia\"&gt;Salia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Del\"&gt;Del&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Parisa\"&gt;Parisa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanova\"&gt;Tanova&lt;/a&gt;. When defeated, they usually use their cloud form to escape, and you will meet them again later in the game.\nTry to travel between every combination of two districts to trigger all scripted travel encounters (usually ambushes), which only occur when leaving a certain district\u00a0for the first time or from a specific district\u00a0to another and provide you with nice loot for this stage of the game. After the scripted ones, there will be random ones with only little loot.\nOnce you have in hand and you're within the streets of Athkatla, a mysterious woman named &lt;a href=\"Valen\"&gt;Valen&lt;/a&gt; will appear and will urge you to meet her mistress in the Graveyard District. Right after you finish talking with Valen, Brus will arrive with a message from his uncle Gaelan Bayle, who will sweeten the deal for you to if you meet him.\nYou now have a choice. You must choose whether to side with the vampires led by &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thieves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt;. If you give to Bodhi, you will have to attack the Shadow Thieves to get help rescuing Imoen. If you give to Gaelan, you will have to attack the vampires to get help rescuing Imoen. When you have made your choice, go to either Bodhi or Gaelan.\nIf you go to Gaelan, he will give you a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thief%20Cellar%20Key\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; so that you can get to Aran Linvail in his secret &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;hideout&lt;/a&gt; that's accessible from the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thief%20Guildhall\"&gt;Shadow Thief Guildhall&lt;/a&gt;. If you're a thief, however, Bodhi states that \"there may be no honor among thieves, but [she] cannot trust you to abandon your thief brethren\". So, your only choice will be to side with the Shadow Thieves to progress the main quest."}

This section is part of the &lt;a href=\"Aran%27s%20tasks%20to%20receive%20the%20Shadow%20Thieves%27%20aid\"&gt;Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid&lt;/a&gt; questline, and all quest journal entries will be registered under that header.\nEnter the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thief%20Guildhall\"&gt;Shadow Thief Guildhall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Athkatla Docks&lt;/a&gt; and go down the stairs behind a hidden door in the northeast wall. From the first room of this level, go through a secret passage in the northeast wall and follow the corridor to &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt;'s quarters. He will ask you to help defend one of his shipments from the competing guild. Go down to the south end of the &lt;a href=\"Docks%20District\"&gt;Docks District&lt;/a&gt; and meet &lt;a href=\"Mook\"&gt;Mook&lt;/a&gt;. If you ever wondered why there's a sign on the south of the map saying \"Down to the Shipyard Docks\", near some stairs leading down to the sea, well, now is the time to go down those stairs. During the night, a creature named &lt;a href=\"Lassal\"&gt;Lassal&lt;/a&gt; will kill Mook and attack your party. Once you have defeated Lassal, report back to Aran Linvail.\nAran's next task will be for you to meet with a recruiter from the other guild and pretend to be a recruit yourself. Aran hopes to learn the location of the other guild's lair. Go to the second story of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Flagons%20Inn\"&gt;Five Flagons Inn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Bridge\"&gt;Athkatla Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. In one of the rooms, you will find &lt;a href=\"Jaylos\"&gt;Jaylos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caehan\"&gt;Caehan&lt;/a&gt;, the defectors.\nThere is no way to get out of this meeting without killing both of them and the guild contact. If you attack the defectors, Caehan will mention the name of the contact before attacking (The contact's name is &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Contact\"&gt;Gracen&lt;/a&gt;), if your &lt;a href=\"charisma\"&gt;charisma&lt;/a&gt; is high enough and you choose the correct dialogue option (4th one) he will tell you the location of the lair, if not he will attack (don't forget to loot the note from his body if you killed him). Either way, once you are done here, return to the shadow thieves. Go to Aran Linvail and tell him what you learned. He will ask you to go to the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Athkatla Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; and destroy &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;.\nGo to the Graveyard District and enter one of the entrances to the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt; (one is at approx X:886 Y:1687).\nFight past &lt;a href=\"Pai%27Na\"&gt;Pai'Na&lt;/a&gt;'s spiders and meet &lt;a href=\"Haz\"&gt;Haz&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance to the vampire's lair (north side of the lower tomb). His Golem will break down the door, but you will be attacked and Haz will be killed.\nFollow Lassal to the inner sanctum. Defeat the vampires there and confront Lassal in the back room. He will flee again. Return to the entrance of the vampire's lair and enter the hallway to the east. You will have to fight two vampires including the powerful &lt;a href=\"Tanova\"&gt;Tanova&lt;/a&gt; to get through. Lassal will finally attack you in the room with the spikes in the ground. Beware of traps! Once you have defeated Lassal, go to the room with the three coffins on the west side of the area. Use blunt weapons to destroy the Clay Golem that guards the coffins.\nClick on each of the coffins to use a wooden stake to finish off the vampires. The top two coffins are &lt;a href=\"Gellal\"&gt;Gellal&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Durst\"&gt;Durst&lt;/a&gt;'s and the bottom one is Lassal's.\nBodhi will appear once you have finished off Lassal. She is a very difficult enemy. Only blunt weapons will work against her. Once you have hurt her enough, she will leave. Return to Aran Linvail in the Shadow Thief Guildhall and he will book you passage on a ship which will take you to the island where &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Irenicus\"&gt;Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; are being held by the &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizards&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary - attacking the Shadow Thieves.\nNOTE: Follow this section if you sided with the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Vampire%20Coven\"&gt;Bodhi's Vampire Coven&lt;/a&gt;.

Take the Smuggled Shipment from Mook's body. Give the package to Bodhi in the Vampire Guild beneath the Graveyard District. You must now choose between two assignments. If you choose the hero's task, go to the Docks District and enter the Shadow Thief Guildhall from the south entrance on the second floor. Defeat the Shadow Thieves and rescue &lt;a href=\"Palern%20Flynn\"&gt;Palern Flynn&lt;/a&gt; in the back room. Return to Bodhi in the Vampire Lair. If you choose the other task, enter the &lt;a href=\"Vulova%20Estate\"&gt;Vulova Estate&lt;/a&gt; at the north end of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20District\"&gt;Government District&lt;/a&gt; and handle &lt;a href=\"Senior%20Armagaran%20Vulova\"&gt;Senior Armagaran Vulova&lt;/a&gt; and his guard &lt;a href=\"Laen%20Torg\"&gt;Laen Torg&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Vulova%20Wizard\"&gt;Vulova Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. Place the Shadow Thief Dagger and Cloak in the fountain by the entrance and return to Bodhi in the Vampire Lair. Your last task will be to kill Aran Linvail, the head of the Shadow Thieves.\nGo to the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Slums\"&gt;Athkatla Slums&lt;/a&gt; and kill &lt;a href=\"Gaelan%20Bayle\"&gt;Gaelan Bayle&lt;/a&gt; in his home to obtain the . Take the key from his body. Now go to the Docks District and enter the Shadow Thief Guildhall. Kill the enemies inside and descend to the cellar through a secret stairway in the northeast corner. Once you defeat the enemies in the first room of the cellar, &lt;a href=\"Tizzak\"&gt;Tizzak&lt;/a&gt; will ask you to free him from his torturers. Enter the torture chamber to the southeast and kill &lt;a href=\"Booter\"&gt;Booter&lt;/a&gt;. Take the prison key from his body and release Tizzak. He will tell you how to get into Aran Linvail's inner chamber.\nContinue north into the Shadow Thief training area. After &lt;a href=\"Dedral\"&gt;Dedral&lt;/a&gt;'s ambush, enter the room to the northeast and push the red button at the end of the room. Watch out for traps! Continue through the area until you find the wizard Haz. Kill him and take his key. Return to the first room of the cellar and enter a secret passage in the northeast wall. Follow the passage all the way to Aran Linvail's lair and defeat him. Return to Bodhi again, after you have defeated Aran Linvail. She will tell you about her relationship with Irenicus and will then escort you to the ship. &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; will sail your party and Bodhi to &lt;a href=\"Brynnlaw\"&gt;Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt;."}

If you joined the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thieves&lt;/a&gt;, Saemon will betray you when you arrive and summon three vampires to attack you in the Brynnlaw docks.\nGetting Inside The Asylum.\nEnter &lt;a href=\"The%20Vulgar%20Monkey\"&gt;The Vulgar Monkey&lt;/a&gt; in the town and speak to Sanik. Before he can tell you anything useful, he will be killed by an assassin. The innkeeper will tell you that the assassin was sent by Lady Galvena and that Sanik's wife Claire, who is being held by Lady Galvena, would probably be the only other one who knows how to get into the Asylum. Enter Lady Galvena's Festhall near the west side of &lt;a href=\"Brynnlaw\"&gt;Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, the Front will ask you your business.\nTo get to the prison, either attack the Front, take the key off his body and go through the secret door in the north corner of the room, or go outside and give the courtesan 100 gold so she will take you to her room inside.\nEnter the next passage and defeat the guards there. Take Galvena's Key from a closet in the last room on the right. Use it to open the door at the end of the hall.\nEnter the prison and defeat Lady Galvena and her mage Vadek. Speak to Claire and she will take you to see Captain Golin who will tell you of two different ways to get into the Asylum.\nOne way of getting into the asylum is to defeat &lt;a href=\"Perth%20the%20Adept\"&gt;Perth the Adept&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast corner of Brynnlaw and take the wardstone from his body. Go up to the north pass and you can then get to the Asylum. Without the wardstone, any character that tries to cross the bridge gets petrified. It is possible to cross the bridge without the wardstone by casting &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Petrification\"&gt;Protection From Petrification&lt;/a&gt; on all party members before crossing (but you still can't open the main door to the Asylum without the wardstone - so why bother?). Once past the bridge, there will be monsters to fight before getting into Spellhold.\nOnce inside, a &lt;a href=\"Coordinator\"&gt;Cowled Wizard coordinator&lt;/a&gt; will show you the prisoners on the level until he gets to &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;. The wizard is suspiciously hinting that he may be working for or actually be &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpoiler content.\nAttention: Reading the content below is a \"spoiler\", don't click on the \"reveal\" section to expand the text if you do not wish to know content involving companion &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt;.\nReveal Yoshimo's surprising plot event for a \"spoiler\":\nIf Yoshimo is a current party companion, you find out he is working for Irenicus all along.\nAnother way to get in is to speak to the &lt;a href=\"Pirate%20Door%20Guard\"&gt;Pirate Door Guard&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest corner of Brynnlaw and speak Golin's or Saemon's name to be allowed entrance into the Pirate Lord's &lt;a href=\"Desharik\"&gt;Desharik&lt;/a&gt; home. Desharik can have you committed to the asylum, bypassing the area outside of Spellhold where monsters must be fought. If &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; is in your party, you can convince Desharik diplomatically to commit you. Otherwise, Desharik must be convinced that you are insane. Having &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wilson\"&gt;Wilson&lt;/a&gt; in your party can help in that matter. Once inside Spellhold, attack &lt;a href=\"Lonk%20the%20Sane\"&gt;Lonk the Sane&lt;/a&gt; or speak with Imoen and Irenicus will appear.\nFrom Irenicus, you will learn that Imoen is also a child of Bhaal like yourself and that he wishes to take your soul essence.\nAfter Irenicus has performed the ritual, you will enter into a dream and Imoen will call to you. Proceed to the library straight ahead. Before entering you are greeted by a demon, it will demand sacrifice from you for entry. \nEnter the keep and locate Imoen. She tells you that to defeat the beast it must be done as a team. So, you must lure it back to her location. Leave the library and to the west you will find the dream creature &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;. lead bhaal back to Imoen, then and only then can the dream creature be defeated. The dream will then end.\nSpellhold.\nWhen you wake up, you will discover that Irenicus has stolen your divine spirit and has told Bodhi to kill you. Instead of killing you outright, Bodhi wants to have some sport with you. She will imprison the party in the labyrinth of Spellhold and you must find your way out. At this point you can take Imoen as a companion or send her away.\nFrom the central room, climb the stairs to the northeast and turn right. In the next area, find a secret door in the northwest corner and defeat all the kobolds. Once the last one is dead you will find &lt;a href=\"Kurtulmak%27s%20Crystal%20Shard\"&gt;Kurtulmak's Crystal Shard&lt;/a&gt;. Take the Wooden Stake from the body of a kobold. In the southwest corner of the area, you will find Dace Sontan, a vampire. Defeat him and use the Wooden Stake to finish him off and you'll receive &lt;a href=\"The%20Hand%20of%20Dace\"&gt;The Hand of Dace&lt;/a&gt;. Return to the first area and talk to the statue in the south corner. With the Hand of Dace and Kurtulmak's Crystal Shard the passage to the next area will appear.\nTake the south passage and take the Minotaur Horn from the fountain in one of the rooms. On the east side of the area, you will be attacked by Bodhi. Your character will turn into the Slayer and attack in rage. Bodhi will leave and you will return to your normal form after a while. It may be prudent be ready to retreat all other members of the party back along the way you came, as the Slayer will attack both friend and foe until the effect wears off. Note that resting immediately after the battle with Bodhi will reinvoke the Slayer form for a short period of time, but second and subsequent rests after that do not.\nTake the east passage from the room with the minotaur statue and take the Minotaur Horn from the room at the end of the hall. Put both Minotaur Horns on the statue to open the passage to the next level.\nDefeat the Kobolds and Goblins and an apparition will appear and subject you to a number of tests. In the first test, defeat the monsters and answer 'a splinter' to the riddle. You will be transported to a room with four judge-like apparitions. The &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Cloak of Reflection&lt;/a&gt; is on the table. Answer their riddles. If done correctly you will be transported to the Troll Cave for the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Heart of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; &amp; \"Giant Troll's Head\". Place the troll's head on the altar for a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Club\"&gt;Bone Club&lt;/a&gt;. The apparition will judge you sane and will grant you freedom.\nWhen you leave the labyrinth, Saemon Havarian will appear and suggest you free the other inmates to attack Irenicus. If you attack Irenicus on your own, you will all die. Instead, return to the upper level and convince Lonk the Sane to release the inmates. Flame their anger and you will all be teleported to Irenicus on the lower level. After you have fought Irenicus for a while he will flee and Yoshimo and a number of murderers will attack your party. Once you have defeat Yoshimo and the murderers, return to the upper level.\nSaemon Havarian will appear again and offer you two suggestions: to enter the portal on the lower level or leave with him on his ship. Using Irenicus' portal is the faster route, skipping an entire city, but doing so misses out on several magic items that can't be found anywhere else.\nIf you do not trust Saemon, enter Irenicus' room near the entrance to Spellhold on the upper level and defeat the Stone Golem. Take Jon's Key and return to the basement. Use the key to open the door and enter the portal, which takes you to the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%205\"&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe City of Caverns.\nIf you decide to take Saemon's offer, return to Brynnlaw and meet him in the Vulgar Monkey. He will tell you that he doesn't actually have a ship at the moment and will ask your aid in acquiring a new one.\nEnter Cayia's house on the west side of town during the night. Cayia and her lover will notice you and summon the guards. Defeat the pirates and take the Pirate Horn from the table. (Alternately, send a character who can hide in the shadows to silently pilfer the horn while Cayla and her lover sleep.) Give the Pirate Horn to Saemon by the docks near the southeast corner of the area.\nBefore you can set sail, Desharik, the Pirate Lord, will appear and try to stop you. Defeat him and the pirates and then speak to Saemon Havarian again to set sail. He will give you the Silver Blade.\nDuring the voyage, the ship will be attacked by the Githyanki. In the middle of the battle, the Sahuagin will appear, and your party will be thrown overboard. The Sahuagin will take you to their underwater city. You will appear before the Royal High Priestess Senityili. She will be able to answer some of your questions and tell you about the prophecy.\nYou will be taken before King Ixilthetocal and will be required to accept a challenge to proven you really are the 'chosen one' spoken about in the prophecy. Defeat the Ettin and then agree to kill the rebel prince for Ixilthetocal. Speak to Senityili again at the temple. She will tell you how to get into the Rebel camp. She will also ask you to talk to the rebel prince instead of killing him and will give you the Rebel's Orb if you agree.\nGo the southwest corner of the city. Watch out for traps! You can either kill the beholder guarding the chest or convince him to let you see inside the chest. Take Sekolah's Tooth from the chest and open the gates on the east side of the city. If you have the Rebel's Orb a sahuagin will take you to Prince Villynaty.\nYou can either kill Prince Villynaty and take his heart to King Ixilthetocal or you can agree to the prince's plan, take the fake heart to King Ixilthetocal and then kill the king. Either way, you will receive a Magical Rope.\nGo to the southeast corner of the area and use the Magical Rope to descend to the Underdark."}

Some insight is gleaned from this in that Irenicus has worked out some kind of alliance with the dark elves in the city. \nThe party then arrives in the underdark, and shortly after another cutscene movie plays for the beginning of chapter 5, introducing the chapter's plot and a sinister description of the underdark.\nGameplay begins afterwards, and it is up to the party to explore and investigate this strange place and track down Irenicus. For a first-time player, the game does not specify exactly what to do, where to go, or any initial \"must do\" actions.\nExplore the Underdark - main point walkthrough.\nThe party is in pursuit of Irenicus, and has no step-by-step plan to achieve that. This means that in terms of gameplay, the party will have to explore and investigate and respond to new information as they go.\nSpeak with any non-hostile creatures possible to gain clues and possible side-quest options. These encounters will generate journal entries and a path forward to help accomplish some goals in the furtherance of the main priority to locate Irenicus, and also to find a way out of the underdark.\nAt some point, the party will need to be able to encounter the denizen of the Dark Cave. To do this first visit the Svirfneblin Settlement. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Goldander%20Blackenrock\"&gt;Goldander Blackenrock&lt;/a&gt;. Through a service to him or other means, obtain the &lt;a href=\"Light%20Gem\"&gt;Light Gem&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing the Light Gem, penetrate the &lt;a href=\"Adalon%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Dark Cave&lt;/a&gt; and hear the majestic dragon's words within. For the most experience and gameplay options accept her task and receive the special enchantment necessary to enter Ust Natha.\nWhen ready enter the drow city. Is Ireicus inside? What about Bodhi?\nIf the player wishes to avoid any further exploration of the underdark, and skip all the other available side quests and just leave the area - then slay the silver dragon, take the special &lt;a href=\"Adalon%27s%20Note\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; she carries and move to the exit gate - defeat the guardians and depart the underdark. \n&lt;a href=\"Ust%20Natha\"&gt;Ust Natha&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough not absolutely necessary in order to leave the underdark, the main plot and gameplay offerings hinge on the party getting access to the drow city of Ust Natha.\nLeave the underdark.\nEventually, the party will wish to leave the underdark to continue the saga.\nThe best method is to complete the &lt;a href=\"Recover%20the%20Silver%20Dragon%27s%20Eggs\"&gt;Recover the Silver Dragon's Eggs&lt;/a&gt; questline. This will facilitate an assisted method to leave.\nThe only other option is to explore the &lt;a href=\"Kuo%20Toa%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Western Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, find the exit and attempt to open the exit gate. The gate is defended by the &lt;a href=\"Drow%20gate%20guardians\"&gt;Drow gate guardians&lt;/a&gt;. If the party doesn't have the drow disguise enchantment, then hostilities will ensue.

At this time the first journal entry for &lt;a href=\"The%20Elven%20City%20Requires%20My%20Aid\"&gt;The Elven City Requires My Aid&lt;/a&gt; quest is recorded.\nHave an encounter with &lt;a href=\"Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen travelling back to Athkatala for the first time after being in the Elven camp - it is likely the party will be \"waylayed\" by Drizzt and his companions. See the &lt;a href=\"Encounter%20-%20Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Encounter - Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt; article for more.\nIf the party doesn't end up fighting him, you can ask for help against &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;. Should you get help from him, he and his friends will be waiting in a specific area in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsider getting even more help in Athkatla.\nMore help is available when planning the attack on Bodhi. From the Shadow Thieves (unless you already sided with Bodhi in Chapter 3), and paladin assistance from the Order of the Radiant Heart.\nIf the party speaks to &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt; in the Shadow Thief Guildhall, he will agree to send some of his top assassins to help you destroy Bodhi and her coven.\nMore assistance might be available from various temples. Try any or all of them is desired. &lt;a href=\"Prelate%20Wessalen\"&gt;Prelate Wessalen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Noble%20Order%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt; in the Athkatla &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt; will most likely provide some support for the future battle with &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;. If the PC has a &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20Stronghold\"&gt;Cleric Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; already, then a request for assistance can also be made to the attending temple superior high priest. The answers given vary depending on the temple.\nThe Githyanki may find the party.\nUpon your first visit to Athkatla, at some point traveling through most any of the city districts there may be another encounter, if the party is still in the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Blade\"&gt;Silver Blade&lt;/a&gt;. A githyanki mage named &lt;a href=\"Kruin\"&gt;Kruin&lt;/a&gt; will approach and demand it's return. This will lead to a fight if the party keeps it.\nVisit Cromwell.\nThe master smith &lt;a href=\"Cromwell\"&gt;Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; is willing and able to assess and forge new or improved items from components taken on your travels. For a fee of course.\nSee Ribald in the Adventurer Mart.\n&lt;a href=\"Ribald%20Barterman\"&gt;Ribald Barterman&lt;/a&gt; has a special stock of new material which can be browsed for only 50 gold. Some fresh items are available and could be a boon for the party.\nPlan on finishing open quests.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%207\"&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt; has begun, the party won't be able to go back and take care of open quests or unexplored areas. Take care of those, preferably before going after Bodhi. \nDestroy Bodhi's coven and get the Rhynn Lanthorn.\nGo to the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Athkatla Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; and you will encounter Bodhi. She has a welcoming committee of vampires waiting in the wings. It is at this juncture that certain select party companion who may be in a &lt;a href=\"Romance\"&gt;Romance&lt;/a&gt; could be abducted - which might be a nasty surprise. See &lt;a href=\"The%20final%20battle%20with%20Bodhi\"&gt;The final battle with Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; questline that initiates now. \nEnter the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt; and seek out the same area the party first encountered the vampires in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%203\"&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering, if the party sought help from the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Noble%20Order%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt;, several paladins await your arrival led by &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Vanstraaten\"&gt;Eric Vanstraaten&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Drizzt and his compatriots agreed to assist, you'll find them in the northwest corner of the Vampire lair.\nIf you sought assistance from &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt;, some shadow thieves with &lt;a href=\"Arkanis%20Gath\"&gt;Arkanis Gath&lt;/a&gt; and two other assassins will also be in the central chamber with the ornate table, also facing the undead. \nOnce all the vampires and enemies are destroyed, the leaders of each assisting group will dismiss surviving assistants and accompany the party below into the inner sanctum of &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Bodhi's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefeat Bodhi and the last of her vampires in the inner sanctum. Once she is driven to her coffin, enter the adjoining chamber containing the coffin, and stake her black heart. You will receive the Rhynn Lanthorn and Imoen will regain her soul. Search for some cryptic books and manuscripts which will help guide the PC to resolve what to do about your dead romantic companion (if that is applicable).\nReturn to Elhan by the exit from the Underdark with the Rhynn Lanthorn. It will lead you to the entrance to the Elven city of &lt;a href=\"Suldanessellar\"&gt;Suldanessellar&lt;/a&gt; and transition to &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%207\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 6 mod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Adalon%27s%20Blood\"&gt;Adalon's Blood&lt;/a&gt; mod can be resolved in chapter 6 alongside the &lt;a href=\"Finish%20the%20leather%20armor%20begun%20by%20Rejiek%20Hidesman\"&gt;Finish the leather armor begun by Rejiek Hidesman&lt;/a&gt; questline.\n&lt;a href=\"Assassinations\"&gt;Assassinations&lt;/a&gt; mod can be resolved in this chapter, but after Bodhi is destroyed.\n&lt;a href=\"Azengaard\"&gt;Azengaard&lt;/a&gt; mod's climax takes place during this chapter in the &lt;a href=\"Small%20Teeth%20Pass\"&gt;Small Teeth Pass&lt;/a&gt; area.\n&lt;a href=\"Back%20to%20Brynnlaw\"&gt;Back to Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt; mod initiates in Athkatla in this chapter.\n&lt;a href=\"CoM%20Encounters\"&gt;CoM Encounters&lt;/a&gt; mod has a nasty surprise for the party in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Athkatla Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; during this chapter.\n&lt;a href=\"Eilistraee%27s%20Song\"&gt;Eilistraee's Song&lt;/a&gt; mod and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;World Map&lt;/a&gt; location is fleshed out in this chapter.\n&lt;a href=\"Expanded%20Mage%20Stronghold\"&gt;Expanded Mage Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; mod has chapter 6 content.\n&lt;a href=\"Imnesvale%20Invasion\"&gt;Imnesvale Invasion&lt;/a&gt; mod will begin upon entry to the village in this chapter.

Watch out as there will be lots of tough monsters scattered around the city. Fight your way to the southwest corner and defeat &lt;a href=\"Raamilat\"&gt;Raamilat&lt;/a&gt; who is guarding &lt;a href=\"Demin%27s%20House\"&gt;Demin's House&lt;/a&gt;. Enter Demin's house and defeat the &lt;a href=\"rakshasa\"&gt;rakshasa&lt;/a&gt;. Demin will tell you that you need to find three relics and bring them to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Rillifane\"&gt;Temple of Rillifane&lt;/a&gt; to enter &lt;a href=\"The%20Palace\"&gt;The Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis part of the plot is tracked in the player's Journal as &lt;a href=\"Getting%20inside%20the%20Palace%20in%20Suldenessellar\"&gt;Getting inside the Palace in Suldenessellar&lt;/a&gt; questline. Everything done here is to further this quest.\nEnter &lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20the%20Talisman\"&gt;the House of the Talisman&lt;/a&gt; just east of Demin's House. Inside you will find a locked container with several plates on it. The elven Priest Stone in &lt;a href=\"the%20Priest%27s%20House\"&gt;the Priest's House&lt;/a&gt; above will give you a clue for opening it. Select the plates in the following order: Rune of Corellon, Symbol of Rillifane, Symbol of Water, Tree of Life, and Suldanessellar. You will receive the &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20of%20Rillifane\"&gt;Talisman of Rillifane&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnter &lt;a href=\"the%20House%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;the House of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; to the north and you will witness an elven warrior sacrifice his life to protect the &lt;a href=\"Moonblade%20%28Suldanesselar%29\"&gt;moonblade&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Demons\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;. Take the moonblade from the elven warrior's body.\nGo to the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Clearing\"&gt;Forest Clearing&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest corner of Suldanessellar and confront &lt;a href=\"Nizidramanii%27yt\"&gt;Nizidramanii'yt&lt;/a&gt; the powerful black dragon. When you have finally defeated him, take the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Goblet%20of%20Life\"&gt;Golden Goblet of Life&lt;/a&gt; from its body.\nEnter the Temple of Rillifane and defeat the enemies within. The enemies within consist of a demon and golem,\u00a0the mage &lt;a href=\"Suneer\"&gt;Suneer&lt;/a&gt; who can cast &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20Swarm\"&gt;Meteor Swarm&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(usually the latter during the former), and a rakshasa. Place the talisman, the moonblade and the goblet on the altar to summon the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Rillifane\"&gt;Avatar of Rillifane&lt;/a&gt;. He will awaken the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Spirit\"&gt;guardian spirits&lt;/a&gt; of the forest and will break the seal on the palace gates. Get the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Horn\"&gt;Stone Horn&lt;/a&gt; from inside &lt;a href=\"The%20House%20of%20the%20Horn\"&gt;the House of the Horn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Harp\"&gt;Stone Harp&lt;/a&gt; from inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Harpist%27s%20House\"&gt;the Harpist's House&lt;/a&gt; if you have not already done so.\nEnter the palace in the northeast part of Suldanessellar. Click on the tree in front of you a few times to gather its nuts. The larger nuts can be used for healing. Put the Stone Horn and the Stone Harp on the statues by the pool to reveal a staircase to the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life\"&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, the Ward gets an opportunity to dialog with each member of the party in what turns out to be failed attempts to let each one go if they want to. \nAt this point of the adventure this part of the plot is tracked in the player's Journal as the &lt;a href=\"Freeing%20Queen%20Ellesime\"&gt;Freeing Queen Ellesime&lt;/a&gt; questline. Everything done here is to further this quest.\nAfter going down the stairs, an image of Ellesime will appear at the bottom of the staircase and will ask you to kill the parasites that are killing the tree of life. Walk along the branches and find the three large parasites. In certain places, a new branch will be grown from one of the smaller Tree of Life nuts which will allow your &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; to cross. When you click on a parasite, two &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s will appear to defend it. Defeat the elementals and then click on the parasite again to kill it. When the last parasite has been killed, Irenicus will lose the power from the Tree of Life. Your party will appear before him and he will attack you. He is incredibly strong, a usual tactic for him being casting &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Immunity\"&gt;Absolute Immunity&lt;/a&gt; and a few other protective &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, then Time Stop, then &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; on one of your characters, maybe &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt; on one who is low on health, &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly another Time Stop, all during the original Time Stop.\nThe Abyss (or Hell) Chapter 7, Part 2.\nThis section is tilted Chapter 7, Part 2 as shown in the player's game journal.\nOnce you have defeated Irenicus, your soul will be dragged down with Irenicus into &lt;a href=\"The%20Abyss\"&gt;The Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. Any party companions are also drawn there. \nThe player's journal will now register the &lt;a href=\"Finding%20Irenicus%20in%20Hell\"&gt;Finding Irenicus in Hell&lt;/a&gt; questline. Everything done here is to further this quest.\nTo open the Abyssal Door, you need to find all five &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tears of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on your performance in any challenge and the current alignment, &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; can change to &lt;a href=\"neutral%20evil\"&gt;neutral evil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt;, which means in the perspective of the story, that they have fallen to the dark influence of &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;the Lord of Murder&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the purpose of documenting the tests - in counterclockwise order (the player can do these in any order desired), the first staircase leads to a wraith-&lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt;, who represents the sin wrath. Kill him and take the first &lt;a href=\"Tear%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tear of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;. Giving in to his taunts and turning into the &lt;a href=\"slayer\"&gt;slayer&lt;/a&gt; is the evil method and killing him without using the slayer ability the good one.\nAt the end of the second staircase, you will be met by a demon named &lt;a href=\"Greed\"&gt;Greed&lt;/a&gt;. He will give you the &lt;a href=\"Blackrazor\"&gt;Blackrazor&lt;/a&gt;. Either give the Blackrazor to the enslaved genie (the good method) or defeat him (the evil method) to keep the blade. Either way, your will free the genie and receive another tear.\nThe third staircase leads to the demon Selfishness. He will snatch one of the members of your party and you have to choose a path. If you go through the door on the right, the &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; will be killed. If you dismiss all party members and enter alone, the demon will conjure a \"good and innocent\" peasant as the sacrifice. If you take the door on the left, your companion will be returned but you will lose 2 maximum HPs, 1 &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. The demon will give you a Tear. Letting your companion die is the evil choice and giving up some of your talent is the good choice.\nAt the bottom of the fourth staircase, the demon Fear will offer to give you an evil &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Bravery\"&gt;Cloak of Bravery&lt;/a&gt; made from the skins of innocent nymphs. If you have some fear protection, take the lower passage. Otherwise, take the upper passage and defeat the &lt;a href=\"beholders\"&gt;beholders&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the glowing red stone to find another Tear. Accepting the evil cloak is the evil way and rejecting it is the good way.\nAt the end of the fifth and final staircase, a demon will praise you for your mighty deeds and try to get you to fight a terrible beast. Refusing to give in to your pride and to fight the creature just because it is in your way is the good option, while killing the dragon is the evil way. Speak to or kill the dragon and he will give you the final Tear. The dragon yields 22000 XP and drops scrolls Wail of the Banshee, Time Stop and Sphere of Chaos, Guard's Ring +2, arrows of dispelling, bolts of lightning, Robe of the Evil Magi. \nClick on the plates next to each eye surrounding the Abyssal Door when you have all five Tears of Bhaal. Every tear offered to the door will give Gorion's Ward a bonus depending on what choices they made during the tests. One tear provides +2 to saving throws, the second yields +2 AC (evil) or 20% immunity to fire, cold and electricity, the third +15 HP (evil) or 10% magic resistance (good), the fourth provides immunity to +1 weapons or less (good) or +2 constitution (evil) and the fifth +1 to charisma and wisdom (playing as a Blade, not sure if other classes result in something different)\nThe door will open and Irenicus will come through. Irenicus will summon four demons to aid him, and the final battle will begin. Defeat Irenicus once and for all and you will regain your soul.\nEpilogue.\nCongratulations, you have now completed \"Shadows of Amn\". The prophecy is only starting, as your &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt; destiny awaits in \"\"."}

After defeating &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; and saving &lt;a href=\"Suldanessellar\"&gt;Suldanessellar&lt;/a&gt;, you will find yourself transported into a sacred grove of the ancient gods after you have been refused access to Suldanessellar, because of being a Bhaalspawn. The final and most bloody part of Alaundo's prophecy about the Bhaalspawn is about to unfold...\nForest Spirit.\nYou will find yourself in the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Heads\"&gt;Spirit Heads&lt;/a&gt; forested area, either on your own or with all party members who have been imported from . Click on any of the stone spirit heads and that will initiate a fateful of a prophecy as told by a &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Spirit\"&gt;Forest Spirit&lt;/a&gt; that involves you and father &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;. After the prophecy has been told, a Journal entry registers:\nthe party is moved to a clearing in the forest.\nSoon after, a cut scene moves the party to a clearing encircled by crumbling obelisks. You will receive a message warning you that someone is coming to you, and that you must prepare for battle. After a few rounds, a female Elf called &lt;a href=\"Illasera\"&gt;Illasera&lt;/a&gt; will appear and speak to you, saying she is also a Bhaalspawn and her goal is to kill you. If you are on your own, she will attack by herself. If you have a party imported or with you, she also will have her own allies to attack with. Illasera is the first of &lt;a href=\"The%20Five\"&gt;The Five&lt;/a&gt; you'll face in this campaign. She is also probably the least powerful one as well. For a discussion of the battle with illasera and if applicable, her \"Black Reaver\" allies, go to her article page.\nPocket Plane.\nAfter she is killed, you will be taken to the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28area%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Solar\"&gt;Solar&lt;/a&gt; will talk to you and promise to aid you with knowledge in the upcoming future. When she leaves, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt; will appear in front of you and will give you important knowledge if you give him part of your soul. If &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; is in the party, you can convince her to give up a part of her soul. After telling you of your first challenge he will offer to join your party. You can refuse or accept. The &lt;a href=\"Fate%20Spirit\"&gt;Fate Spirit&lt;/a&gt; will then address you and is able to summon any former companions to your aid, if they survived Shadows of Amn.\nEnter the room northwest where your first challenge awaits. Another Bhaalspawn will say the test is \"retribution\". Enemies will constantly appear at three points in the room and the type of enemies will depend on your alignment. When you have completed the test and killed them all, you will gain the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane (ability)&lt;/a&gt; . When ready, move through the Pocket Plane exit and planar travel to &lt;a href=\"Saradush\"&gt;Saradush&lt;/a&gt;. The Pocket Plane ability takes the party where they need to go, not necessarily where they want to go.\nSaradush.\nWhen you arrive in Saradush, you will see &lt;a href=\"Melissan\"&gt;Melissan&lt;/a&gt; and some commoners trying to gain audience with the leader of the town, &lt;a href=\"Gromnir%20Il-Khan\"&gt;Gromnir Il-Khan&lt;/a&gt;. Il-Khan soldiers will see you, mistake you for invaders and attack. Once they are dead, Melissan will explain the ongoing situation in Saradush, and ask you to gain entrance into Gromnir's castle and talk to him. Since the two official entrances are sealed, you have to find another. It quickly turns out that there are two ways in, just go a few steps down the castle ramp and speak to the whore in front of House Santele and she gives you the first hints on both (and an unmarked side quest). They can be combined to maximize XP:\nBoth ways lead to the castle basement, and the first time you enter it, you will receive 3000 XP per party member. Explore it until you find the staircase in the north-east corner. You will encounter a few hostile assassins, soldiers and orcs along the way and watch out for traps.\nOn the first floor you will immediately be under attack from more of Gromnir's battle troops; perfectly suited for Invisibility and &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Contingency\"&gt;Chain Contingency&lt;/a&gt; with three &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzims&lt;/a&gt;. When you have defeated them (70.000 XP), you can open the main castle entrance and use it at will. When you are ready, go up to the second floor.\nWhen you reach the second floor you will see Gromnir Il-Khan arresting Melissan for plotting to kill all Bhaalspawn by manipulating them to kill each other, and especially for bringing you in the city to kill him. After their dialogue he will notice you and attack. Once he and his companions are dead (94.000 XP for the kills and 30.000 XP per party member), Melissan will re-appear and tell you, that to save the city and the Bhaalspawn refugees, your next mission is to kill &lt;a href=\"Yaga-Shura\"&gt;Yaga-Shura&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the sieging army. Since he was made invincible, she will ask you to find a way to make him vulnerable to death again so you can defeat him. She gives hints about an old temple of Bhaal in the Forest of Mir and about Yaga-Shura's Lair in the Walking Mountains.\nYaga-Shura.\nUsing your Pocket Plane ability, return to the Pocket Plane. From now on, the Pocket Plane exit will offer more destinations than to return to your previous position. Prepare for battle, exit the plane and tell the spirit that you want to go to on the path to Yaga-Shura's lair. You will find yourself in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Forest%20%28Throne%20of%20Bhaal%29\"&gt;North Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the moment you arrive in the North Forest, you stumble into 11 of Yaga-Shura's soldiers attacking a merchant caravan. They will turn and attack your party (7900 XP). Speak to the only surviving merchant &lt;a href=\"Karthis%20al-Hezzar\"&gt;Karthis al-Hezzar&lt;/a&gt; after the battle and he will offer to sell you what remains of his interesting goods. After this battle you will be able to travel on the world map, including &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Continue through the forest, battle some &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giant\"&gt;Fire Giant&lt;/a&gt;s and other soldiers of Yaga-Shura at a wooden bridge (36.600 XP) and at the east (44.100 XP), then travel to the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Mir%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Temple\"&gt;Forest of Mir \u2013 The Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter arriving at the Forest of Mir, prepare for a battle with shadow creatures. Go along the temple path and you will find a spirit of &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt; (or so it seems), who will be infuriated with your actions. If you have romanced one of your companions, there will be a personal torment for them as well. The Gorion figure will turn into a &lt;a href=\"wraith\"&gt;wraith&lt;/a&gt; and will attack with &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Wraith\"&gt;vampiric mists and wraiths&lt;/a&gt; and other shadow units (74.500 XP). Enter the temple ruins and you will have to fight a variety of big skeletons (43.200 xP). Go up the stairs and talk to &lt;a href=\"Nyalee\"&gt;Nyalee&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that Yaga-Shura is her adopted son and how you can defeat him. She wants you to retrieve her's and Yaga-Shura's heart from his lair. Now travel to the &lt;a href=\"Marching%20Mountains\"&gt;Marching Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Marching Mountains you will occasionally encounter Fire Giant patrols. Until you reach the northern exit, they will respawn fast at two spawn points, making this mountain area a profitable hunting ground, and after that resting will provide you with more sparring partners. In the northeast of the map you will find the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Yaga-Shura%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Yaga-Shura's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Yaga-Shura's lair you will immediately be attacked in the entrance section by many Fire Giants (if they see you), including two &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Fire%20Giant\"&gt;Elite Fire Giant&lt;/a&gt;s (26.000 XP each). Watch out for the lava areas and the traps. The wall levers in the chambers left and right of the entrance can not be used yet. In the second section there are chambers left and right sealed magically. In the third section you can not go any further because of an invisible magical barrier before the next stairs, generated by the machine in the middle of the room. But there are chambers left and right with containers. In the left (northwest) chamber you will find the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20Wardstone\"&gt;Hammer Wardstone&lt;/a&gt; (and a &lt;a href=\"Girdle%20of%20Fire%20Giant%20Strength\"&gt;Girdle of Fire Giant Strength&lt;/a&gt;). As soon as you touch the pillar, several enemies will appear. In the right (northeast) chamber you loot the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Wardstone\"&gt;Skull Wardstone&lt;/a&gt; (prepare for battle with Golems including a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Golem\"&gt;Magic Golem&lt;/a&gt;). Now you return to the side chambers of the entrance, where you now can use the wall levers (5000 XP per party member for each lever) to open the left and right chamber of the second sections, whose magical barriers have vanished. Prepare for battle with &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Man\"&gt;Burning Men&lt;/a&gt; and others, loot the containers there for two more wardstones. In the right chamber an Erinnye will drop the &lt;a href=\"Psion%27s%20Blade\"&gt;Psion's Blade&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent weapon against Illithides. When you have collected the four wardstones, click the machine in the middle of the third section and the invisible barrier in front of the exit in the north will disappear (20.000 XP per party member). Go up the stairs to the second floor.\nOn the second floor you will be greeted by two fire giants. There is a trap at the top of the stairs so move with caution. The large doors in front of you are too big and heavy for you to push, so you will have to go through the small lava passages at the sides, an ideal bottleneck for the battle with the guards inside - they are too big to pass and will wait there to be killed from afar. Once they are killed (including their officer Berenn, 40.500 XP), disarm the many traps and collect Yaga-Shura's heart from the dais. Go through either of the doors at the side of the dais to enter Yaga-Shura's bedroom. To open the doors, you need at least strength 22, which should not be a problem at this point in the game, someone equipped with &lt;a href=\"Crom%20Faeyr\"&gt;Crom Faeyr&lt;/a&gt; or one of the girdles of strength or using one of the conveniently nearby deposited potions of Fire Giant strength can do it. Enter on the left side and lure the Burning Men out to not trigger any trap. For their Lord Imix you will receive 50.000 XP. Disarm several traps in the room and take Nyalee's heart from the large stone bed. Speak with the slave on the right, free her for 15.000 XP per party member, ask her any question you want (she is only there to clarify your next step if you did not speak to Nyalee yet). Afterwards you can let her go or - disgusted by her motives - kill her for 6000 XP.\nReturn to Nyalee at the temple and give her the two hearts. Once she has her heart back, she will regain her feelings for her son and will attack you with some woodland beings which consist of one Vortex Spider, two Nymphs (which cast weak spells that will probably not bother you) and two &lt;a href=\"Shambling%20mounds\"&gt;Shambling mounds&lt;/a&gt;. Kill her. After the battle travel west to the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Camp\"&gt;Siege Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you arrive in the Siege Camp you will discover that you are too late and Saradush has been sacked by the besieging army. Go west. After crossing the bridge, you will see some of Yaga-Shura's troops in the south, easy to fight without triggering Yaga-Shura. A bit to the west you encounter Yaga-Shura, who will attack your party. When he takes damage, he will claim his disbelief and leave the scene. Depending on your movements you will find him in the south or the west of the camp or even in the east beyond the bridge. Now he fights with some of his soldiers aiding him and fully restored. Some of his soldiers will drop a bit more XP and perhaps keep re-spawning.\nPerhaps depending on the game version you have the option to, instead of rushing towards Yaga-Shura and ignoring his soldiers, make a stand on the bridge and keep killing soldiers and giants, while trying to conserve your strength for Yaga-Shura. This will result in 10 minutes more or less battle before the soldiers stop spawning. This makes your battle against Yaga-Shura a bit easier, as you only have to deal with him and a few soldiers. In other versions there may be not so many soldiers at all and the camp a bit disappointing.\nAs soon as he is dead, you will be transported to the Pocket Plane where Solar will tell you about your life before you set out from &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt; with Gorion. The barriers to the second challenge will then dissolve. After your conversation ends, you will be taken back to the siege camp to collect your interesting loot.\nMelissan will appear when you return and tell you that all the Bhaalspawn in Saradush have been killed. She will also tell you that Yaga-Shura has two more allies that you must defeat. She will tell you that you can rest and stock up supplies at &lt;a href=\"Amkethran\"&gt;Amkethran&lt;/a&gt;, where an ally of her is in charge.\nGo south through the &lt;a href=\"Oasis\"&gt;Oasis&lt;/a&gt;. There you will be accused of the destruction of Saradush and will be attacked by about 20 soldiers sent by the kingdom of Tethyr. Fight your way to the east of the area (138.000 XP), collect tons of valuable loot, read your warrant poster and the remarkable letter of the tethyrian queen. Then travel to Amkethran. Chapter 9 will then begin.\nMod Content.\nChapter 8 related portrait Artwork available in your game if you install the &lt;a href=\"Portraits%20Portraits%20Everywhere\"&gt;Portraits Portraits Everywhere&lt;/a&gt; Mod"}

After defeating &lt;a href=\"Illasera\"&gt;Illasera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yaga-Shura\"&gt;Yaga-Shura&lt;/a&gt;, as well as learning your life before the death of &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt;, you move ever closer to your destiny. Under &lt;a href=\"Amelyssan\"&gt;Melissan&lt;/a&gt;'s advice you have traveled to &lt;a href=\"Amkethran\"&gt;Amkethran&lt;/a&gt; to see her ally, &lt;a href=\"Balthazar\"&gt;Balthazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmkethran.\nWhen you arrive in the town of Amkethran, go north to the monastery gates and you will be met by a monk. He will direct you to the unofficial leader of the town, Balthazar. Balthazar will give you the location of two enclaves where two more of the chaos seeking &lt;a href=\"bhaalspawn\"&gt;bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt; are, but will tell you to stay out of his way. You can go to either of the locations first but on this page it shows &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Enclave\"&gt;Sendai's Enclave&lt;/a&gt; first.\nSendai's Enclave.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Enclave\"&gt;Sendai's Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. You arrive in the &lt;a href=\"Area%20outside%20Sendai%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;area outside the enclave&lt;/a&gt; and immediately will see a woodcutter. If you want to avoid a long fight then you should try to kill the woodcutter now. If you want the experience, talk to the woodcutter. He will tell you that he saw some strange looking elves to the west. Go to the southwest area of the map and you will be attacked by &lt;a href=\"Drow\"&gt;Drow&lt;/a&gt; (96.000 XP). Talk to the woodcutter again. He will tell you that he heard some voices by his wife's grave. Go up north to the graveyard and more drow will attack (32.500 XP). When you return to the woodcutter again, he and several other drow will attack you (around 25.000 XP). Once the woodcutter is dead, the entrance to the enclave will appear (10.000 XP per party member). Kill the three guards (19.500 xp) and disarm the trap. Scan the map for another Drow group in the southeast (around 25.000 XP). Go through the entrance into the enclave.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Entrance%20Sendai%27s%20Lair\"&gt;entrance area&lt;/a&gt; fight your way east to the drow barracks. Along the way you will encounter many spiders, spore, drow and umber hulks. In the barracks you will have to fight more drow. Take the key from Thelynn'ss' body. As you leave the barracks with the key, you will see a cut-scene where &lt;a href=\"Sendai\"&gt;Sendai&lt;/a&gt; is being told of the intruder (you) and tells a commander to release her pets into the south tunnels and her slaves in the north tunnels (5000 XP per party member).\nWhen you are out of the barracks, you must choose whether to go through the north or south tunnels (you can combine them). If you go through the &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Lair%20North%20Tunnels\"&gt;north tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, you will have to fight the slaves that will keep appearing until you have killed the slave master (so long as you stay near the entrance, this will be &lt;a href=\"Derro\"&gt;Derro-Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; at 12.000 XP each, an easy farming spot). If you go through the &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Lair%20South%20Tunnels\"&gt;southern tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, you will have to fight many spiders and defeat their queen &lt;a href=\"Lashar%27ra\"&gt;Lashar'ra&lt;/a&gt;. In the side areas there are many traps (worth around 25.000 XP). If you travel through the southern tunnels and reach the next area, the slave master of the northern tunnel will disappear, disabling the spawning function.\nAfter making your way through either of the tunnels, you arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Lair%20Crossway\"&gt;crossroads&lt;/a&gt;. Go down the north-west stairs, kill the drow and enter Odamaron's Lair. Defeat the lich &lt;a href=\"Odamaron\"&gt;Odamaron&lt;/a&gt; and take the Drow Wardstone (and the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Heart of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;) off his body. As you leave with the wardstone you will see another cut-scene, this time where Sendai finds out that the intruder (still you) is &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and tells &lt;a href=\"Diaytha\"&gt;Diaytha&lt;/a&gt; her priestess to stop the ward from getting further into her enclave (5000 XP per party member). When you are out with the Drow Wardstone, go through the north-east door. \nYou arrive in &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Lair%20Diaytha%20Abishai\"&gt;Diaythas area&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Diaytha\"&gt;Diaytha&lt;/a&gt; will set you a challenge which you must complete before you can reach her. The door on the right will open and you will have to kill two &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Earth%20Elemental\"&gt;Greater Earth elementals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ogremoch\"&gt;Ogremoch&lt;/a&gt;, the prince of the Earth. Ogremoch has the ability to cast &lt;a href=\"Earthquake\"&gt;Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. When the prince is dead, the door on the left will open. Through the door on the left you will have to fight Diaytha, a &lt;a href=\"Hive%20Mother\"&gt;Hive Mother&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Knight\"&gt;Demon Knight&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Abishai\"&gt;Abishai&lt;/a&gt;. When Diaytha the priestess is dead, the door to the next area will open.\nIn the next &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Lair%20Captain%20Egeissag\"&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; you will find Captain &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Egeissag\"&gt;Egeissag&lt;/a&gt;. The beholder next to him will suggest a one-on-one pit fight. If you reject the offer you will have to fight the captain and his very hard to reach drow warriors. If you accept, the beholder will cast a &lt;a href=\"geas\"&gt;geas&lt;/a&gt; on your party and the Captain's drow warriors so when one person dies so will their allies. When the captain is dead, you will see yet another cut-scene, this time where Sendai is ordering her &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;mind flayer&lt;/a&gt; ally &lt;a href=\"Mithykyl\"&gt;Mithykyl&lt;/a&gt; to unleash his illithid against Gorion's Ward (5000 XP per party member).\nBuff up as usual (&lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%2C%2010%27%20Radius\"&gt;Protection from Evil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chant\"&gt;Chant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Invisibility\"&gt;Mass Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and others), give Minsc or another appropriate character the &lt;a href=\"Psion%27s%20Blade\"&gt;Psions Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Go through the exit in the arena and you will be in a &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Lair%20Mithykyl\"&gt;mind flayer lair&lt;/a&gt;. Well prepared, it is a matter of seconds to kill the &lt;a href=\"Ulitharid\"&gt;Ulitharid&lt;/a&gt; and the Umber Hulk. Behind the two doors on the right dispatch two &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Illithid\"&gt;Vampiric Illithids&lt;/a&gt; (14.000 XP each). Go through the small passageway through the door opposite you and you will be attacked by Mithykyl, along with a couple of Ulitharids and Umber Hulks. Before you go into the next and last area, you should rest and prepare for a tough battle.\nIn the last area, &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Lair%20Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Sendais Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, Sendai will hail you and create seven statues of herself, each one on one of the platforms in the sanctum. After she is done talking, she will teleport out and one of the statues will turn to life and attack. Each time a copy of Sendai is dead, two drow will appear on the stairs out and another statue will turn to life. When all the copies of Sendai are gone, the real Sendai will re-appear and attack. When she is dead, you will be sent to the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28area%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Solar\"&gt;Solar&lt;/a&gt; will ask you of your future and open another challenge.\nAbazigal's Lair.\nWhen you arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Abazigal%27s%20Entrance\"&gt;Abazigal's Entrance&lt;/a&gt;, you will meet &lt;a href=\"Abazigal\"&gt;Abazigal&lt;/a&gt;'s son, &lt;a href=\"Draconis%20%28humanoid%20form%29\"&gt;Draconis&lt;/a&gt;. He will say that only his kind, dragons, are worthy of Bhaal's blood and attack in human form. When he is near death he will change into his true, dragon form and be replenished. This can be a tough battle as his breath can cause acid damage and is able to turn invisible over and over again (buffs like &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; are helpful). When you have finally killed him, take his head off his body so you can enter inside &lt;a href=\"Abazigal%27s%20Lair%20Entrance%20Hall\"&gt;Abazigal's Lair Entrance Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you arrive in the &lt;a href=\"Abazigal%27s%20Lair%20Entrance%20Hall\"&gt;Abazigal's Lair Entrance Hall&lt;/a&gt;, your presence will quickly be realized and the place will be locked down. Straight away you will have to fight a Greater &lt;a href=\"Werewyvern\"&gt;Werewyvern&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Earth%20Elemental\"&gt;Lesser Earth Elementals&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you collect the empty flask off the Werewyvern's body. As all the doors have been locked, you will have to get around by swimming through the underground tunnels.\nGo to the fourth (the most western) pool and click on it to dive through it to reach the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Salamander%20Cave%20%28Abazigal%27s%20Lair%29\"&gt;Frost Salamander Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Kill a few &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Salamander\"&gt;Frost Salamanders&lt;/a&gt;. Go to the other side of the area and walk through the exit to the next room. When you have killed the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Fiend\"&gt;Bone Fiends&lt;/a&gt;, click on the spring to fill the &lt;a href=\"Empty%20Breath%20Potion%20Flask\"&gt;empty flask&lt;/a&gt; you collected earlier. Go the same way back to the entrance area.\nNext go through the first (the most eastern) pool, you arrive in &lt;a href=\"Abazigal%27s%20Lair%20Cells\"&gt;Abazigal's Lair Cells&lt;/a&gt;. Fight your way through the many &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toa\"&gt;Kuo-Toa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Water%20Elemental\"&gt;Greater Water Elementals&lt;/a&gt;. In a cell you will find one of Balthazars monks (Hindo?), caught while on a special mission. Speak to him and he will give you a rope that will help you get through the not-so-clear tunnels. He will also tell you of a dragon under Abazigal's influence that guards the inner sanctums of his lair, and that you need a &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Scroll of Reversal&lt;/a&gt; to free it. Then he will die and drop the upgrade item &lt;a href=\"Hindo%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Hindo's Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Return to the entrance area.\nNow go through the third (center north) pool, you arrive in the &lt;a href=\"Abazigal%27s%20Lair%20Iycanth%20the%20Mad%20Bondari\"&gt;laboratory area&lt;/a&gt;. Here you will find many floating eyeballs known as 'Seekers'. They are fast moving and can constantly keep casting Acid and Flame arrow. Go to the north-west of this area and you can talk to &lt;a href=\"Iycanth%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Iycanth the Mad&lt;/a&gt;. He will agree to give you a Scroll of Reversal if you fetch him a &lt;a href=\"Gauth%20Eyestalk\"&gt;Gauth's Eyestalk&lt;/a&gt;. You can either dive through the pool just east of you and kill the &lt;a href=\"Gauth\"&gt;Gauth&lt;/a&gt;, who is accompanied by three &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Elder Orbs&lt;/a&gt;. Or you can use a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20to%20Flesh%20Scroll\"&gt;Stone to Flesh Scroll&lt;/a&gt; to restore three adventures and get them to do the task for you. They will return immediately (real time, the ingame time will be a few days) with the eyestalk and the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Pantalettes\"&gt;Bronze Pantalettes&lt;/a&gt; (the last upgrade item required for the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Metal%20Unit\"&gt;Big Metal Unit&lt;/a&gt;), which is the only way to get the latter. You can combine the two ways: after obtaining the pantalettes, you can dive yourself through the pool, the Gauth and the Elder Orbs will still be there for 51.000 XP. When you have the eyestalk, search for Iycanth, who seemingly vanished - actually he did go to his laboratory which you will reach diving through the pool just west of the position of the statues. Give him the eyestalk, he will give you the Scroll of Reversal. Loot his tables for the &lt;a href=\"Juggernaut%20Golem%20Page\"&gt;Juggernaut Golem Page&lt;/a&gt;. Find your way back to the Entrance area, the formerly sealed lab door can be opened from inside and the same goes for the door in the southeast of this area.\nNext dive through the second (center south) pool, you arrive in &lt;a href=\"Abazigal%27s%20Lair%20Fll%27Yissetat\"&gt;Abazigals Antechambers&lt;/a&gt;. Go to the west of the area and talk to &lt;a href=\"Fll%27Yissetat\"&gt;Fil'Yissetat&lt;/a&gt;, the guardian dragon. Use the Scroll of Reversal on her and she will give you &lt;a href=\"Abazigal%27s%20Wardstone\"&gt;Abazigal's Wardstone&lt;/a&gt; so you can enter his inner sanctum. The door between the antechambers and the entrance area can now be opened from inside. Prepare for a tough battle, because after entering the next area, you can not leave it anymore until the battle is won (teleporting to the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28area%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane&lt;/a&gt; is possible, but from there you can only return to your previous position).\nIn &lt;a href=\"Abazigal%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;Abazigals Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; you will encounter eight &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Salamander\"&gt;Ice Salamanders&lt;/a&gt; surrounding &lt;a href=\"Abazigal\"&gt;Abazigal&lt;/a&gt;. Dispatch them without Abazigal spotting you, sneaking along the walls and luring them to you. Buff up, he does not dispel anything in his human form. When you see Abazigal, he will reiterate what Draconis said about dragons being the only kind worthy of Bhaal's blood. Like Draconis he will start out in human form and only when he is near death will change into his true dragon form. He has a powerful breath ability that works like &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, but a lot worse. But he dispels almost nothing of your buffs or clones and summons, so tanking with units soaking the damage and his initial debuff will do.\nWhen he is dead, you will be summoned back to the Pocket Plane where you will find out about the five and their actions. Back and leaving Abazigals Lair you will encounter Elminster who gives you the last hints.\nBalthazar.\nWhen you have defeated both Abazigal and Sendai, return to &lt;a href=\"Amkethran\"&gt;Amkethran&lt;/a&gt; and find a way inside Balthazar's monastery. From this point on, any monk or mercenary here will be hostile, as you have been made a public enemy. There are three ways:\nIf you go for the gates, you will have to kill the leader of the monks (20.000 XP) and take the key off him. The monks at the gate and the mercenaries at their tents will keep re-spawning until 15 to 20 of each group have shown up (10.000 XP each monk, 8000 XP each mercenary).\nIf you want help from Saemon, you need to talk to him in the smugglers cave. He will take you into the monastery and meet up with some more monks. He will leave you there to fight them.\nIf you want to go through the graveyard, Speak to Zakee Rafeha, the tavernkeeper, and he will tell you that Faheed and Majira might know a way in. Speak to them in their house on the cliff and you will be given the Graveyard Key. In the Graveyard, the Key will open one of the doors on the balcony that will lead to the Monastery.\nWhen inside the monastery, you should prepare for battle before moving. When you start to go up the stairs, you will be instantly sent in front of Balthazar at his throne.\nBalthazar will say that he plans to take Bhaal's power for himself, but not to cause chaos. He wants to take Bhaal's power and then perform a suicide ritual to kill him and Bhaal together. He will say your death is a necessity and attack.\nBalthazar has the standard &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; abilities as well as additional abilities which you wouldn't be able to get. These abilities are:\nThe battle should be easier than the ones with Sendai and Abazigal, if you buff up and work extensively with summons. When Balthazar is dead, you will be yet again be summoned to the Pocket Plane. This time you will learn of &lt;a href=\"Melissan\"&gt;Melissan&lt;/a&gt;'s deceit towards you and the five, and who she really is. Back at the monastery you now have the last possibility to travel to other areas, including &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watchers Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you have killed Balthazar and completed the five challenges in the Pocket Plane, prepare for the last battle. In the next area you can not rest, so it can help to have &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; memorized.\nWhen prepared, go through the exit one last time and Chapter 10 will begin."}

Balduran returned with tales of strange, vast lands across the sea. On this adventure he acquired vast wealth and on returning to his small home harbor, invested much of this wealth into fortifying the towns walls. He then set off to explore Anchorome further but never returned. His money was put to good use however, and the small harbor soon became Baldur's Gate, one of the largest cities in Faer\u00fbn.\nBalduran's Final Voyage.\nAbout three hundred years ago, Balduran sailed back to the wondrous lands he had discovered with a crew of two hundred. They were granted permission to adventure through the lands by the Cursed Lord of Anchorome and they gathered a great store of wealth.\nUpon returning to the city, they were attacked, presumably by the Cursed Lord, and one hundred and fifty men were killed. Balduran conscripted locals to fill his depleted ranks for the voyage home. There were incidents while at sea, the mood of the crew was getting worse, and the ship began to run low on supplies. Having discovered by accident what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Isle of Balduran&lt;/a&gt;, the crew anchored off the &lt;a href=\"Lycanthrope%20Island%20North\"&gt;northern&lt;/a&gt; half to replenish their supplies.\nAround the time they reached the island, Balduran made note in his logbook that both the original crew and the crew he hired in Anchorome were beginning to exhibit the initial effects of what turned out to be &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, unbeknownst to them that they were indeed infected with the curse.\nNot long after landing on the island, the curse struck and fighting broke out. It appears, from eye-witness accounts, that some of the crew may have never contacted the curse and it is presumed that they were all killed in the ensuing conflict.\nDuring the battle the ship was beached and scuttled. This may have been on purpose to prevent the curse from leaving the island. With the ship destroyed and no other way to leave the island, the two strains of lycanthropes were left to fight amongst themselves for survival. When the fighting reached a standstill, the wolfweres took residence in the ruins of the ship while the werewolfs withdrew to the &lt;a href=\"Lycanthrope%20Island%20South\"&gt;southern&lt;/a&gt; end of the island and established their village.\n&lt;a href=\"Dradeel\"&gt;Dradeel&lt;/a&gt;, the guide for Balduran's adventures to Anchorome, was in charge of the landing party when the curse hit. Being an elf, the curse had no effect on him. He was knocked out by a lycanthrope in the fighting and when he came too the battle was over. He searched for survivors and found none.\nWhen dawn arrived he came upon an ancient village and took shelter in an &lt;a href=\"Dradeel%27s%20Cabin\"&gt;abandoned hut&lt;/a&gt;. He discovered a cave below the hut and survived on water from a freshwater stream and a peculiar sightless fish for the past three hundred years. Dradeel's attempts to negotiate with either clan or cure their lycanthropy via enchanted food met with failure. He correctly conjectured that the leaders of the clans must be exterminated to dispel the curse, but without his spellbook, which was still on board the ship, Dradeel lacked the strength to do it and was unable to venture far from his abode.\nAs for Balduran's fate, tales passed down through the generations by the members of the Werewolf Village, indicate that he may have contracted the curse as well and that he fought on the side of the wolfwere's. It seems he was instrumental in the killing of many on both sides of the conflict and that he refused to \"belong\". He was left to his ship by the ancestors of the village and his personal fate yet remains a mystery.\nItems.\nAs a long-deceased historical character, the player never meets Balduran in the game. However, the player is given the chance to acquire a number of items that belonged to Balduran towards the end of the original game and during the expansion pack \"(Tales of the Sword Coast)\", with more becoming available in \"Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn\"."}

This walk-through describes the main line for this quest and the side quests you can pick up on the island.

She has a lot to say and add the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Mysterious%20Island\"&gt;The Mysterious Island&lt;/a&gt;, which will serve as a guide for &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;the protagonist's&lt;/a&gt; stay here.\nShe will tell you to speak with &lt;a href=\"Kaishas%20Gan\"&gt;Kaishas Gan&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, everyone you try to talk to, will tell you to talk to Kaishas. Until you've spoken to her \u2013 no one will have anything useful to contribute.\nThe Southern Part.\nHead Northwest on the Island and walk through the open gate . Head into the &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20Village%20Huts%23AR2002\"&gt;Chieftain's House&lt;/a&gt; and speak with her. During the conversation she will ask you to help fight off the 'beasts' that threaten them and their leader &lt;a href=\"Karoug\"&gt;Karoug&lt;/a&gt;, while they build a ship to sail back.\nRight outside the chieftain's house stands &lt;a href=\"Maralee\"&gt;Maralee&lt;/a&gt; who is &lt;a href=\"Maralee%27s%20Child\"&gt;looking for her child&lt;/a&gt;. Outside the gates you can speak with Evalt who is looking for his &lt;a href=\"Evalt%27s%20Missing%20Brother\"&gt;missing brother&lt;/a&gt;. He may wander around a bit.\nIf you want to, you can teach five year old &lt;a href=\"Farthing\"&gt;Farthing&lt;/a&gt; about the virtues of , but if you do she won't have much else to contribute at this point and refuse further dialogue. It is better to pretend to be only three. Then she will be your friend and asks you to look for &lt;a href=\"Farthing%27s%20Dolly%20%28quest%29\"&gt;her dolly&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthwest within the gates female protagonists can find &lt;a href=\"Durlyle\"&gt;Durlyle&lt;/a&gt; and male protagonists &lt;a href=\"Delainy\"&gt;Delainy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are some supplies in containers in the huts, silo's and storages and no one cares if you take them. Beware of a few .\nThe Northern Part.\nHead north and travel to the next screen. Pretty immediately you'll find a man named &lt;a href=\"Palin%20%28Isle%20of%20Balduran%29\"&gt;Palin&lt;/a&gt;. He will ask you to help defeat the monsters, and ask you to follow him if you accept. Then Palin will attack you along with 4 '&lt;a href=\"Wolfweres\"&gt;Wolfweres&lt;/a&gt;'. The Wolfwere's are fairly strong so it's advised to buff up before this fight. Palin is in possession of &lt;a href=\"Farthing%27s%20Dolly\"&gt;Farthing's Dolly&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinuing on more North East, you'll run into a woman named &lt;a href=\"Kryla\"&gt;Kryla&lt;/a&gt; . She tells you a man named Jondal has been ambushed by the wolf men, and if you accept to help her, it will start the quest &lt;a href=\"Jondal%27s%20Murder\"&gt;Jondal's Murder&lt;/a&gt;. She will walk slightly up, tell Jondal that she has 'brought him a feast,' and instantly two Wolfweres will jump out and attack your party. Defeating them finishes this quick quest.\nThere's a house nearby where Kryla and Jondal attacked, inside is a man named Dradeel. Dradeel will tell you about how he and Balduran's Ship was attacked and destroyed, and then also ask you to retrieve his spellbook from the ship's wreckage, beginning the quest &lt;a href=\"Dradeel%27s%20Spellbook\"&gt;Dradeel's Spellbook&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Dradeel's cabin there's a chest, inside there's the holy cloak which you can return to Durlyle to complete Durlyle's Task, and also now pick up the quest &lt;a href=\"Flowers_for_Delainy\"&gt;Flowers_for_Delainy&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind a &lt;a href=\"Sirine%20Queen\"&gt;Sirine Queen&lt;/a&gt; who has Evalt's Brother's Body, which is needed for &lt;a href=\"Evalt%27s%20Missing%20Brother\"&gt;Evalt's Missing Brother&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ship.\nIn the very North East corner of the map you'll find the ship-wrecked ship of Balduran, the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Eye\"&gt;Wandering Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Inside there are a lot of Wolfweres on Every level. Be wary that some of the containers you can search on the ship are trapped. Make sure to pick up the weapon &lt;a href=\"Werebane\"&gt;Werebane&lt;/a&gt; for your thief. It is made of silver and is one of the few weapons that can harm &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Wolfwere\"&gt;Greater Wolfwere&lt;/a&gt; and above.\nKaroug.\nOn the fourth level of the ship you'll find a man named &lt;a href=\"Karoug\"&gt;Karoug&lt;/a&gt;. who is a &lt;a href=\"Loup%20Garou\"&gt;Loup Garou&lt;/a&gt;. Every dialogue option leads to him and his army of Wolfweres attacking your party. Note that Greater Wolfweres and Loup Garou regenerate their health, and that they are immune to any weapon that is not made of . The best tactic to use here is any silver weapon in combination with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; cast by a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; from memory or scroll. Wands cast as a level 1 and won't do a lot of damage. If you only have the Werebane you may need &lt;a href=\"Evermemory\"&gt;Evermemory&lt;/a&gt; to have enough casts of Magic Missile available to end his existence. \nStarting the fight starts the quest &lt;a href=\"Karoug%20and%20the%20Wolfweres\"&gt;Karoug and the Wolfweres&lt;/a&gt; and defeating them ends it.\nI suggest first sending in a rogue in that's invisible and hiding in shadows to grab the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Balduran%20%28BG1%29\"&gt;Sword of Balduran&lt;/a&gt;, as it is also made of silver and very effective against the Greater Wolfwere, and bring it back to your party. Then equip all your silver weapons, cast haste and protection spells, and get ready to take them on. I also suggest drawing the regular Wolfweres down two levels and dealing with them before going in for the Greater Wolfwere.\nKaroug should drop &lt;a href=\"Peladan\"&gt;Peladan&lt;/a&gt;, who is Maralee's child and you can bring back to Maralee to gain her gratitude. Don't forget to pick up &lt;a href=\"Dradeel%27s%20Spellbook\"&gt;Dradeel's Spellbook&lt;/a&gt; which is also located on the fourth floor of the ship.\nBack to the Village.\nOn your way back to the south of the isle, pass by &lt;a href=\"Dradeel%27s%20Cabin\"&gt;Dradeel's Cabin&lt;/a&gt; to hand him the spellbook.\nReturn to the village and speak with anyone you still have a quest with \u2013 except Kaishas Gan \u2013 otherwise you cannot complete the others any more.\nThe Gift of Lycanthropy.\nOnce done, speak to Kaishas and she will inform you she intends to trap you here on the island until her mate returns. Also \u2013 she has gifted you with the blessing of Lycanthropy.\nOutside the gates Maralee will inform you there's a way to escape. There's a secret door that leads to their home below the ground, which in turn leads to a ship ready to sail in a bay that you can take to get home and off the island.\nAlternatively Durlyle/Delainy may also approach you and tell you of a way off of the island and it can also be Dradeel (who apparently didn't teleport off the island just yet). \nFollowing any of their instructions you'll find the hut with the secret door. Go through the tunnels killing any obstacles and picking up some potions. Then make your way to the north east area of it, where the way out is. Once outside Kaishas Gan is guarding the ship and will attack no matter the dialogue options you pick. After defeating her return home using the ship's wheel.\nMendas.\nUpon your return, a man named &lt;a href=\"Baresh\"&gt;Baresh&lt;/a&gt; will approach you and ask you what happened. As you inform him how you dealt with Kaishas Gan, he will run into the house in a not so good mood.\nAfter this conversation, go inside Mendas' house and he will automatically speak with you, revealing his true identity as &lt;a href=\"Selaad%20Gan\"&gt;Selaad Gan&lt;/a&gt;. He and Baresh will then both attack as &lt;a href=\"Loup%20Garou\"&gt;Loup Garou&lt;/a&gt; (Greater Werewolves).\nDefeating them will end this quest, along with &lt;a href=\"The%20Mysterious%20Island\"&gt;The Mysterious Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Reclusive%20Scholar\"&gt;The Reclusive Scholar&lt;/a&gt;."}

In the expansion of Baldur's Gate I, &lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Sword%20Coast\"&gt;Tales of the Sword Coast&lt;/a&gt;, taking place in 1368 DR, the player learns about &lt;a href=\"Balduran\"&gt;Balduran's final voyage&lt;/a&gt; in an isolated isle off the Sword Coast.\nAround 1492 DR, he is revealed to have survived the events on the Isle of Balduran. On his continuing quest for greatness, Balduran unwittingly stumbled across a mind flayer colony beneath the fabled towers of Moonrise, wherein he was infected with a mind flayer tadpole. He was rescued by his long-time compatriot, the bronze dragon Ansur, but they disagreed on the matter of his future; whilst Balduran viewed ceremorphosis as the next step in his journey to greatness, Ansur merely saw him as a threat. Balduran was forced to kill Ansur after he attempted to murder him in his sleep, and then creating a shrine to him beneath the Gate.\nDespite his eventual transformation, the illithid Balduran managed to gain independence from the elder brain and maintained free will. He once again returned to Baldur's Gate, finding an ally in Duke Belynne Stelmane and working to propel the Knights of the Shield to new heights of power.\nIn response to the Dead Three's plot to wield an Elder Brain against Faer\u00fbn in the late 15th century, Balduran stole the Astral Prism from the Githyanki - in truth, a prison for the heir to the Githyanki throne - and used its power to fight against the waves of psychic energy washing over the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast\"&gt;Sword Coast&lt;/a&gt;. He aided a group of tadpole-stricken heroes in their quest to dismantle the plot by delaying (and sometimes controlling) their ceremorphosis.\nInvolvement.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20III\"&gt;Baldur's Gate III&lt;/a&gt;\", Balduran is revealed to be the illithid \"The Emperor\"; he had somehow escaped or avoided his implied stranding and death on the Isle of Balduran, and eventually was infected by a mind flayer colony. Balduran/The Emperor interacts with the main character as a central plot device, and gives them a very important item: the Astral-Touched Tadpole, which lets them and their party become partial illithid if they wish to embrace their mind flayer infection."}

The Ballistic Attack effect applies 1d12 &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt; upon the target.\nThe attack will bypass &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be blocked by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;, or Spell protections that block spell &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; effects, as this one has 0 power level. Some examples would be &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis ability has a secondary type \"Magic attack\" designation.

The mod changes the &lt;a href=\"Opcode\"&gt;Opcode&lt;/a&gt; configuration of the spell, and changes the Secondary designation to &lt;a href=\"Offensive%20damage%20type\"&gt;Offensive damage type&lt;/a&gt;. The damage inflicted is also raised to 5d12 &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it is the same as the unmodified ability.\nBallistic Attack is widely available to &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; using creatures in SCS.

This ability is one of the best ways for a SCS Psionic user to deal direct damage to an opponent (the party) instead of with a melee attack, and of course, the ability automatically hits the target in almost all cases."}

They can only be harmed by weapons with &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20item\"&gt;enchantment level&lt;/a&gt; of +3 or greater.\nBalors receive a +4 bonus to hit and damage in melee combat against &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; creatures, their racial enemy.\nThroughout Shadows of Amn and , the party will encounter a number of balors. These fiends have varied statistics. Some can cast spells more often, some have lower magic resistance but higher elemental resistances, some can be harmed by +2 weapons, and some have resistance to physical damage.\nDue to their high magic resistance, most offensive spells are not very effective against them. One of the few exceptions is &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Bolt of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, which ignores magic resistance and deals considerable damage against all fiends.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best defensive spells against balors and demons in general. It offers immunity to most debilitating effects frequently used by demons, including Hold, Charm, Confusion, and Stun. \nA number of other items and spells also grant the effect Free Action along with immunity to Hold and Stun, such as the &lt;a href=\"Edventar%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Ring of Free Action&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Potion of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Free Action&lt;/a&gt; (Hold only).\nIt is notable that the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Fiend\"&gt;Pit Fiend&lt;/a&gt; one of the most powerful devils in AD&amp;D and the Balor, the cream of the crop for a Tanar'ri - both are quite underdeveloped in this game, missing several special powers and abilities. The characteristic balor's flame-wreathed body isn't implemented, its special sword and deadly flail-whip are not accounted for. Balor's also have an explosive death throe when killed, but that also isn't implemented in the game. \nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"Balor%20%28Underdark%29\"&gt;Balor (Underdark)&lt;/a&gt; for a unique version of this creature encountered as part of the &lt;a href=\"Svirfneblin%20village%20concerns\"&gt;Svirfneblin village concerns&lt;/a&gt; questline in the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;.\nBalor versions (Suldessellar/Watcher's Keep).\nOne Balor is used in the Moonblade fight cutscene and cannot be engaged as it dies during the fight with the elven warriors.\nAnother (displayed in the InfoBox) can be engaged and is spawned when one gets close to the castle to free the queen. It cannot cast any spells, but its skull weapon is capable of putting it's target in a &lt;a href=\"panic\"&gt;panic&lt;/a&gt; state. Its two rings grant a number of immunities on top of its natural 90% magic resistance and excellent AC.\nOne balor (TELBAL1) is present in the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Balor%20%28AR3008%29\"&gt;Teleport Maze&lt;/a&gt;- and is seen presumably fighting three &lt;a href=\"Cornugon\"&gt;Cornugon&lt;/a&gt; fiends, as part of the never ending Bloodwar between the &lt;a href=\"Baatezu\"&gt;Baatezu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanar%27ri\"&gt;Tanar'ri&lt;/a&gt;. This balor has a different attack weapon that can cause a &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Vorpal&lt;/a&gt; effect with no saving throw.\nThe balor also has a different repertoire of innate spell abilities that it is scripted to use. See the InfoBox for a preview.\nTwo more balors are summoned to support &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus%20%28Abyss%29\"&gt;Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; in the final battle in Hell. These creatures are only 10-HD versions and have no spells or special innate attacks.

It is part of a task you can accept stemming from &lt;a href=\"Goldander%20Blackenrock\"&gt;Goldander Blackenrock&lt;/a&gt;. \nThis encounter is part of the &lt;a href=\"Svirfneblin%20village%20concerns\"&gt;Svirfneblin village concerns&lt;/a&gt; quest. \nIf you agree to perform a task for the Svirfneblin leader, which involves destroying this creature and then sealing it with a magical scroll, he will give you a reward to help further your hunt for Irenicus, and the means to enter an extremely dark and currently impenetrable cave - see the &lt;a href=\"Light%20Gem\"&gt;Light Gem&lt;/a&gt; page.\nGameplay.\nOnce this Balor is enticed to manifest itself by interacting with a pit in the mine chamber, the demon will rise forth and soon go on the offensive, seeking to destroy anyone in sight. Expect the beast to self-protect and then attack with innate demonic abilities and his fearsome melee attack \u2014 both can be used in the same round.\nIt will likely implement a &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Symbol, Stun&lt;/a&gt; effect, then possibly a &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28innate%29\"&gt;Paralyze (innate)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Confusion\"&gt;Confusion&lt;/a&gt; spell effect as well.\nNote that the beast's &lt;a href=\"crushing%20damage\"&gt;crushing damage&lt;/a&gt; melee attack will apply a &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; effect on hit, with a saving throw to negate. \nA +3 or better enchantment level is needed to be able to strike the demon with a weapon.\nParty members in the same chamber as the demon should be prepared to resist against these detrimental effects, even if they are not in melee range.\nOnce destroyed, the special magical scroll to seal the pit can be used, and then return to Goldander to report your mission results.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod, and the \"Improved Fiends\" component will alter the Balor as follows:\nAn SCS Improved Fiend AI is provided, allowing better defensive and tactical behavior. The demon will adjust its attacks depending on party protective spells and certain items equipped. It will do a good job not squandering attacks on a party member protected against its attacks until that protection is removed, and or will select a more vulnerable target. The game difficulty selection will affect the challenge factor and what the creature is able to do offensively.\nThe demon has all of the immunities of the unmodified creature, plus some addition ones added; including &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Webbed\"&gt;Webbed&lt;/a&gt;, and specific immunity from most fire and electricity-based spells. \nThis Balor has more hit points and a 20 CON score. It is now a 24 HD creature. The beast uses a special \"flail-whip\" weapon in the off-hand that strikes as a +5 enchanted item that can hit for 1d4 &lt;a href=\"crushing%20damage\"&gt;crushing&lt;/a&gt; (+14 strength bonus) and 3d6 &lt;a href=\"fire%20damage\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt;. This flail-whip has a range of 3 and a speed factor of 4, as well as a +5 THAC0 bonus. \nIn the main hand, presumably the Balor's sword, is a +5 enchanted blade dealing 2d6 &lt;a href=\"slashing%20damage\"&gt;slashing damage&lt;/a&gt; (+14 strength bonus), with a 15% chance of inflicting a &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Kill target&lt;/a&gt; Vorpal Hit. A save vs. Death with a -4 penalty will negate. The Balor also gets to benefit from the 5-pip grand mastery weapon proficiency for the sword, 4 pips to the flail-whip and 3 pips in two-weapon fighting style.\nElemental Resistances are changed to 50% cold and 100% electricity and fire. Acid resistance is removed.\nThe Demon's racial enemy is Human and will gain a to-hit bonus against that race.\nA +2-movement modifier is provided, unaffected by free action.\nThe Balor has the following innate spell-like powers, cast at the 24th level: \nRemove Magic, Domination, Implosion, Stoneskin, Teleport without error.\nAnd the following Arcane and Priest spells memorized (and instantly cast):\nBreach , Symbol of Death , Symbol of Stun , and Firestorm \nThe Balor is wreathed in a protective fire shield similar to an &lt;a href=\"Aura%20of%20Flaming%20Death\"&gt;Aura of Flaming Death&lt;/a&gt;. It can be dispelled but returns again the next round.\nThe demon will deploy a protective stoneskin, and then other innate or spell casts will be instantly deployed in the same round as the melee attacks (&lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt; sword and flail-whip). A &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt; will be cast on top of the Balor, then any of the other available spells will be used depending on the AI script's analysis of opponent's strengths and weaknesses. Due to all the bonuses the creature receives in melee combat, it will most likely hit even a -24 Armor Class over 50% of the time, expect significant slashing and blunt damage delivered in a single round. The Balor will chase down and teleport without error to party members that try and flee away from his presence. You can run, but you cannot hide. This can be mitigated by always keeping its attention with at least one character party member in its detection range, thus allowing wounded companions to withdraw from danger."}

If you have chosen conversation option 1 in the talk with Gorpel Hind, then the Merry Fools will help you in the fight and leave after it. Choosing option 2 results in them leaving immediately.\nTactics.\nOne of the good tactics for this fight is having your fighter near the door and the other party members further away before starting conversation with Gorpel, as after the Maulers arrive, they will all be in one place. Give your fighter as much fire resistance buffs as you can through &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Batalista%27s%20Passport\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; and, after the Maulers come, cast &lt;a href=\"fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;s in the area. If you have a good-aligned party, watch for civilians, as killing them results in a large &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; loss. Killing the whole party results in total of 5250 XP, 214 &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Piece\"&gt;gold pieces&lt;/a&gt; and many items including the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe%20of%20Mauletar\"&gt;Battle Axe of Mauletar&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bracers%20of%20Defense%20AC%207\"&gt;Bracers of Defense AC 7&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Adventurer%27s%20Robe\"&gt;Adventurer's Robe&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Long Sword +1&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackstory.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Nivek\"&gt;Nivek&lt;/a&gt; will explain when he is encountered in one of the &lt;a href=\"Warehouses%20%28south%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%29%23AR1207\"&gt;warehouses&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;South Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, Gorpel Hind and his band of Merry Fools are responsible for capturing the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Basilisk\"&gt;Greater Basilisk&lt;/a&gt; that is currently on the loose inside the warehouse."}

It's the base of operations for the bandits who've been raiding caravans and plaguing travel all along the Coast Way. The existence of this area will not be revealed to the &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Three\"&gt;Chapter Three&lt;/a&gt; and it must be discovered and explored to advance the primary story-line.\nDiscovering the Camp's Location.\nThere are multiple ways to discover the camp's location after the player has cleared the &lt;a href=\"Nashkel%20Mines\"&gt;Nashkel Mines&lt;/a&gt;. The first can be easily discerned by reading through the scrolls one will find in &lt;a href=\"Mulahey\"&gt;Mulahey's&lt;/a&gt; chest that trigger the start of Chapter Three; they reference a mage by the name of &lt;a href=\"Tranzig\"&gt;Tranzig&lt;/a&gt;, who may be tracked down at &lt;a href=\"Feldepost%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Feldepost's Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beregost\"&gt;Beregost&lt;/a&gt;, and convinced by the player to give up the location of the camp.\nAlternatively, many sources reference the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20of%20Sharp%20Teeth\"&gt;Wood of Sharp Teeth&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast being overrun with &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s.

The camp is surrounded by forest and the remains of an ancient, unnamed structure lie to the south of the camp.\n\"Camp Grounds\".\nThe western side of the camp is occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Chill\"&gt;Chill&lt;/a&gt;, a demi-human group of bandits commanded by the hobgoblin &lt;a href=\"Ardenor%20Crush\"&gt;Ardenor Crush&lt;/a&gt;. The central and eastern side of the camp is occupied by the human &lt;a href=\"Blacktalons\"&gt;Blacktalons&lt;/a&gt; commanded by &lt;a href=\"Taurgosz%20Khosann\"&gt;Taurgosz Khosann&lt;/a&gt;. Both of these bandit groups are organized and led by the half-ogre known as &lt;a href=\"Tazok\"&gt;Tazok&lt;/a&gt;.\nLootable containers are found throughout the camp and all chests are locked.\n\"Cave\".\nThe large &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Camp%20Cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; adjacent to the camp is occupied by &lt;a href=\"Garclax\"&gt;Garclax&lt;/a&gt; and his clan of gnolls who've been sent there for causing a disturbance in the camp. The entrance to the cave is guarded by a hobgoblin who advises the party not to enter.\n\"Small Tents\".\nThere are six &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Camp%20Tents\"&gt;small tents&lt;/a&gt; that are spread around the camp in no particular order and it's possible to explore five of the six. Occupants include a band of gnolls in the northernmost tent located to the left of the cave, a hobgoblin stock boy named &lt;a href=\"Tersus\"&gt;Tersus&lt;/a&gt; in the westernmost tent, and a bandit named &lt;a href=\"Knott\"&gt;Knott&lt;/a&gt; in the tent below the entrance to the cave. The other two are unpopulated.\nAll five of the tents have lootable containers within them.\n\"Tazok's Tent\".\n&lt;a href=\"Tazok%27s%20Tent\"&gt;Tazok's Tent&lt;/a&gt; is the large tent located in the eastern side of the camp. Inside are four guardians - the fighter &lt;a href=\"Raemon\"&gt;Raemon&lt;/a&gt;, the mage &lt;a href=\"Venkt\"&gt;Venkt&lt;/a&gt;, the gnoll &lt;a href=\"Britik\"&gt;Britik&lt;/a&gt;, and the hobgoblin elite &lt;a href=\"Hakt\"&gt;Hakt&lt;/a&gt; - along with a prisoner, &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Sai\"&gt;Ender Sai&lt;/a&gt;. After dealing with the guards and looting the place, your next objective should be made clear.\nArea south of the Camp.\nEnemies are mostly found lurking around the old building ruins and consist mainly of hobgoblins, skeletons, or zombies.\nNotable Treasure.\nHakt carries the unique &lt;a href=\"Longbow%20of%20Marksmanship\"&gt;Longbow of Marksmanship&lt;/a&gt; and the trapped chest in Tazok's Tent contains the very rare &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20Weapon%20Expertise\"&gt;Gauntlets of Weapon Expertise&lt;/a&gt;. Also, in the \"\", one may find Venkt carrying a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt; - the only known copy in the original game. \nAnd even if one peacefully infiltrated the camp, it's advisable to clear it as there is no penalty or downside. The benefits include a total of 4775 additional &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;experience points&lt;/a&gt;, a extra net profit of , a &lt;a href=\"Short%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Short Sword +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Shield%20%2B1\"&gt;Medium Shield +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Wand of Fear&lt;/a&gt; , and a &lt;a href=\"War%20Hammer%20%2B1\"&gt;War Hammer +1&lt;/a&gt; along with the rare &lt;a href=\"Full%20Plate%20Armor\"&gt;Full Plate Armor&lt;/a&gt; which are carried by Taurgosz.\n&lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; spell scrolls are in a locked chest in the small tent directly south of Tazok's tent."}

If Vongoeth is able to dispel any buffs on your party, such as with a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, then you may be vulnerable to the Banshee's wail.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod gives this creature a new script, regulating it's targeting and AI, as well detection of some defensive magics."}

Through these varied experiences, they learn many different abilities. They are able to cast up to 6th level &lt;a href=\"wizard%20spells\"&gt;wizard spells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities%23Pick%20Pockets\"&gt;pick pockets&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, while enjoying a wider selection of usable armor and weapons than thieves, and are able to use most . Their broad range of skills comes at the price of not being specialized in any of them, as &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s are better at casting spells, thieves are able to use a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"thieving%20abilities\"&gt;thieving abilities&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s can achieve &lt;a href=\"Fighter%23Special_abilities_of_the_fighter\"&gt;grand mastery&lt;/a&gt; in weapons and have the widest selection of weapons and armor.\nBards are generally neutral characters, tending toward the chaotic -- they travel where they wish, and are usually not bound by obligations, countries or organisations. There aren't many bards who are either good- or evil-aligned.\nIn order for bards to cast a spell, first they need to successfully scribe an arcane spell scroll into their spellbook (scroll lost in process regardless of success or failure). A bard may have a number of spells scribed and available to memorize, limited by their &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; score. Their intelligence can be raised temporarily however, for example by drinking one or more &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Genius\"&gt;Potions of Genius&lt;/a&gt;, before scribing scrolls to their spellbook. They must choose which spells they will have available for immediate use by placing them into a limited number of spell slots. The bard must then &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; for eight hours to memorize the spells, which prepares them for casting. Since most armor prohibits arcane casting and bards can't wear most mage robes, &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20of%20Defense%20AC%207\"&gt;Bracers of Defense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Guard%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Rings of Protection&lt;/a&gt; or bard spells like &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Armor\"&gt;Ghost Armor&lt;/a&gt; are the best sources of &lt;a href=\"armor%20class\"&gt;armor class&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Chain%20Mail\"&gt;Elven Chain Mail&lt;/a&gt;s are obtained.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; can become bards.\nBards may not &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual class&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter abilities table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be rerolled until the minimum is met. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, other Races have modified ability scores.\nSpecial abilities of the bard.\nBard song.\nThe signature ability of the bard is their battle song. While active, the party (including the bard) will be fortified against fear, both natural and magical. Specifically, the party will be rendered immune to magical fear, will have any such existing effects removed from them and their &lt;a href=\"morale\"&gt;morale&lt;/a&gt; will be gradually restored to its baseline while they hear the song. Most Bard songs work within a limited range, roughly fireball-sized, and the singer\u2019s view must not be blocked by doors or corners; however, the unkitted Bard's song in the Enhanced Editions affects all of your party members (this doesn't include summoned or charmed creatures) wherever they may be, even if they're in a different area. The Blade's song, despite sharing an effect with the unkitted Bard's song (increasing luck) works like most bard songs, in that it has a limited range and will affect summoned and charmed creatures.\nIn \"EE version 2.0+\", Bard song of the same type no longer stacks (keep in mind that the unkitted Bard's and the Blade's songs are different and will stack to achieve upwards of +4 luck for party members), and all songs break &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, but the patch does give unkitted normal bard song a &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; bonus to all allies, including the Bard:\nGameplay\nPick pockets.\nA bard can attempt to steal items from other characters. The chance to steal an item depends on the percentage, which automatically increases with the Bard's level, up to a maximum score of 115 at level 16, plus &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; modifier.\nLore.\nBards have the highest &lt;a href=\"Lore\"&gt;Lore&lt;/a&gt; rating of any class, allowing them to identify many of the magical items they or their party discover.\nWizard spellbook.\nBards unlock their first &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;wizard spells&lt;/a&gt; at level 2, where they acquire a slot. They can reach up to once they reach level 16.\u202f\"&lt;a href=\"%23ii\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\" Bards can still cast level 7 to 9 spells from scrolls, even without acquiring &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; (but spells cast from scrolls use a fixed caster level of 10, so those spells that scale by caster level will be significantly weaker than if cast by a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, who have actual spellslots for those levels). like &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; are completely unavailable to Bards, as they don't exist as scrolls and can only be learned by Wizards.\nBards level up faster than mages. It means that, at equivalent &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;, spells cast by Bards will tend to do slightly more damage or last slightly longer than spells cast by &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. This gap is due to many spells scaling with level, and is bridged as soon as scaling reaches its cap \u2014 at level 10 for &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, level 15 for &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt;, level 20 for most spells. &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; are a unique case in that their growth is not capped, making the Bard better than a mage at dispelling throughout the game, as well as making their own spells harder to dispel for enemies. This fact is one of the main reasons why players who attempt Solo saga campaigns select a bard, and especially the &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; kit.\nA downside of the Bard is the late unlocking of new spell levels: Level 3 spells are unlocked at 40,000 XP for a Bard, but 20,000 XP for a mage. Level 4 spells at 160,000 XP for a Bard, but 60,000 XP for a mage. Etc.\nClass kits.\nBard.\nThe Bard is a rogue, but is very different from the Thief. The Bards' strength is their pleasant and charming personality. With it and their wits, they make their way through the world. Bards are talented musicians and walking storehouses of gossip, tall tales, and lore, they learn a little bit about everything that crosses their paths and are jack-of -all-trades but master of none. While many Bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.\nClass features:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Blades are the expert fighters and adventurers whose bardic acting abilities make them appear more intimidating and fearsome. This Bard's fighting style is flashy and entertaining, but is also lethally dangerous.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;.\nJesters are well versed in the arts of ridicule and hilarity, and use their abilities to distract and confuse their enemies, cavorting madly during combat. Do not mistake them for true fools, however, as they can also be quite deadly.\nAdvantages:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Skald\"&gt;Skald&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkalds are Nordic bards who are also warriors of great strength, skill, and virtue; their songs are inspiring sagas of battle and valor, and the Skalds devote their lives to those pursuits.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantage:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nBards have almost the same high-level class abilities as &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of &lt;a href=\"Assassination\"&gt;Assassination&lt;/a&gt;, they have enhanced bards song and magic flute, despite no skill points into Set Traps the traps HLAs available to the Bard will never fail or accidentally trigger on the Bard.\n1 Can be taken multiple times.\n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBards protagonists may &lt;a href=\"Running%20the%20Five%20Flagons%20Playhouse\"&gt;run the Five Flagons Inn stage&lt;/a&gt; after they &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Raelis%20and%20Haer%27Dalis%20from%20the%20Planar%20Prison\"&gt;rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the planar prison&lt;/a&gt;\nClass exclusive items.\nSome instruments, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Captive%20Audience\"&gt;The Captive Audience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Methild%27s%20Harp\"&gt;Methild's Harp&lt;/a&gt;, and some other items are only usable by bards. Among them the &lt;a href=\"Bard%27s%20Gloves\"&gt;Bard's Gloves&lt;/a&gt;, that have no ability by themselves but can be upgraded to the &lt;a href=\"Wondrous%20Gloves\"&gt;Wondrous Gloves&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that the &lt;a href=\"Peacock%20Cap\"&gt;Peacock Cap&lt;/a&gt; is better for Bards.\nGameplay (community).\n~Write your insights below, different from the Gameplay section above, you may use your signatures here, &lt;a href=\"Monk%23Gameplay%20.28community.29\"&gt;example page&lt;/a&gt;~\nBards are really fun to play, but a little difficult to handle.\nSkalds are very helpful with a group. Usually cast \"Mislead\" to keep singing while they do other things like casting \"Remove magic\" versus Mages (It works slower but better than with an Inquisitor like Keldorn). Skalds are a little too passive and sometimes may be a little boring. However, skalds make excellent player controlled/generated NPCs. That way you can enjoy the bonuses (amazing buff song throughout the whole saga, free no hassle item identification, auxiliary spell support, etc), while still having a different, exciting main character to act as your avatar.\nDon\u2019t underestimate the immunity from stun and confusion on the Lvl 20 skald song. I just got it on my skald right before entering the mind flayer tunnel in the Underdark and it made dealing with them surprisingly easy. Intelligence drain is a lot less lethal, when you are able to run away after taking a hit or two.\nBlades aren\u00b4t very good at the front line at beginning of the game, but with some items they can become amazing. With Tenser Transformation, dual wielding (Kundane or Belm in the offhand), Improved Haste, they can be very effective.\nOnce you get Enhanced Bard Song, I think Blades are more versatile. They stop using Tenser and use Mislead (like a Skald), they can be in the front line or they can cast Remove Magic versus Mages.They can become invulnerable versus Liches. In addition,\u00a0they can set traps in the way they need. If you want to start melee then cast Improved haste, set a Time Trap and bring a group to start the battle. On the other hand if you want a fast kill versus Mages, just set a Spike Trap and that\u00b4s all.\nThere are many tricks to use them appropriately.\nBard Songs overview.\nAs the bard song has been changed somewhat between different editions of the games, here is an overview of the most current effect of the different songs:\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a number of gameplay revisions and changes to all Rogues, including their kits. It is a comprehensive modification to nearly all aspects of the Rogues (Bards and Thieves) abilities and strives to bring them closer to their Pen and Paper AD&amp;D counterparts. New and revised abilities are included, as well as new equipment and rogue specific items. Separate user installed components are available to customize selection of content and changes. Go to the link for further information. Other changes applicable to most Bards:\nTrue Bard\nThe Bard's song has been altered as it was almost completely non-functional in the original game. The revised Bard song is based on the Pen and Paper version of this ability. The updated kit description reads as follows:\nBARD: The bard is also a rogue, but he is very different from the thief. His strength is his pleasant and charming personality. With it and his wits he makes his way through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore. He learns a little bit about everything that crosses his path; he is a jack-of-all- trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere and are often inspirational to the listeners. A bard can rally his allies by singing heroic songs or weaving inspiring tales about how his companions will overcome their foes and win the day. The effect of the bard's song varies according to his level:\n1st: +1 to hit and all saving throws, song raises morale\n9th: +2 to hit and all saving throws, song removes fear\n18th: +3 to hit and all saving throws, song protects from fear\nBard High Level Ability revisions\nThis component will remove all Traps and other Thief-specific HLAs from the Bard High Level Ability table and replace them with new abilities which are more fitting for the Bard class. These new HLAs are: Mass Charm, Sound Burst, Enthralling Melody, Lingering Song, Resonating Weapon and Sound Barrier. Furthermore, the Magic Flute and Alchemy HLAs will be revised and each Bard kit will get a unique version of the Enhanced Battlesong HLA.

They are able to cast wizard spells, are able to pick pockets and have a decent selection of armor and weapons, but their broad range of skills comes at the price of not being specialised in most of them, except\u00a0for interaction with people. Bards are neutral characters, they come and go when they want, and are usually not bound by obligations, countries and organisations. There aren't many bards who are either good or evil aligned.\nAbility Scores.\nNote: For the information of this table the human race was used, because they have no character bonunes/penalties related to race and therefore act like a 'neutral'.

Bard song by itself will not break invisibility so a bard can repeat the fear dispelling routine once the last song's effects have ended, undetected by those without magical means to bypass the concealment effects. There are an unlimited number of bard song activations available to the vanilla Baldur's Gate bard class regardless of class level (compare to standard D&amp;D rules where the number of songs per day is limited to once per class level per day).\nLuck\nWhile active, will reduce the THAC0 and damage of enemy physical attacks. \"Note: This claim has not yet been confirmed or documented by the community through a statistical analysis of combat sessions.\"\nPick pockets.\nA bard can steal items from characters. The chance to steal an item depends on the percentage. Bards start with 25 ability points in Pick Pockets, along with any bonus from race and dexterity. They gain 5 points per level.\nWizard spellbook.\nBards are able to cast wizard spells when they reach class level 2. In Baldur's Gate, this is limited up to level 3 and lvl 4 with .

The encounter occurs during &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%204\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe scenario is part of the &lt;a href=\"Escaping%20the%20asylum\"&gt;Escaping the asylum&lt;/a&gt; questline. It isn't optional and is necessary to advance the plot of the bhaalspawn saga.\nSituation recap.\nThe party arrives in the basement area from the &lt;a href=\"Final%20Judgement%20Spellhold%20Test\"&gt;Final Judgement Spellhold Test&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; appears and gives advice/suggests that the only way to defeat Irenicus is to enlist the help of the inmates on the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Main%20Floor\"&gt;Spellhold Main Floor&lt;/a&gt;. \nSome core party companions agree with this via dialogue interjections. Some others say it isn't necessary and the time to strike is now, and no help is needed. Afterwards, the party either allowed Saemon to leave or they killed him. This choice won't affect the battle with Irenicus, but will come into play afterwards.\nThe party may have already found out the hard way that tackling Irenicus in his laboratory before transitioning upstairs to the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Main%20Floor\"&gt;Spellhold Main Floor&lt;/a&gt; proves fatal. Saemon's suggestion was correct about having to get the inmates on the main floor to help.\nThis reality means the party must transition to main floor above.\nWalkthrough.\nFace Lonk and address the inmates.\nAscend the staircase to the main floor. Shortly afterwards &lt;a href=\"Lonk%20the%20Sane\"&gt;Lonk the Sane&lt;/a&gt; will challenge the party. \nThe dialogue will occur even if the party members are invisible or hidden. See his page for details. \nIn short, Lonk either agrees to help the party by releasing the inmates, or the party bribes him to do the same, or he turns hostile and fights back.\nRegardless of which choice is made, the party is then transitioned in front of the inmates who are gathered together in the \"Inmate Commons\" area as marked on the map. \nThe party must make some dialogue choices as they address the inmates. Each inmate has their own interjections during this interlude. These inmates are pretty fearful of facing Irenicus, but still agree in the end to take on their hated oppressor. They may be nuts, but they also go along with joining the party to face him below.\nNo time is allowed the party to prepare, and the game transitions the party and inmates to the basement again - this time inside the laboratory.\nFace Irenicus in his laboratory.\nThe party arrives along with the inmates in the basement laboratory. No action is possible at first due to the dialogue exchange scripted by the plot.\nIrenicus opens the encounter with a surprised statement:\nAfter that &lt;a href=\"Wanev\"&gt;Wanev&lt;/a&gt; will interject - \"\"I'll take back what is mine now! I'll take it back! You perverted this place, and I'll take it back!\" - followed by Irenicus retorting:\nAt this junction, &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt; and finally &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; will each have their shouted interjection aimed at Irenicus. The mage then shouts back:\nThe first phase of the battle.\nIrenicus is now hostile. The player can take control of the party and issue commands. The inmates &lt;a href=\"Aphril\"&gt;Aphril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dradeel\"&gt;Dradeel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naljier%20Skal\"&gt;Naljier Skal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wanev\"&gt;Wanev&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiax\"&gt;Tiax&lt;/a&gt; will initiate their scripted spell casting - buffs to begin with.\nIrenicus instantly deploys an uninterruptable protective spell chain, to include &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Electricity%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Protection From Electricity (spell)&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext will probably be a situational evaluation by the script. If certain conditions are met, then a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; will be attempted. \nThe next move will be to \"forcecast\" SPIN905 which displays a message reading \"Spawn Clones\". Two seconds later the clone of each party member form adjacent to the original character. \nThese appear as the party member in an unarmed and natural state (with no armor or robes etc.). They are hostile and attack the nearest green circled enemy they can detect. See the &lt;a href=\"Clone%20%28Irenicus%20Spellhold%29\"&gt;Clone (Irenicus Spellhold)&lt;/a&gt; for details of their stats and abilities. Note that just because they hold no weapons does not mean they can't strike for real damage. The clones are also under a &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom this point on, Irenicus will cast mostly single target spells at the nearest enemy detected. Area of effect spells include &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;, will be attempted as well and this won't harm the clones.\nIrenicus has several scripted sequencers and triggers that will initiate based on combat conditions, such as being hit. These prepared instantly cast spells will further protect Irenicus and increase staying power.\nDuring this time the inmates will be casting their own spells - none of them are armed with any weaponry or equipment, so they do not engage in melee combat with Irenicus or any of the clones.\n&lt;a href=\"Wanev\"&gt;Wanev&lt;/a&gt; is the most active of the group, and he casts offensive spells at Irenicus or the closest enemy to himsel from time to time. He is scripted to use some potentially dangerous AoE spells which might affect party members, such as &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, a conjured &lt;a href=\"Efreeti\"&gt;Efreeti&lt;/a&gt; is scripted, and that creature will also release Area of Effect spells that can target all creatures - friend or foe, in the battle area. He may even cast a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; during the first phase of the battle.\nIf any party generated hostile spells (accidentally or on purpose} affect an inmate, that particular creature will become a red circled hostile. So be careful.\nWhen Irenicus's original HP value is reduced to 20%, this will trigger the next phase of the battle.\nThe second phase of the battle.\nNow heavily wounded, Irenicus transitions into dialogue, cursing:\nThis initiates several actions on the battleground. A teleport animation plays over Irenicus, as well as another just north of the SW door to the laboratory. The door opens.\nIrenicus has now escaped to points unknown. Each party member is awarded for forcing him to flee.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; was a party member in the earlier part of the Spellhold quest - then he is teleported into the laboratory. If this isn't the case, then that teleport animation plays but nothing appears (perhaps a coding oversight). &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; initiates dialogue at this point, beginning with:\nThe PC has several reply choices. If you delve deeper into why Yoshimo betrayed you to Irenicus, then more information can be gleaned. It is up to the player if he will exact quick revenge or ask questions and inquire.\nIn the end, Yoshimo has no choice but to attack, and he does so. The script that controls this creature will fully utilize the stealth abilities possessed by the rogue, and he still has all the equipment when he was last a party member. Expect &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; attack attempts.\nWhether or not the Yoshimo encounter takes place, in a few rounds after Irenicus teleports away, eventually a group of &lt;a href=\"Murderer\"&gt;Murderer&lt;/a&gt; thieves will try and make their way into the lab through the door, and they'll be under invisibility. These creatures will attack from invisibility unless it is removed. \nAlso at this time, all the inmates were slain (somehow) by Irenicus teleporting away from the battle.\nWith the defeat of all the opponents, so concludes the Battle with Irenicus in Spellhold. It is up to the player to decide what to do next. The party still hasn't escaped the asylum.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes revisions to the inmate's scripts allowing them to perform in a smarter manner and participate in the battle more effectively.\nThe mod also makes changes to the Irenicus AI scripting, and he'll utilize a full spell book as a level 30 mage. Mage HLA's will be used depending on game difficulty settings. This will translate to greater staying power and increased danger to the party.\nThe clones of the party members dynamic is reworked by the mod. They are now copies of the party members including all stats, attributes, equipment and memorized spells. They will use potions and wands in the quick item slots. The same spells available to the original party member will potentially be cast by the clone. Cloned rogues will pickpocket the player characters."}

This ranger is a wanderer who is not comfortable in civilized lands. He maintains a natural affinity for animals; they are his friends and comrades-in-arms, and the Beast Master has a limited form of telepathic communication with them.\nDue to being not comfortable in civilized lands, the equipment is limited to what can be made in the wilderness, so they can't use chain mail or plate mail, and no weapons made from steel. The weapons they can wield are , , , , , and .\nIf a Beast Master - Cleric dual class is made, they can only wield clubs, quarterstaves and slings but this will allow for level 4,5,6 summoning spells to be used as level 1,2,3 cleric spells.\nThe advantages of this class kit are that they have +15% bonus to Move Silently and Hide In Shadows. They also have the ability to use the spells find familiar and all summon animal spells.\nCharacter abilities table.\nNote: The primary abilities table is based on the human class, because humans don't have any bonuses to primary abilities compared to the other races and acts as a 'neutral'. The half elves have a slightly different one and elves have the minimal intellence and charisma raised to 8 and the constitution and dexterity is different.\nAbilities of the ranger.\nCharm animal/person.\nRangers can charm animals and persons to prevent fights or to gain advantages. This ability becomes available at lvl 3.\nHide In Shadow.\nRangers can hide in shadows if they wear leather armor, studded leather armor or no armor. Every ranger starts with 25% (not confirmed) modified by racial and dexterity bonuses at level 1 to successfully hides in shadows. Attempting to hide in shadows during the day or while not in shadows incurs a penalty to the hide check. Melee attacks receive a +4 to-hit bonus if performed while hidden. Beast Master have a bonus to Hide In Shadow and Move Silently of 15%.\nRacial enemy.\nRangers tend to focus their wrath on a particular creature, having a +4 attack and damage roll versus the racial enemy. It can be applied to one of the creatures listed below:\nAnimal Summoning.\nBeast Master can use the spells below as a special ability:\nDruid spellbook.\nAt lvl 8, the priest spellbook unlocks for rangers. They can use the following spells from that moment. The spells the rangers are able to use are the same as &lt;a href=\"Druid%23Druid%20spells\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt;. They can learn up to level 3 spells. Their number of spells is determined by their level and is not affected by Wisdom.\nHigh-level class abilities.\nHigh level class abilities are added the expansion . For all warrior classes and &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s, the pool of abilities consist of abilities which can be accesses from the special abilities menu which can be used during battle. These abilities are available to fighters when they nearing 3,000,000 xp. (exact lvl is not known).\nExperience table.\n^Rangers in classic BG2 and the Enhanced Editions start with two free points in Two Weapon Fighting.\n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nRangers receive the ranger cabin stronghold in the Umar Hills."}

That also means the player's Journal has registered the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Hendak%20and%20the%20slaves\"&gt;Free Hendak and the slaves&lt;/a&gt; quest, which clarifies the goal of what to do.\nWhen the party visits the animal and beast cage area, they may open any cell doors as they see fit (and thus releasing anything within). At some point is likely they'll spot the Beastmaster and his companion pet &lt;a href=\"Tabitha\"&gt;Tabitha&lt;/a&gt;. If the Beastmaster detects a party member he'll initiate a verbal challenge.\nUnless the party agrees to leave, hostilities will ensue. He also opens all the beast cells automatically when that happens.\nDepending on the party's composition, the Beastmaster may prove to be a dangerous opponent and can unleash accurate and rapid bow fire. He's less of a threat when forced to fight with his spear in close quarters.\nIf his pet is slain, he'll shout an outraged remark about this and seek vengeance for harming the animal.\nThe opening of the cells is unlikely to help the Beastmaster as much as he hopes. \nYou'll be able to open the first two cells with two &lt;a href=\"Mutated%20Gibberling\"&gt;Mutated Gibberling&lt;/a&gt; creatures and one &lt;a href=\"Jaguar\"&gt;Jaguar&lt;/a&gt; before he notices you. The rear two cells hold a &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Leopard\"&gt;Leopard&lt;/a&gt; which have the issue of being unable to see you, therefore it is likely only creatures from the middle two cells, a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bear\"&gt;Black Bear&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Bear\"&gt;Grizzly Bear&lt;/a&gt;, will come to his aid.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises the Beastmaster slightly, giving him an SCS \"Fighter\" AI script for smarter tactical behavior. \nAdditionally, the bear and animals move faster with SCS (it is a component that you install called \"Faster Bears\"), and the other creatures don't just sit in their cells when hostilities break out but respond by moving out to seek intruders.\nWeapon proficiencies are revised, and a few potions are provided to boost the half-elf's abilities and to heal wounds during battle."}

{"id": "5893", "revid": "282486", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5893", "title": "Beholder", "text": "Beholders are extra-planar creatures which can fire Beholder Blast projectile rays from their central eye and eye stalks. They move about via levitation. Beholders are protected against backstabbing surprise attacks. Due to their levitation locomotion, beholders are also immune to spells like web, entangle and grease. They cannot be slowed or held/paralyzed by some other sources either.\nBeholders have smaller, weaker siblings, the &lt;a href=\"Gauth\"&gt;Gauth&lt;/a&gt;, who often appear alongside them in greater number.\nPhysical description.\nBeholders are floating heads with one big single cyclops-like eye and a large gaping maw directly beneath the eye that tends to drool. The upper half of the head is surrounded by several smaller eye stalks (ranging between 8 to 12). Each eyestalk is capable of firing a beholder blast projectile and each stalk has a different spell-like function. The central eye also has an anti-magic eye beam that bathes the target. \nAlthough their hideous maw can bite, their preferred method of combat is by firing multiple eye blasts at their enemy, causing status effects, dealing magic energy, fire, lightning, petrification, disintegration or instant death effects. Beholders in the EE game have a permanent alacrity power, that allows them to have no \"weave cool down\" period after firing a beholder blast, which is implemented as a spell effect. This allows them multiple blasts or rays per round. These are scripted attacks by the game engine.\nAbilities.\nA Beholder has several eye stalks, each which can fire a different \"Beholder Blast\" projectile. If the projectile strikes the target, it will cause a spell effect. Most beholder blast spell effects can be blocked by &lt;a href=\"magic%20resistance\"&gt;magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; and have saving throws to negate or reduce their potency. Also, as the blasts are spell effects, protective magics such as Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection and similar can protect the target, but this is dependent on the specific beholder blast type and their assigned spell &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt;. A Beholder typically has ten to twelve eye stalks and a Central Eye which can fire the following beholder blasts:\nMost ordinary beholders are able to cast a single, uninterruptible &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; upon seeing a summoned creature in range. As such, summoned creatures will most likely be banished. Using summoned creatures against a beholder isn't infeasible, but may not be enough to win an encounter on its own. Multiple beholders in the same area will quickly destroy a group of summoned assailants. On the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Gauth\"&gt;gauths&lt;/a&gt; on their own don't have any way to banish summoned creatures, and some summoned beings will be able to shrug off the gauth's attacks very effectively.\nBeholders have a number of immunities, including being protected from &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstabs&lt;/a&gt; and movement modifying effects like &lt;a href=\"Slow%20effect\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;. As they levitate, webs, entangling and grease don't work on these creatures either.\nLocations.\nMany Beholders can be found during the &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20and%20Destroy%20the%20Cult%20of%20the%20Eyeless\"&gt;Investigate and Destroy the Cult of the Eyeless&lt;/a&gt; questline, especially in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Reaches\"&gt;Lower Reaches&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lair%20of%20the%20Unseeing%20Eye\"&gt;Lair of the Unseeing Eye&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother large grouping is awaiting the player in the &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Cave%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Beholder Cave in Underdark&lt;/a&gt;. There are more in &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Enclave\"&gt;Sendai's Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Death%20Tyrant\"&gt;Death Tyrant&lt;/a&gt; will be summoned in the final battle with &lt;a href=\"Amelyssan\"&gt;Amelyssan&lt;/a&gt; in Chapter 10.\nIf you accept the &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20and%20Destroy%20the%20Cult%20of%20the%20Eyeless\"&gt;Investigate and Destroy the Cult of the Eyeless&lt;/a&gt; questline from a Temple, you may stumble across an ambush by a Beholder and two Gauths in the Temple District Sewers who teleport in to confront you (seems to be based on party XP level).\nGameplay.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Shield of Balduran&lt;/a&gt; reflects or bounces some beholder blast projectile rays. Mostly, the shield saves the wielder from getting \"machine-gunned\" by multiple rapid-fire Cause Serious Wound beholder blast projectiles (projectile 208). This is the most frequent attack by any beholder with eye stalks. Thus, most fights against beholders can be managed without death, by sending in a fighter equipped with this shield. Without that shield, those fights are much harder. Note that &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; provides Beholders with a \"Telekinesis\" Ray to counter this shield (see Mod Content below).\nMod content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod and the \"Smarter Beholders\" component will change beholder intelligence and some other abilities in your game. Note that Gauths are less likely to have some of the more deadly eye stalk beholder blast rays. From the Mod Author:\nThis component upgrades the AI\u00a0of the beholders, gauths, elder orbs and hive mothers in SoA\u00a0and ToB. It basically tries to do it non-cheesily, but it's hard to define this exactly since beholder powers are almost all scripted. Beholders get to use their eyestalks about once per ten seconds each, but they will tend to manage to get through more of them in a round; their targeting has also been drastically improved (the new scripts are about 150 times the length of the old ones!)\nIn accordance with the\u00a02nd edition rules, beholders are now immune to most (not all) of their own eyestalks, which makes them more willing to bombard their way through Spell Deflection. I have added a Telekinesis eyestalk (more for fun than for increased challenge). And I have borrowed, with thanks, the Quest Pack component which allows beholders to lose their eyestalks when damaged. Beholders are also unable to use eyestalk powers when blinded (although their allies may use anti-magic rays to remove the blindness).\nThis component is sensitive to the difficulty setting:\nWith this mod, beholders are given different colored animations to distinguish between normal beholders, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Tyrant\"&gt;Death Tyrant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hive%20Mother\"&gt;Hive Mother&lt;/a&gt; varieties.\nMost SCS beholders have a special Death Ray that is scripted for use when they detect hostile \"Summoned\" creatures, such as &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; or similar. The ray acts as a single target &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;, which will destroy/banish a struck summoned creature brought forth by the party (no saving throw). This Death Ray is different than the ordinary one fired at non summoned creatures. It can only affect one creature at a time. This ray is however blocked by &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; - which means that summoned creatures with a high MR are still quite effective against a beholder. (Reference dw#besud.spl) \nSpeaking of the Death Ray, SCS will use another version of the ray than the unmodified game. It still is a level 7 &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; attack, but even if the target has a spell protection, the ray will always inflict 2d8 &lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;Magical damage&lt;/a&gt;, because it has a component that is a level 0 effect. &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; can still block it. This will even go through a character with a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection From Magic&lt;/a&gt; scroll. (Reference dw#befod.spl) \nSCS Hive Mother Beholders have been provided with a more potent Anti-Magic Ray (SPIN550.SPL), that drains spells from memory and charges from items and wands in quick slots or if equipped. The Hive Mother's rapid firing Cause Serious Wounds ray (SPIN551.SPL) now bypasses magic resistance and deals 5d8 Magic energy damage and has &lt;a href=\"power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt; 0 so it will ignore spell level protections such as Spell Trap and Spell Deflection. And finally, the Hive Mother has a super potent Disintegration eyestalk (SPIN552.SPL), that has a -4 penalty to saving throws. If you are playing SCS with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt;, the disintegrate beam also deals massive magic energy damage (35d6), even if you make your saving throw, you'll take at least 5d6. The Hive Mother's telekinesis eyestalk will steal the Shield of Balduran and or the Cloak of Mirroring from an opponent in range, after a few rounds.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; will be destroyed by an Anti-magic Ray."}

{"id": "23419", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23419", "title": "Beholder Cave in Underdark", "text": "The Underdark area auto map notes marks the location of the \"Southern Tunnels\". These tunnels connect to the Beholder Cave in Underdark. Note that the \"Beholder Cave\" is not actually referred to in any text or dialogue in the game explicitly. As far as the player would know, the Southern Tunnels is the only name provided, although &lt;a href=\"Phaere\"&gt;Phaere&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt; will tell the party about the existence of these tunnels.\nDescription.\nGather the party and transition into the Southern Tunnels when ready to enter. The party appears in a system of interconnected chambers and tunnels. The tunnels are not uniform in shape, but generally roundish in form. Lumps, bumps, cracks, crevices and protuberances of stone are evident on all surfaces. Phosphorescent fungi glows and reflects soft light amongst the shadows. The tunnels smell of damp decay and mineral waters. Faint hissing of steam and sucking mud sounds can be discerned.\nOn the map.\nThis area has no Automap Markers.\nGameplay.\nUpon entry into the Beholder Cave, is a roundish room with a pulsating mud orifice in the center. Also, immediately visible and in detection range is an ordinary &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholder&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb%20%28Underdark%29\"&gt;Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt;. They are hostile and will initiate attacks on any visible party members - the closest to either of them will likely get their targeting attention. \nExpect immediate beholder blast rays from the beholder. The Elder Orb will probably self-buff with a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt; to begin, and then either another spell cast, or a beholder eye ray such as the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt;. If any party members are invisible - expect a &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf they are defeated, the party will discover that the Orb has three items of loot, and one of them is the &lt;a href=\"Eyestalk%20of%20an%20Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Eyestalk of an Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt;. This is a quest item asked for by &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt; for her planned summoning ritual. It is also necessary in order to progress in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Drow%20Summoning%20Ritual\"&gt;The Drow Summoning Ritual&lt;/a&gt; quest. If desired, the party could just depart the entire tunnel complex now - and bypass this dungeon exploration. Further delving will of course lead to more adventuring, battles, as well as loot and experience - but it isn't necessary from a quest completion standpoint. \nIf progressing further into the tunnels the next encounter will be a group of five &lt;a href=\"Drow%20Warrior%20%28Underdark%29\"&gt;Drow Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, fully armed and armored - confronting a standard &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholder&lt;/a&gt;. If observed, the creatures may pause their battle and turn on the party. If the player desires the maximum potential XP gain, then attack all the opponents, lest they potentially kill each other and 'rob' the party of that experience. Play this as desired. \nNote that the drow are skilled in combat and can engage in competent melee attacks. Their Armor Class is quite good. The drow carry loot and equipment items if defeated.\nSeveral forked tunnels lie ahead, and the party can move through the passages in more than one direction. In one location will eventually be observed another battle going on with three &lt;a href=\"Gauth\"&gt;Gauth&lt;/a&gt; creatures in a tussle with three &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt; opponents. As was the case with the previous drow and beholder situation - if the gauths and illithids observe the party they could (and will eventually) turn their hostilities upon the party. \nAgain - if the party desires the maximum experience, then intervene and slay the creatures yourself to ensure they don't kill each other first.\nIn another tunnel will be encountered two gauths (near the T4 treasure niche). \nThey will immediately fire off various eye beams at any detected party members in range.\nCarry on further past these two monsters, and meander in a general northern direction.\nA tunnel snakes around leading to a circular chamber with a pulsating mud orifice (near the T3 treasure location). There is a proximity spawn point (spawn point no. 3) in the chamber that will introduce a variable number of gauth and Beholder creatures based on the PC's experience level. There will be at least one gauth in here.\nAlso within this area is a map feature that displays the following text: \"This stair is incomplete and leads nowhere.\"\nIn one seemingly empty area is another hidden proximity sensing spawn point - which will introduce more gauth and beholder creatures depending on the PC's experience level (ref: spwnbeh.bcs).\nAt the furthest point from the Dungeon tunnel entrance in a dead-end round chamber with a central pulsating mud orifice - here are located two beholders and the second Elder Orb.\nIf a party member is hidden or invisible the Elder Orb will cast a &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt;, as pictured in the screenshot to the left.\nTreasure.\nSee the \"Notes\" map on the InfoBox for the T1-T5 treasure locations.\nMod content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod and the \"Smarter Beholders\" component will change beholder intelligence and some other abilities in your game. From the Mod Author:\nThis component upgrades the AI\u00a0of the beholders, gauths, elder orbs and hive mothers in SoA\u00a0and ToB. It basically tries to do it non-cheesily, but it's hard to define this exactly since beholder powers are almost all scripted. Beholders get to use their eyestalks about once per ten seconds each, but they will tend to manage to get through more of them in a round; their targeting has also been drastically improved (the new scripts are about 150 times the length of the old ones!)\nIn accordance with the\u00a02nd edition rules, beholders are now immune to most (not all) of their own eyestalks, which makes them more willing to bombard their way through Spell Deflection. I have added a Telekinesis eyestalk (more for fun than for increased challenge). And I have borrowed, with thanks, the Quest Pack component which allows beholders to lose their eyestalks when damaged. Beholders are also unable to use eyestalk powers when blinded (although their allies may use anti-magic rays to remove the blindness).\nHive mothers use the same range of powers as in the original game, but use them more efficiently, and use their eyestalks in the gap while they're waiting to cast spells again. Elder orbs were tricky because of the rather inconsistent range of powers they show in the unmodded game, but I have interpreted them as casting spells just as standard mages do, and as knowing 2 spells of each level. Their choice of spell, and of Contingency, Spell Trigger et al, has been optimized more, and they too use eyestalk powers while waiting to cast again (and show a preference for short-casting-time spells, so as to allow more eyestalk use.)\nIt might be worth noting that, even in the unmodded game, hive mothers can see through invisibility (though elder orbs cannot. except for the Unseeing Eye).\nIn addition, SCS beholders use an alternative form of their antimagic ray. In pen-and-paper D&amp;D, a beholder's eyestalk blocks all magical effects, beneficial or otherwise, on the target for as long as it's targeted. In BG2, the eye is more powerful: it removes all magical effects, blocks spellcasting for several rounds, but doesn't block enemy magic attacks (including the beholder's other eyestalks). If this component is installed, the beholder antimagic ray blocks all magical effects, including harmful ones, for one round, and also disables magical activity (spellcasting etc) by the target for one round; this is supposed to simulate the beholder bathing the target with its antimagic ray for one round.\nThis component is sensitive to the difficulty setting:\nInstallation of the \"Tactical Challengers for BG2\" Component will add an Improved Beholder Hive. From the Mod author:\nThis component (adapted from Quest Pack) adds a few extra beholders to the hive in the Underdark, notably including a &lt;a href=\"Hive%20Mother\"&gt;Hive Mother&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis component is sensitive to the difficulty setting:"}

Across the small circular room, opposite the entrance is a silent trigger that spawns one or more &lt;a href=\"Gauth\"&gt;Gauths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholders&lt;/a&gt; depending upon the current experience points accrued by &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;. They spawn at a point further inside the lair.\nBlind Priests.\nIn the center of the map you will find a cluster of six &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Priest\"&gt;Blind Priests&lt;/a&gt;; two worth and four worth 4,000 XP.\nExit.\nIn the southern part of the map is an exit labeled \"To the Upper Reaches\" on the player's map. It leads to the secret door in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Tunnels%23Lair%20of%20the%20Cult%20Outcasts%20and%20The%20Lower%20Reaches\"&gt;Inner Chambers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Tunnels\"&gt;The Old Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;. This door was previously sealed with an unconventional lock warded against simple spells, so that you could not enter it from the other side. Now it can be opened from this side, and will remain open, allowing the player to go back to the City of &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; if rest, healing, or additional gear is needed to clear the rest of the Beholder Hideout.\nTreasure Caches.\nAltogether there are eight caches of treasure stashed away throughout the dungeon. Each of the four small circular chambers that radiate out from the center of the map have caches in their centers, with the northern chamber having two more caches near the walls. The remaining two caches are in the tunnels that connect the chambers.\nThe Unseeing Eye.\nAs soon as the second &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Device%20Part%20%28second%20part%29\"&gt;Rift Device Part&lt;/a&gt; is taken into the party's inventory from where it is stashed, the two halves combine to form the completed rod, simply called the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Device\"&gt;Rift Device&lt;/a&gt;, granting the party 26,250 XP. This will occur even if the first half is inside a &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Holding\"&gt;Bag of Holding&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs soon as the rod has been completed, it draws the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Unseeing%20Eye\"&gt;Unseeing Eye&lt;/a&gt; which attacks the party immediately upon arrival (assuming that the Eye has not already been killed at the top of the Pit of the Faithless; see &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20and%20Destroy%20the%20Cult%20of%20the%20Eyeless%23Destroying%20the%20Cult\"&gt;Destroying the Cult&lt;/a&gt; for more details). Equip the completed Device Rift to a quickslot, and use it on the Unseeing Eye the moment you see it, and then deal some extra damage in order to kill it.\nGameplay.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Sewers\"&gt;Cloak of the Sewers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Shield of Balduran&lt;/a&gt; can be of great use here. \nAnother tactic is to have a melee character with hide abilities like &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Valygar%20Corthala\"&gt;Valygar Corthala&lt;/a&gt; walk up to a beholder, preferably hasted. While beholders are immune to backstab, it is still very useful to initiate a fight without having to walk up to them. Make a ranged attack with a character that can take a few rays, and right after start the melee. The creature will focus its rays on the ranged attacker, and before it realizes it should switch targets it is dead. This tactic is less effective when multiple beholders have to be faced. \nA similar tactic combines stealth, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Paws%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Boots of Speed&lt;/a&gt;, and ranged attacks. Against a single Beholder or Gauth (preferably), you can have someone (like Minsc for example) with the Boots of Speed move stealthed (hidden in shadows) as close to the creature as needed for a ranged attack, unleash an arrow, and then run away and hide again when out of the creature's sight. Repeat until the creaure is dead - it's possible to kill it without suffering any backlash. If you have poisoned arrows, all the better.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod and the \"Smarter Beholders\" component will change beholder intelligence and some other abilities in your game.

Player characters start to get -1 luck penalty at fatigue 7 (as shown in FATIGMOD.2da) and that increase up to -94 luck at 100 fatigue. Fatigue can only be decreased by resting or items (&lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Glory\"&gt;Blazing Glory&lt;/a&gt; ; &lt;a href=\"The%20Gift\"&gt;The Gift&lt;/a&gt; ; &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Tankard\"&gt;Battle Tankard&lt;/a&gt; ; &lt;a href=\"Hexxat%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Hexxat's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Wish%23Make%20it%20as%20if%20the%20entire%20party%20has%20just%20rested%20a%20full%20night%20and%20rememorized%20all%20their%20spells.\"&gt;Wish: Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce again, despite what the game manuals claim, every character has a base fatigue value of 0, regardless of their CON attribute. This is the reason why both a character with CON 3 and CON 25 become tired after two &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; casts expire (or with a single cast of a Restoration spell or a combination of reverting the Slayer transformation and a Haste spell expiring, for example) and the save game-editing tool EEKeeper confirms this, as it shows that all player characters have a fatigue value of 0 after sleep (so no negative values).\nHowever, CON does affect how fast naturally-accumulated fatigue (ie fatigue you get over time without sleep) increases, so a character with CON 3 will still get tired much sooner than a character with CON 25 over the course of travels and normal play time, despite having the same initial fatigue value.\nThe natural fatigue-inflicting effect works in a strange way, because characters don't exactly get fatigue over time in a gradual way; instead, a character will suddenly get 7 or 8 fatigue instantly after a set amount of time (y using EEKeeper and constant saving after 4 hours of travel, one can easily check that the previously-thought relation of 1 fatigue for each 4 hours isn't exactly true). And, with that in mind, characters with low CON values will get a sudden 7 or 8 fatigue penalty suddenly after a set amount of hours pass and higher CON characters will get that same penalty suddenly as well, but only when a larger set amount of hours pass."}

Examples include &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe divine spell &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt; will protect the recipient from this spell. See the status effect link for other preventive abilities, spells and methods.\nIn an unmodified game only a successful &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect or a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Restoration\"&gt;Greater Restoration&lt;/a&gt; spell can remove the status effect from the victim.\nA successful cast of Feeblemind isn\u2019t implemented as an aggressive action - thus it won\u2019t cause the target or other creatures in the same area to turn hostile: this isn't on purpose though, as the spell is flagged as \"hostile\", but because the \"State: Feebleminded\" causes all victim creature scripts to cease, the hostility trigger won't be implemented - and since the creature isn't made hostile, this in-turn doesn't trigger other neutral creatures nearby to also turn hostile.\nThis quirk in the spell design isn't an actual bug, but rather an order of operations and game engine limitation.\nHowever, if the &lt;a href=\"Feeblemindedness\"&gt;Feeblemindedness&lt;/a&gt; effect is dispelled from the target, then the victim will turn hostile to an enemy caster.\nIf a solo character is affected by this spell, it effectively ends the game, as the duration is VERY long, and the character has no means of removing it.\nA creature under the feeblemindedness effect is not in the &lt;a href=\"Helpless\"&gt;Helpless&lt;/a&gt; state, and its &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; attribute is set to 3. Attacks against a creature will not automatically hit, and the target's full &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; protection benefits will still apply, although of course, the creature will not fight back or flee.\nA creature coded as an \"innocent\" killed while feebleminded will still elicit a reputation penalty, and make others in the area hostile, for instance inside a shop or tavern with patrons.\nThe Artificial Intelligence and scripting of the game will almost never use the Feeblemind spell against the player in the entire game saga.\nBe advised that using this spell on creatures that are scripted to deliver dialogue can break those planned story scripts, some of which could be essential. Ensure that the target of the spell isn't needed to advance the various questlines in the game, or it can cause gameplay problems and or shutter plot actions. If in doubt, make a save game before casting the spell, or just don't use feeblemind unless the target is already hostile.\nNotes.\nDue to this spell's unusual and probably unintended misfunctioning hostility flag - the Feeblemind spell has many exploits that can be achieved in a tactical sense and to permanently pacify neutral creatures before a planned battle or to perform a theft and other actions. Many articles and comments abound on the internet in gaming forums and gaming sites about this spell's uses/exploits.\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"Spiritual%20Lock\"&gt;Spiritual Lock&lt;/a&gt; spell for the &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; class.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Feeblemind\" is restricted towards people or creatures who use magic spells. There are also different saving throw modifiers for different types of creatures, and the target's Wisdom can affect this. The spell can only be removed with a Heal spell or Wish.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising saving throw. See below for description:\nFeeblemind\nLevel: 5\nSchool: Enchantment\nRange: Long\nDuration: Permanent\nCasting Time: 5\nArea of Effect: 1 creature\nSaving Throw: Spell negates\nFeeblemind causes the subject\u2019s intellect to degenerate into that of a simple beast of burden, with an intelligence score of 3. The subject remains in this state until a successful dispel magic is cast upon him. The victim must make a save vs. spell at -4 in order to avoid the effect.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod Smarter Mage component will script arcane casters to attempt the Feeblemind spell directed at party members. This is usually more common if the mage was assigned an Enchanter mage kit. Often the Greater Malison spell will be cast before Feeblemind and other enchantment spells. In effect this can lead to the player having a -8 penalty to their saving throw."}

Fighters can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains. A good Fighter needs to be strong and healthy if they hope\u00a0to survive.\nClass features:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Berserker\"&gt;Berserker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is a warrior who is in tune with animalistic side and, during combat, can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will enable one to fight longer, harder, and more savagely than any person has a right to. Berserkers tend to be barbarian-like in nature, but not always. Sometimes it is a conscious choice that a warrior in training makes. Regardless, opponents on the battlefield will be unsettled when they see the savage and inhuman elements of the Berserker's personality. This class is common amongst dwarves, known to them as the Battlerager.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Slayer\"&gt;Wizard Slayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis warrior has been specially trained by one's sect to excel in hunting and combating spellcasters of all kinds.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Kensai\"&gt;Kensai&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis class's name, which means \"sword saint\" in the common tongue, refers to a warrior who has been specially trained to be one with his weapon(s). The Kensai is deadly, fast, and trained to fight without the protection of armor. Despite its common name, a Kensai may use any melee weapon.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Barbarian can be an excellent warrior. While not as disciplined or as skilled as other fighter kits, they can willingly throw themselves into a &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;, becoming tougher and stronger.\nClass Features:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Defender\"&gt;Dwarven Defender&lt;/a&gt; (EE only).\nThe Dwarven Defender is a formidable warrior that is reputed to be worth two soldiers of any other race.

Unlike most other multi-class combinations, both classes can freely use heavy armor without restricting any class abilities, making this character a naturally proficient tank.\nAs a fighter, the character benefits from high &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Dice\"&gt;Hit Dice&lt;/a&gt;, low\u00a0&lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;, multiple attacks per round, and advanced &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;weapon proficiencies&lt;/a&gt;. This enables the character to act as a frontline melee character, though it will never be as good as a pure fighter in that respect.\nAs a cleric, the character has access to &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; and divine spells. The progression is slower than that of a single-class cleric of course, but not prohibitively so. This multi-class inherits the weapon restrictions of the cleric.\nGameplay.\nFighter / Clerics are straightforward to play. They benefit from of a number of offensive cleric buffs which are self-target only. The two most critical spells are &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Magic\"&gt;Righteous Magic&lt;/a&gt;, which boost &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and damage rolls. At higher levels, spells like &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Globe of Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aura%20of%20Flaming%20Death\"&gt;Aura of Flaming Death&lt;/a&gt; can also augment the F/C's damage output.\nWhile the number of defensive options are more limited than those of the &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Fighter / Mage&lt;/a&gt;, the F/C is uniquely positioned to stack several percentile damage resistances at high levels. While &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt; is weak at low levels, it can eventually provide 25% physical damage resistance. This can stack with the &lt;a href=\"Hardiness\"&gt;Hardiness&lt;/a&gt; HLA to provide 65% resistance, and further stack with the &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20Easthaven\"&gt;Defender of Easthaven&lt;/a&gt; (even in the offhand) for up to 85% resistance, making them potent physical tanks.\nDue to the character's low &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;, they are able to utilize spells that use an attack roll, such as &lt;a href=\"Harm\"&gt;Harm&lt;/a&gt;, better than single-class clerics. At high levels, they can use the &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt; HLA after these spells to guarantee success, allowing them to effectively kill any target outright.\u00a0\nWhile this class may use the &lt;a href=\"Crom%20Faeyr\"&gt;Crom Faeyr&lt;/a&gt; to reach 25 &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, consider that under many circumstances, a F/C is able to reach max STR without it. As long as the caster has 19 STR or higher, they\u00a0will buff to 25 STR using Draw Upon Holy Might or Righteous Magic once they reach cleric level 18; this is possible for half-orcs innately, and humans or half-elves after using any of the permanent stat increases available.\u00a0 When stacking these spells, they may reach 25 STR much earlier and from less optimal base stats.\u00a0 Thus, it may be better to consider using different weapons with this class combination.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;Dual-Class&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s can dual class if they meet the attribute requirements for doing so. As with other dual-class combinations, it is generally preferable to dual from fighter into cleric, as your HP is better and clerics will benefit much more from their uncapped progression than a fighter will.\nKit Comparisons for Dual-Classing:\nCommon Level ranges for Dual-Classing:\nAbility Scores Table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value.\n^ - Fighters have access to percentile Strength.\nSpecial Abilities of the Fighter / Cleric.\nAdvanced Weapon Specialization.\nThis class may Specialize in any weapon, allowing them to invest up to two points into a specific &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;Weapon Proficiency&lt;/a&gt;. (Cleric weapon restrictions still apply, and any proficiency points not put in staffs, maces, clubs, morningstars/flails, hammers, slings or fighting styles are wasted for Fighters dual-classing to Cleric!) As a result, fighters may do more damage and hit more often with weapons from the specific proficiency.\n&lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nClerics have the ability to turn undead creatures. When this mode is activated and the undead creatures are in range of the character, there is a chance they will stop attacking their targets and run away from the character until the effect is worn off. As the character's level increases, this becomes increasingly powerful.\u00a0 At very high level differences, &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;Alignment&lt;/a&gt; factors into this effect; good and neutral clerics can outright destroy undead, and evil clerics can permanently charm them.\n&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Symbol\"&gt;Holy Symbol&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen clerics reach level 25 (7,650,000 XP for the multi-class), they obtain a in form of a ring, based on their patron &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt; or their &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; if not having chosen one.

The progression is slower than that of a single-class druid of course, but not prohibitively so. This multi-class inherits the weapon restrictions of the druid, but not its armor restrictions.\nGameplay.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Cleric\"&gt;Fighter / Cleric&lt;/a&gt;, Fighter / Druids are straightforward to play. While they miss out on a number of great lower level cleric buffs, they gain &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Skins\"&gt;Iron Skins&lt;/a&gt; which is a potent defensive tool.\nThe 4th level spell &lt;a href=\"Call%20Woodland%20Beings\"&gt;Call Woodland Beings&lt;/a&gt; can be used to summon a Nymph, which can perform the 5th level spell &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Cure\"&gt;Mass Cure&lt;/a&gt; in addition to an artillery of mid-level disabling spells, making them better than F/C's at consistently keeping a group healthy, although they do miss &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Dead\"&gt;Raise Dead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resurrection\"&gt;Resurrection&lt;/a&gt; (they can learn &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Raise%20Dead\"&gt;Mass Raise Dead&lt;/a&gt; as a HLA, though).\u00a0 Note that, due to the druid's extreme experience growth and spell slots table progression at level 15, the F/D will lag behind the F/C for the 3,000,000 XP - 6,000,000 XP level range, but eventually will have double the 7th level spell slots.\nAs an offensive spellcaster, they gain several spells with guaranteed disabling effects. &lt;a href=\"Insect%20Plague\"&gt;Insect Plague&lt;/a&gt; is the most notable of these as it totally disables spellcasting without offering a saving throw. &lt;a href=\"Dolorous%20Decay\"&gt;Dolorous Decay&lt;/a&gt; (slow, no save) and &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Beauty\"&gt;Nature's Beauty&lt;/a&gt; (blind, no save) are also highly effective, and the cleric has no substitutes for these. Their shapeshifting abilities are made largely useless by the multi-class, however, as they are already stronger fighters than the animals available.\nDue to adding fighter abilities, Fighter/Druids do not suffer from any armor or shield restrictions and can effectively hold their own in melee fight. Shapeshifters and Avengers retain their armor restrictions however.\nFinally, while their weapon selection is not necessarily better or worse, they can wield &lt;a href=\"Belm\"&gt;Belm&lt;/a&gt; to gain extra APR, which the F/C cannot do. This gives them a huge base damage increase that should be considered against the cleric's better buffing abilities.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;Dual-Class&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s can dual class if they meet the attribute requirements for doing so.

Note that the druid has &lt;a href=\"Charisma\"&gt;Charisma&lt;/a&gt; as a prime attribute in addition to &lt;a href=\"Wisdom\"&gt;Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, and that fighters must be &lt;a href=\"true%20neutral\"&gt;true neutral&lt;/a&gt; to dual into the class.\nKit Comparisons for Dual-Classing:\nCommon Level ranges for Dual-Classing:\nAbility Scores Table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value.\n^ - Fighters have access to percentile Strength.\nSpecial Abilities of the Fighter / Druid.\nAdvanced Weapon Specialization.\nThis class may Specialize in any weapon, allowing them to invest up to two points into a specific &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;Weapon Proficiency&lt;/a&gt;.

This enables the character to act as a frontline melee character, though it will never be as good as a pure fighter in that respect.\nAs a mage, the character has access to higher &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt; and arcane spells.\u00a0 The progression is slower than that of a single-class Mage of course, but not prohibitively so.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the player should keep in mind that they are unable to cast spells while wearing any armor (with the notable exception of ), which can conflict with the fighter's preferred role.\u00a0 They can eventually select every mage\u00a0&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-Level Class Ability&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0but due to the required access to 9th level spell slots, they are significantly delayed in acquiring them.\nGameplay.\nFighter / Mages benefit heavily from the mage's wide variety of defensive spells. Although they have less HP than single-class fighters and usually don't wear armor, spells such as &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; can make the F/M very difficult to suffer physical damage, allowing them to function as a tank. In addition, they can utilize spell protections such as &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and combat protection strippers like &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to make them highly effective counters to enemy mages.\nThe F/M also benefits from the mage's offensive buffs, especially &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt;, as their base &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;APR&lt;/a&gt; can already be quite high with the fighter bonuses. &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Blue%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Blue)&lt;/a&gt; are also effective at increasing damage output as the character wades into melee battles often. Note that \"traditional\" buff spells such as &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20Self\"&gt;Polymorph Self&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tenser%27s%20Transformation\"&gt;Tenser's Transformation&lt;/a&gt; can be relatively weaker for the F/M than they are for the single-class mage, as the F/M should already by an effective fighter (for example, one of Tenser's main effects is that it grants the caster fighter THAC0, which the F/M innately possesses at all times).\nThe F/M can make up for their slower spellcasting progression by casting from scrolls, which allows them to cast spells that they are not be able to learn yet. Note that spells cast from scrolls use a fixed caster level, typically 6 in \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" and 10 in \"\".\nAlthough the F/M cannot &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;, they still enjoy a -4 THAC0 bonus when attacking from stealth. This makes &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, and especially &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; effective tools.\nFinally, all multi-class fighters can make effective archers, even though they lack &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;Grandmastery&lt;/a&gt; compared to single-class fighters. If the F/M is used this way, they are more free to utilize traditional mage spells such as &lt;a href=\"Sleep\"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; as they do not require defensive spell support to function.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;Dual-Class&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s can dual class if they meet the attribute requirements for doing so.

The player should also keep in mind that the backstab ability only works with weapons usable by a single-class thief and build their proficiencies accordingly.\nGameplay.\nThe Fighter / Thief is relatively uncomplicated.

Alternatively, (&lt;a href=\"Greater%20Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Greater&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Whirlwind Attack&lt;/a&gt; can be used within the time stop to maximize the number of strikes.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;Dual-Class&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s can dual-class if they meet the attribute requirements for doing so.

He will grant access to the guildhall. Go through the left door and down the stairs to the basement where Mae'Var is found, torturing a thief named &lt;a href=\"Lin\"&gt;Lin&lt;/a&gt;. His first assignment is to steal a Unique Item from one of two Temples in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;, depending on your &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt;. In either case, the theft is easier at night. Failure results in hostilities with all temple occupants, so timing and stealth are critical.\nWhen the item has been obtained, return to Mae'Var and deliver it. He will tell you to report to &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Odesseiron\"&gt;Edwin&lt;/a&gt;, his second in command.\nSecond task.\nGet to the third floor of the guildhall and speak to &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Odesseiron\"&gt;Edwin&lt;/a&gt;, a former companion in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;.

Enter &lt;a href=\"Rayic%20Gethras%E2%80%99s%20Home\"&gt;Rayic Gethras\u2019s Home&lt;/a&gt; to the west and defeat the wizard on the third floor. Return to Edwin to report your success.\nThird task.\nEdwin will ask you to retrieve some documents from a merchant named &lt;a href=\"Marcus\"&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt;. Enter the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Bounty%20Tavern\"&gt;Sea Bounty Tavern&lt;/a&gt; just west of the guildhall. You have many ways to deal with Marcus:\u00a0\nPotions or spells can be used to temporarily raise attributes before speaking with him.\nGive the documents to Edwin and he will tell you to report to Mae'Var for your final assignment.\nFourth task.\nReturn to the cellars of Mae'Var's Guildhall and speak with Mae'Var. He will require that you kill a traitor named &lt;a href=\"Embarl\"&gt;Embarl&lt;/a&gt;. Enter the second floor of the Sea Bounty,\nGive the dagger to Mae'Var as proof that you killed Embarl.\nProviding Evidence.\nSpeak to Edwin once more and he will reveal that he knows that you are spying on Mae'Var and wants to join in on the \"winning side\" of the affair. He offers to give you\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mae%27Var%27s%20Strongbox%20Key\"&gt;Mae'Var's Strongbox Key&lt;/a&gt; and to join your party to expose the secret partnership with a rival thieves' guild. If you accept the key, with or without his help and companionship, descend to the floor below, and use the key to open the strongbox in the north chamber. If you refuse Edwin, then this questline is now stymied, as the proof of Mae'Var's treachery is locked away and can't be obtained without the key. Perhaps the key can be obtained from Edwin in another manner? Note that Edwin is one of the best mage companions available in the game - if you can tolerate his personality. If not, then keep in the party temporarily, and then decide to release him when his usefulness to the party has passed.\nTake the quest item &lt;a href=\"Mae%27Var%27s%20Letter\"&gt;Mae'Var's Letter&lt;/a&gt; from the box. The &lt;a href=\"Worn%20Whispers\"&gt;Boots of Stealth (\"Worn Whispers\")&lt;/a&gt; can also be looted from the strongbox. It is recommended to finish any shopping from Gorch at this point, and to loot all remaining containers in the guildhall, as this will be the last opportunity to do so.\nGive the letter to Renal Bloodscalp in the Shadow Thief Guildhall. He will thank you for proving Mae'Var's guilt and will ask you to return to Mae'Var and kill him. Return once again to Mae'Var's Guildhall and fight your way through to Mae'Var in the cellar. Once you have killed him, return to Renal Bloodscalp for a handsome reward.\n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Gorion's Ward is a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; with no other stronghold, Renal Bloodscalp will offer them Mae'Var's former position as &lt;a href=\"Thieves%27%20Guild%20Stronghold\"&gt;head of the thieves' guild&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, they get &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%27s%20Blade\"&gt;The Shadow's Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemember to loot Mae'Var's place clean and do not store any important items there before reporting back to Renal for rewards, for you have no means to return to original Mae'Var's Guildhall after accepting it as your stronghold.\nMod Content.\nMods:.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod alters the reward from Renal Bloodscalp if the party has provided proof of Mae'Var's treachery.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alternatives\"&gt;Alternatives&lt;/a&gt; mod and the \"Temple Thievery\" component offers a different way to satisfy Mae'Var's demand that the protagonist steal an artifact from a temple. Please keep in mind that for recruiting Edwin, the PC needs to work for Renal Bloodscalp long enough before accepting one of the alternative offers."}

However, before you can enter the Harpers' headquarters, you will need to get pass the doorman, as the front door is sealed against intrusion.\nWalkthrough.\nSpeak to &lt;a href=\"Rylock\"&gt;Rylock&lt;/a&gt;, the doorman in front of &lt;a href=\"Galvarey%20Estate\"&gt;Galvarey Estate&lt;/a&gt; (aka Harper Hold), who can be found southwest in &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Dock District&lt;/a&gt;. He will ask you to kill some evil creatures in &lt;a href=\"Prebek%27s%20House\"&gt;Prebek's House&lt;/a&gt; before he will allow you to enter the building.

Enter the aviary and take the &lt;a href=\"Harper%20Bird\"&gt;Harper Bird&lt;/a&gt; who was once Montaron.\nLeave Harper Hold and give the bird to Xzar.

Disarm the trap in the doorway, and the nearby trapped locker with minor loot (incl. scroll of protection from fire), and another trapped locker (ray of enfeeblement, minor spell deflection). \u00a0Traverse the bridge East past spiders and undead to the entrance to the Southern Dungeons (x 2750, y 3250).\n\"The stale stench of death assails your nostrils. \u00a0Tombs line this hall, and you hear the sound of shuffling within them.\"\nAlongside the walls, there are doors which can be inspected, leading to small empty rooms. \u00a0Regardless of whether you open the doors, they will disgorge various undead including zombies, wights, skeleton warriors, ghasts, etc. \u00a0If you have a cleric, start\u00a0turning undead, or cast repulse undead. \u00a0If your AI script has your adventurers set to prefer melee, they will chase down fleeing undead, triggering more door openings and traps, so set them to prefer ranged or just make sure that they don't chase mobs down the hall.\nThere are traps located by the eyes, chin, and left hand of the mosaic portrait on the floor. \u00a0The fifth set of doors unleash a vampire who will lead with domination. \u00a0Don't miss the urn on the left wall (x 950, y 300, protection from electricity, pearl necklace, +1 bullets and +1 darts). \u00a0\nA hidden door on the right wall at the end of the hall opens to a corridor where you'll get a pair of mummies; then a shadow, a shadow fiend, and two wraiths. \u00a0There's an urn at the intersection with some goodies (x 500, y 1300, +1 arrows).\nGo south first, disarm traps (x 300, y 1600; x 430, y 1800; x 700, y 2000).\n\"This tomb has been cracked open, and anything of value has been removed. \u00a0Looters have broken the fingers of the corpse, no doubt to take something it was holding.\" \u00a0The looters missed one urn in the room with some +1 arrows.\nGo back to the intersection and head East. \u00a0More traps (x 800, y 1400). \u00a0There's a sarcophagus at the same location. \u00a0Open it for a skeleton warrior who drops Halcyon +1, a spear that also gives electrical damage, or in other words, vendor trash.\nJust around the bend, you'll come to four mummies and two ghasts. \u00a0A well placed fireball or two will save a lot of ammunition.\nWhen you round the next corner, you'll come face-to-face with Nevaziah, a long-dead wizard who doesn't realize just yet that he's a lich. \u00a0Respond to his query that you are not with the Cowled Wizards, that indeed the Cowled Wizards are still searching for him,\nNevaziah doesn't have a contingency spell loaded, and +2 ranged ammunition will easily disrupt all attempts at spellcasting. \u00a0Pierce Magic and other spells that remove target protection will make him an easy kill.\nFive days later, Edwin deciphers a part of the scroll and will receive a permanent -1 bonus to all saving throws, 50,000 XP and +20 to his &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of days later another decipher of the scroll transforms himself into a woman without being able to turn back, from this point many companions will have \"very\" interesting (not funny to Edwina of course) conversations with HER.\nAfter about three weeks or so, a Red Wizard of Thay by the name of &lt;a href=\"Degardan\"&gt;Degardan&lt;/a&gt; presents himself to the party and asks for information about Edwin, where you've the choice to either betray him, which causes him to turn hostile and concludes the quest, or maintain his cover.

{"id": "55320", "revid": "50513676", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55320", "title": "Finding Irenicus in Hell", "text": "This is part of the main quest for &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%207\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt;: Part 2. \nIn fact, it is the only quest presented in the final part of the .\nAquisition.\nWhen the party first is transported to and awakens in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Abyss\"&gt;The Abyss&lt;/a&gt; area, the player's Journal gets an update under Chapter 7: Part 2.\nFollowing this event is a brand-new Journal entry which registers under the title \"Finding Irenicus in Hell\". The entry reads:\nWalkthrough (Abbreviated).\nOnce the party has had a time to get its wits back, it could for instance try to camp and rest in this horrid place. It turns out that it is possible if desired. Aside from the strange sounds often audible or imagined (sounds of anguish? Horror? Despair?) a well-deserved period of inactivity is appreciated. It should provide time to reflect on the challenge ahead, to reform a spell book, perhaps to eat and drink any rations brought along.\nThe next step isn't clear to try and find Irenicus. A reconnaissance of the terrain indicates a strange statue in the center, some sort of runes or cryptic markings on the floor, and five staircases descending into the depths. Most noteworthy is a macabre Abyssal Door, sealed shut, with five \"eyes\" mounted around it. Closer examination of the door displays a text:\nWith little else to try, select a staircase to descend when prepared to do so. The whole party must travel as a team, and none can be separated.\nAs it doesn't matter which stairs are selected or what order they are explored, this page is going to review them in a clockwise fashion (as if the party were facing the Abyssal door and first explored the stairs to their right (East), and then the next one, and so forth).\nDescend the stairs below - Test of Pride.\nThe steps below lead to the &lt;a href=\"Pride%20%28Abyss%29\"&gt;Pride (Abyss)&lt;/a&gt; area, although the party wouldn't know this. \nTransition down the steps to whatever awaits the party at the bottom.\nA moment after they enter this new area, the party observes a hellish cavern.\nJust ahead is the figure of some sort of fiend, a demon labelled as &lt;a href=\"Pride%20%28Fiend%29\"&gt;Pride&lt;/a&gt; will initiate a strange greeting.\nThe demon says:\nThe bhaalspawn may now reply and ask questions, about what it means about being in pieces, holding sway here, your heritage, and what are the Tears of Bhaal. The demon will answer each question. Eventually the fiend explains what must be done to obtain one of those Tears, it remarks:\nSo, obviously, the demon wishes you to have pride in your reputation as a vanquisher of all that oppose you, and just go seize the Tear of Bhaal from the creature.\nThrough dialogue selection this can be easily done, in fact two replies will send the bhaalspawn down the \"evil path\". When hearing that choice the demon will say:\nOn the other hand, not agreeing to just slay the creature without finding out more, such as asking what kind of creature it is, and why does the creature have to be killed, or could you just ask the creature for the Tear and that sort of direction - this is the \"good\" path. Eventually, the demon will end this test and say:\nTaking the evil path requires slaying the creature, a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20%28Abyss%29\"&gt;Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating this creature allows looting it's corpse for the Tear of bhaal and other treasures as described on the dragon's creature article. With the Tear in the inventory, the party is now allowed to leave this area and ascend the steps back to the starting section.\nTaking the good path requires that a party member speak with the dragon, which will acknowledge that you have mastered your pride, and wishes you well, and voluntarily gives the Tear of Bhaal. The dragon disappears in a cascade of flaming magical power forever. The screen fades to black, and then the party may now leave the area and return upstairs.\nIf the party wants to forego speaking with the dragon and asking for the tear, instead attack the dragon and see if it can be had by force. Although the dragon doesn't say anything or even turn hostile (red circle) - it still fights back (blue circle). When it is defeated, the dragon's corpse provides a Tear, and 100 gold coins. The dragon awards its XP for being killed. The party may leave this area now.\nReturn to the starting area - use a Tear of Bhaal.\nWith one of the required &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tears of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; in your possession, the party could try to experiment what it can do or wait until later and go after more of these tears.\nJust to illustrate the process of \"using\" one of the Tears, the bhaalspawn (it has to done by the protagonist) must have the Tear in inventory - and approach the Abyssal Door. \nWhen close enough, the player's cursor will show a golden circle allowing interaction (clicking) when it is hovered/positioned over one of the door's \"eyes\".\nClicking/selecting the eye will show a flash of animated magic and bring up some text, reading:\nDepending on what tear it is and from what Test it was derived from, as well as whether the test was completed in the \"good\" or \"evil\" way - determines the next text messages displayed.\nThe message will display what the Tear granted Gorion's Ward in terms of a new ability or power. This may also include a final message that could say \"Alignment Change\" and the new alignment the bhaalspawn is now assigned, such as going from Neutral Good to Neutral Evil. \nWhen one of the Tears of Bhaal is used, the Abyssal Door image is changed, and shows that one of the \"eyes\" is now closed.\nDescend the stairs below - Test of Fear.\nWhen ready, the party descends a long set of stairs leading below to another destination, as yet unknown. \nThis is the second area if visiting these places in a clockwise fashion, with the Test of Pride having been the first.\nThe party transitions to the &lt;a href=\"Fear%20%28Abyss%29\"&gt;Test of Fear&lt;/a&gt; area, entering bizarre cavern.\nDirectly ahead is observed yet another demon awaiting the party's arrival.\nThe fiend initiates a greeting - perhaps saying the following:\nThe demon continues:\nAt this juncture the bhaalspawn must make a dialogue choice reply. There are four reply selections offered: \n- \"A cloak stitched from the skin of nymphs? I can feel its evil from here. I wish nothing to do with it, despite its power\".\n- \"I do not need a cloak to give me courage, fiend. Take it and begone.\"\n- \"I am not sure. Let me investigate these rooms myself, and I will decide then if I need it.\"\n- \"A magical cloak? Of course I'll take it.\"\nMake a selection. If the bhaalspawn rebuffs the offered cloak, the demon will reply:\nThe demon departs the area in a flash of magic. This decision is the \"good\" path in this test. A Journal entry will register:\nIf the bhaalspawn accepts the cloak, the demon says:\nThe fiend departs the area with a magical animation effect, and the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Bravery\"&gt;Cloak of Bravery&lt;/a&gt; is placed in the PC's inventory. You have now decided to take the \"evil' path in this test. A Journal entry is registered:\nIf the bhaalspawn wants to investigate the area before committing to an answer about the cloak, the demon will say:\nIf later the bhaalspawn decides to speak with the demon again, it will reply:\nHere is another chance to accept the cloak or refuse it.\nNow, whether the bhaalspawn took the cloak, refused it or just didn't decide one way or another - the Tear of Bhaal in this area is obtainable to the party if they can locate it.\nThe cavern here is split into two rooms, although connected by passageways. One side is inhabited by Three &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Gauth\"&gt;Gauth&lt;/a&gt; monsters, which will be hostile when they detect a party member.\nOn the other half of the cavern is positioned an obvious sea-trunk or treasure chest. This container cannot be forced open, but it can be lockpicked with sufficient skill. If the trap on it isn't disarmed before it is opened, the room will be flooded with an &lt;a href=\"Incendiary%20Cloud\"&gt;Incendiary Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. Within are some potions for the taking.\nVery close to the chest and stretching across this part of the cavern is a hidden proximity trigger that will expose any nearby party member to a potent &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; status effect (Ref: SPIN772.spl). There is no saving throw, it bypasses magic resistance and Spell Protections such as a &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. An item or spell that makes one immune to the effect will provide protection, such as the Cloak the demon can provide, or a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Fear\"&gt;Remove Fear&lt;/a&gt; spell. By this stage of the game, the party probably has multiple ways of protecting against fear.\nIf a party member(s) is affected by this potent fear effect, then the member will be uncontrollable and randomly run about the area - possibly moving into the Elder Orb side of the cavern and getting attacked. The duration of the fear effect is quite short, but perhaps long enough to get into some trouble. It cannot be dispelled but could be countered with appropriate magic that removes fear/horror/panic.\nIf at any point the party obtains the tear of Bhaal in this area, the demon will disappear from the map, if it hadn't already left beforehand. There is no requirement to ever face the Elder Orbs and gauths in this area unless desired, although it may be a bit tricky in terms of party member positioning and maneuver on the map to avoid them.\nFor the location of the tear, see the &lt;a href=\"Fear%20%28Abyss%29\"&gt;Fear (Abyss)&lt;/a&gt; area article. This should prevent a \"Spoiler\" should the player want to find it on their own without being shown ahead of gameplay.\nWhen the Tear of Bhaal is found, a text message displays:\nOr if the player has the Cloak, then the text differs:\nWith the tear in the party's possession, this area can be departed from when ready to do so.\nDescend the stairs below - Test of Selfishness.\nWhen ready, descend a long staircase down to this new area.\nThe party will transition and is placed on a landing, with several more steps descending to a level floor, below.\nFurther ahead is observed a winged &lt;a href=\"Selfish%20%28Fiend%29\"&gt;Fiend&lt;/a&gt;. It will initiate starting dialogue with the party if any move forward. \nNote that the opening dialogue exchange differs if this is the player's first test for one the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tears of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; attempted. Assuming it isn't the first test, then the fiend opens with the following remark:\nGorion's Ward replies:\nThe fiend answers and continues:\nIf a companion from the party is selected -\nIf an innocent human is summoned forth -\nAt this point, the demon disappears in a swirl of magic and the player's Journal is updated, with one of two entries, depending on if a party companion is used as an innocent, or if a random human was used as the testing subject - the text will differ slightly:\nThe game script will now select a party companion or will create a human subject to serve as the \"innocent\" subject - a subject who will be affected by the bhaalspawns actions. The party companion will be subjected to a special &lt;a href=\"Held\"&gt;Held&lt;/a&gt; status effect and is transported elsewhere in the area (somewhere in the fog of war).\nWith the demon and the innocent person now removed from sight, the bhaalspawn must make a choice as to which path to take.\nTo the player's right which is West (also the demon's left) is the \"good\" path, a sacrifice must be made by the bhaalspawn.\nTo the player's left which is east (also the demon's right) is the \"evil\" path, no sacrifice need be made by the bhaalspawn.\nDecide on a path and enter one of the doorways, once one is opened, the door is consumed. There are three doors to each path. If at any time the player wishes to backtrack and change from the good to evil path, that can be done as long as the third door on each path hasn't been passed yet.\nThe \"good\" path:\nThe first door opened shows a swirl of magic animation on the PC and a text reads: \"You have lost 2 Hit Points from your maximum Hit Point level.\" (Ref: SPIN767.spl)\nThe second door opens also plays a 3D visual effect on the PC and a text reads: \"You have lost one Dexterity point.\" (Ref: SPIN766.spl)\nThe third door is opened with another 3D effect. A text reads: \"You have lost experience points.\" (Ref: SPIN765.spl)\nOnce the third door has been opened, the fiend addresses Gorion's Ward and says:\nThe PC receives a Tear of Bhaal in the inventory, the fiend disappears in a flaming burst, and the player's Journal updates with:\nThe \"evil\" path:\nThe bhaalspawn will have three doors to open moving in a southernly direction. When the first is opened that triggers a brief view of the fiend standing next to the abducted party companion/or the innocent human victim. A 3D animation plays over the sprite and the figure loses 50% of its Hit Points.\nAfter the second door is opened, this event repeats, however the victim takes an additional 25% Hit Point damage.\nUpon the third and final door being opened, the fiend utters some final words: \nThe fiend disappears in a burst of flame, and the victim is also engulfed in a flash of fiery magic - killing the creature (with a &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Kill target&lt;/a&gt; effect, and the \"chunking\" Death Type designation added.). The player's Journal updates:\nWith the Tear of Bhaal now in your possession, the party may leave this area. If a party companion has been slain as a result of the Selfishness path, then it is possible to revive them with appropriate magic if the party has access to that - but only if the companion was not subjected to the \"chunking\" parameter. Otherwise, they will remain deceased until resurrected, or will not be revivable due to the chunking. Note that the party can return to this area if the party wishes to leave the companions gear here until later. If the companion's portrait is still present in the party formation and \"greyed\" out - This indicates a dead companion but revivable. The companion will not be killed if a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt; effect is cast upon them beforehand, but will still be &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person%20%28priest%29\"&gt;held&lt;/a&gt; even after resting. This allows for a safer way to kill the companion and not randomly trigger the chunking effect, so that they can be resurrected.\nDescend the stairs below - Test of Greed.\nThe party moves down another long staircase into the unknown depths below.\nBy now, this will be the fourth consecutive visit to one the Tears of Bhaal test areas.\nWhat awaits the party in this one is yet unknown - still, the group presses forward with determination.\nAs the party descends, the heat from below is extreme, the sulphureous air thick with acrid smoke and ash.\nAt the bottom of the steps is observed yet another fiend awaiting our arrival. The demon initiates contact and speaks:\nGorion's Ward replies:\nThe fiend continues:\nThe player receives the &lt;a href=\"Blackrazor\"&gt;Blackrazor&lt;/a&gt; sword, the demon transports away in a flash of magic and the player's Journal updates:\nMove the party forward as desired, to find the so called \"other' whom the demon said holds the Tear of Bhaal.\nThe next chamber is a sweltering cavern with much bubbling magma interspersed with stones that may be walked upon.\nIn the distance is a large creature, some sort of Djinni or Efreet being who initiates contact when a party member is close enough. The game script takes control at this point and moves the party members in an arrangement before the being. It opens dialogue in a pained and labored hollow rasp:\nThe bhaalspawn and this &lt;a href=\"Enslaved%20Genie\"&gt;Enslaved Genie&lt;/a&gt; will now engage in a series of dialogue questions and answers. The genie is not permitted to directly answer all the questions in totality. The genie will however offer a riddle of sorts that he is forced to disclose:\n\"Ye who hold the razor's blade\nforged of darkest iron,\nquenched by blood and fear,\nknow that ye hold the key\nto the one who guards\nBhaal's sacred murdered Tear.\"\nAfter all the questions have been exhausted the bhaalspawn must make a decision about what to do. It boils down to three selections. \n- Do nothing and say \"I'm not sure wat I want to do.\". Initiate dialogue again later, or preemptively attack the genie.\n- Give the genie the Blackrazor sword, freeing the creature from torment. Receive the Tear of Bhaal and a reward. This is the \"good\" path.\n- Tell the genie it is time to die. The creature will fight back. When it is defeated, it's freed from enslavement, and upon the ground is dropped the Tear of Bhaal. This is the \"evil\" path.\nFor details about the stats, abilities and scripted actions likely when fighting the genie, see this &lt;a href=\"Enslaved%20Genie\"&gt;linked article&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Tear is obtained, the party is able to transition out of this zone and back up the stairs to the main area.\nDescend the stairs below - Test of Wrath.\nWhen prepared, gather the party and move below to the next Tear of Bhaal testing &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20%28Abyss%29\"&gt;Area&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party transitions below and observes a large cavern. There is no fiend waiting here, unlike previously visited test areas.\nMoving cautiously forward is yet another strange chamber, with grotesque protruding \"eyes\" peering at and following the party's movements. \nThe eyes are on the floor, cavern walls and probably on the rocky ceiling. A carved or magically formed serpent's maw juts from the wall ahead, like some sort of throne or door, and standing before and facing the party is an imposing figure.\nWhen within detection the figure will address the party - it is actually the deceased shade of &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok Anchev&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe figure booms out a remark in a familiar voice. The remark differs if this is the first test area explored by the party.\nThis form of Sarevok has been condemned here and addresses &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; in a determined and arrogant manner. There is a chain of dialogue options and rebuttals available in the exchange.\nSarevok makes it clear that he'll not provide the Tear of Bhaal because the protagonist is unworthy to receive it. Only by unleashing the true power and wrath of bhaal will he give it to the party. During the dialogue, there will be insults and accusations of weakness made. The player will have to decide if the bhaalspawn will meet Sarevok's challenge and try and take the tear with unfettered wrath or refuse this notion and retain control over the taint of bhaal. Sarevok knows you have been tainted by the Lord of Murder and embodied it in the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;. He wishes you to summon that wrath here and now and embrace the true power of your dead father. \nIf the bhaalspawn threatens to take the tear by force, Sarevok is impressed and eagerly attacks. Likewise, if the bhaalspawn lives up to the heritage of the Lord of Murder and promises to destroy Sarevok - this also spurs on a fight. These actions are deemed the \"evil\" path in the test of wrath.\nIf the bhaalspawn refuses to succumb to the intimidation and goading from Sarevok, the shade's patience wears out and he attacks. This is the \"good\" path in the test of wrath.\nFor information regarding the stats and abilities of this version of Sarevok, see the &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20Sarevok\"&gt;Wraith Sarevok&lt;/a&gt; article.\nIn order to get the Tear of Bhaal here, the party has no choice but to destroy Sarevok's wraith form. If and when that occurs, the Tear will automatically be placed in the PC's inventory. Afterwards, the party is now permitted to leave and return to the starting area above.\nSolve the Abyssal Door.\nTo advance the questline, the party must have performed all five tests to collect the five &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tears of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach Tear must be placed upon the Abyssal Door (also titled the \"Watcher's Door\"). This can be done at any time after one is obtained. Tears can be placed one-by-one as they are collected, or all of them can be placed in one final event. It matters not. \nAs each tear if placed upon the door, the reward is bestowed upon the bhaalspawn by the Tear. The nature of the reward is determined by whether the Tear was obtained in a \"good\" or \"evil\" manner. An alignment shift is possible depending upon the choices made during the tests.\nWhen the last tear is placed on the door, this triggers a script and a cutscene cinematic that opens the doorway. A violent burst of force knocks the party backwards and may put some prone on the ground. Several 3D effect animations are displayed.\nFinally, Irenicus stands before the party and initiates a confrontational series of statements and promises of the bhaalspawn's demise. The party may select certain replies and even question Irenicus. All core Bioware and Beamdog companions have interjections here as well. The dialogue runs its course, and Irenicus turns hostile, morphs into a unique version of the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt; and gates in a pair of &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Glabrezu (Shadows of Amn)&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Balor\"&gt;Balor&lt;/a&gt; allies. After that sequence, the cutscene finishes, and the player may take control of the party to issue commands and fight back.\nA final player Journal entry will display - and then all previous entries are removed from the Journal. This questline is now complete. The only task left to do is to kill Irenicus once and for all. \nFor more information about your foe, see the &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus%20%28Abyss%29\"&gt;Jon Irenicus (Abyss)&lt;/a&gt; page."}

Standing roughly twice as tall as a human (if not more), they can pose a serious threat to those unprepared to deal with them. These giants are found in several areas of the saga, but not in BG1 or SoA (unless you enter &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt; before ToB). \nThere are several varieties of Fire Giants in the game, with mostly minor differences between them. The Fire Giants in Watcher's Keep differ from the one's besieging &lt;a href=\"Saradush\"&gt;Saradush&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Camp\"&gt;Siege Camp&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Marching%20Mountains\"&gt;Marching Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yaga-Shura%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Yaga-Shura's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The Fire Giant statistics displayed in the Info Box above are from the Siege Camp/Marching Mountains/Yaga-Shura's Keep areas, since these account for the majority found in the game. \nDescription.\nThe majority of these hard-hitting creatures wield an undroppable Battle Axe (&lt;a href=\"GIAFIR2.ITM\"&gt;GIAFIR2.ITM&lt;/a&gt;), which is a +3 enchanted weapon with a speed factor of 5 and a reach of 2 (same as a halberd). It gives the giant a +3 THAC0 bonus, deals 2d12 slashing damage and 1d12 fire damage on any successful strike. The axe is coded and counts as a Two-handed Weapon, although it has one-handed animation. \nAnother variety wields a giant's version of a War Hammer (GIAFOR.ITM), is a +3 enchanted weapon with a speed factor of 7 and a reach of 2. It gives the giant a +3 THAC0 bonus and inflicts 2d10 crushing damage and 1d6 fire damage. This is a one-handed weapon.\nAnd yet another Fire Giant weapon is the giant's Fist (&lt;a href=\"GIAFIR.ITM\"&gt;GIAFIR.ITM&lt;/a&gt;), which has identical stats as the War Hammer, including the supplemental fire damage.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Giant%20%28Guardian%20of%20Fire%29\"&gt;Fire Giant (Guardian of Fire)&lt;/a&gt; variety employs a giant's Two-handed sword (&lt;a href=\"GIANTS01.ITM\"&gt;GIANTS01.ITM&lt;/a&gt;), that is non magical and deals 2D10 crushing or slashing damage.\nMost Fire Giants are healed by fire damage. Some giants only have 50% Fire and magical fire resistance though. Some Fire giants carry random treasure and potions. The AI script will utilize carried potions depending on situational triggers.\nThe assigned &lt;a href=\"Berserker\"&gt;Berserker&lt;/a&gt; kit doesn't actually allow these giants to utilize their &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt; ability. It simply isn't scripted for use in the unmodified game. Therefore, it really doesn't affect the creature's skills or behavior one way or another.\nFire giants are penalized when trying to strike the \"shorty\" races. A giant has a 4 point &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; penalty to hit when facing Dwarf, Gnome or Halfling opponents. This is a 2nd Edition D&amp;D rule implemented by the game.\nThe game files named \"Fire Giant\" include the following .CRE creatures, in alphabetical order: GIAFIR01, GIANTF01 (not used in the game), GORFIRG, HGWAR01, SARFAKI2, SARFAKIE, YSCARA03, YSFIRE01, YSFIRE02, YSG2, YSGUAR01, YSSOLD10. \nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes some universal changes to the Fire Giant Creatures in the games."}

Its potentially high damage and wide area of effect can be exploited in many creative ways, such as hit and run tactics or firing beyond a line-of-sight.

The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures who fail their saving throw vs. breath at -2 suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage."}

See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has replaced Fireshield (Red) with this arcane spell. See below for description:\nFire Shield\nLevel: 4\nSchool: Evocation\nRange: Personal\nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level\nCasting Time: 4\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nThis spell protects the user by surrounding the caster with a circular wall of flames. This shield not only grants the user 40% fire and cold resistance, but also protects the caster from attacks made within a 5\u2019 radius. Opponents that hit the caster with a weapon or spell from within this radius will suffer 1d6 points of fire damage plus one for every two levels of the caster (up to a maximum of 1d6+10). Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative, but it can be used in conjunction with similar spells. Tiny and small flying creatures cannot pass through the flames. Magic resistance does not affect this spell."}

It can still fire chosen bolt projectiles from the quiver, if the wielder wants this. The user needs an 8 &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; attribute to operate the crossbow.\nThe crossbow itself adds 1d8 +4 points of damage, has +6 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; bonus (+4 from the crossbow, +2 from the magically created bolt) and a weight of 5 lbs. The weapon has a speed factor of 1 and it fires one projectile per round. \nThe Fire damage added to any bolt hit can be blocked by &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the user wishes to ensure a target is hit with a +4 &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20item\"&gt;Enchanted projectile&lt;/a&gt; (or +5 with the upgraded version), then for example, do not fire an ordinary &lt;a href=\"Bolt\"&gt;Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20%2B1\"&gt;Bolt +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20%2B2\"&gt;Bolt +2&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20%2B3\"&gt;Bolt +3&lt;/a&gt; from the Firetooth Crossbow - the loaded ammunition will be the actual enchantment value that attempts to strike the target.\nIf the user wishes to maximize potential damage onto a target, then adding another bolt ammunition type to the crossbow will increase the damage range. For example:\nFiring the Firetooth +4 using its own ammunition only; 1d8+4 (+2 Fire) (strikes as a +4 Enchanted item)\nFiring Firetooth +4 using a &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toan%20Bolt\"&gt;Kuo-toan Bolt&lt;/a&gt;; 1d8+4 + 2d6 (+2 Fire) (strikes as a +1 Enchanted item)\nAlso, using certain enchanted ammunition with Firetooth can benefit the wielder who wishes to get the best &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; possible - for example firing a &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20%2B3\"&gt;Bolt +3&lt;/a&gt; at a target will improve the to hit roll by 3-points over just firing the crossbow's own ammuntion.\nUpgraded.\nFiretooth +5 is an enchanted light crossbow which does not require ammunition, but instead creates magical bolts of fire +5, which inflict 2 points of fire damage. The crossbow itself adds 1d8+5 points of damage, it has +7 THAC0\u00a0bonus (+5 from the crossbow, +2 from the bolts). The weight, speed factor and rate of fire are not improved.\nBugs.\nLaunchers that generate their own ammo (e.g. Gesen's Bow or the Firetooth crossbow) would override the projectile of loaded ammo, meaning it could interact with the target protections incorrectly.

There will be an exchange of dialogue options between you the Bhaalspawn and Firkraag. You might ask him why you were tricked, with \"\"So here I am. Why have you done this? Why have you forced this confrontation?\". He will reply:\nYou will note that there is a mage (&lt;a href=\"Conster\"&gt;Conster&lt;/a&gt;) standing nearby the dragon as well.\nThere are choices that must be made here, and the dialogue between you and the dragon will drive this. \nIf you are playing the evil path, you can agree to bring back &lt;a href=\"Garren%20Windspear\"&gt;Garren Windspear&lt;/a&gt;'s deed for the Windspear Hills land to Firkraag. If you do, then leave and pursue that quest.\nYou can confront Firkraag right now and refute all his statements that allow you to go free and pursue your life unmolested. You will be warned once more, and if you still persist in a a confrontation/fight, then you will face both Firkraag and Conster (a 16th level mage) in battle to the death. The developers have given ample opportunity to back off and not do this now. In case, perhaps you did this quest too early in the Saga, and really aren't experienced enough.\nYou may also tell Firkraag that you can't leave without Garren's child. After some repartee', Firkraag will send Conster back upstairs (he'll teleport), and Conster will await you in a test to the death. The dragon states that if you defeat the mage, you may take the key to the prison cell from his body and free the child. You can do this without turning Firkraag hostile, and pursue Conster, get the key, and free the prisoner. Then you may decide if you want to leave Firkraag be and never return, or perhaps return at a later time (such as if you are planning on fulfilling the Paladin Stronghold duties). Regardless, Firkraag will be in his hideout, if and when you come back. Do this before you transition to ToB for obvious reasons.\nInitial Hostilities: Once Firkraag becomes hostile, through dialogue or if attacked, there are only a few tics on the game clock before his assigned script will kick in, and some or all the sequential abilities and attacks will deploy over the course of the battle, depending how long he is alive and still able to function. These scripted actions are timed, and there is a progression to what the dragon does to kill you, disable you and to try and defend himself. The script is not responsive to the game difficulty setting, and Firkraag will not alter his actions based on what protections, spells, potions, equipment or buffs the party has. In that sense, he isn't particularly intelligent, or adaptable. See the Mod content section below for revisions that will mitigate this tactical limitation and make the dragon behave \"smarter\".\nHe opens with a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; (10 skins). The closest party member that can be detected will then be targeted with an AoE &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; (at caster level 23). Any party members in the area of effect will be subjected to this effect. Most likely , a party at this stage of the saga will have problems not getting their \"buffs\" dispelled. So beware, because in short order, probably in less than a round, a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Fear\"&gt;Dragon Fear&lt;/a&gt; aura will radiate from his center mass. After that a &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect, and then a &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Buffet\"&gt;Wing Buffet&lt;/a&gt; and or a Dragon Breath attack will occur. If the Wing Buffet is deployed it will disperse any cloud projectiles in the area, such as &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;. \nDepending how long the battle rages on, Firkraag has access to a number of other instant cast spells, innately scripted, such as Greater Malison, Haste (for himself), Hold Person and others listed in the Info Box. The longer he survives, the further down the spell repertoire he will go. And systematically like clockwork, the dragon will regularly deploy breath weapon, wing buffet and dragon fear auras, until death. There is no limit to these. \nIn general, Firkraag's biggest threats are his Dragon Breath and his ferocious damage dealing claws. He hits with such frequency and ease that armor class alone won't be likely enough protection. Protection from fire is a must, as taking a full-on dragon breath attack could be crippling or fatal, especially if a saving throw is failed.\nOther Facts and considerations.\nHis undroppable &lt;a href=\"DRAGRING.ITM\"&gt;dragon ability ring&lt;/a&gt; grants Firkraag invisibility detection by script, immunity to backstab, immunity to stun, sleep, silence, domination, charm, confusion, hold, slow, paralyze, entangle, web, grease, and wing buffet. \nFor the first in-game hour (5 turns, 300 real-time seconds) after entering the lair, he is also immune to many ranged weapons and ammunition. In the EE versions, he'll be immune to nine separate projectiles during this period. The immunity for certain projectiles can be removed, and if not, those attacks will fail to strike the dragon until the protection expires. Most of the favorite and available projectiles used by a party playing with EE will work against Firkraag. These nine projectiles are:\nIn earlier game editions there were additional projectile protections included, and some of those protections could be dispelled as follows.\nAchievements.\nRed Dragon Slayer.\nSlew the red dragon, Firkraag.\nMod content.\nMods.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises Firkraag in many ways. Especially if you install the \"Smarter Dragons\" component (which is responsive to the game difficulty selection). His SCS AI improves targeting and recognition of opponent's protections, which means he will fight smarter and not waste attacks on someone he cannot hit or damage. It will also influence his tactical options and attack methods. First, some mention of the dragon's stats and abilities. In most cases, all of the unmodded ones are still applicable:\nImmunities in addition to the unmodified dragon version:\nAs stated in the article above, Firkraag has access to several innate Dragon abilities. They are uninterruptible. A little bit more on what SCS does with the following:\nSpells: Firkraag is scripted to use the following spells, as determined by the AI's need, and your party's protections: &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; , Haste, &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Word\"&gt;Secret Word&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Silence\"&gt;Power Word, Silence&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Khelben%27s%20Warding%20Whip\"&gt;Khelben's Warding Whip&lt;/a&gt;. \nSCS looks for the party preparing for battle, simulating that Firkraag and Conster would be forewarned of an imminent hostile action. Any trap setting, creature or demon summoning or certain spells will possibly trigger a hostile reaction. I won't spoil the spells it looks for, but it includes many of the favorite party-wide buffs from wizards and clerics such as Haste and Draw upon Holy Might, Protection from Fire and many more. You just can't buff in the presence of Firkraag without triggering a response. Forget setting a trap near the dragon or within visual range. If you summon an elemental, or some cannon fodder from the wand of summoning of any kind, he will become hostile. Buffing and summoning must occur out of sight from the dragon. If a summoned creature moves into visual range that will also trigger a hostile reaction.\nFirkraag will deploy a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; if able, if the party summons an Elemental, Efreeti, Mordenkainen's Sword and similar - and banish them from the area.\nOn \"Insane\" difficulty, Firkraag regains use of Red Dragon Breath quicker than the unmodded game. Could potentially by percentage, have a 50% chance each round to blast with it. \nFor the greatest challenge, fight Firkraag and Conster at the same time, with SCS's smarter mage component. It is pretty tough for a typical party at this stage of the saga.\nWith the installation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, some of Firkraag's arcane memorized spells will be the SR version. The innate abilities mostly are not revised.\nNote that the &lt;a href=\"BuTcHeRy\"&gt;BuTcHeRy&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes some changes to the order of things that occur with Firkraag. When you first enter Firkraag's lair, there will be a cut scene, then an ambush is prepared for the party, that you must overcome before Firkraag and Conster are even present. This mod works with SCS like a champ.\n&lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod places special golem building components in Firkraag's lootable treasure, should he be defeated."}

At the end of the hallway is an unlocked door that leads to the monastery.\nWithin the cavern are four hidden spawn points. These generate different groups of enemies. For example, one produces a Hobgoblin group. Another spawns various Ogrillions. Near the pools of water can be encountered &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Mist\"&gt;Vampiric Mist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Death\"&gt;Crimson Death&lt;/a&gt; creatures. These spawn points will recur if the party exits this area and returns again at a later time.\nContainers.\nThere are two non-visible \"containers\" in the cavern. If found and examined, there is some available random and fixed loot to be found.\nGameplay.\nUpon entry from the Windspear Hills area on the surface, the party will be confronted by a mixed group of Hobgoblin guardians and &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20DigDag\"&gt;Chieftain DigDag&lt;/a&gt;. Some shouted dialogue ensues, and the hobgoblins attack. The Chieftan makes a strategic withdrawal to warn his master of your incursion into the complex.\nExploration of this cavern is an interesting interlude. Some beneficial loot can be obtained, as well as a clue about how something huge and terrible was actually able to physically enter this underground abandoned monastery. The enemies listed in the paragraph below are shown, and the usual numbers of each encountered.\nAt the North side of the cavern is a doorway leading to the actual abandoned monastery, although there is no Automap Note designated. It is guarded by a sinister &lt;a href=\"Ruhk%20Transmuter\"&gt;Ruhk Transmuter&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Kamikaze%20Kobold\"&gt;Kamikaze Kobold&lt;/a&gt; minions. Check the articles for details. \nThe party will need to work its way through several groups of opponents before clearing out the cavern, and of course, getting a free path to the doorway that leads to Firkraag's Maze area. This is the beginning of a classic \"dungeon crawl\" - enjoy the danger and excitement adventurer.\nBe careful with the various Mist creatures encountered. If not familiar with any of the abilities or powers of enemies found within, go the individual creature pages for a summary.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes some changes to select creature scripts, an example is the Rukh Transmuter and Vampiric Mists. The Smarter Mage Component boost the Rukh's spell casting choices and intelligent spell use, as well as the Hobgoblin spell casters. There may be some additional creatures such as Orc barbarians opponents as well. Chieftan DigDag gets a new script, a berserker kit, innate Enrage use, and weapon proficiencies assigned.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod places a component in one of the hidden containers in the cavern. A component that can be used in the construction of a particular variety of golem. Don't miss out and pick up this item. Its why you installed the mod after all."}

These areas are &lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Entrance\"&gt;Firkraag's Entrance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Maze\"&gt;Firkraag's Maze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;Firkraag's Hideout&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThis area is the debris-strewn, dilapidated monastery itself. It is a maze of passageways and rooms, all separated by doors, some of which are unlocked or locked, and some of which, when opened, are doors that lead to nowhere. There are even a couple of doors that require special keys to open them. There are hidden proximity triggers and spawn points throughout the area. Some spawn compositions are derived from the PC's XP level. See the \"Mod content\" section for additional mod revised spawn information.\nNote that a few spawn points that will trigger more than once, however this will occur only if the party leaves AR1202 and returns, an example being visiting Firkraag's Hideout, and then entering Firkraag's Maze again. These will be more orcs and some undead creatures (not vampires most likely) in the same places as encountered the first time.

Ogre, Orog and Hobgoblin minions commanded by Tazok near the Jail and in especially in Firkraag's Hideout, plus a slight plot twist. Probably at least 40+ new opponents are encountered. The &lt;a href=\"Tazok\"&gt;Tazok&lt;/a&gt; encounter is changed with this mod, although his loot will be the same."}

They are members of the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist\"&gt;Flaming Fist&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that serves as law enforcement for the Sword Coast. They are primarily encountered keeping watch although they are also found on the lookout for wanted criminals, preventing vagrants from sleeping on the streets, being summoned by those under duress, and unexpectedly appearing during the commission of crimes. One specific type of Flaming Fist Mercenary is able to cast some basic spells.\n&lt;br&gt;\nLocations.\nDuring the early exploration of the Sword Coast, prior to being able to enter the city of Baldur's Gate, there are several areas where Flaming Fist Mercenaries are encountered. One will appear in the town of &lt;a href=\"Beregost\"&gt;Beregost&lt;/a&gt; if any attempt is made to sleep within the town limits. Two more are encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Jovial%20Juggler\"&gt;Jovial Juggler&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Officer%20Vai\"&gt;Officer Vai&lt;/a&gt;'s contingent during &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Three\"&gt;Chapter Three&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouth of Beregost.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"South%20Beregost%20Road\"&gt;South Beregost Road&lt;/a&gt; area, about 3/4 of the way down the road, a troupe of three Flaming Fist Mercenaries will mistake &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; for a bandit group. When the leader challenges the party, the correct answer is 1. More dialog will ensue. Common sense will set you free. Otherwise, as he says, \"there will be trouble.\" Killing the three of them after they attack doesn't result in any reputation penalty and is a good way to obtain a set of &lt;a href=\"Plate%20Mail\"&gt;plate mail&lt;/a&gt; early.\n\"You there! You're under arrest for banditry and highway robbery! We know you're part of that bandit group who's been terrorizing the Coast Way. Give yourselves up, or there will be trouble.\"\nGibberling Mountains.\nA Flaming Fist Mercenary on the west side of the &lt;a href=\"Gibberling%20Mountains\"&gt;Gibberling Mountains&lt;/a&gt; area approaches as soon as a member of the party comes within sight. He is looking for &lt;a href=\"Samuel\"&gt;Samuel&lt;/a&gt;, a deserter from the Flaming Fist. This soldier is the only one who carries 100 .\n\"\"Hold! I am a member of the Flaming Fist, and require that you identify yourselves.\"\nResults:\nPeldvale.\nShortly after you meet &lt;a href=\"Viconia\"&gt;Viconia&lt;/a&gt; in the northwestern corner of the &lt;a href=\"Peldvale\"&gt;Peldvale&lt;/a&gt; area, a Flaming Fist Mercenary will appear. If Gorion's Ward chooses to defend Viconia, this is another one of the rare opportunities to kill a Flaming Fist soldier without penalty. This soldier is a level 4 &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Cleric\"&gt;Fighter / Cleric&lt;/a&gt; and is capable of casting some basic priest spells so beware. The result is 250 &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; for the kill and his gear. For what it's worth, it appears that Viconia is probably telling the truth; that the Flaming Fist wants her dead simply because she is &lt;a href=\"drow\"&gt;drow&lt;/a&gt;.\nMercenary: \"Step aside travelers, I am a member of the Flaming Fist. The woman you are harboring is wanted for murder of the foulest sort. She is a dark elf; it should be obvious that she is evil.\"\nViconia: \"They lie. I've done nothing wrong.\"\nWyrm's Crossing.\nAttempting to cross the bridge to Baldur's Gate in the &lt;a href=\"Wyrm%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Wyrm's Crossing&lt;/a&gt; area prior to &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Five\"&gt;Chapter Five&lt;/a&gt;, the party will encounter a Flaming Fist Mercenary near the draw bridge. He'll inform the party that entrance to the city is forbidden at this time due to recent bandit activity.\n&lt;br&gt;\nOnce the bridge is opened in Chapter Five, a different Mercenary will approach the party on sight and inform them of an entrance tax to enter the city and ask them for their point of origin.\n\"The entrance tax is 6 gold pieces for each party of travelers. Please announce your point of origin.\"\nThe Mercenary will collect the tax and reply to any of these responses by informing them that his &lt;a href=\"Scar\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; wishes to speak with them.\nBaldur's Gate.\nWithin the city of Baldur's Gate, there are several instances where Flaming Fist Mercenaries will be encountered.\n\"Sleeping on the Streets:\".\nOne particular Flaming Fist Mercenary likes to wake up a tired party that tried to find some sleep on a city's streets.\n\"Flaming Fist HQ:\".\nAn obvious place to encounter Flaming Fist Mercenaries is the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist%20Headquarters\"&gt;Flaming Fist Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;southwest district&lt;/a&gt; of the city. One Mercenary is stationed on the ground floor near the stairs to the second floor. If spoken to before performing a few side quests for Commander Scar, he'll inform the party that &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Eltan\"&gt;Duke Eltan&lt;/a&gt; is not available and to go find Scar.\n&lt;br&gt;\nOnce the Scar side quests are completed he informs the party that Duke Eltan is upstairs.\nA second Flaming Fist Mercenary is found in the basement. Attempted dialogue is comprised of a couple of innocuous responses. However, opening the locked chest in his presence will alert three &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist%20Enforcer%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;Flaming Fist Enforcers&lt;/a&gt; and he will join the fight if hostilities breakout.\nFour Mercenaries are present during the interrogation cut-scene with &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Dosan\"&gt;Angelo&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Ducal Palace:\".\nOnce entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Ducal%20Palace\"&gt;Ducal Palace&lt;/a&gt; has been secured during &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Seven\"&gt;Chapter Seven&lt;/a&gt;, Flaming Fist Mercenaries are found in several different locations within the palace.\n\"Hall of Wonders:\".\nThree Flaming Fist Mercenaries are roaming the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Wonders\"&gt;Hall of Wonders&lt;/a&gt; keeping watch. If certain dialogue is followed three more will be summoned by &lt;a href=\"Brathlen\"&gt;Brathlen&lt;/a&gt;. If Gorion's Ward threatens &lt;a href=\"Alora\"&gt;Alora&lt;/a&gt;, she will summon two Mercenaries that are enemies from the get go.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Northeast Baldur's Gate:\".\nOne Flaming Fist Mercenary will appear during the first test of the &lt;a href=\"Narlen%27s%20Heist\"&gt;Narlen's Heist&lt;/a&gt; side quest. Besides the undroppable &lt;a href=\"UNIFLAM.ITM\"&gt;cloak&lt;/a&gt;, this Mercenary is also equipped with an undroppable &lt;a href=\"GOBOOM2.itm\"&gt;amulate&lt;/a&gt;. "}

They are hostile to you and are allied with Azamantes. You will also encounter them in &lt;a href=\"Yaga-Shura%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Yaga-Shura's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, but with a different creature file. The InfoBox shows the Watcher's Keep version.\nDifferences between the Watcher's Keep and Yaga Shura's Lair Flaming Skulls:\nHUSKU01.CRE Flaming Skull is worth 9,000 XP. It now has 127% Fire resistance (will be healed by Fire damage). This creature has ten memorized &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Bolt\"&gt;Fire Bolt&lt;/a&gt; attacks in the innate ability memory field. All other abilities are the same, as well as the AI script.\nGameplay.\nThese disembodied skull forms move extremely rapidly and are probably one of the fastest movers in the game.\nThey can innately &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough they appear to be flying above the party, they can be engaged in melee if one can get close enough. \nThese skulls will dart and maneuver around the map and mostly attack at range with spells - in fact, they will attempt to move away from any enemies that are within a certain distance. \nThe creature has two Innate ability attacks, and five fire based Wizard Spells it can cast. The creature does not run out of spells. \nThe Skulls are racially a Lich, and have basic Undead Immunities as provided by the undroppable Ring item &lt;a href=\"RING95.ITM\"&gt;RING95.ITM&lt;/a&gt;. See the link for immunities provided.\nIn addition to those immunities, the skull is completely fire immune with 100% &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance. However, it is very vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Cold%20damage\"&gt;Cold damage&lt;/a&gt;, taking extra damage from that effect. The skull is also partially protected from some &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt;, but not &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe skull will periodically launch fire-based spells at the nearest creature it can detect. This is somewhat randomized by the script. It will also apply and then after a set period reapply a &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; upon itself.\nTheir biggest threat will be the &lt;a href=\"Incendiary%20Cloud\"&gt;Incendiary Cloud&lt;/a&gt; which is randomly cast, and their dying explosion blast. \nIn an unmodified game these skulls are more of a nuisance than an actual primary danger to the party, unless for some reason you are unable to protect your party from fire damage.\nFrom a protection standpoint, a party member can be almost completely protected from the Faming Skull's spells with only a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey can also be slain via instant death effects from weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Disruption\"&gt;Mace of Disruption&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Azuredge\"&gt;Azuredge&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee the info box for other special abilities.\nExploding death throe ability.\nUpon death, the Flaming Skull automatically force launches its \"Skull Explode\" death throe. The ability blasts a \"White fireball\" graphic animation dealing 20d6 &lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;Magical damage&lt;/a&gt; centered on the skull. A saving throw vs. Spells will halve the damage. It can be blocked by magic resistance and a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. \nBugs.\nThe Flaming Skull's regeneration ability timing mode is set as permanent, but that setting requires a duration to work, and it has no duration, and therefore it doesn't operate correctly. This is an issue throughout the game in several other creatures as well. This issue is included in &lt;a href=\"The%20Enhanced%20Edition%20Fixpack%20%28EEFP%29\"&gt;The Enhanced Edition Fixpack (EEFP)&lt;/a&gt; and is already identified to Beamdog for possible fixing in the future.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod changes some aspects of the Flaming Skull creature - unless noted below, all other stats and immunizes are the same as the unmodified creature.

Even the &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; ability won't allow their use.\nThe \"skull projectiles\" must be aimed and fired at a single target. When they strike a target the \"flasher\" ammunition actually exposes the target to a potential &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; effect lasting 12 seconds.\nThe projectile (No. 240) only affects enemies and not the party, and that is important because the projectile has a small area of effect when a successful hit is made. Enemy creatures in close proximity may also get exposed to the missile damage and flash stun effect. The AoE is about five game feet in all directions from the target creature.\nThose creatures exposed to the flash stun must make a &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; versus Spell or be stunned for 2 rounds. While stunned they'll be immobile and are regarded as &lt;a href=\"Helpless\"&gt;Helpless&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe on-screen combat log message will display a text string \"Stunned\" for each creature that fails the saving throw. Additionally, a lighting effect and a color fade animation effect will render over the those who failed the save. No sound effect is included in the flashers burst.\nThe flasher ammunition stun-burst powder is non-magical and bypasses &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; and has 0 (zero) &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt;, so it will ignore spell protections like &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;. The Stun effect is also not subject to &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effects, although it only lasts a short time.\nThis ammunition is designed as a magical +1 &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20item\"&gt;Enchanted item&lt;/a&gt; for the purposes of what it can strike."}
