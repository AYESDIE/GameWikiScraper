The Fledglings are now level 8/8 Fighter/Thief class. Their dexterity is raised to 19 and also have a 16 constitution. This means they have an improved Armor Class and 83 Hit Points.

A steel plug blocks the flow of an underground river. If the plug were released, the water would flood the entire mine.

He also mentions that the fourth level is a \"secret\" level, something that is left out of the Journal entry.\n\"A miner told us that the leader of the mine lives on the fourth level of the mine.\"\nDeserting Guard.\nThe guard at 1925.940 on the second level offers information if you will spare his life.\n\"An Iron Throne guard told us that we could find Davaeorn on the fourth floor of the Cloakwood mine.\"\nYeslick Orothiar.\nIt is unsurprising that the last surviving dwarf of the clan that built the mine should have quite a lot to say about freeing his ancestral home from the Iron Throne.\n\"The dwarf Yeslick has told us a great deal about the Cloakwood mine. He and his clan used to work in the mine, but they dug into an underground river. In the ensuing flood, most of Yeslick's clan died.

The journal entry redundantly titled Flooding the Cloakwood Mine (\"I have a way ...\") is copied from Chapter Four Quests to a new Chapter 5 Quest, and then the quest is closed with one of two entries depending on whether or not you gave &lt;a href=\"Rill\"&gt;Rill&lt;/a&gt; 100 to evacuate the slaves.\n\"I have flooded the Iron Throne mine in Cloakwood.

Once that has been done, the Forest of Tethir can be selected as a valid travel destination on the &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;World Map&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nVisiting this area is optional by the party during chapter 6. There will not be a quest reason to be here in the unmodified game until after the party has delivered the &lt;a href=\"Rhynn%20Lanthorn\"&gt;Rhynn Lanthorn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Elhan\"&gt;Elhan&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"The%20Elven%20City%20Requires%20My%20Aid\"&gt;The Elven City Requires My Aid&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nHowever, the player can direct the party to this location before that time if desired. There is some freelance adventuring, exploring and a small side quest available in the forest. Visiting the area early won't spoil or harm any later quests, so go ahead and do it if you want to. \nGameplay walkthrough.\nThe Forest.\nThe party will enter the map on the north edge of the area.\nThe Forest is much denser than the &lt;a href=\"North%20Forest%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;North Forest&lt;/a&gt; area. Huge ancient trees grow here, towering well over a hundred feet tall. The canopy of foliage blocks all but limited speckled sunlight on the forest floor. Still ponds of silent water abound. This forest is very old indeed.\nVarious wildlife is present in the forest. Some will be predatory and hostile, as well as many passive birds, moose, deer, rabbit and squirrel animals.\nWhen ready, begin exploring. As the party maneuvers across the spongy and damp forest floor, pressing through bramble and thick ferns - they will come upon gigantic fallen trees with vast trunks. If the party can clamber up some side branches, they can use the trees as a pathway to navigate past the undergrowth and move about the area.\nHostile encounters in the Forest.\nThroughout the area there are several spawn zones that will generate hostile creatures. They may be natural creatures such as a stalking &lt;a href=\"Panther\"&gt;Panther&lt;/a&gt;, a group of armed &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; bowmen and foot soldiers, horrible mist creatures of various types, perhaps even a &lt;a href=\"Wolfwere\"&gt;Wolfwere&lt;/a&gt; pack or a &lt;a href=\"Yuan-ti\"&gt;Yuan-ti&lt;/a&gt; war party. Be ever on the lookout for these attackers.\nThe time of day/night influences the probability and type of spawns generated. \nThe Cabin.\nOn the western side of the map (see the Automap marker on the players \"World Map\" tab) is a location marked \"Cabin\". Descending on a huge branch will lead down to a slightly cleared area with a cabin structure. You'll probably spot a lone male elf dressed in leather armor and a hood - when within a specific distance the familiar face of &lt;a href=\"Coran\"&gt;Coran&lt;/a&gt; from Baldur's Gate will address the party, he'll say:\nA back-and-forth dialogue will continue here. In essence, Coran needs help rescuing &lt;a href=\"Safana\"&gt;Safana&lt;/a&gt; from some wolfweres that have captured her. Coran isn't strong enough to do it alone, and requests the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;. The player can refuse, or agree. If the party says no, Coran says if you change your mind he'll be heading over to the Wolfwere Camp location to see about attempting a rescue. If the party agrees he'll be pleased and will meet the party at the camp. The player's Journal registers the &lt;a href=\"Coran%20and%20the%20Wolfweres\"&gt;Coran and the Wolfweres&lt;/a&gt; side quest.\nCoran then departs for the Wolfwere Camp. Meet him there when you are ready to do so (there is no time limit).\nThe Cave.\nOn the eastern and slightly south side of the map is an Automap Marker on the player's world map marked as \"Cave\".\nTo investigate this, find the door on a hillside, open it and enter within.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Tethir%20Cave\"&gt;Forest of Tethir Cave&lt;/a&gt; for more details. What's inside?\nReturn to the Forest.\nOnce the party has returned the &lt;a href=\"Rhynn%20Lanthorn\"&gt;Rhynn Lanthorn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Elhan\"&gt;Elhan&lt;/a&gt; - the elven commander transports the party back to the forest. The lanthorn buzzes with power and penetrates the illusionary ward placed by &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the hidden entrance to &lt;a href=\"Suldanessellar\"&gt;Suldanessellar&lt;/a&gt;.\nElhan enters the gateway and asks the party to follow when they are ready.\nIf the player wishes to finish any tasks in chapter 6, go ahead and do that now, before transitioning through the gate and beginning &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%207\"&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt;. \nTrivia.\nLooks like the developers went with the dwarven spelling on the World Map, as it's titled \"Forest of Tethyr\" - according to the Forgotten Realms Wiki, the correct spelling for the forest is the elvish spelling \"Tethir\", named after an elvish hero.\nMod content.\nMods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises the AI scripts for most creatures on the map for smarter tactical behavior. The Yuan-ti mage is a potent spell caster. Various mist creatures will have new innate abilities, such as the Mist Horror. The spell casting Wyvern cultist has a large repertoire of magic.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/RoxanneSHS/LensHunt\"&gt;The Broken Lanthorn&lt;/a&gt; mod will require the party to find another missing lens piece for the &lt;a href=\"Rhynn%20Lanthorn\"&gt;Rhynn Lanthorn&lt;/a&gt; in this area."}

This article first describes the effect as part of a series on status effects, and goes on to detail the bundle itself in &lt;a href=\"%23Free%20Action%20bundle\"&gt;its own section&lt;/a&gt;, down the page.\nWhen game descriptions refer to \"Free Action\", they never talk about the single Free action effect, always the bundle of many effects.\nMechanics.\nNever used alone, always with other effects, the Free action effect is on its own a cure of sorts: When applied to a creature, it clears some negative arrangements of the \"Movement rate bonus\" effect, potentially restoring its movement speed to normal if it had been lowered.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;s, there is virtually no arrangement where the Free action effect \"alone\" would be useful, as the target is either affected by worse movement-related ailments at the same time, or the \"Movement rate bonus\" inflicted is no longer using one of the negative arrangements cleared by the Free action effect.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"original%20edition\"&gt;original edition&lt;/a&gt;s, it alone would be enough to restore movement of a creature affected by &lt;a href=\"Grease\"&gt;Grease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plant%20Growth\"&gt;Plant Growth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Spin\"&gt;Defensive Spin&lt;/a&gt; and wild surges #&lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge%2311\"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge%2369\"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; \"Entangle(d)\", as well as the attacks of &lt;a href=\"Nyalee\"&gt;Nyalee&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Shambling%20Mound%20%28Forest%20of%20Mir%29\"&gt;Shambling Mound&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFree Action bundle.\nThough not perfectly consistent from spell to item, this bundle of many effects labeled \"Free Action\" by the game can be expected to first cure any pre-existing &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Held\"&gt;Hold creature&lt;/a&gt; effect, as well as sluggishness born from causes other than the &lt;a href=\"Slow%20effect\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;Disease&lt;/a&gt; effects.

In some game variants it may grant immunity to the Stun effect as well.\nParty members should expect to receive an \u00a0icon on their portrait when game descriptions say they will be affected by \"Free Action\".\nIt is possible to benefit from both haste and free action if the Haste effect is applied \"before\" the Free Action bundle of effects, because the bundle does not cure a pre-existing haste on arrival, it only prevents it from being applied for as long as the bundle's immunities are active.\u00a0For example, a mage could cast &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0first on a fighter, who would then and only then equip &lt;a href=\"Edventar%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Edventar's Gift&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to benefit from both effects.\u00a0That wouldn't work if the fighter wore the ring from the start.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"klatu%20Tweaks%20and%20Fixes\"&gt;klatu Tweaks and Fixes&lt;/a&gt; makes the Free Action feature consistent across the various items and spells, and makes sure hasting is always possible."}

There may be wandering &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt; creatures moving about the platform or examining everything with their multiple eyes.\nA richly dressed drow female, with the markings of a Priestess of Lolth strolls and stares at various human slaves in their pens. She seems pensive.\nAn adamantine full plate mail clad male drow also observes the platform. He holds a lance in one hand, and in the other is a scroll or ledger, which he glances at, and sometimes makes markings with his stylus, perhaps doing some bookkeeping.\nHuman figures in surfacer clothing can be seen within the various pens. They seem to be sorted by age.\nThe party must decide if they wish to engage any of these people. None will address the party unless initiated by the player. There is no requirement to speak with anyone, and the party is free to just look and move on to something else in the city. It is entirely optional to dig further into these characters.\nChoices.\nThe Priestess of Lolth.\nYou may address the Priestess who is in this area if you dare. She has no bearing on the slaves or their fate. Alternatively, the party can just leave the priestess to her own brooding thoughts. She certainly has no interest in the party.\nAddress the Slaves.\nThere are five pens on the platform. Each pen has one or more humans locked within, and they appear to be confined in their guilded cages and on display to view at the same time.\nIn one pen is a lone male dressed in Nobleman attire (DASLAVE6), although a bit worse for wear. If you address the nobleman, he may say:\n\"\"My... these are my people whom you've imprisoned here. I demand you free us!\"\nIn another pen is a lone woman dressed in peasant attire (DASLAVE5), dirty and disheveled. She will vehemently glare at the party and hiss: \n\"Get away from me! Get away from me, you horrible creatures!\"\nAnother pen has two adults within. The first is a woman who appears to wear the trappings of a Cleric (DASLAVE2), she will say: \n\"Ilmater, I pray to you... send mercy to your faithful servant... aid her and the poor souls that are with her. I beg of you...\"\nThe other captive is a male Halfling (DASLAVE7) who tearfully exclaims:\n\"My... my entire family... why? *sob* Why?\"\nYet another pen holds a boy and a girl (DASLAVE3 and 4)\nThe Slave Girl says: \"Where's my mommy? Can I see my mommy? I miss her...\"\nThe Slave Boys begs: \"It... it's one of the dark people! *sob* Pl-please don't hurt me!\"\"\nThe last pen holds a lone male, the Slave Leader. His first reply will be a fiery insult. Much more dialogue is available later if you are able to purchase the slaves. This will only be permissible after having contact with &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt; and making a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Drow%20Slave%20Trader\"&gt;Drow Slave Trader&lt;/a&gt;.\nAddress the Slave Trader.\nThe Drow Slave Trader will engage in conversation with the party spokesperson if he is contacted. Questions may be asked about the slaves, and he'll answer them in typical drow fashion.\nIf the drow thinks the curiosity is getting tedious, he may say:\"\n\"\"Have you actual business with me, &lt;MALEFEMALE&gt;, or do you simply enjoy the fetid aroma of penned surfacers? I am late watering the dogs, and you are keeping me from it.\"\nFor instance, if asked what kind of slaves are being sold, he'll reply:\n\"\"Pfeh. Humans, mostly. Surfacers from a recent raid by the young. All of the passable ones have already been purchased or selected by the Handmaidens.\"\nIf the party makes any comments or replies that suggest they are outraged by the fact that the slaves and their ultimate fate is horrifying or similar, the Slave trader will give an earful back, bewildered by the attitude of you, fellow drow - such as:\n\"Eh? What is so outrageous about it? These are lesser beings, nothing more. Roth\u00e9 for the slaughter, if we so desire. What would make you think otherwise?\"\nIf the party inquires about buying the slaves, and haven't yet been summoned for an audience with the Matron Mother yet, he'll say:\n\"Why? Are you thinking that you require slaves for yourself? You are associated with no noble House that I know of. Return if a matron mother sends you.\"\"\nLater, after the party has been summoned to see the &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother&lt;/a&gt;, the party will be considered favored by House Despana, and the party may return to buy the slaves. See the Slave Trader again. After some more back and forth about what you may be using the slaves, and whether they may be required to work outside the city, the party can basically just purchase the slaves (presumably as an offering to Lolth as food for the Spider Pits), or to conduct work in the Underdark. \nIf the party makes it clear they are interested in buying, and how much, the Slave trader asks: \n\"\"Well, it depends on what House Despana needs them for. If you need them to work outside of the city, you might want them armed, but it costs a little extra.\"\nOr if the party makes it clear that weapons won't be needed:\n\"Then use them for sport outside of the city or send them to the temple as an offering. The Dark Mother's spiders are always hungry.\"\"\nNow the party must agree on a price, which can be as expensive as 2,000 Gold. This can be reduced with certain dialogue choices, depending on what the party wished to do with slaves.\nIf the party goes with this plan, the the Slave Trader will release the humans, provide them weapons and say:\n\"Excellent. You are doing me a favor, taking these filthy humans. I'll have to go and get their equipment, but I shall bring them out of their cages first. Next he'll comment:\n\"While I am gone, you may wish to leave your instructions with them. I'll have them armed and sent where you wish. Lolth's favor on you, &lt;MALEFEMALE&gt;.\"\nAddress the Slaves you have freed.\nNow, the Slave Leader will speak with you and ask what is to become of them, as you are their new owner. There are options of what you can say. You can be somewhat kind and benevolent, in tone, and tell them to go to the city gates and make their way to freedom. You can be somewhat uncaring, and tell them to fend for themselves, or you can even be particularly cruel and tell them to start running, as they will be used for target practice.\nThe slave leader will have few more closing remarks, and then the slaves will depart. During this phase certain party companions will have commentary, such as Edwin, Valygar, Jaheria and Nalia. Many popular NPC companion mods also have interjections, such as Xan and &lt;a href=\"Afaaq%20the%20Djinni%20Companion\"&gt;Afaaq the Djinni Companion&lt;/a&gt;.\nDepending on what the party did with their dialogue, they could gain 7,500 quest experience and +1 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt;."}

These effects include charm, confusion, domination, entangle, feeblemindedness, hold, paralysis, petrification, sleep, slow, stun, and web. This spell will also cancel the effects of the spell Maze and return any characters trapped in the labyrinth of planes. If it is cast in an area where a creature was sealed with an Imprisonment spell, it will instantly free him and he will reappear exactly where he was standing when he was imprisoned."}

The first is to confront &lt;a href=\"Perth%20the%20Adept\"&gt;Perth the Adept&lt;/a&gt;, a local representative of the &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizards&lt;/a&gt; and obtain the &lt;a href=\"Wardstone%20for%20Asylum\"&gt;Asylum Wardstone&lt;/a&gt; that he possesses. The other way is to speak to Captain Desharik and convince him that you are someone who needs to be interred into the asylum due to madness or another mental affliction.\nDesharik's Estate is located in the extreme northwest of Brynnlaw, and is most prominent structure. To get inside to speak with Desharik, the player must get the &lt;a href=\"Pirate%20Door%20Guard\"&gt;Pirate Door Guard&lt;/a&gt; to allow entry. There are three ways to do this: \nConvincing Desharik to send you to the asylum is more difficult than one may think. He's not eager to send anyone there, and he's nervous about upsetting the Cowled Wizards, and possibly a bit paranoid. You have three options to convince him that the party belongs there (there is a fourth option in the Enhanced Edition):\nIf none of your attempts work, Desharik will close off any chance of letting you into the Asylum. Your only method to get within now is to see about contacting the Brynnlaw Cowled Wizard representative and seek a solution to enter the asylum, &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nContainers and loot within the Estate.\nDesharik's bedroom includes four containers, some &lt;a href=\"Find%20Traps%20%28skill%29\"&gt;trapped&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Open%20Locks\"&gt;locked&lt;/a&gt;, with several &lt;a href=\"potions%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;potions of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Piece\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapon\"&gt;+2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20%2B2\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20%2B2\"&gt;bolts&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Light%20Crossbow%20%2B1\"&gt;Light Crossbow +1&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Longbow%20%2B2\"&gt;Longbow +2&lt;/a&gt;; he personally wears &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Leather%20Armor%20%2B1\"&gt;Studded Leather Armor +1&lt;/a&gt; and dual-wields &lt;a href=\"Scimitar%20%2B1\"&gt;+1 scimitars&lt;/a&gt; in either hand.\nAfter Spellhold/Escaping Brynnlaw.\nIf the party opts to trust &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; after making &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; flee from &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;, they will learn that Desharik has confiscated Saemon's ship, so he needs them to steal a signal horn from Desharik's mistress &lt;a href=\"Cayia\"&gt;Cayia&lt;/a&gt; so they can escape Brynnlaw on his ship. If Desharik was not killed before the party entered the asylum, he will appear as the party prepares to set sail and will most likely lead to a final confrontation of Desharik and loyal pirates vs. Saemon (and your party). Kill Desharik (after his dialogue is finished) before defeating his accompanying pirates - doing so allows you to loot his possessions and get some additional XP. See also the &lt;a href=\"Leaving%20the%20island\"&gt;Leaving the island&lt;/a&gt; page for this.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod assigns a new default SCS Fighter AI to Desharik, as well as 5 pips in scimitar weapon proficiency and 3 pips in two weapon fighting style. He'll now get 5 APR with his dual wielding scimitar attacks, 4 with the main hand and 1 with the off-hand."}

Alternatively, you can reject the order and fight Szass Tam, but this will cause you to be prematurely ejected from Thay.\nIf your party agreed with Szass Tam, you could use local merchants (like in ) to buy some magical items, like &lt;a href=\"Kazrah%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Kazrah's Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Gift of Peace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buckler%20%2B3\"&gt;Buckler +3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Regeneration\"&gt;Ring of Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Lich\"&gt;Cloak of the Lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nSzass Tam will teleport the party into the &lt;a href=\"Neera%20-%20Thayan%20Estate\"&gt;Vicross' Estate&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0 Vicross is in the center room with several powerful guards.\u00a0Once they are dead, ring the Bell of Summoning and Szass Tam will teleport in.\u00a0After some dialogue, he attacks.\u00a0Once his health is low enough, he'll give up and offer to return you to Tethyr.\u00a0If you insist on continuing the fight, his health becomes full again and must once again deplete it before he forcibly returns the party to Thethyr via teleportation magic.\nEither way, returning to Tethyr after Vicross is dead triggers a dialogue with Neera and the end of the quest. Completion of the quest grants 20,000 XP to all characters. Successfully defeating Szass a second time grants an additional 15,000 XP to all party members and the unique &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Whips\"&gt;Wand of Whips&lt;/a&gt;.\nWARNING: Defeating Szass too quickly can prevent the quest from finishing. You'll still be sent back to Tethyr, but the dialogue to end the quest may not initiate, therefore the quest won't be completed properly, and no experience point reward will be had."}

The natural inclination would be to use it to detect potential threats, but there are many false positives using this method. There are numerous, helpful evil characters and many hostile ones of neutral alignment. Making decisions based purely on Detect Evil's results can be dangerous for the player.

The caster will also be made aware of magically resistant creatures, whether they are evil-aligned or not. It is best used on a new, unexplored map so the player can anticipate the size and power of random encounters.

Once, long ago, this was a place of darkness and vile creatures that spilled into this world from the blackness. Amaunator invaded this place, brought his light to it and drove away the shadows! The Yellow God set up temples here... and wards to keep the darkness forever at bay. Once there were priests who shouted his names to the heavens and kept the wards strong! But our Amaunator has lost his power over the ages. The Keeper of the Sun is no longer worshiped as he once was... and the wards began to weaken.\"\n\"Amuana was born to our people a child prophetess... the Child of Light who would fight against the darkness that was once more beginning to spill into these lands. But it was too late... too late. The wards were destroyed, and the shadows crept over the temples and murdered us all. A &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Lord\"&gt;Shade Lord&lt;/a&gt; now rules, here, and even a vile &lt;a href=\"Thaxll%27ssillyia\"&gt;Shadow Dragon&lt;/a&gt; stalks these halls. Amuana was overwhelmed by the Shade Lord. We could... could not protect her as he took her body and... threw her bones to his dark wolves... They gnaw on her remains, good &lt;MAN/WOMAN&gt;... the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Wolf\"&gt;shadow wolves&lt;/a&gt; defile her with their teeth and saliva. We... we failed our task.\"\"\n\"Please, I beg of you... retrieve Amuana's bones from the wolves... save her from the contempt of the Shade Lord!

And we cannot call her without her bones! You will have to pass the dread guardian, the Shadow Dragon... and without the aid of Amuana, how will you do this? Please, we beg you! Help us! Help Amuana!\"\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Amuana%27s%20Bones\"&gt;Amuana's Bones&lt;/a&gt; are brought to them, the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Amuana\"&gt;Amuana&lt;/a&gt; appears.\n\"My bones have been retrieved from the jaws of the shadow wolves. I am grateful to you. Badon and Dettseh have been relieved of their duty and crossed over... I will join them soon. I pray that you are in this place to strike a blow against the darkness that has engulfed it, a darkness that I had not power enough to defeat when I was among the living. But I have some power. I have power enough to elude the attention of their guardians, if necessary, and I can give this to you. A wardstone... carry it and the dreaded Shadow Dragon will not notice your passing. Do not attack the beast or otherwise draw its attention, and you shall be safe. Safe enough, at least, to stand against that foul Shade Lord that has spread his hand over my once-glorious temple. I... will go, now, to rejoin my Keeper of the Eternal Sun. I owe my freedom to you, and will always be thankful. Live, my friends... live long and live well. May the Light be forever victorious.\"\nAfterwards, the party receives , the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dragon%20Wardstone\"&gt;Shadow Dragon Wardstone&lt;/a&gt;, and the player's Journal is updated under \"Investigate the deaths in the Umar Hills.\" \"After the disappearance of the two spirits, Amuana appeared and rewarded me with a wardstone that she claims will render whoever holds it and all with them invisible to the Shade Lord's guardian...which she says to be a Shadow Dragon. She warned me to be careful not to drop the stone or attack the dragon and I would be safe, then thanked me and disappeared.\""}

It has no Mage spells. It is equipped with different undroppable items to change its abilities and immunities. It can see invisible creatures and can't be backstabbed. It now has a casting time modifier with a +10-speed bonus, and spells will cast almost instantly. It has a movement modifier bonus of +4. The Mace has no dispelling function. It has a hidden helmet that gives it a Wings Animation and prevents critical hits. The creature gets a revised and smarter AI, and occasionally uses Divine Spells while engaged in melee or if enemies are present, automatically. The player can still control the Deva to command his spell casting as desired. As a Cleric, the Deva may be directed to Turn Undead using its appropriate button control. \nThe Deva gets a different animation than the unmodded game, looking more like a humanoid angel with silver-blue wings, and not the same as a Solar.

The devil's army is well organized and disciplined, but demons have the numeric superiority.\nThey live in society strictly based on hierarchy. Promotion through the ranks is based on corruption of mortal souls or fighting in the Blood War. Therefore human souls are the main currency in the devil's society. Corrupted souls are tortured to wring out magical energy from the them. Once every single drop is wrung out, the soul is reborn as a lemure, a new member of infernal society.\nIn terms of the game's identifiers for \"Devils\", there is no Race or Class assigned as such. They are typically assigned a Race of \"Demonic\" and Class as \"Imp\". Special spell or weapons that provide to hit modifiers or bonuses against \"Demons\" also work against \"Devils\".\nMortality.\nDevils can be &lt;a href=\"Gate\"&gt;gated&lt;/a&gt; on the mortal plane. While on &lt;a href=\"Toril\"&gt;Toril&lt;/a&gt;, they cannot truly die, but their souls get sent back to the Nine Hells where their bodies take 99 years to recover. During this period the fallen devil usually gets demoted.\nIn contrast, devils slain in the Nine Hells are gone forever."}

The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. If the recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed creature will carry them out as quickly as possible.\nIf the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm spell is broken.

Two doors can be used to enter the chamber, and one is locked.\nThe beholder will not hesitate very long before attacking. It does this by using \"force cast\" spells, meaning near instant deployment and no chance of spell interruption. If a valid targeted enemy is detected it will usually begin with a &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt;, and if there are multiple opponents seen by the beholder it looks at the second nearest, and even third nearest target to determine which one it aims the spell at. \nThis creature will selectively launch &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hands\"&gt;Burning Hands&lt;/a&gt; and use one beholder eye ray, the &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; beam. It can get off another &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; during the battle as well, and it might be applied on top of an existing one. The AI has a safeguard targeting logic to try and avoid damaging itself with the Ice Storm, but it might not work, and it could end up in its own Area of Effect.\nThe beholder is scripted to recognize Mage class opponents and reserves attacking those with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll of the beholders magic attacks are scripted and timed, and it doesn't run out of spells. They will stop when the creature is disabled or destroyed.\nThe creature has some unique physical damage resistances that most beholders don't possess - and it also has a slight &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; rating.\nMod content.\nIf the player has installed the &lt;a href=\"Ooze%27s%20Lounge\"&gt;Ooze's Lounge&lt;/a&gt; mod, then the Director's corpse will provide an item that will further a side quest introduced by that mod, involving the Beholder merchant and its sidekick immature small beholder.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a several changes to this Director. The beholder has a brighter tint to make it appear different than an ordinary beholder. The creature's immunities are standardized with SCS beholders, so it is immune to all movement and hold type spell effects and is under &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action\"&gt;Free Action&lt;/a&gt;. It is protected from &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;.\nSCS revised the AI script for the Director. The mod has melded the original Director's use of force cast spells with several other uses of Beholder eye ray attacks. Instead of &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; (which can harm itself), it uses an innate spell version of &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than casting &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hands\"&gt;Burning Hands&lt;/a&gt;, the beholder uses the Beholder \"Burning Ray\" eye beam. \nThe creature will be firing an Eye beam called \"Enervation\", which is basically a &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; 7 Death Ray, save vs. Death or be killed, magic resistance can block it. \nThere is a beholder &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; eye beam used, and force cast &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nAs all SCS beholders have, the creature has permanent Alacrity, allowing multiple eye beams/spells to be launched (2-3 per round) with no cool down period.

See below:\nDispel Magic\nLevel: 3\nSchool: Abjuration\nSphere: All\nRange: Long\nDuration: Instant\nCasting Time: 3\nArea of Effect: 20\u2019 radius\nSaving Throw: Special\nDispel Magic removes magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.\nThe chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the magic he is trying to dispel, his chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic he attempts to dispel, his chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; implements the Dispel Magic Fix: This component fixes the chance to dispel magic to match the spell's description (so there is at least a marginal chance of dispelling effects of a higher-level mage) and corrects conceptual problems caused by the automatic dispelling of all magically created items. If installed, there will always be at at least a 1% chance that dispel magic will work, regardless of the opposing caster level."}

These magicians have an extended lifespan. Diya is part of Hexxat's second quest, to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20the%20Unproved\"&gt;Shroud of the Unproved&lt;/a&gt; for her master \"L\" (Larloch). \nGame Play.\nEach magician has some dialogue, which will begin when Hexxat enters the library, and if she is visible. Diya al-Hafiz initiates the dialogue. All dialogue choices eventually lead to hostility with the magicians.\nOnce Hostile, the magicians cast Spell Deflection and Stoneskin, followed by an obscure reference to a \"Tatoo of Power' or other \"Tatoo\" variations - this is just embellished text for dramatic effect (there is no \"Tatoo of Power\" spell in the game). Mirror images may be cast, perhaps Power Word, Silence. Offensively they will use Greater Malison and Lightning Bolts or Chain Lightning. Most of their memorized spells are not used. They do not attempt to Breach a target, nor do they try and take down any spell protections. They will cast a single target spell at a party member that is protected from single target spells, like Spell Deflection or Spell Trap. \nOne peculiar thing about these spell casters is that thy all cast the same spell, at the same target, at the same time. For instance, you might be on the receiving end of three Greater Malison, or three Power Word, Silence spells.\nThe AI for these creatures is not very adaptable, and does not react to what spells or protections your party has up. They do not move out of clouds or AOE spells if there are no opponents in their visual range. If anyone is within their visual range they will attempt to close the distance to cast spells at them. They cannot open the door to the library if you close it, but they will follow the party if the door is left open. For example, you could fire a &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; into the library, then close the door, and you may slay the whole group without any dialogue being uttered. These creatures are humans, not Undead or ghosts of some sort. They have no special immunities, or secret buffs. Their undroppable Stoneskin amulet does however provide them with at least one instance of Stoneskin.\nAlthough Diya is a level 20 Sorcerer, he has no memorized 8th or 9th level spells. Diya also is provided with four memorized Cleric Spells.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod will update this creature's spell book to the SR versions. For instance, instead of the 5th level spell &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; cast at the party, it will be the SR spell \"Waves of Fatigue\". Instead of the 7th Level Spell &lt;a href=\"Mantle\"&gt;Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, it will the SR version \"Prismatic Mantle\"."}

It has three defensive spells it can use, including &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Oddly enough, the game gives the Djinni no offensive spells to employ in its script. \nThis creature's melee attack weapon is some kind fist or similar (with no animation) inflicting 2d8 crushing damage with additional strength modifier damage added. The game gave the creature 2 pips proficiency with blunt weapons, but the weapon is not coded properly so it doesn't modify the attack. This weapon is non magical and unenchanted. A Djinni gets two attacks per round. \nSummoned Djinni.\nThese type of Djinni will most likely only be encountered if a hostile mage casts a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Djinni\"&gt;Summon Djinni&lt;/a&gt; spell, or if the party does.\nSpell Version.\nDjinni summoned by the spell differ vary little from the non-summoned variety. It has the same stats and melee weapon as displayed in the info box.\nA party summoned djinni from the wizard spell will be a controlled creature. You will need to direct it and move it and select which spells to cast, and what to target. The selectable spells available are:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Armor\"&gt;Ghost Armor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThese spells are different than what the AI scripted djinni gets access to, so the Shadow Door, Globe of Invulnerability and Protection from Magical Weapons spells cannot be selected by the player, but the AI will cast them on their own as soon as the Djinni spots an enemy.\nRing of Djinni Summoning version.\nThe Djinni conjured from the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Djinni%20Summoning\"&gt;Ring of Djinni Summoning&lt;/a&gt; produces another variety of the creature. It is similar in stats, armor class and to hit abilities as the info box creature, although it has 7 Hit Dice (but the same hit points). Its saving throws are worse 10/12/11/12/13. The creature performs melee attacks with the &lt;a href=\"GENSCIM.ITM\"&gt;GENSCIM.ITM&lt;/a&gt;, instead of the info box quick weapon. \nThis creature is subject to your will, and a controlled creature. You will need to direct it and move it and select which spells to cast, and what to target. The selectable spells available are:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Armor\"&gt;Ghost Armor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThis creature will only be available for 1 turn. The Djinn from the ring is equipped with an undroppable and invisible item that prevents it from going below 1 &lt;a href=\"Hit%20point\"&gt;Hit point&lt;/a&gt; - see the &lt;a href=\"MONHP1.ITM\"&gt;MONHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt; page. It therefore cannot die from hit point loss. It can be destroyed or banished by other means like any summoned creature such as &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;, or even the &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate%20effect\"&gt;Disintegrate effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe AI in this version of the creature is different and won't cast Shadow Door, Globe of Invulnerability or Protection from Magical Weapons, it will simply use Invisibility upon spotting an enemy, after a delay.\nLocations.\nUnknown, please fill-in if you wish.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises the Djinni. it does this by implementing the \"Smarter Genie\" component. From the Mod's Readme:\nSmarter Genies (BG2, BG2EE, BGT, EET)&lt;br&gt;\nThis component improves the various genies (djinni, efreet, and the like) in BG2. Mostly this is done by improving their scripts and systematising the rather chaotic list of spells and abilities that different genies get (in the original game, if you charmed a genie you'd see that it had a totally different list of spells from the ones it was actually using!) However, the component also changes summoned genies so that they count as \"Gated\" rather than \"Summoned\"; the practical consequence of this is that they are immune to Death Spell. This makes genie-summoning rather more useful.&lt;br&gt;\nThis component is sensitive to the difficulty setting:&lt;br&gt;\nBASIC: Genies will attack fairly unintelligently, and mostly do not use their invisibility or protective powers.&lt;br&gt;\nIMPROVED: Genies attack intelligently and use all of their magical powers.&lt;br&gt;\nTACTICAL: Genies can use their magical powers instantly and without risk of spell failure.&lt;br&gt;\nHARDCORE and above: Genies receive a modest (+50%) boost to their hit points.&lt;br&gt;\nThe summoned Djinni have some revised powers and abilities. The 5 Hit Dice version is not used (no Djinni has 5 HD in D&amp;D) and the 10 HD version is also changed. The wizard spell summoned Djinni and the Ring summoned creatures are now mostly identical. Only the melee weapons differ. The AI scripts and abilities/spells/statistics are the same. They are now both 11 Hit Dice Creatures with level 11/11 Mage/Cleric spell casting levels. By script they cast wizard spells (sometimes instantly depending on game difficulty selection). The creature will turn into mist form (and it is impervious to damage while in that form) and rapidly regenerate hit points when damaged over 50%. Careful timing and delivered damage can overcome the mist regeneration phase - if it isn't done correctly, the creature can take a long time to kill, as it is constantly going into mist form, regenerating, and then reforming etc.&lt;br&gt;\nThe spells selection to the Djinni are slightly different than the base game. The SCS AI is very smart and detailed, and all memorized spells can be cast. The creature responds to the party's protections in an intelligent manner. The Djinni can use the following spells.&lt;br&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWith the installation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, all of Djinni's memorized spells will be the SR version.\nAlso with SR, the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Djinni\"&gt;Summon Djinni&lt;/a&gt; wizard spell is changed. That revised spell summons a completely different version of a gated Djinni. See the spell page link for description of the spell and creature. Note that if SCS and SR are both installed, the SR Efreeti version is the one that appears, but it has the SCS AI assigned to it. Both mods work together by design.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Afaaq%20the%20Djinni%20Companion\"&gt;Afaaq the Djinni Companion&lt;/a&gt; mod allows the party to rescue and take along a \"seventh\" party member. This mod adds Afaaq to your party and has much new content, quests and dialogue. Afaaq can also \"level-up\" once during his adventures with the party. He has his own unique equipment and memorized spells and powers. You can send Afaaq back to his \"lamp\" when you want to and bring him out as desired. Try it out if you want to experience having a Djinni as a party member."}

{"id": "7657", "revid": "53053884", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7657", "title": "Doomsayer", "text": "The Doomsayer is the guardian of an ancient temple of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Kozah&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Archaeological%20Site\"&gt;Archaeological Site&lt;/a&gt; south of the &lt;a href=\"Lighthouse\"&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;. This temple is being excavated by &lt;a href=\"Charleston%20Nib\"&gt;Charleston Nib&lt;/a&gt;. If the &lt;a href=\"Idol\"&gt;Idol of Kozah&lt;/a&gt; is taken out of the temple, the Doomsayer will appear and attack, after a brief dialogue.\nThe Doomsayer targets the nearest party member with melee attacks, and is quite powerful. Even at level 6, the party member being attacked will need extensive healing and other support (&lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil\"&gt;Protection From Evil&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) to survive the encounter. Like all non-magic resistant melee attackers, it is easily trivialized with the first level spell &lt;a href=\"Grease\"&gt;Grease&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Doomsayer can only be damaged by enchanted weapons and ammunition, and is immune to electrical damage.\nThe rewards offered by fighting the Doomsayer are minimal, and ultimately it is not recommended.\nEquipment.\nThe Doomsayer appears as a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; male &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; and comes equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Helmet%23Plumed%20Crest%20Helmet\"&gt;plumed crest helmet&lt;/a&gt; (immunity to critical hits) and &lt;a href=\"Plate%20Mail\"&gt;Plate Mail&lt;/a&gt;; the latter, however, doesn't have any effects on his &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;armor class&lt;/a&gt;, as he has a natural AC of -2 that is further lowered by 3 through his &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. He wields a flame blade, similar to the weapon created by the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Blade\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, that in the classic &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; deals 1d4 +4 fire damage and gives a -4 bonus to the Doomsayer's already low &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; of 8.\nIn addition he wears two . One of these grants him immunity to a number of &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt;: berserk, charm, confusion, fatigue, panic, paralyze, petrification, poison, slay and sleep. The other one creates a field of &lt;a href=\"blur\"&gt;blur&lt;/a&gt; that lowers his already very low armor class by an additional -3 bonus, to an overall value of -8, and adds a -1 bonus to all of his &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHe doesn't drop any items upon death.\nTactics.\nIn the original \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; will make all the difference when fighting the Doomsayer: it dispels his &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Blade\"&gt;Flame Blade&lt;/a&gt;. With fists alone, the Doomsayer's damage is minimized and he is never able to kill, as fists only knock someone out. In the \"\", however, dispelling magic has no effect at all on these built-in abilities.\nFire, ice, acid and magic damage spells will work. Lightning will heal him, as he has over 100% lightning resistance. &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Wands of Frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Magic%20Missiles\"&gt;Magic Missiles&lt;/a&gt; work. &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Paralyzation\"&gt;Wand of Paralyzation&lt;/a&gt; works even better. Also, in case Dispel Magic misfires, have &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt; prepped for one of your main fighters armed with powerful weapons. Note also that ranged weapons can be helpful to halt the Doomsayer just enough to maximize the effect of Web.\nWhile he's immune to the damage of missiles, he's not to their magical component, so &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s and similar will partially work.\nGrease + Magic Missile.\nNot even cheese, just a good grasp of the magic system - Grease is a first level spell with a good duration that slows movement to a crawl even on a successful saving throw, completely neutering the Doomsayer's ability to deal its ferocious melee damage. So incapacitated, the Doomsayer can be safely dealt with at range. The most effective means to do so by is Magic Missile; the projectiles always hit (ignoring its impressive AC) and completely bypass its elemental based resistances. The Doomsayer requires around twenty-four missiles to reliably destroy (eight castings of the fifth level version suffices) and can easily be soloed by a fifth level mage with the &lt;a href=\"Evermemory\"&gt;Ring of Wizardry.&lt;/a&gt;\nFleeing.\nTo disengage, you'll need a distraction, and the best one is probably summoning creatures to keep him busy. &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; will work well enough, though he has high saving throws (at least whilst blurred) and won't give up the chase despite being out of sight. You'd probably have to flee the zone and return to disengage combat.\nExploits.\nThe easiest way of killing Doomsayer is to lure him towards &lt;a href=\"Brage\"&gt;Brage&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to his &lt;a href=\"Two-handed%20Sword%2C%20Cursed%20Berserking\"&gt;cursed sword&lt;/a&gt;, the captain will turn &lt;a href=\"berserk\"&gt;berserk&lt;/a&gt; in the presence of an enemy and will go after the apparition. At this point it's best to quaff a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;Potion of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; or to &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;hide in shadows&lt;/a&gt; (the cart remains can be used to break line of sight), but simply running in circles should also work. Brage attacks only once per round and needs a good roll to hit Doomsayer, but his every hit deals very respectable damage.\nDialogue.\n\"IthNal cOR dan osa KOZAH! Rrrackne dall'a osa KOZAH!\""}

He wont leave party if you increase reputation then.\nAfter Dorn has spent a week in your party in the extension, his script will force a special not-so-random encounter, an ambush from a &lt;a href=\"Planetar\"&gt;Planetar&lt;/a&gt; and several Crusaders. After killing the Crusaders and injuring the Planetar (who cannot be killed), the Planetar declares that both Gorion's Ward and Dorn have been put on the Scroll of Retribution, marking both for execution by celestial forces.\u00a0 One of the demons trapped in the Abyssal Blade suggests that you make an assault on Lunia in order to remove your name and Dorn's from the Scroll, and Dorn agrees.\u00a0 A portal at the ambush site can take you there.\nOnce in &lt;a href=\"Dorn%20-%20Lunia\"&gt;Lunia&lt;/a&gt;, another planetar can be found near the entrance giving &lt;a href=\"sigil%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Sigils of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; to the assembled &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;priests of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;.

From it you can obtain the unique &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Apple\"&gt;Silver Apple&lt;/a&gt;, although if Dorn remains alive and still tied to Ur-Gothoz, he will defile the tree and make the apples unobtainable no matter the conversation path (to avoid this, you need to go to tree in invisibility to avoid conversation with monks that stay near tree). On your way back from the Scroll, a gathering of a dozen people will appear near the tree: a planetar and several priests, paladins and onlookers; they will recognize Dorn as the defiler and attack (a bug will cause this even if you went to the Scroll via the southeastern stairs and never saw the tree before)(and another bug that's add dialogue option from another demon to defile tree).\nThe Scroll is in the northeast, guarded by several Paladins and the scribe &lt;a href=\"Naiman%20Alore\"&gt;Naiman Alore&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Again, you can either kill the scribe or trick him into removing your names by claiming that the gods have ordered this and that they must be obeyed or trick him to get inks (then you can remove your names and add 2 too).\u00a0If you take the violent approach, you may add two other names to the scroll; After short time planetar and 3 priests will teleport near to you to revenge for rescribbed scroll. if you add the names of Bhaalspawn you have yet to fight, then during those fights you will be aided by a Planetar.\nIn any way, &lt;a href=\"Ixthezzys\"&gt;Ixthezzys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dolrassa\"&gt;Dolrassa&lt;/a&gt;, two silver dragons, will try to prevent your escape.\u00a0You may prevent confrontation said that you are bhaalspawn, they will teleport away.

His proficiency points are two in each of Two-Handed Swords and the Two-Handed Weapon Style.\nRestrictions for alignment can be bypassed using the &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Opposite%20Alignment\"&gt;Helmet of Opposite Alignment&lt;/a&gt; to use his excellent stats in a Good party. It also allows you to romance him, if you like bad boys. \n\nRecruitment.\nDorn is available to recruit in &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Nine%20%E2%80%93%20Boareskyr%20Bridge\"&gt;Chapter Nine&lt;/a&gt;, he's held captive by &lt;a href=\"Caelar%20Argent\"&gt;Caelar&lt;/a&gt;'s crusaders and you'll find him inside a prison cell in the crusader camp at &lt;a href=\"Boareskyr%20Bridge\"&gt;Boareskyr Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, releasing him won't draw hostage attentions from the crusaders, but any items you placed in his inventory prior to his departure in Chapter 7 (SoD) are in a box just above the cage and his level is reset to default.\n\nRecruitment.\nDorn is available to recruit in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%202\"&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;. Travel to the southern part of &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;, talk to him to let him join, recruiting him will initiate a number of &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;-damaging but rewarding quests. If dismissed at this stage, he will return to his original spot (Temple District).\nGameplay.\nAt the culminating point of his companion quest, you acquire the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Blade\"&gt;Abyssal Blade&lt;/a&gt;, a blackguard-only +3 two-handed sword with additional effects depending on how you chose to complete his quest chain. The effects carry over into \"\". Siding with &lt;a href=\"Ur-Gothoz\"&gt;Ur-Gothoz&lt;/a&gt; will also earn him the powerful helmet &lt;a href=\"The%20Visage\"&gt;The Visage&lt;/a&gt;. If you decide to kill both Ur-Gothoz and Azothet, the Abyssal Blade will be imbued with the\u00a0souls of both patrons (+5 vs. good aligned, +5 vs demons and +5 vs devils) but Dorn will become a fallen blackguard and lose all his powers, turning him into a pure fighter of the same level. In addition, you will lose his final quest in Throne of Bhaal. If you leave at least one of them alive, be it Ur-Gothoz or Azothet, you unlock his final quest in the godly plane of Lunia. In &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the player can get him the blackguard-only sword &lt;a href=\"Ir%27revrykal\"&gt;Ir'revrykal&lt;/a&gt;, effectively an\u00a0evil version of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Carsomyr\"&gt;Carsomyr&lt;/a&gt;. As the only party member with a natural 19 Strength, he is also the only character who can use the &lt;a href=\"Strong%20Arm\"&gt;Strong Arm&lt;/a&gt; bow without a strength-enhancing item.\nDefensively speaking, his 14 Constitution and 16 Dexterity put him at a disadvantage as a tank, but these can be compensated for with the &lt;a href=\"Girdle%20of%20Fortitude\"&gt;Girdle of Fortitude&lt;/a&gt;, which sets his Constitution to 18 for eight hours. Dorn is the only companion other than &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Valygar\"&gt;Valygar&lt;/a&gt; that can use &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20Easthaven\"&gt;Defender of Easthaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hardiness\"&gt;Hardiness&lt;/a&gt;, making him an excellent physical damage tank. &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0allows him to reach 25 Strength at level 26 without the use of magical equipment, which can be saved for other party members, along with 22 Dexterity and 20 Constitution.\nAt protagonist level 9, he starts with proficiencies in Two-Handed Sword, Crossbow, and Two-Handed Weapon Style. His starting equipment is &lt;a href=\"Plate%20Mail\"&gt;Plate Mail&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Basic%20Helmets%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Helmet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rancor\"&gt;Rancor&lt;/a&gt; (a +1 or +2 two-handed sword). As a level 8 Blackguard, he has the innate abilities &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fear\"&gt;Resist Fear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Plane%20Protection\"&gt;Negative Plane Protection&lt;/a&gt;.\nBugs.\nAs of BG2EE 2.6, Dorn's first talk with the PC is supposed to be one of three, depending on your reputation and whether you known him from the events in BG. However, his script is always setting the variable that you knew him, so you always get one of the three banters and never see the other two options. This is identified for correction in the pending Enhanced Edition Fix Pack (EEFP). Ref: (dorn.bcs)"}

Any other method of getting there will not yield his appearance. The party will be waylaid by brigands led by &lt;a href=\"Senjak\"&gt;Senjak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dorotea\"&gt;Dorotea&lt;/a&gt;, Dorn's former companions. Dorn charges in, clearing three bandits before the fight starts. After the bloodshed, he offers to join you.\nCharmed, I'm Sure.\nWander around with Dorn long enough and he'll eventually comment on his vendetta. His next target is necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kryll\"&gt;Kryll&lt;/a&gt;, another of his former companions, which leads you to &lt;a href=\"Nashkel\"&gt;Nashkel&lt;/a&gt;. It's not really necessary to wait until Dorn talks about his next target, though. Speak to &lt;a href=\"Taris\"&gt;Taris&lt;/a&gt; outside the &lt;a href=\"Nashkel%20Inn\"&gt;Nashkel Inn&lt;/a&gt;, then head to the &lt;a href=\"Gibberling%20Mountains\"&gt;Gibberling Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nKryll is expecting Dorn near a blood-stained rock (x=2550, y=1500). After satiating Dorn's thirst for her blood, find &lt;a href=\"Letter%20to%20Kryll\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; for Dorn from Kryll's body and trace it back to Taris to inform her about the misfortune of her husband. Should you wish to choose it, the last dialog option kicks off a forced sequence of responses aimed to torment her with a series of gruesome, although grimly whimsical and honest, details of her husband's demise which eventually leads her to turn hostile. Killing her results in a major reputation penalty.\nAnother One Bites the Dust.\nWhen the party reaches &lt;a href=\"Wyrm%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Wyrm's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, Dorn will remark on the proximity to his last former comrade and a revenge opportunity.\nPrepare ahead as &lt;a href=\"Simmeon\"&gt;Simmeon&lt;/a&gt; awaits you north of the inner side of the bridge (x=1090, y=290). It is important to note however that the bridge section where Simmeon awaits will not be accessible prior to .\u00a0Simeon will summon two &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20of%20Azothet\"&gt;Thralls of Azothet&lt;/a&gt; and is accompanied by a mage named &lt;a href=\"Sheila\"&gt;Sheila&lt;/a&gt; and an unnamed priest.\nAfter the fight, Dorn will talk more. From this point forwards, he'll gradually (based on in-game time) fill you with his tales, and his &lt;a href=\"romance\"&gt;romance&lt;/a&gt; route will become open to &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;."}

This will allow a more robust initial pre-buffing of protective spells at the outset of hostilities, especially against Irenicus - who also has a deadlier initial attack phase. \nIn the unmodded game he only applies an initial moderate spell protection and may be insufficient against some spells cast by Irenicus, such as Horrid Wilting or Wail of the Banshee. With SCS he has more staying power and can remain in the fight longer. The mod also furnishes Dradeel with a potion for quaffing use.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod will change his spells to the mod versions."}

Only weapons with a +2 enchantment or greater can strike him. See the InfoBox for a listing of other abilities and immunities.\nAs a Fighter with grandmastery proficiency in two-handed swords and two-handed Weapon skill at 2 pips, he can strike hard and fast with his +2 enchanted great sword. These blows do not induce a level drain effect like other vampiric touch attacks.\nThe game gave Dragomir no memorized spells, however the AI script provides the creature with a &lt;a href=\"Domination%20%28Innate%29\"&gt;Vampire Domination&lt;/a&gt; that can be discharged multiple times as an innate ability, and he may attempt to use that on anyone in his visual range. A save vs. spell with a small penalty negates. This script looks for races resistant to charms, classes with charm resistance, and items that provide immunity to charm. The creature will then select another target if possible.\nIf you succeed in slaying Dragomir, you can loot the body.

The look of the stairwell is similar to places the party has probably been before where a dragon has been encountered, such as &lt;a href=\"Firkraag%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;Firkraag's Hideout&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%E2%80%93%20Saladrex%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Watcher's Keep \u2013 Saladrex (Dragon)&lt;/a&gt; areas.\nThe party must be gathered to enter here, and it can't be split. Once this area is entered, it can't be exited until the challenge ahead is resolved.\nAs the party moves forward from the stairs and emerges into a cavernous arched chamber - and when a member is detected, a huge green dragon will rumble an initial two lines of dialogue, and then attack. The creature can &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt;, so being hidden won't prevent this. The dragon's hostile action doesn't allow the party to reply or afford an opportunity to engage in dialogue.\nThe first action by the beast is to apply its initial preparatory protection buff of &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt; on itself, followed a second later with a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; directed at the closest party member. These spells can't be interrupted.\nThe next action will probably see the dragon radiating a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Fear\"&gt;Dragon Fear&lt;/a&gt; aura and a &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Buffet\"&gt;Wing Buffet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the dragon detects an &lt;a href=\"Incendiary%20Cloud\"&gt;Incendiary Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Death%20Fog\"&gt;Death Fog&lt;/a&gt; it will also initiate a Wing Buffet to disperse those.\nIf the dragon senses any invisibility effects upon the party, it will launch a &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nWhen the dragon has zero &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; layers remaining it applies another (10-skins).\nThe creature will direct a &lt;a href=\"Plant%20Growth\"&gt;Plant Growth&lt;/a&gt; spell over itself when an enemy is within 15 feet. This spell has a large saving throw penalty and is difficult to block. An affected party member is essentially unable to move from its spot, where it is rooted in a stationary point on the map. The entangled party member may still fight and cast spells but can't maneuver.\nWithin three to four rounds of combat, the dragon will begin to use its &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragon%20Breath\"&gt;Green Dragon Breath&lt;/a&gt; weapon attack at the closest opponent in range. The breath weapon may affect other party members in the area of effect. This can be done again after several more rounds have transpired.\nWhen the dragon's wounds have reduced its &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; below 50%, the beast can initiate a &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; spell, and this completely restores its original HP and can cure several status effects as well.\nFurther along in the battle, if the creature is still functioning, a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Insects%20%28innate%29\"&gt;Summon Insects (innate)&lt;/a&gt; spell is attempted at a party spell casting class member (Bard, Mage, Druid, Cleric etc.), as long as their &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; is below 50%.\nMuch later in the battle, possibly never occurring, the dragon can attempt a &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; spell at a party member who has less than 50% magic resistance.\nObviously, party members in melee attack range will also be engaged by the dragon's slashing claw attacks, which will have a good chance of connecting against even superior armor class ratings.\nIf no party members engage the dragon in close quarters combat, the beast will advance and move into melee range on its own.\nWhen the party defeats this beast, almost immediately afterwards the Helmite Ghost materializes in the chamber and delivers a message, saying:\nEach party member receives quest experience points (), and the exit back to the level above is now accessible.\nDon't forget to take the items and gold the dragon carried. You'll need some these to progress the adventure.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises this dragon in many ways. Especially if you install the \"Smarter Dragons\" component (which is responsive to the game difficulty selection). \nHis SCS AI improves targeting and recognition of opponent's protections, which means he will fight smarter and not waste attacks on someone he cannot hit or damage. \nIt will also influence his tactical options and attack methods. First, some mention of the dragon's stats and abilities. In most cases, all of the unmodded ones are still applicable:\nImmunities in addition to the unmodded dragon version:\nSpells: The dragon's scripted spell use is revised. It can use the following spells, as determined by the AI's need: \nWith the installation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, some of the dragon's arcane and divine memorized spells will be the SR version.\nGame difficulty settings determine how often the dragon can use &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Buffet\"&gt;Wing Buffet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragon%20Breath\"&gt;Green Dragon Breath&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe dragon will have a random scroll in its droppable loot."}

Upon spotting the party, the dragon pleads for aid against its giant assailants.\nIf &lt;a href=\"M%27Khiin%20Grubdoubler\"&gt;M'Khiin Grubdoubler&lt;/a&gt; is present, she calls the giants cowards for attacking the dragon.\nIf somebody in your party is using equipment made of green &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scales\"&gt;Dragon Scales&lt;/a&gt;, you will not be able to have amiable relations with this young green dragon.\nThere are two possible outcomes:\nDragon Wins.\nIf the dragon wins and the party did not attack it, in addition to the experience points and loot for slaying the Hill Giants, the young dragon will reward the party by telling them of an otherwise inaccessible secret cache in the northwestern part of this map. This contains a &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Tears\"&gt;King's Tears&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Beljuril\"&gt;Beljuril&lt;/a&gt;, , and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Red%20Ioun%20Stone\"&gt;Blood Red Ioun Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party moves quickly, they can still attack the dragon before it leaves after telling them where to find the cache, which will grant them its combat experience points as well.\nGiants Win.\nUpon slaying the dragon, the rest of the band - two more Hill Giants and a &lt;a href=\"Hill%20Giant%20Leader\"&gt;Hill Giant Leader&lt;/a&gt; - will arrive, and the whole hunting party will attack the player's party for \"spoiling their meal.\"\nThis path offers more combat experience points, but forgoes the wealth that comes from helping the dragon. It also means trading the Ioun Stone for the magical halberd &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Fury\"&gt;Cold Fury&lt;/a&gt;, which can be taken from the corpse of the Hill Giant Leader.\nGiants Win, but then they lose.\nIt is possible to get both the Dragon's cash and the Hill Giant's Leader's loot by targeting the Dragon with a Raise Dead (or similar) spell shortly before the Dragon dies from the Giants' blows (due to randomness of the fight a couple of healing spells to help the Giants may be needed, also do not attack the Dragon or it will become hostile in its next life). After the Dragon dies the Hill Giant Leader will spawn. Then the Dragon will be raised by the Player's Raise Dead and if the two original giants are killed while it is alive (caution - raised Dragon will have 1 HP), the hoard unlock dialogue will trigger. Reverse (resurrecting Giants and killing the Dragon after getting hoard unlock dialogue) does not work, resurrected giants do not call their leader. Of course, Raise Dead working on Dragons and Giants is a bug, it should not work on such creatures by the description.\nTrivia.\nThis encounter is based on a bit of AD&amp;D lore from the Monstrous Manual, where hill giants are noted for considering the flesh of green dragons as a delicacy and organizing hunting parties to take them down."}

The first dream sequence occurs after several rest attempts (be it in an or in the open) with the second dream sequence occurring a few rests after the first and the third dream sequence happening a few rests after the second. The fourth dream takes place during the events of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%204\"&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt; when Gorion's Ward's bhaalspawn soul essence is stolen by &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;. The fifth dream takes place during the first rest attempt following the battle with Irenicus in Spellhold after completing Bodhi's Hunt. When this final dream ends, Gorion's Ward is now able to polymorph into the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt; as a special ability.\nThe first, third, fourth, and fifth dream all have &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; in them while the second dream may not involve her depending upon the dialogue choice Gorion's Ward selects. The fourth dream also has the avatar of &lt;a href=\"Bhaal%20%28dream%29\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; who appears in the form of &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt;. The first three dreams involve interacting with Irenicus within the dream, as he is the primary \u201cdriver\u201d of these first three dream sequences, in his attempts to get Gorion's Ward to come to grips with the Ward's true heritage and how the Ward might realize the \u201cpotential\u201d within and \u201caccept the gifts\u201d offered.\nLocations.\nThe first dream takes place outside around the perimeter of the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Library%20%28Dream%29\"&gt;Candlekeep Library&lt;/a&gt; and involves people near and dear to Gorion's Ward who were encountered during the events of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second and third dreams take place inside the Library on the fourth floor, albeit in slightly different locations within the area.\nThe fourth dream is initiated in the basement of Spellhold when Gorion's Ward is placed under a spell by Irenicus during the soul theft. It takes place in the Library exterior area and inside on the ground floor. Unlike the first three dreams, it involves actual gameplay and it is possible for Gorion's Ward to die, which leads to game over.\nThe fifth dream takes place on the second and fourth floors of the Library and is similar to the first three dreams in that there is no gameplay interaction with any creatures.\nDream abilities in Shadows of Amn.\nIf a \"Shadows of Amn\" game is started via importing Gorion's Ward from \"Baldur's Gate\", the Ward will retain the special abilities that were gained during the &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;dreams&lt;/a&gt; of the first game. Dreams in \"Shadows of Amn\" do not allow for additional abilities to be gained.\nHowever, a newly &lt;a href=\"Character%20Generation\"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; protagonist, especially of neutral alignment, doesn't follow \"exactly\" the above mentioned rules. Depending on the Ward's starting reputation, determined through the initial &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt;, these powers will be assigned to Gorion's Ward instead:\nGorion's Ward will lose all of these abilities following the completion of the fourth dream.\nThe First Dream.\n\"Scene A\".\nThe first dream opens on the left side of the Candlekeep Library where Gorion's Ward is approached by Imoen who initiates dialogue:\n\"Scene B\".\nThe scene then shifts to the entrance to the Library:\n\"Scene C\".\nThe scene shifts to the inner wall which surrounds the Library, where three stone statues of Khalid, Elminster and Gorion are found. After the dialogue ends the three statues shatter:\n\"Scene D\".\nThe scene shifts back inside the inner wall where a stone statue of Sarevok is found. The statue shatters while Imoen laments her fate: \n\"Scene E\".\nImoen turns to stone while Irenicus enters the scene:\nThe statue of Imoen shatters and Gorion's Ward falls back asleep:\nThe Second Dream.\n\"Scene A\".\nGorion's Ward awakes on the fourth floor inside of the Candlekeep Library where Irenicus and a large number of stone statues of commoners awaits:\n\"Scene B\".\nIrenicus turns and animates one of the stone statues; he talks about her life, kills her, and then talks of life forgetting her before informing Gorion's Ward of the \"power\" that could be within:\nNow Gorion's Ward has two dialogue paths to choose from:\n\"Scene C1\".\nThe first is the \"good\" path whereby Irenicus brings Imoen into the dream and then he speaks of how the Wards actions might affect others before telling Gorion's Ward to accept the \"gifts\" that are offered:\n\"Scene D1\".\nIrenicus then turns to Imoen and casts some spells upon&lt;br&gt;her to get Gorion's Ward to understand the supposed&lt;br&gt;consequences of this path:\nThe dream ends as Gorion's Ward falls back asleep:\n\"Scene C2\".\nThe second is the \"evil\" path whereby Gorion's Ward is intrigued by the idea's put forth by Irenicus: \nThe Ward calls forth a meteor swarm while the stone statues shatter:\nThe dream ends as Gorion's Ward falls back asleep:\nThe Third Dream.\n\"Scene A\".\nGorion's Ward awakes again on the fourth floor inside of the Candlekeep Library where only Irenicus awaits this time as he commands the Ward to \u201cstand\u201d and than engages in dialogue:\nWhen the dialogue ends, a spitting image of&lt;br&gt;Gorion's Ward is magically brought into the scene:\nFollowed by a Tanar'ri which turns and destroys&lt;br&gt;the image of Gorion's Ward who shouts,&lt;br&gt;\u201cIt's hopeless\u201d as the Ward disappears:\nThe Tanar'ri then shouts \u201cHahahahahaha!!\u201d&lt;br&gt;before it disappears:\n\"Scene B\".\nIrenicus than questions why Gorion's Ward submits to the power of others and to the flesh of existence when the Ward could weld power to dominate all other creatures:\nA spitting image of Gorion's Ward is once again&lt;br&gt;magically brought into the scene:\nFollowed by a Vampire, a Lich and a Mind Flayer:\nGorion's Ward image turns and destroys all three creatures:\nThe image also shouts \u201cHahahahahaha!!\u201d&lt;br&gt;before it disappears:\n\"Scene C\".\nIrenicus teleports Imoen into the dream while engaging in some final brief dialogue:\nIrenicus begins to cast spells upon Imoen:\nThe dream ends as Gorion's Ward falls back asleep:\nThe Fourth Dream.\n\"Scene A\".\nGorion's Ward awakes outside the inner wall within the dreamscape of Candlekeep and immediately hears the voice of Imoen:\nThe Ward is provided with three different dialogue reply choices that all result in Imoen pleading for the Ward to \u201cfind me within\u201d:\n\"Scene B\".\nEntering the courtyard, Gorion's Ward will observe a demon on the steps to the doorway of the Candlekeep Library. The demon will initiate dialogue once the Ward gets close enough and before being able to get \u201cpass\u201d the doors, a choice is offered and a sacrifice must be given:\nAfter the choice is made, the demon then reply's:\nThe demon disappears as Gorion's Ward undergoes the ability score sacrifice:\nGorion's Ward can now enter the Library to find Imoen:\n\"Scene C\".\nEntering the Library, Gorion's Ward finds Imoen on the ground floor:\nThree dialogue reply's are available:\nTo which Imoen reply's:\nExiting the Library, Gorion's Ward finds the avatar of Bhaal, in the guise of Sarevok, within the courtyard:\nThe Ward is given several response dialogue choices, all of which illicit a reply and then the avatar attacks:\nWhen Gorion's Ward and the creature are within Imoen's sight, the final dialogue sequence will take place:\nThe dream ends.\nThe Fifth Dream.\n\"Scene A\".\nGorion's Ward awakes on the second floor of the Candlekeep Library, standing opposite of Imoen:\n\"You came too late. Didn't I say you would come too late? You will learn to trust me.\"\n\"Don't be afraid. You are safe here... if you behave. I will show you what fills the void. What is now free.\"\n\"I lurk behind your soul, in the very fiber of your being. I am the only thing left when mind and reason are stripped away.\"\n\"I will show you what you can be, what you can do... if you simply let yourself become what you are.\"\n\"I can show you all of this because I am within. I... am what fills the void. I am you.\"\nAt which point Imoen transforms into the Slayer and, if Gorion's Ward has any companions, proceeds to attack and kill every one of them. If the Ward is solo, the Slayer just stands there until the scene fades to black:\n\"Scene B\".\nThe dream fades back to life and shifts to the fourth floor of the Candlekeep Library. Gorion's Ward is now in the presence of Sarevok, Bodhi, Irenicus and Imoen (in normal form). Imoen proceeds to inform Gorion's Ward of the \u201cvaluable prize\u201d the Ward is about to receive:\n\"You are to be given a gift. It is a valuable prize, one that you had better appreciate.\"\n\"You worry for your comrades, perhaps? Leave them, abandon them, and become what you must.\"\n\"You are alone. You have no one else. You should accept what you are... resistance makes you weak.\"\n\"There is great power in your heritage. Use it... and you will become closer to who you are... what you could be.\"\nAt which point Gorion's Ward transforms into the Slayer:\nGorion's Ward becomes the Slayer and Imoen speaks once more:\n\"Feel what is in the void. Use the tools that you are given. Become part of something greater. I am in you, and I know what is best.\"\n\"Each time you use it, each time you accept it, you move a little closer to the evil within.\"\n\"Perhaps you lose yourself in the end, but you will go to greater reward than you can know.\"\n\"After all, what does an eternity of nothingness matter... when you can destroy all that would oppose your development as easy as \u201cone\u201d...\"\nGorion's Ward proceeds to attack Sarevok:\nSarevok dies:\nGorion's Ward proceeds to attack Bodhi:\nBodhi dies:\nGorion's Ward proceeds to attack Irenicus:\nIrenicus dies:\nGorion's Ward proceeds to attack Imoen:\nImoen dies:\nImoen reappears where Gorion's Ward originally appeared when this scene began and the Ward proceeds to die:\nGorion's Ward dies:\nThe scene fades to black and so comes to a close the dream sequences for the \"Shadows of Amn\". Gorion's Ward is now able to polymorph into the Slayer form at will."}

See &lt;a href=\"Riddle%20of%20the%20Imps\"&gt;Riddle of the Imps&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%206\"&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/a&gt;, the real Drizzt will \"waylay\" the party when travelling from the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Temple%20at%20Underdark%20Exit\"&gt;Elven Temple at Underdark Exit&lt;/a&gt; to either &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20City%20Gates\"&gt;Athkatla City Gates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Keep\"&gt;De'Arnise Keep&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Small%20Teeth%20Pass\"&gt;Small Teeth Pass&lt;/a&gt;. See the &lt;a href=\"Encounter%20-%20Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Encounter - Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt; for more on this event.\nHe will be accompanied by his friends from the novels. You can ask him for help against &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;. Should you get help from him, he and his friends will be waiting in the north-east corner of the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe drawback to asking for Drizzt's help is that because he's such a powerful warrior, he can kill Bodhi in seconds, before the party members can touch her - meaning you receive no XP. To solve this issue, you can imprison him before the final fight with Bodhi, when you meet Drizzt again downstairs (you get 12,000 XP for this) and you can release him when you finish the fight. He is a nice guy, very easy going, and you can still be friends like nothing happened. \nNote that with the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod and the various vampire and Bodhi enhancement components, the exact opposite will probably occur, and Drizzt can easily be killed by Bodhi, especially with no help from the party.\nGameplay.\nIf the party is engaged in combat with Drizzt (this can happen in the first encounter with him), he behaves as a melee fighter, attacking the nearest detected enemy. \nAt the beginning of the battle Drizzt's panther companion &lt;a href=\"Guenhwyvar\"&gt;Guenhwyvar&lt;/a&gt; is summoned to fight alongside as well.\nDrizzt actually attacks with a special scimitar &lt;a href=\"DRIZZT.ITM\"&gt;DRIZZT.ITM&lt;/a&gt; rather than dual wielding &lt;a href=\"Twinkle\"&gt;Twinkle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icingdeath\"&gt;Icingdeath&lt;/a&gt; - although his sprite animation doesn't reveal this. His \"real\" weapons are added to other inventory slots so that any passive bonuses of the weapons are still retained.\nDrizzt will typically apply an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt; and if able, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Stone%20Giant%20Strength\"&gt;Potion of Stone Giant Strength&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe can also consume the &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt; when his HP falls to 50% of original.\nLoot.\nAlthough Drizzt's loot might be tempting in Baldur's Gate 2, players will probably be unable to keep the items for long after Drizzt dies. After leaving the Lower Tombs, a &lt;a href=\"Malchor%20Harpell\"&gt;Malchor Harpell&lt;/a&gt; will approach the party and confiscate some key items of Drizzt and companion's gear. This mage is guarded from being killed or rendered incapacitated.\nAttempting to hide the gear in a bag of holding or on a shelf will not help either, as the mage will return once any dropped items are picked up. If the NPC appears a third time, he will &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;imprison&lt;/a&gt; the entire party - thus ending the game. Exiting to a different area will not stop the NPC from appearing and following.\nHowever, Malchor Harpell is still vulnerable to feeble mind and it is possible to exploit to keep the gear.\nMod content.\nFor the Drizzt version in BG2, the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes revisions to the drow."}

Most drow are evil aligned, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt; and Solaufein in . They are shorter than regular elves and highly resistant to magic, and have a strong hatred for surface elves. Drow usually have black, blue or violet skin, have white hair and red or blue eyes. Before the name Drow was adapted, they were simply known as 'dark elves'.\nDrow are taught from an early age to trust no one, forging alliances only when they are confident that they can outmatch their ally if they decide to turn on them. The inherent pride in their own abilities quite often leads to such alliances being forged, though they almost always end badly when one party decides said alliance is no longer convenient. Even drow who escape the cruelties of the Underdark find it more difficult to form long-term friendships than most races do.\nSlavery plays a large part in drow society and drow households usually have two or more slaves for each member. All unskilled labor in drow cities is carried out by slaves. One slave from each household is usually kept as a \u201cpet\u201d by the household, and this is often a spider, since it is the symbol of the deity Lloth. Spiders roam the streets in drow cities, acting as pest controllers, and larger ones are used to guard houses or as mounts for transportation. These spiders are often specially bred for the purpose and are more intelligent than their regular counterparts, especially the sword spider.\nMost drow speak a drow version of Elvish as well as Undercommon, and a language suitable for the region in which they live, such as Abyssal, Common, Draconic, or Goblin. It is quite common for the Drow to learn the language spoken on the surface beneath which they live. All Drow are literate except for their barbarians. Drow Sign Language is commonly known, and is a silent language that consists of hand signals and facial expressions. There is no equivalent written or spoken form of this language."}

More self buffs may follow including &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;. An Additional &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; will be applied if the first is removed or consumed.\nAfterwards, if still able to fight, the drow will try and summon a &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Stalker\"&gt;Invisible Stalker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Spawn\"&gt;Spider Spawn&lt;/a&gt; for assistance, and then direct some spell casts at closest detected party members, such as \n&lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Fear%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Fear (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt; if engaged in melee, and &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word, Stun&lt;/a&gt;. If time allows a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt; may be applied to self as well. Other offensive damage spells and disabling spells are scripted for use, such as &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;.

They are unskilled in quarterstaff use, and are mages, so really can't strike anything in combat anyway.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a few changes to this creature. The Mage now has a Necromancer Kit. One pip in Quarterstaff weapon proficiency is assigned.

More spells and some different ones are memorized, but no level 8 spells, correcting the base game's oddity. A default SCS mage AI script is installed for \"Smarter Mage\" behavior. An SCS random treasure is in the creature's inventory as well.\nThe mage will begin hostilities by launching a {previously cast) self-protections including: &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI: Abjuration&lt;/a&gt; or \"Dispelling Screen\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt; spell will be cast immediately after. Additional defensive, summoning, offensive and disabling spells will be attempted based the AI's threat and opponent vulnerability assessments. Expect &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; attempts and various minor and spell sequencers for instant deployed spells.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod is installed, the drow's memorized spells will be the SR versions."}

The drow warriors are similar but may be equipped differently. Drow warriors clad in Drow Full Plate and equipped with a Drow Shield can have a very tough armor class to hit for mid-level party fighters and other classes. Drow warriors armed with Drow Crossbow of Speed and Drow Bolts will fire 2.5 missiles per round. Variations seen are:\nNote that some of strength statistics provided to the warriors are not consistent with the minimum required for a player or party member. It does not cause any penalties to the creatures however, but many of the warriors have no bonuses either since all the stats are straight 9's across the board, which is decidedly mediocre and unlikely for a Drow Warrior. None of the drow warriors have any assigned fighting styles, such as single-weapon, two-handed weapon or sword and shield.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a few changes to these creatures. This is normally done by accepting and installing the \"Improved Drow\" component. This will address the original games' lapses or omissions in the actual creature files and changes them to what they probably should be. Examples include giving them an SCS default AI for much better tactical combat and smarter decision-making behavior. Weapon proficiencies and weapon styles are assigned commensurate with the creature's class and experience level, just like a party member would be able to have. \nFor warriors, Drow fighters and other classes will have boosted strength and dexterity values to reflect that the best of Ust Natha's forces would be strong enough to wield a flail, or wear full plate armor, and quick enough to fire a crossbow and hit something accurately. Many Drow Fighters are also provided with the &lt;a href=\"HELMNOAN.ITM\"&gt;HELMNOAN.ITM&lt;/a&gt; as well to protect against critical hits.\nThis means that an SCS Drow warrior will have slightly boosted &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;, and improved &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and weapon damage. If Fighting styles are applied, then a improved Armor Class."}

This is an oversight. The drow priestess has no equipment. The drow leader has a female appearance but is a male gender in the files. This is known as 'binary' code. The drow rogue has no proficiency with his primary short sword weapon.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes changes to these creatures and adds to their numbers. SCS AI scripts are added to all creatures for smarter tactical behavior, threat recognition and opponent vulnerability assessment.

Other potions for boosting performance are also available and scripted for use. \nThe mod adds two &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Glabrezu (Shadows of Amn)&lt;/a&gt; demons to the guardian group. The demons will use their \"Improved Fiends\" scripts, to include innate spell casting during battle (which are instant and can't be interrupted). Expect an innate &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; at the outset of battle from both demons. \nThe Skeleton Warriors are replaced by two &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt; creatures. The golems will use their &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Slow\"&gt;Golem Slow&lt;/a&gt; innate ability when within the correct distance of any enemy, then melee fight.\nThe Drow Warrior now has 5 pips in crossbow weapon proficiency, and two in Longsword. Several potions are available for healing and boosting performance.\nThe Drow Wizard may now be an Invoker, and will begin with a group of (previously cast) spells to include &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI Abjuration&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Dispelling Screen\" with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR mod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20The%20Elements\"&gt;Protection From The Elements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;. The mage has a prepared minor sequencer, spell sequencer and spell trigger, which will be used instantly depending on the AI's threat recognition script. At the high end of the spells the wizard can use, there is a &lt;a href=\"Bigby%27s%20Clenched%20Fist\"&gt;Bigby's Clenched Fist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; HLA. The wizard can cast &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;. If given enough time it will cast &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt;. If any summoned party creatures are detected, the wizard can cast &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Drow Priestess is furnished with a &lt;a href=\"Drow%20Flail\"&gt;Drow Flail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drow%20Full%20Plate%20%2B5\"&gt;Drow Full Plate +5&lt;/a&gt;. Will open up with a set of {previously cast) self-buffs, including &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Regeneration (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Resistance%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Magic Resistance (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire (priest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Mirror\"&gt;Physical Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Free Action (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;. Will attempt to conjure a &lt;a href=\"Aerial%20Servant\"&gt;Aerial Servant&lt;/a&gt; and then a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt;. Further spell casting will be determined based on the opponent's protections and vulnerabilities.\nThe Drow Rogue is increased to two, and they are now assigned &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; kits.

For the version in and , refer to &lt;a href=\"Druid%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;Druid (Baldur's Gate)&lt;/a&gt;. For the version in , refer to &lt;a href=\"Druid%20%28BG3%29\"&gt;Druid (BG3)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntroduction.\nDruids are priests dedicated to nature and balance and any disciplined druid is a &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;true neutral&lt;/a&gt; character. They can use priest spells, but they all are related to nature and thereby their spell choices are different from &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s and have a fewer amount of spells available to them. Unlike mages and bards, who scribe scrolls to learn new spells, clerics and druids automatically know all spells of any spell levels they have unlocked. Druids must select the spells they want to memorize for the upcoming day and then &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; before they can cast them.\nThe weaponry and armor druids are allowed to use due to their ethos is limited to equipment that is primitive, related to their rituals or made from material found on the surface. They can use , , , , , and (but not other weapons from the group) as weapons. For protection, they can wear any and all headgear. They can use &lt;a href=\"bucklers\"&gt;bucklers&lt;/a&gt; and other if their other hand is available.\nOnly humans and half-elves can become druids. The prime ability scores of the druid are &lt;a href=\"Wisdom\"&gt;Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charisma\"&gt;Charisma&lt;/a&gt;. The only multi- or dual-class combination they can do is with the &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; class.\nAbility scores table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, other Races have modified ability scores.\n^^ The Avenger class kit has a -2 penalty to maximum Strength and Constitution. A Human Avenger can start with at most 16 in these ability scores. Minimum ability scores are not affected.\nSpecial abilities.\nShapeshifting.\nAt level 7, the druid gains the ability to shapeshift into a black bear, brown bear or wolf \u2013 each form once per day.\nPoison Immunity.\nAt level 15, druids become immune to poison.\nElemental Resistance.\nAt level 18, druids gain a 10% resistance to fire, cold, electricity, and acid. This is increased to 20% at level 21 and 30% at level 24\nDruid spells.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s learn druid spells on level up, &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s may also access to them up to spell level 3, cells in light green are druid specific spells, which are\u00a0not usable by &lt;a href=\"Cleric%23Cleric%20spells\"&gt;clerics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nClass kits.\nDruid.\nThe Druids serve the cause of nature and neutrality, the wilderness is their community, and they use their special powers to protect it and to preserve balance in the world.\nClass features: \nGameplay \n&lt;a href=\"Totemic%20Druid\"&gt;Totemic Druid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Totemic Druids closely identify with a particular animal, an animal that they feel represents their individual spirits. This grants the Totemic Druids a special connection to the animal kingdom, and they're able to call upon their spirits to aid them.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantage:\nGameplay \n&lt;a href=\"Shapeshifter\"&gt;Shapeshifter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe\u00a0Shapeshifters are not called Shapeshifter because they have access to a great variety of forms, but rather because of their complete dedication to a single alternate form. Shapeshifters have willingly allowed themselves to become infected with lycanthropy, but due to intense study and training they have the ability to control their afflictions. The creatures they become are that of &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt;, the most famous of the lycanthrope shape changers.\nAdvantages \nDisadvantages: \nGameplay \n&lt;a href=\"Avenger\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;.\nA member of a special sect within the druidic order, a Druid of this type is dedicated to fighting those who would defile nature.\u00a0Avengers\u00a0have powers the average Druid does not - additional abilities that have been earned through extensive rituals, a process that is very physically draining.\nAdvantages \nDisadvantages \nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nDruids receive quest level priest spells which are added to the level 7 spellbook. The spells can only be selected once. To druids, HLAs become available once they reach lvl 15. \nSpell progression.\nDruids gain additional spell slots for their &lt;a href=\"wisdom\"&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt; \n^ Usable by druids whose wisdom is 17 or higher.\n^^ Usable by druids whose wisdom is 18 or higher.\nThe above restrictions do not apply to and \"EE\": any druid whose wisdom is lower than 16 may learn lvl 6 and lvl 7 spells, including \n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nDruid protagonists are able to &lt;a href=\"Heeding%20the%20Spirit%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;heed the spirit's call&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Druid%20Grove\"&gt;Druid Grove&lt;/a&gt; once they complete &lt;a href=\"Animal%20trouble%20in%20Trademeet\"&gt;Animal trouble in Trademeet&lt;/a&gt; side quest.\nGameplay (community).\nThere is a known bug, that could be called \"Running out of Ammo\". The Druid can cast Iron Skins to improve their defenses (even in the case of the Shapeshifter), cast Energy Blades which changes the Attacks Per Round to 9. When the 20 energy blades are cast the caster keeps the improved speed for a while due to the bug, so a Druid who usually has 1 APR now has 9 APR. If the Druid wears the Girdle of Fire Giant Strength + Ixil\u00b4s Spike +6 or the Staff of the Ram +6, (even Cernd) could become very dangerous.\u00a0\nIn the case of Cernd, a combination of the Bracers of Defense AC 3 the Aura of Flaming Death, give him an acceptable armor class; with Iron Skins, the Druid (even with terrible stats) can survive pretty well in higher level play. If you want to play the Druid like a Fighter, then his first task before that is to summon Elemental Princes, Devas and cast Insect Plague.\nThe Druid (in some ways similar to the Bard) allows the player to experiment with different playstyles.\nMod content.\nWith &lt;a href=\"the%20Tweaks%20Anthology\"&gt;the Tweaks Anthology&lt;/a&gt; mod, a neutral evil Avenger can wear the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Flesh\"&gt;Human Flesh&lt;/a&gt; before the end of Shadows of Amn (when alignment change allows them to wear said armor without mods). This mod also allows the druid to use the cleric's experience table, removing druid's erratic level progression.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod overhauls and changes Druidic Spells significantly. Among other things, the mod makes druid and cleric spell selections more distinct, with druids focusing on animal and elemental spheres for a repertoire of spells oriented toward the offensive.

Afterwards, the Ward will observe the coronation proceedings until eventually &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt; (who the dukes are preparing to crown 'Grand Duke') spots the Ward, whereby the six noblemen involved in the procession will transform into &lt;a href=\"doppelganger\"&gt;doppelganger&lt;/a&gt;s and attack &lt;a href=\"Liia%20Jannath\"&gt;Liia Jannath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Belt\"&gt;Duke Belt&lt;/a&gt; and anyone else in their line of sight.

The party will learn that any incriminating evidence would be found on &lt;a href=\"Rieltar%20Anchev\"&gt;Rieltar Anchev&lt;/a&gt;, the Throne's leader in Baldur's Gate, currently in &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt; for business. This prompts Eltan to send them on the trail of Rieltar, giving them a &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Nether%20Scrolls\"&gt;precious book&lt;/a&gt; which grants entry into the fortified library when given to the &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Portal\"&gt;Keeper of the Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the player's temporary absence from the city during &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Six\"&gt;Chapter Six&lt;/a&gt;, Eltan is incapacitated through illness, and his right-hand man Scar is murdered. Eltan's illness is exacerbated, or possibly caused, by a slow poison administered by his personal healer &lt;a href=\"Rashad\"&gt;Rashad&lt;/a&gt; - who is in fact a doppelganger. Eltan's illness means that he is unable to command and thus unable to appoint his own lieutenant to replace Scar in the Flaming Fist: the job thus falls to &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Dosan\"&gt;Angelo&lt;/a&gt;, a corrupt man in &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt;'s pay. This means that even after Rashad's exposure and death it is not safe for Eltan to remain at the Flaming Fist HQ, and thus he looks for sanctuary with another ally, the &lt;a href=\"Harbor%20Master\"&gt;Harbor Master&lt;/a&gt; of Baldur's Gate.\nHe'll also provide you with a &lt;a href=\"Message%20from%20Sarevok%20to%20Rashad%20the%20doppelganger\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; that details &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;Sarevok's&lt;/a&gt; plans to have the other two remaining dukes murdered."}

Surviving in the area of Durlag's Tower is not really hard, but the building is one of the most difficult areas in the game, especially the underground levels. They are filled with traps, monsters, and many encounters are deadly (even for max-level parties) without good tactics. It is recommended to have at least one &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt; with a high find/disarm traps skill and a full party with many different classes. Those willing to brave Durlag's Tower will find many unique treasures inside.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; thief doesn't have high enough skills, the thief can be buffed with &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Perception\"&gt;Potions of Perception&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Power\"&gt;Potions of Power&lt;/a&gt; if needed, the former of which are sold by &lt;a href=\"Erdane\"&gt;Erdane&lt;/a&gt;.

The best way to do this is station a thief with high strength and a good backstab multiplier right behind her while hidden. If you have two thieves, have both of them do it. Station your other party members within easy striking distance as well. Whichever character is going to be speaking first rather than attacking first, station that character directly in front of her, as close as you can to her. Quicksave at this point. While the game is paused, have all your party members who are going to be attacking initiate their attacks, and have the speaking member initiate conversation. Once all characters are assigned their task, unpause the game. The speaking character's action should be faster than any attack, so conversation will preempt the battle. The moment the conversation is over with, though, the two backstabs should go through first to start the fight, followed by the attacks of the rest of the party. Also at this point, have your speaker join in the fight. If you can dish out enough damage fast enough, you can kill Kirinhale before she completes her teleport spell.

It consists of various rooms and a large, multi-chambered cavern. The primary objective of this level is to gain understanding about &lt;a href=\"Durlag%20Trollkiller\"&gt;Durlag's&lt;/a&gt; predicament and why he still haunts this place, long after his demise. The secondary objective is gain access to the warded room that leads to the showdown with the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Knight\"&gt;Demon Knight&lt;/a&gt;.\nDurlag's Specter.\nYou enter this level into a short hallway where the specter of Durlag is standing. He will immediately speak to you upon sight, impressed that you have been able to make it this far through the labyrinth of dungeons while informing you that there is still some things you must \"understand\" in order to complete the level and advance to confront the evil which has invaded the tower.\nThere is no defined manner in which to explore this dungeon level and the following descriptions \nabout what will be confronted are not presented in any type of order.\nBottomless Pit Room and Pain.\nWhen you enter this level the first door you see is one of two entrances to the bottomless pit room. Unlocking the door will reveal a stone bridge over a swirling pool of lava. Cross the bridge and follow the corridor around to a large chamber with a big pit in the center of it. Be careful to avoid the trap at the entrance of the chamber. There is another trap in front of the only door in the chamber. Both are &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;web traps&lt;/a&gt; which can be very inconvenient for your healers when dealing with venomous &lt;a href=\"Ettercap\"&gt;Ettercap&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Phase%20Spider\"&gt;Phase Spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Spider\"&gt;Sword Spider&lt;/a&gt;s, plus an &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Phase%20Spider\"&gt;Astral Phase Spider&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring the room further you'll notice a small alcove that contains a stone golem. Talk to it and it will pose one of three questions, the first of which can vary from game to game. Failing to answer this first question correctly results in a fiery response from the golem. Should you answer correctly, it will pose two more questions. Answering either of these incorrectly doesn't result in punishment, but it does begin the process all over again.\nThe answer to the first question is either:\nOnce you've answered the three questions correctly, the golem will give you a riddled response and the party will be teleported to a separate area known as the compass room.\nCompass Room.\nInside this circular room are four stone golems. Every time you are teleported here you'll have to answer a riddle. Answering correctly is the only way to leave the room and return to labyrinth level 4. Clues to the answer of each riddle come from talking with all four golems and what you've learned while exploring the first three dungeon levels below the tower.\nThe four stone golems represent the past inhabitants and events of the tower. Starting at the top left and moving counterclockwise they are: the doppelganger invaders, Durlag's friends and family, the builders who rebuilt the tower after the invaders were destroyed, and Durlag himself.\nThe first three will tell their stories and provide clues to the riddle that Durlag's golem will ask. Answering incorrectly will fill the room with a &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; spell, but you are also able to choose not to answer immediately if you need to question the other golems again. However, they\u2019ll just repeat what they told you before. Each time you answer the riddle correctly you will be teleported back to the hallway near Durlag's specter. If you speak with him all he\u2019ll say is:\nBelow are the three correct answers to each riddle.\nGrael, The Compass Wardstone, and Blame.\nSlime Caverns.\nShould you choose to continue exploring the hallway where you entered this level you\u2019ll find a long passageway that connects to the end of the hallway. As you explore the passageway you\u2019ll come across a pair of secret doors. The doors lead to bioluminescent caverns full of slime which Durlag subsisted on to survive in his madness. The caverns contain no traps other than pools of slime. It's best to avoid standing in the slime for too long as it deals 2 pts of acid damage per second, which will cause minimal damage, as you attempt to loot certain areas within the caverns. Enemies within these caverns include &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Crawler\"&gt;Crypt Crawler&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Ghoul\"&gt;Greater Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, so prepare to be held a lot. \nLit pools of slime contain loot and gold, and keep an eye out for secret doors as you explore.\nAs you explore the area you will eventually come across &lt;a href=\"Grael\"&gt;Grael&lt;/a&gt;, a greater ghoul who will talk to you and provide more context to this area. When the dialogue finishes he\u2019ll turn hostile. Be sure to take the &lt;a href=\"Compass%20Wardstone\"&gt;Compass Wardstone&lt;/a&gt; off his corpse.\nWhile exploring the caverns you\u2019ll come across a secret door that opens to a short passageway leading into a small bedroom which is, most likely, Durlag\u2019s final resting spot. Be sure to loot the trapped and locked chest in this room for &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Earth\"&gt;The Burning Earth&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Striking\"&gt;Staff of Striking&lt;/a&gt;. Look for a second secret door and explore some trapped passageways, one of which leads to a warded door that requires the Compass Wardstone to open. Through this door is Durlag's secret throne room.\nSecret Throne Room.\nEnter the throne room. The large pile of treasure next to the throne includes and a ton of gems. Click on the throne and you will be teleported to the compass room where you will have to answer another riddle.\nIslanne, The Bone Wardstone, and Fear.\nStore Room.\nFollowing the passageway past the slime caverns leads to a store room and the specter of &lt;a href=\"Islanne\"&gt;Islanne&lt;/a&gt;. You can talk to her and she will teleport you out of the tower if you so choose, and you can later return to this floor by re-entering one of the four elemental challenge rooms on level 3 (see &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20Walkthrough%23Bugs\"&gt;Bugs&lt;/a&gt;). Exploring this room will reveal a secret, warded door, an unlocked door, and a short passageway that leads to another unlocked door.\nForge Room.\nOpening the unlocked door reveals a short passageway that leads to the forge room. Inside the room are two &lt;a href=\"Helmed%20Horror\"&gt;Helmed Horror&lt;/a&gt;s. Loot the trapped kiln in the center of the room for the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wardstone\"&gt;Bone Wardstone&lt;/a&gt;. Go back to the short passageway in the store room and enter the rune carpet room.\nRune Carpet Room.\nUpon entering the room you will notice a brown rug on the floor that extends almost the entire width of the room. The runes on the carpet are written in the dwarven script &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3ADethek\"&gt;Dethek&lt;/a&gt; and read \"none but the dead\". Two stone statues on either end will warn you against crossing it, and doing so would unleash upon the party some very nasty effects. However, it is possible to walk around the carpet.\nOn the other side of the rug are three bed-like tombs, similar to what you saw in Kiel\u2019s room on the previous level. These represent the final resting places for Islanne, Fuernebol, and Durlag\u2019s father, Bolhur Thunderaxe. The tomb nearest the carpet is Fuernebol\u2019s and the trapped and locked chest contains his possessions including the &lt;a href=\"Krotan%27s%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Krotan's Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; mace and &lt;a href=\"Karajah%27s%20Life%20and%20Death\"&gt;Karajah's Life and Death&lt;/a&gt; leather armor . The middle tomb is Islanne\u2019s and the trapped and locked chest next to it contains her possessions including &lt;a href=\"Pellan%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Pellan's Shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arla%27s%20Dragonbane\"&gt;Arla's Dragonbane&lt;/a&gt; sling. The third tomb is Bolhur\u2019s and clicking on it will teleport you back to the compass room and another riddle.\nExiting the room through the arch doorway on the opposite side of the room will reveal a passage way the leads back to the bottomless pit room and to the machine room.\nMachine Room.\nInside this room you will find a machine where you can use the Bone Wardstone to disengage the silent trap for safe passage across the rune carpet.\nAfter you answer the third riddle correctly and are teleported back to the hallway, speak with Durlag\u2019s specter. This time he\u2019ll ask you to defeat the evil in the tower. Agree and follow him back to the store room and the warded door, which he\u2019ll open and then disappear for good.\nThe Final Battle.\nThe Last Throne Room.\nEnter the room and &lt;a href=\"Clair%20De%27Lain\"&gt;Clair De'Lain&lt;/a&gt; will hail you. She warns you about the Demon Knight and provides a possible way to defeat it by uncovering his magical Mirror of Opposition. The trapped and locked chest in this room contains a &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Shield\"&gt;Cloak of the Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemon Knight Chamber.\nEnter into the Demon Knight's chamber where he will address you and taunt you. You can attempt to kill him in a one-on-six fight, which may not be too difficult for a maximum level party pre-buffed with all available buff spells like Bless, Chant, Haste, and others. You can also try to attack the Mirror of Opposition next to the Demon Knight as soon as possible. The mirror will duplicate everyone in its gaze creating &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Fiend\"&gt;Mirror Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s. The duplicates of your party members are hostile and will attack the party whereas the duplicate of the Demon Knight will attack him. For the most experience you should ensure you kill the real Demon Knight first. Prepare your party with enchantments and consider a mix of ranged and melee attacks. Be warned that the Demon Knight may strip characters of their enchantments with his spells.\nConclusion.\nAfter slaying the Demon Knight, take the &lt;a href=\"Soultaker%20Dagger\"&gt;Soultaker Dagger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Opposite%20Alignment\"&gt;Helmet of Opposite Alignment&lt;/a&gt; from its corpse and talk to &lt;a href=\"Dalton\"&gt;Dalton&lt;/a&gt; on the northeast top of the landing. Return to the throne room and talk to Clair. She will tell you of her fear that the Demon Knight serves an even greater power and with that ominous statement will depart.\nGo back to the store room and talk to Islanne, this time accepting her offer to be teleported out of the tower, and close out the tormented history of Durlag's Tower once and for all. And with the dagger in your inventory, go to &lt;a href=\"Ulgoth%27s%20Beard\"&gt;Ulgoth's Beard&lt;/a&gt; to finally bring your long &lt;a href=\"Recovering%20%22Soultaker%22\"&gt;Recovering \"Soultaker\"&lt;/a&gt; quest to its final conclusion.\nTreasure.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28treasure%29\"&gt;Durlag's Tower (treasure)&lt;/a&gt;"}

These emanate from the circular room in front of you and are &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;s that regularly explode from the center of the room at roughly six and a half second intervals. With careful timing you can walk each of your party members to one of three exits (two doors and an open passageway) within the room without getting fried. There is also a couple of piles of loot on the floor of the room.\n\"Tip: You can also &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; each member of the party or use &lt;a href=\"The%20Paws%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;The Paws of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, passing the boots into each character's inventory to get everyone across the room, though the extra speed should not be necessary.\"\nBestiary Room.\nThe top door leads to the largest of the three rooms called the bestiary room. Inside is a massive skeleton of &lt;a href=\"Durlag%20Trollkiller\"&gt;Durlag's&lt;/a&gt; dragon Mechezarin. Upon entering the room a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; immediately greets you with a summary of the nature of the room and what it contains.\nNote: If you circle around and enter from the Southwest, it is possible to revive one or more of the Five Heroes prior to encountering the Unique Talking Skeleton. Doing so results in the hero(s) attacking Skeleton without it fighting back. Killing Skeleton, before it can talk to you, requires dealing 100 HP, with a Thief in stealth-mode, \"beyond\" the Fog of War. Getting any closer, even when successfully hiding in shadows results in Skeleton delivering its monologue followed immediately by its death-scene. Killing Skeleton only gets you 65 XP (divided by up to 6 N/PCs) and no loot; however, the following comparison of each Hero against Skeleton gives the player an estimate of each Hero's worth in Battle:\nCombat Strategies:\nNotable loot from the heros include &lt;a href=\"Full%20Plate%20Mail\"&gt;Full Plate Mail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Biting\"&gt;Arrows of Biting&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Long Sword +1&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuspended Platforms Room.\nThe center door leads to a room of six circular, suspended platforms connected together with wooden walkways. The platforms contain both traps and skeletons (17 total). Unlike typical skeletons, these skeletons come equipped with magical arrows including: arrows of &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Dispelling\"&gt;dispelling&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of the platforms also have loot on the floor.\nGarden Maze Room.\nThe bottom passageway leads a door that opens to the garden maze room. This is the toughest of the three rooms to get through. Hiding within the maze are three &lt;a href=\"Ashirukuru\"&gt;Ashirukuru&lt;/a&gt;s that can deal some serious backstab damage. There are several &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Ghoul\"&gt;Greater Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s found lurking throughout the maze too. And there are also many traps. In the center is a trapped container with lots of treasure, the most noteworthy of which is &lt;a href=\"Bala%27s%20Axe\"&gt;Bala's Axe&lt;/a&gt;.\nHallway.\nNo matter which of the three rooms you explored first, they all exit into a long hallway that contains two greater ghouls and an alcove with stone masks that, when clicking on them, provide hints about the rest of the challenges that await. Beware that a trap is on the floor of this alcove. A few items of loot are also on the floor for the taking. You'll also notice four doors along the hallway. As mentioned previously, these doors lead to elemental challenges that must be completed to advance to the next level of the dungeon.\nElemental Challenges.\nThe four challenges below are ordered from top to bottom regarding their location in the hallway. There is no required order to complete all four of the challenges.\n\"Cold Elemental Challenge\".\nIn this chamber, the chamber of ice, there are four &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Wolf\"&gt;winter wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kaldran%20the%20Bear\"&gt;Kaldran the Bear&lt;/a&gt;. Kaldran is the only enemy required to be killed here. But this only applies if this challenge area is the last one you attempt. Though good luck escaping without the wolves attacking as well, plus you get four pelts if you kill all of them.\n\"Tactical Note\": Send in only one party member that has 100% immunity to cold and either downs a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Potion of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; or is equipped with &lt;a href=\"Edventar%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Edventar's Gift&lt;/a&gt;. If they use ranged attacks, all enemies can be easily dispatched.\n\"Earth Elemental Challenge\".\nIn this chamber, the chamber of slime, there is a &lt;a href=\"Fission%20Slime\"&gt;Fission Slime&lt;/a&gt;. It can only be killed by fire, otherwise it will keep splitting and multiplying. Fireball, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, potions dealing fire damage, and arrows of fire are all good methods for eliminating this slime.\n\"Tactical Note\": If you buff a strong melee combatant with &lt;a href=\"Protection%20from%20Poison\"&gt;Protection from Poison&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Potion of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; and give them one or two &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;Potions of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; on standby for escape if needed, you can have them attack and \"intentionally\" cause the slime to split. Then have a mage, standing at maximum range, target the extra slime with &lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt; or a couple of blasts from a &lt;a href=\"The%20Victor\"&gt;ring of energy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter it is hit with fire, the melee character should be able to kill it without it splitting (works about 90% of the time, only a couple times it might split again). Then the melee combatant can make the original slime spit again and, as long as one of the slimes is never hit with fire damage, you should be able to repeat this tactic as needed to raise your party's XP.\n\"Air Elemental Challenge\".\nIn this chamber, the chamber of wind, there is an &lt;a href=\"Air%20Aspect\"&gt;Air Aspect&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Stalker\"&gt;invisible stalkers&lt;/a&gt;. The air aspect is the only enemy required to be killed here. But this only applies if this challenge area is the last one you attempt. And it can be fairly easy to escape without encountering the invisible stalkers if you don't venture too far into the chamber. Casting &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Invisibility\"&gt;Detect Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; will reveal the invisible stalkers.\n\"Tactical Note\": Drawing the air aspect out of the room and into the hallway will reduce the possibility of the invisible stalkers attacking the party, unless of course you want the additional XP.\n\"Fire Elemental Challenge\".\nIn this chamber, the chamber of fire, there are two &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Guard\"&gt;Phoenix Guard&lt;/a&gt;s. The male phoenix guard is the only enemy required to be killed here. But this only applies if this challenge area is the last one you attempt.\n\"Tactical Note\": Again, drawing the male phoenix guard out of the room and into the hallway will reduce the possibility of the female phoenix guard attacking the party, unless of course you want the additional XP.\nOnce you have completed the last of all four challenges, the party will be immediately teleported to the chessboard.\nChessboard.\nYou will find your party arranged on a giant chessboard. An ethereal voice will provide basic rules which you should follow closely unless you want to face several lightning attacks. The full rules of the game are as follows:\nObviously obeying these rules is quite difficult during the heat of battle. You can ignore the movement rules by using &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Lightning\"&gt;Protection From Lightning&lt;/a&gt; scrolls or &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Absorption\"&gt;Potion of Absorption&lt;/a&gt;. This really works well if you're playing solo. Just give your character 100% immunity to electricity, go invisible, and stroll right across the board and out the exit door.\nOne tactic is to ensure you don't travel beyond the squares occupied by the statues and instead make the enemies come to you. Cast &lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chant\"&gt;Chant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil\"&gt;Protection From Evil&lt;/a&gt; and other enchantments, then use ranged weapons and spells, including summoning and area-effect spells to provoke them.\nAnother tactic is not to move at all and just cast fireballs to the opposite side of the board, potentially wiping out all enemies without ever needing to see them. In any case, kill the &lt;a href=\"Pawn\"&gt;pawns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rook\"&gt;rooks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bishop\"&gt;bishops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen\"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;. When you have defeated the enemy king, be sure to loot him for &lt;a href=\"The%20World%27s%20Edge\"&gt;The World's Edge&lt;/a&gt;. There is an exit door on the other side of the board that leads to &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20Four%29\"&gt;Labyrinth Level 4&lt;/a&gt; which is the final dungeon level below the tower."}
{"id": "42346", "revid": "31124876", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=42346", "title": "Durlag's Tower (Labyrinth Level Two)", "text": "The third subterranean level below &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Durlag's Tower&lt;/a&gt; is the Labyrinth Level Two dungeon.\nThis level contains many doors and switches, dozens of traps, quite a few silent traps and some great loot. Be aware that navigating this level without a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; with maxed detect trap skill will consume a lot of healing power. Also be cognizant of the fact that depending on what path you take to explore this level may determine how many &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Doppelganger\"&gt;Greater Doppelganger&lt;/a&gt; forms of Durlag\u2019s family you will encounter.\nThe First Four Rooms.\nStatue Room.\nYou enter the level into a circular antechamber. Three of the doors are warded shut and require switches to be activated to open them. The only open door leads to the statue room. Entering the statue room and turning the switch on the statue above the doppelganger floor rug opens Door 1 and closes Door 2 (if open). Turning the switch on the statue below the rug opens Door 2 and closes Door 1 (if open).\nPractice Room.\nDoor 1 leads to the practice room. There are multiple traps in this room so be aware. Attacking the silver sparring dummy on the right is the \"first trigger\" necessary to open Door 3. Attacking the red sparring dummy in the middle always opens or closes Door 2. Attacking the gold sparring dummy on the left will open Doors 4 and 5 and close Door 1 (once only). A false &lt;a href=\"Durlag%20Trollkiller\"&gt;Durlag&lt;/a&gt; will appear in the passageway behind Door 5. He\u2019ll teleport around the room before casting a &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; spell and then shapeshifting into his true form \u2013 a greater doppelganger which will cast &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, and attack.\nEaster egg: You can destroy sparring dummies and loot them like normal containers. You need to either cast Magic resistance spell on them (Druid level5 spell) or attack with a weapon which deals poison damage (it will take a long time because dummies almost always save vs. death). Dummies give 0xp. \nSilver sparring dummy: 8 potions of healing, 2 potions of heroism. Gold sparring dummy: Potion of master thievery, 19 arrows+1, 5 acid arrow, 11 arrows of fire, 12 ice arrows, 6 arrows+2. Red sparring dummy: Otiluke's resilient sphere, Defensive harmony, Protection from lightning, Champion's strength.\nIslanne's Room.\nDoor 2 leads to &lt;a href=\"Islanne\"&gt;Islanne's&lt;/a&gt; room. Removing &lt;a href=\"Fuernebol\"&gt;Fuernebol's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fuernebol%20Wardstone\"&gt;wardstone&lt;/a&gt; from the table on the left side of the bed opens or closes Door 1. Removing &lt;a href=\"Kiel%20the%20Legion%20Killer\"&gt;Kiel's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kiel%20Wardstone\"&gt;wardstone&lt;/a&gt; from the table on the right side of the bed is the \"second trigger\" necessary to open Door 3. Removing Islanne's &lt;a href=\"Islanne%20Wardstone\"&gt;wardstone&lt;/a&gt; from the table near the chairs opens Doors 6 and 7 and closes Door 2 (once only). A false Durlag will appear in the passageway behind Door 7 and teleport around the room before casting a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; spell and then shapeshifting into his true form \u2013 a greater doppelganger which will cast mirror image and haste, and attack.\n\"Tip: It is not necessary to inventory all three of the wardstones. Practice putting each of them in your inventory one at a time, watch what happens, then put them back where each came from. But do not put back Islanne's stone until Durlag has finished teleporting around the room and has cast his spell. Caution - If you accidently put the wrong stone on the wrong table...oops!\"\nThrone Room.\nOpening Door 3 will allow you to enter the throne room. Doors 8 and 9 in this room aren\u2019t warded and are able to be picked by a thief. Door 8 provides access to the torture chamber room and Door 9 provides access to the switch room, which may be useful if you've shut yourself off from a room inadvertently.\nPicking up &lt;a href=\"Kiel%27s%20Helmet\"&gt;Kiel's Helmet&lt;/a&gt; located on the floor in front of the throne will bring forth the final false Durlag for this segment of the dungeon. Durlag will appear in the circular antechamber and teleport through the passageway into the room. He will then begin his lament for Kiel while teleporting around the room. Fuernebol and Islanne will also enter the room at this time from Doors 8 and 9 respectively and Door 3 will close. Once Durlag finishes with his dialogue, all three will cast spells; Durlag and Fuernebol will cast Stinking Cloud and Islanne will cast &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;. They will then immediately shapeshift into their true greater doppelganger forms, cast mirror image and haste, and attack.\n(Combat tip) If you want to make the throne room fight easier you should leave everyone except a &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;hasted&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"The%20Paws%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;The Paws of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;-equipped) character in the entrance chamber. Send the speedy character to grab Kiel's Helmet and run back to join the group before Door 3 closes. You can wait for the spells in the throne room to wear off and then attack the silver sparring dummy again to re-open Door 3. By using this method, there's a chance for one or more of the doppelgangers to also take damage from the Cloudkill. If you have access to &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt;, you can also leave some skeletons in the throne room before taking Kiel's Helmet. They can withstand the effects of Cloudkill and fight for you. It's possible to kill some of the greater doppelgangers before you re-open Door 3.\nTorture Chamber and Teleport Rooms.\nThe torture chamber room is filled with many floor traps, leading to the teleport room. Other than that it is of no special significance, besides containing &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Goblet\"&gt;Durlag's Goblet&lt;/a&gt; on the floor. However, it does lead to the teleport room which does have some significance. When you enter the teleport room, the second of two \"silent traps\" will be triggered. (The first silent trap is located in the passageway between the throne and torture chamber rooms). Two greater doppelgangers will spawn near the back of the torture chamber room. Their forms will be randomly chosen between Durlag, Islanne, Fuernebol, Kiel, or a greater doppelganger. During combat both will shapeshift between different family members, mostly based on damage taken, and when they do they will have all of the spells available to either Islanne or Kiel (at full capacity) each time they shapeshift into their forms.\nTo move from one side of the teleport room to the other will require a &lt;a href=\"Teleportation%20Wardstone\"&gt;Teleportation Wardstone&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in a pot near the dividing point of the room. Once the stone is inventoried the floor sigil will glow. Click on it to teleport to the other side of room. The pot on the other side also contains a teleportation wardstone, in case you were to enter from that side of the room first.\nSwitch and Trophy Rooms.\nEntering the switch room through Door 9 will reveal eleven switches on the wall that is opposite the throne room. These switches will open and close Doors 1-11. Here is the key to all eleven switches:\nTop Row \u2013 1 2 3 4 5\nBottom Row - 6 7 10 11 8 9\nExiting the switch room through Door 10 will lead to a passageway that ends at the trophy room. Like the torture chamber room, this room has no special significance other than being filled with traps. It has two exits, one that follows a short passageway back to the master bedroom (Door 11) and the other that leads to the bridge room (Door 13).\nBridge Room.\nHere\u2019s where it really gets fun. Opening Door 13 will reveal a greater doppelganger standing on a stone bridge impersonating Fuernebol. Entering into the room will reveal two greater doppelgangers on separate bridges impersonating Islanne and a second Fuernebol. Also be aware that entering the room will trigger the second of two silent traps. (The first silent trap is located in the passageway between the throne and switch rooms).\nTriggering the silent trap will spawn two greater doppelgangers in the passageway that leads to Kiel\u2019s room. Their forms will again be randomly chosen between Durlag, Islanne, Fuernebol, Kiel, or a greater doppelganger. During combat all five will shapeshift between different family members, mostly based on damage taken, and when they do they will have all of the spells available to either Islanne or Kiel (at full capacity) each time they shapeshift into their forms. Also, the doorway to this passageway is trapped and unless you are able to get a thief over there pronto to disarm it, the doppelgangers will trigger it when they enter the room.\nKiel\u2019s Room.\nFollowing the passageway from the bridge room will lead to Kiel\u2019s room. There are four &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Doom%20Guard\"&gt;Dwarven Doom Guard&lt;/a&gt;s are standing sentinel. Looting the trapped and locked trunk at the foot of the bed and removing either &lt;a href=\"Kiel%27s%20Morning%20Star\"&gt;Kiel's Morning Star&lt;/a&gt; and/or his &lt;a href=\"Kiel%27s%20Buckler\"&gt;Buckler&lt;/a&gt; will turn the guards hostile.\nIf you are having trouble with the guards, try loading up your &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;(s) with &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt; and cast &lt;a href=\"Otiluke%27s%20Resilient%20Sphere\"&gt;Otiluke's Resilient Sphere&lt;/a&gt; on the party member who raids the trunk. The doom guards generally attack the party member who raids the trunk, so once your party member is immunized to the damage, one can defeat the guards one by one by stunning them with chromatic orb and destroying them with magic while they are focused on the immune party member.\nAn alternative approach would be to bait them all the way to the teleport room and teleport your party to the other side. The guards will not be able to touch you, but still be on the other side, making it easy to take them down one by one with ranged attacks. However, this will only work if: \nYet another approach would be to attack them before they attack you. Mages can simply cast fireballs into the room to soften them up. Or a strategy with less risk involved would be to cast &lt;a href=\"Feeblemind\"&gt;Feeblemind&lt;/a&gt; on all of them before attacking. This will make the guards non-aggressive even when you are attacking them, making for an easy kill with no damage to your characters.\nThe Ghast Passageway.\nWhen you exit Kiel\u2019s room, you\u2019ll enter an octagonal room with a trapped false stairway and a warded door (Door 15) that leads to &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20Three%29\"&gt;labyrinth level 3&lt;/a&gt; of the dungeon. Triggering the false stairs trap will activate a stinking cloud spell and summon three &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s if you fancy a fight.\nContinuing on will bring you to the &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghast&lt;/a&gt; passageway. It is trapped with active and silent traps. Door 17 is at the end of the passageway and opening it leads to the altar room.\nAltar Room.\nThis room contains four altar-like containers and a statue that can be looted. Watch for traps. Door 16 is located in this room. Opening it leads to a small chamber which is floor trapped and has a trapped statue that contains the &lt;a href=\"Level%202%20Exit%20Wardstone\"&gt;Level 2 Exit Wardstone&lt;/a&gt;, along with two more altars of loot on either side.\nExiting the other side of the room leads back to the teleport room.\nWith the level 2 exit wardstone in your possession, you are now able to open Door 15 and exit to the &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20Three%29\"&gt;third level of the dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nTreasure.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28treasure%29\"&gt;Durlag's Tower (treasure)&lt;/a&gt;"}

Upon your arrival &lt;a href=\"Caelar%20Argent\"&gt;Caelar Argent&lt;/a&gt; fights her way through a group of devils to reach them.\nBattle.\nUpon entering the area a long conversation between Belhifet and Caelar follows, where it is revealed that the real reason for the &lt;a href=\"Crusade\"&gt;Crusade&lt;/a&gt; was to save her uncle Aun Argent, who had given himself up years ago to save his then still adolescent niece. Depending on the player's dialogue choices Caelar will either become Belhifet's &lt;a href=\"blackguard\"&gt;blackguard&lt;/a&gt; (which results in Hephernaan being executed on the spot) or join forces with the protagonist (and even join the party, if there is room for her). Depending on the outcome the player has to then either battle Belhifet &amp; Hephernaan or Belhifet &amp; Caelar.\nBelhifet uses a fear aura and has two unique abilities called Blazing Inferno &amp; Infernal Conveyance which are both very strong fire based attacks (the first one being a widespread AoE attack). Furthermore, on the Core Rules difficulty setting he can only be hit with +3 weapons and he himself is immune to fire. So make sure to bring both fire and fear protection with you. He also has a damage reduction of 33% vs. physical-based damage.\nAt the start of the battle, Belhifet will cast &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; on the party member nearest to him, effectively removing all prebuffs from the affected party members. To counter that, move a hasted member who is under the effect of &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;: Abjuration to where Hephernaan is, Belhifet will cast Dispel on that party member, but the spell will be wasted due to the SI protection while the other party members are also unaffected because they're out of the spell range. This strategy will let you preserve all prebuffs which help considerably with survival on higher difficulties.\nThe only loot drops in this battle come from Hephernaan, neither Belhifet nor Caelar drop anything.\nAfter defeating him, the party is brought back to the entrance portal through which they entered Avernus."}

The flowers do have some internal traits that suggest them granting immunity may have been considered at some point. But the curse itself actually only ever impacts party members and the flowers won't prevent them from transforming.\nIn the Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate the flowers are a consumable with five effect codes. Effects 0 and 1 simply make the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"golems\"&gt;golems&lt;/a&gt; and creatures with &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;poison resistance&lt;/a&gt; immune to the flowers' other effects. Effect 2 applies 6 points of poison damage per second, for 60 seconds (total 360). The poison damage is non-magical and thus cannot be dispelled, but can be treated with potions or clerical spells (either cure the poison effect, or simply counteract the damage with healing). The fifth effect adds a portrait icon for the poison effect.\nMore interestingly, the fourth effect they will try to apply is a Polymorph (opcode 135) with an empty creature resource. In the original Baldur's Gate/Tales of the Sword Coast this combination is used to undo other polymorph effects before they expire. It might, perhaps, have been intended as a method of curing the party of lycanthropy at an earlier development stage when the curse caused a werewolf transformation without actually killing the party or ending the game (which might also explain why exactly six plants are available).\nThis consumable effect is also the cause of the flowers odd pricing: They are actually configured as single-use items that vanish when they run out of charges, but all the ones the player can collect in-game have zero charges remaining, making the item state invalid. Since single-use consumables are not supposed to persist after their last charge is used, the game engine erroneously allows the player to consume them (bringing them down to -1 charges) before they disappear. Merchants, on the other hand, treat them as charge-depleted items worth 1GP, and then recharge them like any other enchanted item with charges. This is visible when you sell one to a store and then buy it back: The purchased item will have a sub-scripted number indicating that it has one charge. This pricing is arguably a bug in the original Tales of the Sword Coast, a mod or patch could correct it either by removing the magic effect entirely, or by setting the six instances of the item in the game to start with one charge each instead of zero.\nIn dialog lines exist (starting with string #70635 \"I have this belladonna flower I picked up on an island of werewolves...\") in which the player may offer these to &lt;a href=\"Neera\"&gt;Neera&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative to &lt;a href=\"Belladonna\"&gt;Belladonna&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Call%20of%20the%20Wild%20Mage\"&gt;The Call of the Wild Mage&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the regular SoD quest items, picking these up while Neera is in the party will not trigger dialog or a quest update. To offer these flowers you must talk to Nerra while all of the following conditions are met: You have started the quest, you \"do not\" have Neera in the party, you are not carrying and have not given Neera the SoD Belladonna item, and of course you must have Belladonna Flowers in your inventory."}

After the trial, you need to speak to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Samand\"&gt;Captain Samand&lt;/a&gt; and you will learn that he is rather doubtful about the case, and that his initial prime suspect was a man named &lt;a href=\"Kiser%20Jhaeri\"&gt;Kiser Jhaeri&lt;/a&gt;.

She promises that she'll try to convince &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Inspector%20Brega\"&gt;Chief Inspector Brega&lt;/a&gt; to give you access to the witness he is hiding.\n8+ hours later, Bylanna's messenger Myroven approaches you outdoors and tells you that the witness who observed the village poisoning is in the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Flagons%20Inn\"&gt;Five Flagons Inn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nEither let Myroven teleport you there immediately or travel there at your own leasure.\nOPTIONAL: If you didn't take the teleport option, you can talk to &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Inspector%20Brega\"&gt;Chief Inspector Brega&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six%20Building\"&gt;government council building&lt;/a&gt; about it first, but this doesn't change anything.\nEither way, when you arrive on the second floor of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Flagons%20Inn\"&gt;Five Flagons Inn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20District\"&gt;Bridge District&lt;/a&gt;, Myroven leads you into the room where you meet the witness Baevrin and his bodyguards Terahn, Merahn, and Ardelios.&lt;br&gt;\nTalk to Baevrin, and get him to admit that he lied in his witness statement about seeing Kova commit the poisoning \"(up to 18,000 exp)\" and that the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thieves&lt;/a&gt; are holding his girlfriend Adylin hostage.&lt;br&gt;\nAfterwards, he and his guards disappear to another safehouse.\n8+ hours later, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thief&lt;/a&gt; merchant &lt;a href=\"Arledrian\"&gt;Arledrian&lt;/a&gt; approaches you outdoors. (Alternatively, you can have this conversation earlier by going to \"him\" on the second floor of &lt;a href=\"Gaelan%20Bayle%27s%20Home\"&gt;Gaelan Bayle's Home&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br&gt;\nIn exchange for 500 , he tells you that Adylin is being held in &lt;a href=\"Delosar%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Delosar's Inn&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnter the top-most floor of &lt;a href=\"Delosar%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Delosar's Inn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20District\"&gt;Bridge District&lt;/a&gt;, to find Adylin guarded by multiple captors. Combat ensues.\nInitially, only 4 enemies are in the room, but more spawn as soon as combat starts (depending on whether you arrived here early or late, and on the &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; score of the protagonist):\nAfter her captors are defeated, save the game and then talk to Adylin.&lt;br&gt;\nYou automatically travel to the upper floor of the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20House\"&gt;horn house&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20District\"&gt;Bridge District&lt;/a&gt; with her, where you meet up with Myroven and Baevrin.&lt;br&gt;\nBaevrin promises to correct his witness statement, and asks you how to get it done. You can choose:\nIf Baevrin survived, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Inspector%20Brega\"&gt;Chief Inspector Brega&lt;/a&gt; officially records Baevrin's revised testimony, which exculpates Kova of the village poisoning \"(24,000 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt;, +1 &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;)\".&lt;br&gt;\nIf Baevrin died, Brega instead adds a note about these happenings to the evidence list, which at least casts doubt on Baevrin's original testimony \"(12,000 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt;)\".\nCapturing Seida.\nWhen you enter &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%206\"&gt;chapter 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gaelan%20Bayle\"&gt;Gaelan Bayle&lt;/a&gt; approaches you and hands you \"Renal's Note\" which suggests that &lt;a href=\"Renal%20Bloodscalp\"&gt;Renal Bloodscalp&lt;/a&gt; has information about Kova's case.\nTravel to the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Docks District&lt;/a&gt;, and meet &lt;a href=\"Renal%20Bloodscalp\"&gt;Renal Bloodscalp&lt;/a&gt; on the upper floor of the main &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thief%20Guildhall\"&gt;Shadow Thief Guildhall&lt;/a&gt;. In return for 3000 , he informs you that his rival guildmaster Seida has a blade just like the one that implicated Kova in the nobles' murders \"(9000 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt;)\".\nOPTIONAL: \"Arledrian encounter\"\nOPTIONAL: \"Bribing Edwin\"\nComplete the &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%206\"&gt;chapter 6&lt;/a&gt; story-line portion &lt;a href=\"The%20final%20battle%20with%20Bodhi\"&gt;The final battle with Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven't already. &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt; is now willing to help you capture Seida, provided that you already found all the previous pieces of evidence for Kova's innocence:\nPay &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt; 7000 \"(or get his help for free by telling him what you learned from the optional Arledrian encounter)\". When you are ready, he gives you 4 runes and teleports you to a dark alleyway where you finally meet guildmaster Seida.\nSeida and Kova have an emotional exchange of words, where some backstory is revealed:\nSeida then attacks you with many of his underlings, and &lt;a href=\"Edwin\"&gt;Edwin&lt;/a&gt; betrays you and also fights on Seida's side.

He offers to enter the special prison to keep an eye on Seida for you, but wants you to buy him a recording device first.&lt;br&gt;\n(If your speaking party member has 12+ INT or 12+ WIS, you can convince Dayven to infiltrate the prison as a prisoner rather than a guard.)&lt;br&gt;\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"Ribald%20Barterman\"&gt;Ribald Barterman&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer%27s%20Mart\"&gt;Adventurer's Mart&lt;/a&gt; to loan \"The Everseeing Eye\" for a 6000 deposit, and bring it to Dayven.\n2+ days after the trial, either Myroven or Investigator Dayven appears to tell you that Seida has broken out of prison.&lt;br&gt;\nIf Dayven went into the special prison as a guard, then he was killed during the assault.&lt;br&gt;\nIf Dayven went into the special prison as a prisoner, then he is the one to give you the news, and hands you back the eye \u2013 which now contains a recording of the breakout.\nIf you got the eye with the recording, present it to &lt;a href=\"Corneil\"&gt;Corneil&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six%20Building\"&gt;council building&lt;/a&gt;. You watch the recording together, and see Kharen breaking out Seida (as well as them admitting that Kharen is Seida's daughter and one of his double-agents).&lt;br&gt;\nThis convinces Corneil that Kova really is innocent of the enforcer murders. You get 36,000 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;exp&lt;/a&gt;, a free &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; magic license, and the Cowled Wizard assassination attempts against Kova stop.\nWedding.\nIf you complete the main story with Kova and Kiyone in the party, then at the very end, &lt;a href=\"Ellesime\"&gt;Ellesime&lt;/a&gt; officiates the wedding ceremony to marry Kova and Kiyone.\nToB.\nThe mod author planned to add additional quest content for the \"\" portion of the game, but apparently this never materialized.\nAppendix.\nWhat causes them to leave the party.\nObviously, making severe choices like handing Kova over to the authorities causes Kova and Kiyone to leave.

Bhaal was originally a mortal assassin who ascended to godhood with the aid of his companions Bane and Myrkul. They traveled the realms seeking power and eventually killed one of the Seven Lost Gods whose power they divided amongst themselves. Then they went at last to the Gray Wastes of Hades, where Jergal dwelt, intent on taking his power by force but he surrendered it willingly.\nThe three then fought over his power until Jergal suggested they divide it up and decide who got what with a game of skill. Bane won and, having first choice, took the portfolio of fear, hatred, strife and tyranny. Myrkul was second, and chose the portfolio of the dead. Bhaal came out the loser of their game, and was left the realm of murder as his own, but Bhaal found it suited him well, and thought it the best of the three.\nBhaal's demise.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Time%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Time of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, most gods, including Bhaal, were forced to walk upon the face of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Faer%C3%BBn\"&gt;Faer\u00fbn&lt;/a&gt; as mortals, and lost all their godly powers. During this period, Bhaal was slain by the then-mortal &lt;a href=\"Cyric\"&gt;Cyric&lt;/a&gt; with the 'sword' &lt;a href=\"Mask\"&gt;Godsbane&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0atop &lt;a href=\"Boareskyr%20Bridge\"&gt;Boareskyr Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Bhaal, having foreseen his own death, had impregnated countless mortal women, whose children carried a piece of his divine essence within them. These children are referred to as the children of Bhaal, or &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt;, and were created to ensure Bhaal's resurrection. To this end, Bhaal sought to have all his children slain after his demise so his essence could be freed and gather at the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Forge\"&gt;Mana Forge&lt;/a&gt;. Once all the pieces of his divine essence had been collected, he left it to his most trusted deathstalker, &lt;a href=\"Amelyssan\"&gt;Amelyssan&lt;/a&gt;, to perform the correct rites to bring about his resurrection and help him regain his power.\nGameplay.\nBhaal is mentioned on a multitude of occasions throughout the entirety of the series. His unholy symbol, the skull surrounded by a ring of tear drops, is the logo of the first &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, it's and . The latter one even has his name in the title. The entire story revolves around his legacy in form of his countless children, the Bhaalspawn, most notably &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarevok\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Five\"&gt;The Five&lt;/a&gt;.\nSiege of Dragonspear.\nAt the end of &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Nine%20%E2%80%93%20Boareskyr%20Bridge\"&gt;Chapter Nine&lt;/a&gt;, Gorion's Ward has a vision of Cyric murdering Bhaal with Godsbane, when they cross Boareskyr Bridge.\nShadows of Amn.\nDuring a dream sequence in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%204\"&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt; he appears in the form of \"the instinct\" (using the guise of Sarevok). Gorion's Ward has to lure him into the library where the dream version of\u00a0Imoen will make him vulnerable, so that they can strike him down with combined forces. The dream ends after he is defeated. See the &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Dreams (Shadows of Amn)&lt;/a&gt; page for more information. For the breakdown of the stats and abilities of this dream version of Bhaal see the &lt;a href=\"Bhaal%20%28dream%29\"&gt;Bhaal (dream)&lt;/a&gt; page.\nShortly after that, Gorion's Ward will gain the ability to transform into one of Bhaal's avatars, the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrone of Bhaal.\nIn the very finale of the series, in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%2010\"&gt;Chapter 10&lt;/a&gt;, Gorion's Ward either destroys or absorbs what ever is left of Bhaal's essence in the world and even gets the option to take his place as the new Lord of Murder.\nTemples.\nUnlike most other temples in the games, the temples of Bhaal do not offer any services."}

It is implied that it becomes the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane\"&gt;Pocket Plane&lt;/a&gt; in '.\nArea Description.\nIrenicus lies hidden behind the Abyssal Door in the northern section of the map. To open it, Gorion's Ward must undertake the five Trials and retrieve the Tear of Bhaal hidden at the end of each Trial.\u00a0\nTo the east is the Test of Pride.\nTo the west is the Test of Wrath.\nTo the south is the Test of Selfishness.\nTo the southeast is the Test of Fear.\nTo the southwest is the Test of Greed.\nThe Trials can be undertaken in any order. The first \"examiner\" will explain the Domain's nature to Gorion's Ward when confronted, and the final Trial will fully clarify what is happening and why the tests are occuring.\nOnce a Tear of Bhaal has been acquired, clicking on the Abyssal Door will remove that Tear from the party's inventory, progresses the party a step towards the FInal Battle, and imbues Gorion's Ward with a special ability, dependent on the Trial that the Tear comes from and the choice that they made for solving that Trial.\nChoosing an Evil path may potentially cause Gorion's Ward to experience a change in their Moral alignment to Evil.\nTest of Pride.\nUpon entering the Test of Pride, a demon begins to flatter Gorion's Ward about their might, explaining that a powerful beast lies just beyond and exhorting them to defeat it so they may claim the Tear. If the player remains suspicious of its flattery, however, the demon is eventually forced to confess that the guardian may just give them the Tear if they ask it nicely.\nIf the player declares they will ask for the Tear, then demon comments on how humility, properly used, can be a source of great power. It vanishes and the Tear's guardian, a Black Dragon, hands it over peacefully. This is the Path of Good. The Tear of Bhaal will grant Gorion's Ward +20% Resistance to Fire, Cold and Electricity.\nIf the player arrogantly or reluctantly declares they will fight the guardian for the tear, then the demon vanishes, forcing them to confront a Black Dragon. When slain, it grants the party 22000 EXP, as well as leaving behind loot in the form of the Tear of Bhaal, Scrolls of Time Stop, Wail of the Banshee and Sphere of Chaos, 20 Bolts of Lightning, 20 Arrows of Dispelling, a Ring of Protection +2, and a Robe of the Evil Archmagi. This is the Path of Evil. The Tear of Bhaal will grant Gorion's Ward (possibly the party) 200000 EXP.\nTest of Fear.\nUpon entering the Test of Fear, a demon explains how the Tear of Bhaal can be reached by either of two routes; a chamber filled with Beholders (specifically, Elder Orbs and Gauths) or a chamber where potent magic will attack the player's mind. They offer the player a Cloak of Bravery, fashioned from the skins of nymphs, to defend them against the terrors beyond.\nIf the player refuses, they must still make their way through either room. Any effect that grants Fear Immunity, such as Mazzy's Invoke Courage special ability, will protect them against the madness room. The beholder room is simply a tough fight.\nIf the player accepts the Cloak of Bravery, then\u00a0the Tear of Bhaal will grant Gorion's Ward\u00a0a +2 bonus to Constitution. This is the Evil path.\nIf the player refuses the cloak, then the Tear of Bhaal renders Gorion's Ward immune to any weapon that is not equivalent to a +2 or higher enchantment. This is the Good path.\nNote: Refusing the Cloak of Bravery, but going through the madness path first, might lead to the alignment of Gorion's Ward changing even though they receive the Good Path Tear's reward.\nTest of Selfishness.\nUpon entering the Test of Selfishness, a demon explains that Gorion's Ward must take one of two paths; the one on the left will drain away some of their power, whilst the other will steal the life from one of their companions. The demon then kidnaps and paralyses a random party member, leaving the player to make their choice.\u00a0\nTaking the Good Path in this Trial will cost the player: -2 from Maximum Hit Point Value, -1 Dexterity, and - an undetermined amount of EXP.\u00a0The Tear of Bhaal will grant Gorion's Ward\u00a0+10% Magic Resistance.\nTaking the Evil Path will kill the abducted companion, though they can be subjected to a Raise Dead or Resurrection spell without issue. The Tear of Bhaal will grant Gorion's Ward a +2 bonus to their Armor Class.\nTest of Greed.\nUpon entering the Test of Greed, a demon tells Gorion's Ward that the Tear lies in the possession of a powerful guardian, and gives them &lt;a href=\"Blackrazor\"&gt;Blackrazor&lt;/a&gt;, a Longsword +3, to combat it with.\nAt the end of the pathway, the guardian is revealed as an imprisoned Genie, who gives the player a riddle, which they puzzle out means that they can either use Blackrazor to slay him, or they can set him free by simply giving him the sword.\nThe Good path here costs the party Blackrazor, but rewards them with 20000 EXP.The Tear of Bhaal will grant Gorion's Ward\u00a0+2 to all Saving Throws.\nThe Evil path here means the party must fight the Enslaved Genie. A Spell Trigger launches an Improved Mantle, Mirror Image, Protection from Fire, Fire Shield (Red) and Globe of Invulnerability upon the beginning of the battle. The death of the Genie rewards the party with 11000 EXP and allows them to keep Blackrazor.\u00a0The Tear of Bhaal will grant Gorion's Ward\u00a0+15 Max Hit Points.\nTest of Wrath.\nUpon entering the Test of Wrath, the party finds themselves confronted by Sarevok's Wraith, who brashly attempts to coax them to surrender to their rage and adopt the form of the Slayer.\nIf the player rises to Sarevok's taunts, or uses the Slayer Form special ability, then they count as taking the Evil path.\u00a0The Tear of Bhaal will grant Gorion's Ward\u00a0a +2 bonus to Strength.\nIf the player does not rise to Sarevok's taunts and does not activate Slayer Form, then they count as taking the Good path. When they return to the Abyssal Door,\u00a0The Tear of Bhaal will grant Gorion's Ward a +1 bonus to Wisdom and a +1 bonus to Charisma.\nWraith Sarevok is worth 20000 EXP.\nFinal Battle.\nAfter all five Tears of Bhaal have been used, Irenicus storms into the Domain. Some banter is exchanged and he transforms into the Slayer, as well as summoning two Pit Fiends and two Glabrezus to aid him.\nWarning: the Pit Fiends and Glabrezus break the normal rules and are capable of attacking the party even if they have Protection from Evil applied.\nIrenicus as the Slayer will engage in minor spellcasting for most of the battle; teleporting across the field and using defensive spells like Mislead and Fire Shield (Red). After his health has been reduced low enough, he will start attacking physically and using more offensive spells. Killing him is difficult, as his health regenerates very quickly, but not impossible.\nWhen defeated, the ending cutscene is triggered."}

Bhaal had foreseen his own death during the Time of Troubles and, being unable to prevent it, he instead started planning his resurrection by creating armies of offspring, each carrying small amount of his divine essence.\u00a0He also created the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Forge\"&gt;Mana Forge&lt;/a&gt;, in which the divine parts of his children's souls would be stored after their deaths.\nBhaalspawn offspring.\nThere are \"two\" in-game children sired by Bhaalspawn; it is unknown if they possess any of the divine essences of their father:\nBhaalspawn abilities.\nDue to their divine heritage, it was not unheard of for Bhaalspawn to manifest unusual abilities.

This is integrated into the game by way of a &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;dream sequence&lt;/a&gt; that occurs whenever Gorion's Ward sleeps after starting a new chapter. Precisely which spell-like ability is acquired depends on the &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; level of Gorion's Ward, with a Reputation of 10 or higher granting a benevolent spell-like ability, and one of 9 or lower triggering more malevolent ones.\nIn Baldur's Gate II.\nIn , an imported &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; will retain whatever array of spell-like abilities they acquired in the previous game.\nA character that is generated brand new for this game will instead be given an array of spell-like innate abilities based on their alignment (note that Horror is only gained in the version of the game; the original BG2:SoA uses &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Touch\"&gt;Ghoul Touch&lt;/a&gt; instead):\nIn Chapter 4, Gorion's Ward will lose these spell-like abilities permanently, instead replacing them with &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Chapter 7 Part 2, Gorion's Ward will gain a number of passive permanent bonuses as the reward for completing the tests needed to recover the &lt;a href=\"Tear%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tears of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;. Precisely which bonus is received for which challenge depends on whether Gorion's Ward took the \"good\" path or the \"evil\" path.\nIn , during the first chapter, Gorion's Ward gains the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28ability%29\"&gt;ability to access a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28area%29\"&gt;personal demiplane&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nWith either the &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Unfinished Business (Baldur's Gate II)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; mods installed, it is possible to implement an option that grants Gorion's Ward further unique Bhaalspawn abilities as a result of completing the various trials in the Pocket Plane in , starting from the 2nd trial onwards. The results depend on the &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;Alignment&lt;/a&gt; of Gorion's Ward, with them gaining either a Good ability or an Evil ability.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; mod, the bhaalspawn is able to see incremental changes in the abilities of the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;. The slayer has a \"Basic\", \"Improved\", \"Ultimate\" and \"Ravager\" forms. These are unlocked by accruing total experience point thresholds.

Biff can technically be recruited as a potential &lt;a href=\"Companions\"&gt;Companion&lt;/a&gt;. This is similar to the Candlekeep party in the original Baldur's Gate. In which there are various not conventional but possible ,methods to recruit &lt;a href=\"Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt; that are otherwise not typical of most expected playthroughs. This can be done in the base games and no cheating is required. There are instances when multiple Biff the Understudy companions can be recruited into the player's party. Although this is quite difficult and requires specific circumstances to be met and in the overwhelming majority of playthroughs this is exceedingly rare but it does happen from to to time to have Biff the understudy in one's party.\nIn at least the original Baldur's Gate Biff can be used as a sacrificial companion for lures such as with fighting Drizzt. Biff can be in fact summoned multiple times and is exceedingly valuable in a sacrificial or on demand replacement roll. Given he seemingly has no penalties to death can be re-recruited again and again even after complete annihilation that would permanently kill most all companions. Biff the Understudy is the only neutral aligned pure Fighter &lt;a href=\"Companions\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; in the original Baldur's Gate.\nIn any Baldur's Gate game, if an NPC is absent when the game calls for them to recite lines, Biff will appear and say the character's lines instead, being the understudy. Though he will speak their dialogue, he will not perform any of the character's actions. Should you happen to kill him, there will be no penalty.\nIn Baldur's Gate II, Biff has an actual role to play. In the basement of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Flagons%20Inn\"&gt;Five Flagons Inn&lt;/a&gt; there is a play going on. One of the actors, &lt;a href=\"Haer%27Dalis\"&gt;Haer'Dalis&lt;/a&gt;, is missing so Biff comes on the scene and fills in for his role. Because he isn't the usual actor in the plays in the inn and because he gets most of his lines wrong, he is booed by the crowd. Due to this the play is abandoned.\nDialogue.\n\"Uh... here I am! H-here I am, my... uh... s-sweetums?\"\n\"I've been, uh... across the sea, my fair... um... m-my fair one. Yeah, yes, that's it\u2014across the sea and, uh...\"\n\"Yes, that's it! On the new lands.

{"id": "4637", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4637", "title": "Black Blade of Disaster", "text": "The Black Blade of Disaster enables a &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; to create and wield a &lt;a href=\"Long%20swords\"&gt;long sword&lt;/a&gt; that acts as an &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; with additional powerful abilities.\nGameplay.\nThe caster applies this spell to self only.\nOnce the spell casting is finished, a rather quick animation renders this blade adjacent to the caster as it rises out of the floor.\nOnce the animation is progressed sufficiently, the spell created blade is usable by the caster, which supersedes the casters other main-hand weapons, including fists.\nIf there was an off-hand weapon equipped, it is still viable and available to use, and can be changed to a shield, or another off-hand weapon.\nWhile the black blade is in existence, only this weapon can be wielded in melee from the main hand - the character may not change or adjust it, and if attempted, a message displays \"Magical weapon in use\".\nThe black blade bestows certain boosts to the wielder, and the weapon is wielded as a &lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword\"&gt;Long Sword&lt;/a&gt; in melee combat.\nThe blade strikes as a +6 &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20item\"&gt;Enchanted item&lt;/a&gt; for the purposes of what it can strike. The blade provides a 5-point &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; bonus, and any successful hit inflicts 2d12+5 &lt;a href=\"Slashing%20damage\"&gt;Slashing damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe blade also confers \"Grand Mastery\" in Long Sword &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;Weapon Proficiency&lt;/a&gt; for the blade's duration. This level of proficiency adds another 3-point THAC0 bonus and +5 additional damage.\nHowever, if the character has invested any points into long sword proficiency, their innate proficiency level will override the grand mastery effect provided from the spell. This takes place after attacking once, being attacked, casting a spell, or even manipulating an item in the character's inventory - presumably any event that causes the game to recalculate stats.\nWhen a creature is struck by the blade, there are several on-hit effects that can occur:\nThe on-hit effects of the sword are assigned to the Necromancy school and are of the &lt;a href=\"Offensive%20damage%20type\"&gt;Offensive damage type&lt;/a&gt;. As such, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt; can negate them.\nIn addition to this, the effects are also coded as &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; 9 and thus can be absorbed/deflected by appropriate spell protections such as &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;. Repeated attacks from the blade will however rapidly exceed the protective capacity of these spells and take them down.\n\"Shadows of Amn\".\nIn the original \"Shadows of Amn\", without its expansion, the spellcaster's base &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; is set to 12 for the duration of the &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; and every hit may &lt;a href=\"Slay%20Living\"&gt;slay&lt;/a&gt; the target if no &lt;a href=\"save\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt; vs. death is made with a bonus of 4.\n\"Throne of Bhaal\".\nAfter the installation of the original expansion \"Throne of Bhaal\" or in any \"complete\" package of the original \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II&lt;/a&gt;\", the slaying effect remains, but the fixed THAC0 is removed. Instead, &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;grand mastery&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Long%20Swords\"&gt;Long Swords&lt;/a&gt; is applied, which will improve the THAC0 by 2, add 4 to the &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; dealt and reduce the speed by 3; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; multi- or &lt;a href=\"dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt;es will also benefit from an additional half &lt;a href=\"attack%20per%20round\"&gt;attack per round&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn top of this, there's a 10%-chance that the target has 4 &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; effect. A saving throw negates. It bypasses &lt;a href=\"magic%20resistance\"&gt;magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and the wielder simultaneously gains a +20 current &lt;a href=\"Hit%20point\"&gt;Hit point&lt;/a&gt; gain.\nLocations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"spell%20scroll\"&gt;spell scroll&lt;/a&gt; is only sold by a few and cannot be found elsewhere.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Black Blade of Disaster\" is a very rare spell restricted to the Drow only. The blade can strike twice per round with the same THAC0 as its caster. A black blade of disaster can cut through prismatic walls and spheres, walls of force, and all other known magical barriers. It can penetrate an antimagic shell and affect objects inside. If the caster rolls a natural 20, the blade disintegrates the creature struck; nothing short of a wish will restore an individual destroyed in this fashion. All magical attacks and effects directed at the rift are absorbed. Anyone trying to seize or physically attack the blade is affected as if struck by the blade. The caster suffers 1d2 points of damage every time he strikes with the blade, as it draws off some of his life force as well. This damage does not by itself disrupt his concentration.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell - revising its casting time, duration, effects, and description. See below:\nBlack Blade of Disaster\nLevel: 9\nSchool: Conjuration\nRange: Personal\nDuration: 1 round/level\nCasting Time: 5\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nThis spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift, about 5 feet long. It jumps into the caster\u2019s hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The caster wields the blade as if proficient with the weapon and brandishes it with a base THAC0 of 0. The sword deals 2d12 damage per strike and acts as a +5 magical weapon in all regards, including hit and damage bonuses. With each hit, there is a 15% chance the victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 or be disintegrated (40d6 points of magic damage, 5d6 on a successful save)."}

The demon says that one of the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tears of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; is possessed by a creature further in the cavern (the party can't see this creature at this time) - this Tear can be had by seizing it from the creature ahead.\nThe demon makes it clear that he expects the bhaalspawn will triumph and live up to the fearsome reputation earned by so many previous victories. Simply seize the day and take the Tear by force. \nThe choices presented in dialog with the demon are covered in the &lt;a href=\"Finding%20Irenicus%20in%20Hell\"&gt;Finding Irenicus in Hell&lt;/a&gt; article.\nIf the bhaalspawn decides to face the unknown creature to defeat it and get the sought after Tear - then the demon approves, remarking it as an \"excellent\" choice, makes a closing remark, and disappears from the map, and the party may advance to see what kind of creature it is, and engage it in battle.\nThe party will soon observe a Black Dragon, who is hostile and will defend itself and attack via its scripted actions.\nThe dragon will apply a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; spell on itself while also launching a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; at the nearest opponent in range. These spells are not interruptible.\nShortly thereafter a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Fear\"&gt;Dragon Fear&lt;/a&gt; innate ability will radiate from the dragon exposing nearby party members to the effect. A saving throw will negate, or immunity to the &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; status effect will prevent the disabling effect. If a party member is with a 10' range it will also perform a &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Buffet\"&gt;Wing Buffet&lt;/a&gt; at this time.\nWhen the dragon's starting hit point total falls to 50% an instantly applied &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; spell is applied. This only occurs once in the battle.\nThe dragon will blast a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Breath\"&gt;Black Dragon Breath&lt;/a&gt; after about three rounds into the battle at detected party members in range. The area of effect might strike several party members depending on their positioning.\nThereafter, the dragon will attack party members in melee range with its claws, pausing about every three rounds to blast out another Black Dragon breath attack, followed by yet another Wing Buffet. This cycle continues as long as the dragon is still able to fight back and function. The dragon will move to the nearest enemy in order to get into range with its melee and breath attacks.\nLater in the battle there is about a 1 in 3 chance that the dragon will cast a &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Person\"&gt;Charm Person&lt;/a&gt; spell at the party member with the most damaging melee attack it can detect. This occurs only once, if it occurs at all.\nFighting the Dragon if the Bhaalspawn takes the \"good\" path.\nIf the player selects the \"good\" path in the test, the demon departs the area with different dialogue. In order to retrieve the required Tear of Bhaal, the party can speak with the dragon, who will freely supply it to the party and depart the map - or preemptively attack the dragon (without speaking to it first) and destroy it (hoping that it has the Tear on its person).\nIn this scenario the dragon presented to the party is actually a different one from the hostile dragon written in the text above (reference HDRAGSIL), which has a dialogue script and lacks carried loot (except for some gold pieces and the Tear of Bhaal).\nThe good path dragon version won't actually go from neutral to a red circled hostile creature if attacked, yet it will fight back with the same script as the hostile dragon. The game doesn't penalize the player from attacking the good dragon version - the only difference between speaking with the dragon and obtaining the Tear peaceably and attacking it - is the delivery of dialogue, and departure animation versus a fight and the XP gained from slaying the dragon. \nAlso, perhaps the dubious and unnecessary attack on a neutral Dragon when taking the so called \"good\" path isn't something to be proud of, nor does it display any humility. Depending on the player's moral code and viewpoint.\nRole play this as desired. The party is after all in Hell - so forgiveness, compassion and ethics aren't really enforced here.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises the dragons here. The AI scripts are changed to include more situational logic and reactive analysis of the tactical situation. The dragon will evaluate player defensive buffs, equipped item, spells and innate abilities active on the party members before responding/attacking. The SCS dragon has no &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; spell ability.\nImmunities in addition to the unmodified dragon version:\nThe dragon is scripted to use an innate &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Insects%20%28innate%29\"&gt;Summon Insects&lt;/a&gt; dragon version spell. Also, a &lt;a href=\"Plant%20Growth\"&gt;Plant Growth&lt;/a&gt; spell might be used after many rounds (10 plus at least) has elapsed after the battle begins.\nThe dragon follows the unmodified game to a certain extent, however depending on the game difficulty selection, will perform breath attacks more frequently (every two rounds). Additionally, the dragon is able to cast &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt; twice each. Instead of charm person it can cast &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Charm\"&gt;Dire Charm&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf any cloud type spells are cast at the dragon, including &lt;a href=\"Incendiary%20Cloud\"&gt;Incendiary Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, then the script will initiate a Wing Buffet to clear it from the map.\nWith SCS, dragon breath weapons are not assigned to any school of magic and have no secondary type - so the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt; has no effect, nor will &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; and similar protections have any interaction.\nIf the player has the &lt;a href=\"IWDification\"&gt;IWDification&lt;/a&gt; mod installed with SCS, or the internal SCS Icewind Dale spells component enabled, then additional IWD scrolls are added to the dragon's carried loot."}

The purpose of the spell is to apply &lt;a href=\"Acid%20damage\"&gt;Acid damage&lt;/a&gt; in an Area of Effect to the dragon's enemies.\nEffects.\nThe ability is uninterruptible and takes almost no time to deploy. The scripted targeting will fire over a selected target area, which is typically within the creature's sight detection range. All creatures in the area of effect are subject to the effects. This breath weapon is a projectile that will burst (similar to a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;) and spread in a ring of greenish colored acidic destruction. In addition to the bursting animation, a unique sound effect is also played.\nWhen a dragon deploys a Black Dragon Breath, a blast explodes upon enemies within the AoE who are then subjected to 24d4 &lt;a href=\"Acid%20damage\"&gt;Acid damage&lt;/a&gt;. A quick reaction &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; vs Breath Attack will apply, and a successful save will reduce the damage by half.

The quintessential black knight, this villain carries a reputation of the foulest sort that is very well deserved. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the Blackguard is hated and feared by all. Some people call these villains \"anti-paladins\" due to their completely evil nature.\nTheir abilities do reflect their dark nature as the anti-paladins have immunities to few &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; and fear in this case. Instead of &lt;a href=\"Lay%20on%20Hands%20%28paladin%29\"&gt;Lay on Hands&lt;/a&gt;, they have the ability &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Health\"&gt;Absorb Health&lt;/a&gt;. While paladins and the other class kits can become fallen, blackguards are not affected by &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; or the evil acts they perform. They can't use the spell &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Evil\"&gt;Detect Evil&lt;/a&gt; at all and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Protection From Evil&lt;/a&gt; is no longer an innate ability, they\u00a0also have a different minimum requirements than paladins.\nThis class kit is only available in and .\nCharacter abilities.\nBlackguards do not have an increased minimal wisdom of 13, it's only 3, and the minimal charisma has dropped from 17 to 14 points, but constitution is 5 points higher.\nSpecial abilities of the paladin.\nTurn undead.\nBlackguards have the ability to \"&lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;turn&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"creature\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt;s that are , though only with an effectiveness comparable to a &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt; that is two &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;character levels&lt;/a&gt; behind the paladin. When this mode is activated and undead creatures are in range of the character, there is a possibility the undead will stop attacking their targets and run away from the character until the effect is worn off. At higher levels, this mode may control undead outright.\nSaving throws bonus.\nThey gain +2 bonus to all saving throws.\nPriest spells.\nPaladins are able to use priest spells when they reach lvl 9. They may only use spells levels 1 to 4. Any spells which effects are based on the casting level of the user, are limited for paladins between spell levels 1 and 9. Between lvl 9 and 20, the paladin will gain one spell slot each time he/she levels up.\nStronghold.\nDespite being a Paladin kit, the Blackguard does not share the same stronghold as other Paladins due to its evil nature. Blackguards will instead receive the same stronghold as a Fighter after liberating &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Keep\"&gt;De'Arnise Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh-level class abilities.\nHigh-level class abilities are added in the expansion .

In the , the spell is single target.\nLocation.\nThe item bestowed is Blackmist.\nGameplay.\nThe halberd functions normally as one would expect, inflicting &lt;a href=\"Piercing%20damage\"&gt;piercing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"slashing%20damage\"&gt;slashing damage&lt;/a&gt; upon a successful hit. It strikes as a +4 enchanted weapon, including THAC0 and damage bonuses.\nWhile the weapon is equipped, the wielder can launch a special Blackmist-only blindness effect (it's not a spell nor an innate ability in the game files). The range is 10' and must be aimed at a single target. When the projectile lands on the target it applies a series of internal effect codes in a 5-foot radius on the target and any in the radius (friend or foe).\nMagic resistance can block the effects. The internal &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; of the blindness effect is 8, and thus certain spell level protections such as &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt; can block the attack on the primary target (but not the other creatures in the AoE). Creatures within the AoE can attempt a &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; versus spell to negate the effect.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt; effect takes hold, it will last for 2 hours. In addition, if the saving throw is missed, the affected creature will display a coloring and lighting effect over their sprite, and the combat log will show the text \"blinded\". Sound effect also is audible when first blinding the creature (see Bugs, below) if applicable. \nThe effect can be dispelled. A Mirror or reflected Image won't prevent the projectile from striking the correct target.\nThree of these blindness attack \"charges\" can be attempted per day, and the item recharges after a normal adventurer resting period.\nBugs.\nAs of BG2EE 2.6, Blackmist plays two sounds when blinding a target, but one of those sounds is supposed to be an expiry sound when the blindness wears off.

{"id": "10414", "revid": "49135869", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10414", "title": "Blade", "text": "Blade is a class kit in .\nIntroduction.\nBlades are a &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; kit that specializes in highly complex, scenic and visually stunning fencing techniques which usually find the enemy unprepared and unable to counteract. This makes blades somewhat more efficient in melee combat than their bard colleagues.\nCombat training takes its toll on the other \"trademark\" bard skills and they tend to neglect singing, pickpocketing and gaining lore - these skills will always be underdeveloped in comparison to unkitted bards. Spellcasting, however, is not affected by any penalties. A Blade is as good a spellcaster as any other bard.\nIn order for bards to cast a spell, first they need to successfully scribe a mage spell scroll into their spell book (scroll lost in process regardless of success or failure), in which they must prepare the spell by putting it into an empty spell slot, then they have to rest to get the spell ready. Spellcasting is also affected by armor, wearing an armor of any kind (other than the few &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Chain%20Mail\"&gt;Elven Chain Mail&lt;/a&gt;s found) renders it impossible.\nBards are generally neutral characters, tending toward the chaotic\u2014they come and go when they want, and are usually not bound by obligations, countries or organisations. There aren't many bards who are either good- or evil-aligned.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; can become bards.\nBards may not &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual class&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter abilities table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, other Races have modified ability scores.\nSpecial abilities of the Blade.\nBard song.\nThe signature ability of the bard is their battle song. While active, the party will be fortified against fear, both natural and magical. Specifically, the party will be rendered immune to magical fear, will have any such existing effects removed from them and their &lt;a href=\"morale\"&gt;morale&lt;/a&gt; will be gradually restored to its baseline while they hear the song. All Bard songs work within a limited range, roughly 5 to 6 meters, and the singer\u2019s view must not be blocked by doors, corners.\nIn \"EE version 2.0+\", Bard song of the same type no longer stacks, and all songs break &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, but the patch does give the bard song a +1 &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; bonus to allies who hear it at Blade level 1. Blades do not improve their song as they level up.\nBlades may select the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Bard%20Song\"&gt;Enhanced Bard Song&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;HLA&lt;/a&gt;. This replaces their default song and improves their buffing abilities significantly, though the Blade must be at least lvl 24 in the \"Enhanced Edition\".\nGameplay\nPick pockets.\nA bard can attempt to steal items from other characters. The chance to steal an item depends on the percentage, which automatically increases with the Blade's level, up to a maximum score of 57 at level 16, plus &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; modifier.\nLore.\nBlades have only half the starting Lore for Bards and receive only 5 &lt;a href=\"Lore\"&gt;Lore&lt;/a&gt; points per level.\nWizard spellbook.\nBards gain &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;wizard spells&lt;/a&gt; slots upon reaching bard level 2, and may learn any level 1-6 arcane spell via scrolls.\nBards are known for their quick levelling, which gives them an advantage over &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s when using spells that scale with the caster's level. The advantage fades when using spells capped at a certain level, like &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; - the bard will be the first to get the maximal possible effect at lvl 10, but loses the advantage once the mage reaches the same level. Most spell effects are capped at level 20.\nTwo-weapon Fighting.\nThe Blade is the only Bard class able to invest three proficiency points in two weapon style. They can even go one step further, select &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; and wear &lt;a href=\"Montolio%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;Montolio's Cloak&lt;/a&gt; to fully negate the off-hand penalty to THAC0.\nThis does not mean that a Blade should go melee exclusively as spells like &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteors&lt;/a&gt; and ranged damage arrows like &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt; work extremely well with both spins.\n&lt;a href=\"Offensive%20Spin\"&gt;Offensive Spin&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon activating this ability, the Blade doubles their movement speed, receives two points bonus on &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and damage, one extra attack and all their melee and ranged attacks do maximum damage for the next 4 &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23R\"&gt;rounds&lt;/a&gt;. The damage effect is similar to &lt;a href=\"Kensai\"&gt;Kensai&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kai\"&gt;Kai&lt;/a&gt; but last more than twice as long and can apply to range weapons.\nThis ability does not stack with &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt;, but does stack with &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt;. It cannot be used together with &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Spin\"&gt;Defensive Spin&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Spin\"&gt;Defensive Spin&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen activated, this ability gives the blade 1 AC bonus per level up to a maximum of 10 AC, but makes them unable to move around the map for the duration of the ability (4 rounds). Great for being an AC tank with &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Armor\"&gt;Ghost Armor&lt;/a&gt; while casting spells, especially in BG1.\nDefensive Spin can not be used together with Offensive Spin, but the Blade retains all his other abilities - bard song, spells and melee/ranged attacks.\nThis ability works well with the Enhanced Bard Song, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Evasion\"&gt;Greater Evasion&lt;/a&gt; and various protective spells and can, for a short period, help the Blade achieve the highest AC possible in the series.\nKit description.\nThe Blade is an expert fighter and adventurer whose bardic acting abilities make him appear more intimidating and fearsome. His fighting style is flashy and entertaining, but is also quite deadly.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nGameplay.\nIn BG1 Blades are considered good solo characters and may clear Legacy of Bhaal mode fairly easily. In a party setting they can be an excellent source of ranged damage, spell damage from and with enough levels/Int/Wis/Dex may provide the party with lore/pickpocket/stealing utility. They can also be a temporary tank with Defensive Spin.\nIn BG2 Blades, like all other bards, tend to have a supporting role in the party by default. Their base abilities leave much to be desired: a mediocre THAC0; low number of attacks; and low Hit Die limit their usefulness and survivability in general situations. However, they may then use Offensive Spin, Defensive Spin, spells/items that directly improve APR/weapon damage output (like Melf's Minute Meteors and &lt;a href=\"Shapechange\"&gt;Shapechange&lt;/a&gt;) and buffs like &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tenser%27s%20Transformation\"&gt;Tenser's Transformation&lt;/a&gt; to allow them to enter the fray and contribute either offensively or defensively in a much more significant manner. Bard HLAs complete the Blade kit by turning it into a true jack-of-all-trades - a chameleon capable of matching the offensive fighting prowess of a warrior, the defensive prowess of a tanky mage and burst damage potential of a rogue.\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nBards have almost the same high-level class abilities as &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of &lt;a href=\"Assassination\"&gt;Assassination&lt;/a&gt;, they get enhanced bards song and magic flute. Despite no skill points into Set Traps, the traps HLAs available to the Bard will never fail or accidentally trigger on the Bard.\n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBards protagonists may &lt;a href=\"Running%20the%20Five%20Flagons%20Playhouse\"&gt;run the Five Flagons Inn stage&lt;/a&gt; after they &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Raelis%20and%20Haer%27Dalis%20from%20the%20Planar%20Prison\"&gt;rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the planar prison&lt;/a&gt;\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a number of gameplay revisions and changes to all Rogues, including their kits. It is a comprehensive modification to nearly all aspects of the Rogues (Bards and Thieves) abilities and strives to bring them closer to their Pen and Paper AD&amp;D counterparts. New and revised abilities are included, as well as new equipment and rogue specific items. Separate user installed components are available to customize selection of content and changes. Go to the link for further information.\nThe Mod addresses Blade in many different aspects, including:\nBlade\nBlades now automatically start with maximum proficiency (3 points) in Two Weapon Fighting style as described in the 2E AD&amp;D \"Complete Bard's Handbook\" supplement. They also get a new special ability called \"Weapons Display\" once for every 10 experience levels (starting with one use at level 1). However, Blades no longer gain access to the \"Enhanced Bard Song\" HLA. They can now pick the Whirlwind HLA instead. The updated kit description reads as follows:\nBLADE: The Blade is an expert fighter and adventurer whose bardic acting abilities make him appear more intimidating and fearsome. If there is a showy way to wield or perform with a weapon, a Blade knows how to do it better than anyone. Blades often perform amazing displays of skill and control as they whirl various weapons about their bodies with deadly precision. The weapons of a Blade are always kept in perfect condition and highly polished for maximum effect during a battle or a performance. Blades regularly train and perform with weapons in both hands eventually developing complete ambidexterity.\nAdvantages:\n- May use the Offensive Spin and Defensive Spin abilities once per day per 4 levels\n- May use the Weapons Display ability once per day per 10 levels\n- Obtains maximum proficiency in two weapon fighting style at first level\n- Can acquire the Whirlwind ability at higher levels\nDisadvantages:\n- Only has one-half normal Lore value\n- Only has one-half Pick Pockets percentage\n- Battlesong does not improve with levels\n- Cannot acquire the Enhanced Battlesong ability\n- Cannot acquire the Lingering Song ability\nOffensive Spin:\nThis ability lasts for 24 seconds granting the Blade +2 bonus to hit and damage and an extra attack. All of the Blade's attacks do maximum damage for the duration.\nDefensive Spin:\nThis ability lasts for 24 seconds and grants the Blade a +1 bonus to Armor Class per each level of experience, up to a maximum of 10. The Blade cannot move away from the initial spot while performing a Defensive Spin.\nWeapons Display:\nBy whirling a melee weapon about his body a Blade can affect the morale and courage of others. Such a display of skill, precision, and deadly grace lowers opponents' morale (enemies must save vs. spell to avoid morale failure) and simultaneously inspires allies, granting a +1 bonus to their attack rolls. The display must occur for a full round without interruption. During this time, any successful attack upon the Blade or failed saving throw by the Blade disrupts the display. Weapons Display is an extraordinary (non-magical) ability, therefore it completely ignores any magic resistance of the subject creatures. Undead, Constructs, Slimes, Animals and Demonic creatures are completely unaffected by the Weapons Display. Furthermore, the ability cannot affect creatures whose total Hit Dice exceed the Blade's current level and creatures with more than 20 Hit Dice are completely unaffected. The effectiveness and the duration of this ability improve as the Blade gains more levels. The bonus granted to the attack rolls of allies and the saving throw penalty for the enemies increase by one point per ten experience levels of the Blade. The effects of Weapons Display last for one round per each level of the Blade.\nBard High Level Ability revisions (including Blade Kit)\nThis component will remove all Traps and other Thief-specific HLAs from the Bard High Level Ability table and replace them with new abilities which are more fitting for the Bard class. These new HLAs are: Mass Charm, Sound Burst, Enthralling Melody, Lingering Song, Resonating Weapon and Sound Barrier. Furthermore, the Magic Flute and Alchemy HLAs will be revised and each Bard kit will get a unique version of the Enhanced Battlesong HLA."}

(This is probably because, in the Infinity Engine, it is almost impossible to script creatures to avoid them crashing into each other.) This component (again in the name of fairness, and also of hassle avoidance) extends this to the player's version of these two spells: with it installed, players and NPCs use the same form of Blade Barrier.

These whirl and flash around the caster, forming a dangerous barrier. Those within a 6-foot radius of the caster suffer 1d8 points of slashing damage every 3 seconds. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.\nNote that spells like Invisibility, Shadow Door, etc. will not function on the caster when protected by Blade Barrier. Also, cleric/thieves and cleric/rangers who cast this will not be able to hide in shadows until the spell expires."}

It's also not coded to make the target Unconscious for 5 rounds. \nNote: This spell needs some in game testing (currently not performed as of this writing).

At the &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%201\"&gt;start of \"Shadows of Amn\"&lt;/a&gt;, she has formed &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Vampire%20Coven\"&gt;Bodhi's Vampire Coven&lt;/a&gt; to challenge and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thieves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt;. She and her group of controlled vampires will also be able to assist her brother's machinations.\nBackstory.\nMuch of Bodhi's backstory prior to is left ambiguous. Once an elf living in Suldanesellar, she was a close confidante to &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;spellcaster&lt;/a&gt; who refers to her as a \"sister\". She assisted him in his attempt to become a god and suffered the same punishment as him when the plan failed. Both Bodhi and Irenicus were stripped of their connection to the elven race and were cast out of the elven city. It is implied that the nature of the punishment significantly shortened Bodhi's lifespan, as she voluntarily turned into a vampire as means of survival.\nIn the beginning of Shadows of Amn Bodhi has settled in Athkatla, and formed a &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Vampire%20Coven\"&gt;Coven of vampires&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate her enemies. She is also inextricably involved in Irenicus' plot to drain the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life\"&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/a&gt; and become immortal.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Meeting%20with%20Valen%27s%20mistress\"&gt;Meeting with Valen's mistress&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%202\"&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt; of Shadows of Amn, &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; must choose whether to side with Bodhi and her vampires or &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt; and his Shadow Thieves and work for the chosen side during &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%203\"&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;. This is introduced to the party via &lt;a href=\"Valen\"&gt;Valen&lt;/a&gt;, who delivers a message to you for a requested meeting. The trigger for this event is looking for a quantity of gold saved up and in the party's purse. It should trigger if you have near 15,000 gold (the fee for passage to &lt;a href=\"Brynnlaw\"&gt;Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt;).\nBodhi plays an important role in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%204\"&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt; where she confronts Gorion's Ward in &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;. She also obtains a portion of &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;divine soul&lt;/a&gt; as means to further her dream of immortality.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20final%20battle%20with%20Bodhi\"&gt;The final battle with Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%206\"&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/a&gt; of Shadows of Amn, Gorion's Ward is confronted by Bodhi in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Athkatla Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; regardless of the choice made previously.\nFacing Bodhi in combat.\nDepending on the party's choices of either siding with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thieves&lt;/a&gt; or Bodhi, will determine when the party will have to actually fight Bodhi.\nIn Chapter 3, if you have sided with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thieves&lt;/a&gt; and are undertaking a task by &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt; to disrupt and destroy Bodhi and vampires in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt;, then you will face Bodhi. This creature is a version that can't actually be destroyed and only damaged and forced to flee. However, this version can still seriously hurt, and level drain the party, and even kill. The battle with Bodhi will continue until she incurs enough hit point loss in order to reach the \"flee\" the battlefield point. \nIn Chapter 4, in &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;, the party will again meet Bodhi, and eventually have to face her in combat again, as the party navigates the various hurdles and impediments associated with that Dungeon. Bodhi will appear and will attack. The Protagonist will involuntarily change into the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;, which will eventually drive Bodhi away again. She can't be killed in this chapter, and frankly, she won't kill the protagonist here either. \nIn Chapter 6, the final battle with Bodhi will occur back in her original lair in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt;. In this battle, she can be destroyed for good when she retreats to her coffin, and she is \"staked\" within.\nAbilities in combat.\nIn Chapters 3 and 4, the Bodhi creature files, and associated abilities are equivalent to an &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Ancient%29\"&gt;Vampire (Ancient)&lt;/a&gt; creature - see that page for abilities and its immunities (with minor differences). The game has scripted these versions to put up a fight, then when a certain damage level is incurred or another trigger is reached, will flee the encounter. These versions of Bodhi are equipped with the &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt; or a similar MINHP20 version, which blocks final death by any means. \nIn Chapter 6, the Bodhi version is the one reflected on this page's Info Box. It is the strongest version of Bodhi in the game, exceeding that of a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Ancient%29\"&gt;Ancient Vampire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis version of Bhodi is still equipped with the &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt;, making bodhi immune to being killed and able to transition to her coffin. In order to get rid of this, the party must \"weaken\" the Vampires in the lair, by using the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Elven Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; in the room where she is located (add it to one of the blood fonts).\nMod content.\nMods:.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Alternatives\"&gt;Alternatives&lt;/a&gt; mod allows changes to how the party can deal with the Shadow Thieves and Bodhi. Now there is no need to side with either faction in order to undertake a trip to Brynnlaw and search for &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;. The alternative choices presented mean the party can take down both the Shadow Thieves as well as Bodhi. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod offers two choices regarding what kind of Bodhi will appear in the game. These are:&lt;br&gt;\nImproved Bodhi&lt;br&gt;\nThis component is inspired by the Improved Bodhi in Westley Weimer's Tactics mod. To quote from the readme to that mod:&lt;br&gt;\n\"Sigh. Bodhi is worth 91K XP -- more than almost anything else in the game. And yet she is a mere brute-force melee fighter who doesn't even drink healing potions. We make her more intelligent ... and give her some impressive pseudo-magical powers associated with vampires of myth and legend. Bodhi gains dominion over bats, the cold, the ground and the grave.\"\nThe SCS version of Improved Bodhi is updated to use modern WeiDU coding (to help with compatibility-friendliness) and SCS AI scripting.&lt;br&gt;\nYou can fight Bodhi in chapters 3 and 6; in chapter 3 (again, following Tactics) she'll pull her punches.&lt;br&gt;\nThis component is sensitive to the difficulty setting:&lt;br&gt;\nBASIC: Bodhi is protected only by &lt;a href=\"Fledgling%20Vampire\"&gt;fledgling vampires&lt;/a&gt; and by a few other undead and uses few supernatural abilities.&lt;br&gt;\nIMPROVED: Bodhi uses her \"Buried Alive\" (slowing and weakening), Touch of Death (vampiric touch) and \"Call of the Mistress\" (control undead) supernatural powers; her allies include two full-strength &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nTACTICAL: Bodhi also uses her \"Cloud of Bats\" (similar to Insect Plague), \"Abyssal Darkness\" (blindness) and \"Sepulchral Sleep\" (unconsciousness). Her allies now include four &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Elder%29\"&gt;adult vampires&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nHARDCORE: Bodhi also uses her \"Chill of the Grave\" (cold damage) supernatural power; she is served by two vampire mages.&lt;br&gt;\nINSANE: Bodhi's physical abilities and resistances are substantially enhanced (matching the original Tactics version); she gains a permanent \"Deathly Shroud\" (cold fire shield) and is immune to first and second level spells. Two &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Ancient%29\"&gt;Ancient Vampires&lt;/a&gt; join her defenders.&lt;br&gt;\nImproved Vampires\" component: See the &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; article page and the \"Mod content\" section for discussion. This component does affect Bodhi, but only if you don't install the \"Improved Bodhi\" component (in other words, if you want Bodhi to use her original-game abilities more effectively but don't want to give her the extra powers of that component, install Improved Vampires but not Improved Bodhi).&lt;br&gt;\nEven with just the Improved Vampires component installed, the SCS Chapter 3 and 6 Bodhi has the following revisions:&lt;br&gt;\nLevel 25/25 Fighter/Thief Class, HP: 228, STR 24, DEX 24, CON 20, Effective AC: -10, Adjusted THAC0: -9, APR: 4&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance: 25%&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;Magical damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance: 50% (such as &lt;a href=\"Sunray\"&gt;Sunray&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Bolt of Glory&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;\nSee Invisible Creatures by Script&lt;br&gt;\nImmune to &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nImmune to &lt;a href=\"Slay\"&gt;Slay&lt;/a&gt; effect (example &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Disruption\"&gt;Mace of Disruption&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Azuredge\"&gt;Azuredge&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;\nMovement Modifier +12&lt;br&gt;\nBackstab damage modifier X5 (if attacking from invisibility)&lt;br&gt;\nTwo melee attack choices: Level Drain (5 levels) and 'Blood Drain\" (3 Con) from victim and she gains +15 HP per hit. The second is when opponent is protected from &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nShape change into Mist, Bat, or Wolf Form at will. All have different powers in that form&lt;br&gt;\n\"Cloud of Bats\" innate ability&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Domination%20%28Innate%29\"&gt;Vampire Domination&lt;/a&gt; attempted several times during each turn if not protected from &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Creature\"&gt;Charm Creature&lt;/a&gt; effects&lt;br&gt;\nInnately and instantly force-cast &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; upon self when only 10% HP remain&lt;br&gt; \nWith the Improved Bodhi component, she will use some specific powers when facing the party:&lt;br&gt;\nDuring Chapter 3 Encounter: Deathly Shroud, Sepulchral Sleep, Touch of Death, Shapeshift Bat. Note that the \"Deathly Shroud\" is like a &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Blue%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Blue)&lt;/a&gt;, but any hit on Bodhi reduces the attacker's saving throws temporarily. &lt;br&gt;\nDuring Chapter 6 Encounter: Cloud of Bats, Abyssal Darkness, Deathly Shroud, Sepulchral Sleep, Touch of Death, Shapeshift Bat, Buried Alive, Chill of the Grave."}

These traps are effective for crowd control in addition to damage, slowing enemies at the early levels and eventually graduating to holding and even mazing enemies.\nThese traps come at the cost of 5 fewer skill points than the standard thief per level, which by itself isn't nearly as steep a price as the &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt; pays for their abilities. However, the special snares, like all other thief traps, are reliant on the bounty hunter's &lt;a href=\"Thief%23Set_Traps\"&gt;Set Traps&lt;/a&gt; score to set them successfully. Which means bounty hunters will need to invest points in that skill sooner than all other thieves would, if they intend to use their unique abilities to their fullest from the start. So much like\u00a0assassins, bounty hunters\u00a0will likely have to rely on thief stat-boosting equipment and potions (such as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Armor\"&gt;Shadow Armor&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Perception\"&gt;Potion of Perception&lt;/a&gt;) in the early-going.\nCompanion &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II&lt;/a&gt;\" is a bounty hunter.\nDual-classing and locking Special Snares.\nThe information in this section does not apply to the latest Enhanced Edition, as (unlike regular traps) the Set Special Snare ability scales with the average of both classes' (the inactive and active class) levels rounded up, making it so even a Bounty Hunter dualed at level 2 might still eventually get access to the Maze trap.\nThe upgrades Special Snares get when the bounty hunter reaches certain levels are not necessarily strict improvements over their early-level counterparts, especially when it pertains to the saving throw penalties.\nFor example, at 11th-level, while the hold effect gained at this level is stronger than slow in itself, the hold trap comes with a much smaller saving throw penalty than the slow trap did (-1 vs. -4). The hold effect also only works on humanoid enemies, as the spell Hold Person does. Some players may feel the higher success rate for inflicting slow outweighs the stronger effect of hold that will be inflicted at a lower success rate and on fewer enemy types.\nHowever, since the new snares gained at certain levels always outright replace the previous ones, the only way to lock the bounty hunter's Special Snare into the player's preferred option is to &lt;a href=\"dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt; (valid options are to &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;).\nDualing at level 10 or earlier locks the Special Snare at the slow with -4 save penalty version.\nDualing from level 11 to 15 locks the Special Snare at the hold with -1 save penalty version.\nThe Otiluke's snare from level 16 to 20 makes for perhaps the worst stretch of the bounty hunter's career. Because the trap does no damage, and there is no save penalty at all against the Otiluke's sphere, and on top of that, the enemy cannot be harmed when caught in it, it is generally considered a downgrade from the previous hold and slow snares.\nSo basically the options are to dual-class to lock the slow or hold snare in place, or bear with\u00a0the 16-20 level range\u00a0while waiting to upgrade to the &lt;a href=\"maze\"&gt;maze&lt;/a&gt; snare.\nMaze Snare tactics.\nThe 21st-level Special Snare is a maze trap that allows no save and ignores magic resistance. Using &lt;a href=\"Exploits%23Fog_of_War_Trick\"&gt;Fog of War&lt;/a&gt; tactics, a bounty hunter can maze an entire group of enemies unfailingly.\nWhile all enemies are mazed, the bounty hunter can hide and wait to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; the first enemy that reappears. Just like with the &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; spell, enemies with higher &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; return sooner. If the enemy group has\u00a0a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, that mage will typically be the first one out of the maze, with their allies no longer around and making them an easy target for a backstab.\nThe maze trap also\u00a0combines remarkably well with the standard thief traps and the HLA traps, especially &lt;a href=\"Set%20Spike%20Trap\"&gt;spike traps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Set%20Time%20Trap\"&gt;time traps&lt;/a&gt;. While all enemies are mazed, the bounty hunter can lay a few welcome-back spike or time traps and potentially eliminate the whole enemy group with ease.\nThis synergy between the maze snare and HLA traps make bounty hunters arguably the most effective single-class thieves in high-level play.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a number of gameplay revisions and changes to all Rogues, including their kits. It is a comprehensive modification to nearly all aspects of the Rogues (Bards and Thieves) abilities and strives to bring them closer to their Pen and Paper AD&amp;D counterparts. New and revised abilities are included, as well as new equipment and rogue specific items. Separate user installed components are available to customize selection of content and changes. Go to the link for further information.\nThe Mod addresses Bounty Hunters in many different aspects, including:\nBounty Hunter\nThrough this revision, the Bounty Hunter relies on mechanical devices and alchemical substances for incapacitating his prey, rather than imbuing his snares with magical effects as was the case in the unmodded game. In summary, the Bounty Hunter's special snares have been replaced with Alchemical Traps, he can now coat his weapons in Paralytic Toxin and his Alchemical Expertise improves as he gains more experience. Finally, a Bounty Hunter can now also choose the Tracking HLA at higher levels. The updated kit description reads as follows:\nBOUNTY HUNTER:\nThis is a hunter of men, skilled in tracking and capturing quarry, whether for lawful authorities or underworld masters. Due to the frequent need to bring his prey back alive, a Bounty Hunter often relies on alchemical substances that can incapacitate or weaken his victims. A Bounty Hunter's trap making abilities are also well beyond those of the average thief.\nAdvantages:\n- Gains a +15% bonus to the Set Traps skill at 1st level\n- May use Paralytic Toxin once per day at 1st level and every 10 levels thereafter\n- Can lay Alchemical Traps in addition to regular snares\n- Acquires Alchemical Expertise at 10th level. This ability further improves every 10 levels thereafter\n- Can acquire the Tracking ability at higher levels\nDisadvantages:\n- Gets only 20% to distribute between thief abilities at each level\nParalytic Toxin:\nThe Bounty Hunter's intricate understanding of alchemy and herbalism allows him to create a substance that causes severe loss of muscle function when injected into the bloodstream. This paralytic toxin is a transparent, odorless liquid which can be easily applied to weapons without fear of detection. A hit from any weapon coated in this substance causes the target to make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or become paralyzed for one round per every ten levels of the Bounty Hunter. However, the toxin evaporates quickly when exposed to air making the coating last only a single round. Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures are unaffected by the Paralytic Toxin.\nAlchemical Traps:\nCombining his superior trap setting skills with alchemical knowledge, a Bounty Hunter can create traps that are primarily designed for incapacitating his opponents, rather than killing them outright. The effects of the traps vary according to the Bounty Hunter's level, but always last for five rounds and can be negated by a successful saving throw vs. breath:\n1st: trap deals 2d4 points of subdual damage and dazzles the target\n6th: trap deals 4d4 points of subdual damage and slows the target\n11th: trap deals 6d4 points of subdual damage and entangles the target\n16th: trap deals 8d4 points of subdual damage and blinds the target\n21st: trap deals 10d4 points of subdual damage and renders the target unconscious\nNote: subdual damage is non-lethal and will render the target unconscious if its hit points drop below 0 instead of killing it. Constructs, Elementals, Slimes and Undead creatures are immune to subdual damage.\nAlchemical Expertise\nThrough training and experience, a Bounty Hunter gradually learns to utilize alchemical substances more effectively. Each time this ability is acquired, the saving throw difficulty class of the Bounty Hunter's Paralytic Toxin and Alchemical Traps improves by 1.\nNote: The setting range of the Alchemical Traps has been reduced to normal (i.e. they cannot be \"thrown\" as in the unmodded game). Furthermore, the traps no longer have the spell-like Maze/Otiluke's Resilient Sphere effects and the physical damage component (which was missing from level 16 onward) has been restored. Their new secondary effects are alchemical (rather than magical) in nature and therefore completely ignore any magic resistance of their targets. However, specific creatures may be innately immune to certain effects. For example, Constructs, Slimes, Elementals and Undead creatures cannot be dazzled or rendered unconscious, flying and incorporeal creatures like Wyverns, Beholders, Shadows, Mists, Air and Fire Elementals cannot be slowed by the grease effect, while exceptionally large creatures (Dragons, Giants, Iron Golems) and incorporeal creatures (Shadows, Mists, Air and Fire Elementals) cannot be entangled. It should also be noted that slowed, entangled and blinded creatures temporarily lose any dexterity bonus to their armor class since they cannot dodge attacks effectively while they are incapacitated."}

It would be a waste of your life which, fractured though it is, can still contribute much. Helm will see you through. As for our intrepid friends here, I shall exceed the reward offered by Oublek.

After giving the tour, Brathlen will answer some questions before leaving and disappearing for good.\nBrathlen and two of the three &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist%20Mercenary/FLAM\"&gt;Flaming Fist Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; are present between 3:30 am and 8:30 pm while the remaining mercenary and &lt;a href=\"Be%27land\"&gt;Be'land&lt;/a&gt; are present between 3:30 am and 9:30 pm.\nDialogue.\n\"Welcome all to the Hall of Wonders. Please follow, and I shall endeavor to introduce you to the majesty of Gond.\"\n\"I hope you had little difficulty making your way here. People are often confused by the companion building across the lane, the High House of Wonders. It is the consecrated temple to Gond, our worship center on the Sword Coast, and parent temple to the Hall here. Separated to ensure that tourism does not disrupt the sanctity of our reverence, the two structures are nevertheless linked by a bridge, that they might be guarded as one.\"\n\"Here is a wondrous item forged from the mind of one of our respected gnomish brethren. Known as a Steam Dragon, it is a remarkable if somewhat noisy means of moving large objects. The fire in its belly powers mighty gears that can be affixed to belts and pulleys, hauling loads that would require dozens of strong backs. Our own harbor employs such items on a grand scale, relieving ships of their cargo in a matter of moments. A mite detrimental to the jobs of several longshoremen when installed, it has greatly improved the health of the few remaining.\"\n\"Another marvel of ingenuity, the Pump of Gond. By standing astride the seat one is able to move water as a mill wheel might, with only the power of the legs. Excellent for watering fields or draining a flooded home. Hard work to ride for long, it does spare the back and neck from bearing the weight of buckets.\"\n\"Bringing light where is naught but darkness, the Everlight. The natural law that all must fall helps feed continuous oil to a system of lamp lights, eliminating bothersome refueling for weeks at a time. This is the enormous tank that holds the oil in reserve. None need be stranded in the night again, as is inevitable with the standard illumination. Have you ever known the oil to run out during the daytime?\"\n\"\"Here be an amazement if ever there was one. Without question you have all seen a mariner's standard spyglass? That crude device that roughs out a coastline? It is but a shadow of this work of art from faraway Lantan. We are informed that it was labeled a \"tell-a-scope\" or some such when initially assembled, but we have taken to calling it a Farseer. A much more elegant name for its function and craftsmanship. The faces of the stars themselves are visible with its aid, and one is liable to run out of earth before running out of sight. Our local craftsmen have not been able to recapture Gond's original inspiration, and the inner workings remain a detailed mystery. Thus, while copies of its beauty are available, they function no better than the spyglass I mentioned.\"\"\n\"I apologize, but I have to take my leave. I have duties in the temple, and must leave you to marvel on your own. Are there questions that I might answer before I go?\""}

When the Breach strikes the shield, both are nullified and consumed.\nA creature who cannot be targeted cannot be breached. For example, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; prevent targeting from a Breach Spell (aside from a few late-game enemies who can &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;ignore invisibility&lt;/a&gt;).\nA creature that is immune to spells with a 5 &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; will also be immune to a Breach spell, such as a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Rakshasa\"&gt;Rakshasa&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Breach doesn't remove illusionary protections such as &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Reflected%20Image\"&gt;Reflected Image&lt;/a&gt;. It also does nothing against buffs like &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Regeneration (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Power\"&gt;Holy Power&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenser%27s%20Transformation\"&gt;Tenser's Transformation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Resistance%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Magic Resistance (spell)&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Breach is of the Abjuration school, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Abjuration&lt;/a&gt; doesn't block the spell.\nIn the unmodified game, Breach cannot be blocked by a spell protection such as &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;. See the Mod content below for alternative game revisions.\nCasting a Breach on a neutral creature will turn them hostile, and perhaps others in the same vicinity.\nSpells subject to breaching.\nListed below are \"all\" combat and specific protection &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; and , subject to breaching in alphabetical order. An icon denotes those particular spells that differ by game version.\nTrivia.\nThe Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset has no 5th level Wizard spell titled \"\"Breach\". However, there is a 6th level Wizard spell called \"Breach Defenses\"\". Breach defenses temporarily negates the magical defenses of a crea\u00adture otherwise immune to normal weapons. Once drained of its magical protection, the creature becomes vulnerable to normal weapons and its Armor Class is worsened by 2 (from AC 4 to AC 6, for example) to a maximum of AC 10. Under this insidious spell's power, wraiths become more tan\u00adgible, iron golems soften, and lycanthropes must fear more than silver weapons. See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; \"More Consistent Breach Spell\" component changes Breach in two significant ways:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod 5th Level spell &lt;a href=\"http%3A//gibberlings3.github.io/SpellRevisions/spells/arcane/level-5/dispelling-screen\"&gt;Dispelling Screen&lt;/a&gt; protects against one instance of a dispel magic effect or a Breach spell.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects to match up with the SR combat and specific protections it removes. See below for description:\nBreach\nLevel: 5\nSchool: Abjuration\nRange: Long\nDuration: Instant\nCasting Time: 5\nArea of Effect: 1 creature\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is cast at a creature, it breaches and dispels all of the specific and combat protections on the target creature. The target\u2019s magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.\nThe specific protection spells dispelled by Breach are: Resist Fear, Resist Elements, Death Ward, Free Action, Protection from Acid, Protection from Cold, Protection from Electricity, Protection from Fire, Chaotic Commands, Protection from Magic Energy, Protection from the Elements, and Protection from Energy.\nThe combat protection spells dispelled by Breach are: Mage Armor, Shield, Armor of Faith, Barkskin, Protection from Missiles, Spirit Armor, Stoneskin, Protection from Normal Weapons, Protection from Magical Weapons, Physical Mirror, Prismatic Mantle, and Absolute Immunity."}

All it can really do is scout ahead of the caster and hopefully remain undetected - it can dispel the \"fog of war\" on a map, in the same manner a player character or familiar can.\nThe eye can't interact with objects, switches, containers, doors and can't attack anything.\nThe eye moves at a moderate floating speed, slightly faster than a normal humanoid creature.\nThe eye is fragile, and if exposed to spells it can be damaged/killed or otherwise fall prey to negative status effects, such as &lt;a href=\"Confused\"&gt;Confused&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sleep\"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and many others.\nContrary to the spell's description, certain spells can in fact be indirectly cast upon the eye, which can \"enhance\" it, such as &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Chant\"&gt;Chant&lt;/a&gt; for example. \nHowever, as it is invisible, a party member can't target the creature with many single-target spells, and if those are attempted a text will display reading \"Spell Canceled: Cannot target spells on invisible or sanctuaried creatures.\" \nThe eye's always on invisibility can be removed by a hostile creature's divination attack spells, and targeted if an enemy has the &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; power. \nOnce the eye's invisibility is stripped away, it is ripe for being targeted and destroyed. \nIf the eye gets caught in a &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect from an enemy source, it can be destroyed as well.\nThe caster cannot have more than one eye active at a time - if a second is attempted a message will display \"You may have only one explorer active at a time\".\nIn almost all gameplay situations, there is little risk of an enemy gaze attack on the wizard eye, and even if it did occur, the game doesn't transfer that attack to the caster - this is just a literary flourish in the spell's description taken from the Advanced D&amp;D 2nd Edition's spell description.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its range. See below for description:\nWizard Eye\nLevel: 4\nSchool: Divination\nRange: Short\nDuration: 1 round/level\nCasting Time: 1 round\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends him visual information. The wizard eye can see with normal vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit areas. The wizard eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful dispel cast on the wizard or eye ends the spell."}
{"id": "9082", "revid": "49127847", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9082", "title": "Wizard Slayer", "text": "Wizard Slayer is one of the class kits available for &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s. This class kit has a fairly self-explanatory specialization, killing wizards and other &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Magic\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; spellcasters as efficiently as possible by causing them to &lt;a href=\"Miscast%20Magic\"&gt;miscast magic&lt;/a&gt; while also avoiding their spell effects. They can also become a decent tank for physical and magical attacks as well. Note that wizard slayers are \"wizard\" slayers, and have fewer advantages when facing divine spellcasters such as &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDue to their stance on magic, wizard slayers are restricted in the use of some types of enchanted gear (&lt;a href=\"rings\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"amulets\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"necklaces\"&gt;necklaces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bracers\"&gt;bracers&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"gauntlets\"&gt;gauntlets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"belts\"&gt;belts&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"girdles\"&gt;girdles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cloaks\"&gt;cloaks&lt;/a&gt; and most &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;). The only way to circumvent this restriction is to dual class to a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; and select the &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"high-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;high-level class ability&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter abilities table.\nNote: For the information in this table, the human class was used, because humans do not have any bonuses or penalties to the primary ability scores. For all other races, these numbers may be slightly different. For example, elves have even higher minimal requirements.\nAdvanced Weapon Specialization.\nAdvanced Weapon Specialization increases the maximum number of points that can be invested into a specific proficiency to five points. As a result, fighters may do more damage and hit more often with weapons from that specific proficiency. For more information on proficiency points, see &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20proficiency\"&gt;Weapon proficiency&lt;/a&gt;.\nWizard Slayer Abilities.\nInnate Magic Resistance.\nWizard slayers gain a 1% bonus to magic resistance per level, and starting from level 20, gain a 5% bonus to magic resistance every even level (thus 19% at level 19, 24% at level 20, 25% at level 21, 30% at level 22, and so on).\nOf note is the fact that this kit's magic resistance is cumulative with most sources of magic resistance (even &lt;a href=\"Carsomyr\"&gt;Carsomyr&lt;/a&gt;'s, on a Wizard Slayer/Thief with Use Any Item, but not &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Magic\"&gt;Resist Magic&lt;/a&gt;). Some of them are the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tears of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt;, equipped items and even transformations (eg the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;). Due to this fact, if Gorion's Ward is a Wizard Slayer, it's possible to reach 99% magic resistance without any equipment or temporary buff (84% from level 40 + 10% from the Tear of Bhaal + 5% from the Machine of Lum).\nMiscast Magic on Hit.\nEvery successful hit the wizard slayer makes against arcane spellcasters lowers their chance to successfully cast spells by 25% for 5 rounds. With further hits, the duration refreshes, the chance to miscast stacks, and even applies if their attack deals no damage. Four successful hits will render an enemy mage unable to cast spells (though they can still use magic items such as ). Ranged weapons with high attacks per round, such as (3 APR), or &lt;a href=\"Tuigan%20Bow%20%2B1\"&gt;Tuigan Bow +1&lt;/a&gt; (3 APR), would be a great choice as the miscast magic effect applies to ranged attacks as well. It also applies to weapons that have an area of effect (&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Seeds\"&gt;Fire Seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Detonation\"&gt;Arrow of Detonation&lt;/a&gt;). The added benefit is that most spell protections only protect against targeted attacks but not against AOE attacks.\nIn terms of &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;high-level abilities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Strike\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt; is preferred in order to stack up more hits quickly and render spellcasters ineffective.\nMagic Items Restriction.\nWizard slayers can wear enchanted body &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"helmets\"&gt;helmets&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"headgear\"&gt;headgear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and magical &lt;a href=\"ammunition\"&gt;ammunition&lt;/a&gt;. Their main disadvantage is that enchanted &lt;a href=\"rings\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"amulets\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"necklaces\"&gt;necklaces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"belts\"&gt;belts&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"girdles\"&gt;girdles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cloaks\"&gt;cloaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bracers\"&gt;bracers&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"gauntlets\"&gt;gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; are off-limits.\nQuick-item Restrictions.\nQuick inventory items and other consumables which can be used by wizard slayers are:\nFurthermore, dual-classing allows wizard slayers to use more quick inventory items and consumables, even some that they, technically, shouldn't be able to (eg they correctly can't use Wands of Paralyzation when dualed to Mage in BGEE, but they're able to in BG2EE):\nBaldur's Gate I EE Playstyle.\nIn BG:EE you won't miss much power under item slots you can't equip. As you can't use rings/amulets/cloaks you should use magic plate armor while leaving non-magic version to other party members that can combine them with rings/amulets/cloaks of protection.\nIn terms of fighting casters miscast magic will apply only for arcane spells - so usually mages. However the game doesn't always behave as expected and some enemies looking like priests/druids and casting priest/druid spells will be affected. For the miscast magic to be effective you have to apply it quickly - so high attack per round weapon is advised (darts, bows, or two weapon fighting).\nOn the defensive side Wizard Slayer will be very weak - you can't use rings of free action, you can use mind shielding potions and priests on low levels will have limited access to matching spells. Most casters in BG1 will open with crowd control spells so you have to be prepared which for Wizard Slayer is rather impossible unless using ranged weapons from the second line. Barbarian or Berserker on the other hand when enraged will be immune to pretty much any CC and thus able to quickly take down the caster.\nIf you aren't going with ranged weapons axes look like a good pick due to &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Slayer%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;Wizard Slayer (weapon)&lt;/a&gt; axe that also can be imported to BG2:EE if you are proficient with axes and you have it with you. The axe works on all spell casting, including divine and is magical although the enchantment is +1 only.\nBaldur's Gate II EE Playstyle.\nYour playstyle depends on whenever you play a melee or ranged build. With melee you will need a priest buffing you with Free Action and Chaotic Commands and mage protecting you from magical/elemental damage when facing harder caster enemies. For late ToB levels you may be able to reach 100% magic resistance or close to it. Evil characters can utilize &lt;a href=\"Human%20Flesh\"&gt;Human Flesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen using ranged weapons you will be less likely to be targeted with spells so it's easier to handle and you don't have to be as protected as in melee range (although your tank will benefit from same spells).\nDue to item restrictions, in BG2 Wizard Slayer does lose a lot of options for power gain and thus usually is dual-classed into a thief to remove the restrictions thanks to Use Any Item ability.\nItem Restrictions Exceptions.\nItem restrictions for Wizard Slayer are implemented through manual exclusion of each barred item. There are a handful of items that was mistakenly omitted by developers, this group includes but is not limited to: \nHigh-level class abilities.\nHigh level class abilities were added in the expansion . For all warrior classes and &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, the pool of abilities consist of abilities which can be accessed from the special abilities menu during battle. These abilities are available to fighters when they exceed 3,000,000 &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;, which means they usually start to get HLA at level 21 and each level after. Single class Wizard Slayers will have 20 HLA in total at level 40. \nTable for experience, weapon proficiency points, hitpoints and Magic resistance.\nFor more information, see &lt;a href=\"Experience%20tables\"&gt;Experience tables&lt;/a&gt;."}

It has all the general statistics of a\u00a0normal &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe\"&gt;battle axe&lt;/a&gt;, but is &lt;a href=\"Magical%20item\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; and for all intents and purposes, can be considered a +1 weapon.\nGameplay.\nOn a successful hit, Wizard Slayer inflicts a status effect that causes an 80% chance of casting failure unless the victim succeeds its &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt; vs Spell with a -2 penalty. &lt;a href=\"Priest%20spells\"&gt;Divine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Magic\"&gt;Arcane Magic&lt;/a&gt; are affected and it lasts for 100 seconds. As an on-hit effect it goes through &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and it stacks with itself and other sources of casting failure like the &lt;a href=\"Deafness%20effect\"&gt;Deafness effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe axe also allows instantaneous casting of &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; once per day, at the wielder's divine caster level (character level for Clerics/Druids/Shamans, character level -7 for Rangers, character level -8 for Paladins and 1 for characters that cannot cast ).\nAs such, in BG2EE, this charge ability can only be used effectively by Shamans, Rangers, Paladins and Cleric/Thieves with Use Any Item. Shamans in particular benefit the most, being able to eventually cast this with a level of 31 (or 32, if wearing the Circlet of Lost Souls, something that Cleric/Thieves can also benefit from).\nIn BGEE, Shamans are really the only class that can put this axe's dispel magic ability to good use, as everyone else who can wield this weapon will only have a divine caster level of 1. It might seem useless at first, as the class can already cast Dispel Magic normally, but: a) you might not have selected the spell for your Shaman and b) this ability is cast instantaneously, whereas the divine spell Dispel Magic has a casting time of 6. Plus, having this ability as an option leaves a level 3 slot for other spells."}

It is a matter of dispute whether certain areas in the game belong to Western Heartlands or Amn. Some players are ambivalent and subscribe to more expansive definitions of the Western Heartlands with the border line at &lt;a href=\"Beregost\"&gt;Beregost&lt;/a&gt;, which roughly divides the Sword Coast up into Western Heartlands and &lt;a href=\"Amn\"&gt;Amn&lt;/a&gt;. One can also see the Coast as merging from Amn into Heartlands, or that the Heartlands stop at Baldur's Gate, etc. Finally, Amn and the Heartlands can be seen as being divided, with the Sword Coast in between as its own entity.\nCategories on this wiki are currently arranged according to the latter viewpoint. There is no strict rule here, only an aesthetic rationale: it is convenient and practical for all of the areas in Baldur's Gate game to be considered part of the Sword Coast; for the Sword Coast to have its own town, Beregost; for the areas around Baldur's Gate City to be in Western Heartlands, and for Amn's borders to be on the same latitude as &lt;a href=\"Nashkel\"&gt;Nashkel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDisc 1, the north part of Disc 2, Disc 4 and &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; itself are both &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast\"&gt;Sword Coast&lt;/a&gt; and Western Heartlands, Disc 3 is &lt;a href=\"Amn\"&gt;Amn&lt;/a&gt;. The rest (including ) are Sword Coast areas.\nGeographical table map.\nThere are 54 mapped areas that can be traveled to above ground, these are all eventually unlocked on the World Map. There are also interiors of dungeons and buildings. Each one has an &lt;a href=\"Area%20Code\"&gt;area code&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following tables map the main area. They are positioned geographically. Two areas that came with the expansion \"\", namely &lt;a href=\"Ulgoth%27s%20Beard\"&gt;Ulgoth's Beard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Durlag's Tower&lt;/a&gt;, though integrated in the map, don't fit into this array due to being added after the technical completion of the main game."}

Each drain is temporary; 300 seconds (i.e., 5 minutes). However, the effect is cumulative, such that the target will instantly die if strength is drained below 1 point."}

A sound effect is audible at the beginning and another when the spell expires. The creature's portrait will display an icon (No. 23 \"Invulnerable\").\nAlso, after the spell is cast a text display reads \"Wraithformed\".\nThe spell now will protect against all normal weapons (including missile ammunition). Obviously any magical or enchanted weapon will be able to bypass this protection.\nAdditionally, the spell also boosts the caster's &lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;Magical damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance by +25%, which is cumulative with other sources of magic damage resistance.\nThe spell deactivates arcane and divine spellcasting and also innate abilities (e.g. Bhaalspawn powers). Scrolls can still be used to cast spells in this wraithform.\nThis spell can be removed with any &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect, but it is immune to the &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nIt appears that this spell can be \"stacked\", as it doesn't have the required coding to prevent that. If two of these spells were applied to the same caster, they would be able to receive additional magical damage resistance. Perhaps the developers missed fixing this issue, as similar spells were revised to prevent such things. Of course, since this form restricts Wizard spell casting, it would need to be applied with a scroll.\nAcquisition.\n In the original , Wraith Form \u2013 as it is spelled in those \u2013 is only available in the base game, \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\", as rare &lt;a href=\"random%20treasure\"&gt;random treasure&lt;/a&gt;.

For instance, the wizard can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all he wears or holds in his hands, as long as the spell persists. Additionally, no form of attack is possible when in wraithform, except against creatures that exist on the Ethereal Plane, where all attacks (both ways) are normal. See the External link for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its school and internal Opcode structure:\nWraithform\nAlteration\nLevel: 3\nRange: 0\nDuration: 2 rounds/level\nCasting Time: 1\nArea of Effect: The caster\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard and all of &lt;PRO_HISHER&gt; gear become insubstantial. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better enchantment, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. The wizard also gains 25% resistance to magic damage. While in wraithform, the caster cannot cast either arcane or divine spells."}

This article is focused on the adult Wyvern versions in and . Differences between the original game will be pointed out if needed.\nWyvern versions in the game saga.\nBaldur's Gate I.\nThis version of an adult Wyvern is detailed in the first InfoBox. They can inhabit heavily wooded regions, particularly the area &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Cloakwood\"&gt;Cloakwood Wyverns&lt;/a&gt;. They are often encountered when the party is waylaid while traveling between forests, including &lt;a href=\"Cloakwood\"&gt;Cloakwood&lt;/a&gt; and the \"Wood of Sharp Teeth\".\nWyverns are among the most challenging enemies in Baldur's Gate and can easily wipe out an unprepared party \u2013 especially as they are most often encountered in groups of at least two. They have two melee attacks: a high-damage crushing blow (from teeth and claws) and a low-damage piercing strike (the tail). The piercing strike inflicts powerful &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; effect if its victim fails their saving throw. Antidotes are critical here, as the poison will inflict a large amount of damage in the time it takes to cast Slow Poison.\nAs a wyvern's saving throws are relatively high, it's generally suggested to use missile weapons, while using a high-AC decoy that has some &lt;a href=\"Antidote\"&gt;Antidote&lt;/a&gt;s handy.\nBaldur's Gate II.\nAdult Wyverns can be encountered in certain areas, and a version may be faced if summoned by enemies using the &lt;a href=\"Wyvern%20Call\"&gt;Wyvern Call&lt;/a&gt; conjuring spell. The lethality and danger of an adult Wyvern is diminished in BG2, as the creature design was not significantly scaled up to match the party's experience levels. See the BG2 InfoBox for the slight changes made from the BG1 version.\nNote that the Wyvern creature summoned by the Wyvern Call spell is a \"summoned\" creature and can be banished with a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelated Quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Coran%20the%20Wyvern%20Hunter\"&gt;Coran the Wyvern Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\", after speaking with the potential companion &lt;a href=\"Coran\"&gt;Coran&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Cloakwood\"&gt;First Cloakwood&lt;/a&gt; area, it's possible to turn in a &lt;a href=\"Wyvern%20Head\"&gt;Wyvern Head&lt;/a&gt; to the Beregost authorities for a pretty penny - .

Its own saving throws are quite low, as well.\nIt has immunity to various effects that restrict movement, such as &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralysis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slow%20effect\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Webbed\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grease\"&gt;Grease&lt;/a&gt;.

For example, a Cleric's Strength of One spell (that can be used to buff several wyverns at once) will improve THAC0 by 2 and damage by 3.\n-A wyvern also benefits from improved haste more than most summons, as the majority of them only have 1 attack per round (so there's no point in doubling 1 with improved haste, might as well use regular haste), but the wyvern has 2.\n-A Skald's song and/or any Bard's Enhanced Bard Song can do a lot for this summon, as its main issues are AC and THAC0 (not to mention the relatively short duration of the spell). In fact, if both songs are combined the wyvern will reach -7 AC and 2 THAC0, so if there are several wyverns it's pretty likely that even very strong enemies will get poisoned and die (again, just two applications can fell even dragons).\n-A Skald's song or Enhanced Bard Song also provides immunities that fit perfectly with the wyvern's own, adding fear, confusion and stun to the list, making wyverns immune to the vast majority of status effects in the game (one of the few notable exceptions is charm).\nWhere to obtain its scroll.\n-Unlike most spells below level 9, the scroll for this spell cannot be found on random loot.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has no direct equivalent to the arcane \"Wyvern Call\" spell, however it does offer the level 6 arcane spell \"Monster Summoning VI\", as described below:\nMonster Summoning VI\nLevel: 6\nSchool: Conjuration\nRange: Medium\nDuration: 3 turns\nCasting Time: 1 round\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nBy means of this spell, the caster summons a number of monsters, which serve the mage under any conditions.

Unfortunately, he was captured and held prisoner by &lt;a href=\"Mulahey\"&gt;Mulahey&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; &amp;.\nRecruitment.\nXan is encountered near the end of &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Two\"&gt;Chapter Two&lt;/a&gt;, or the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Three\"&gt;Chapter Three&lt;/a&gt; if the party deals with &lt;a href=\"Mulahey\"&gt;Mulahey&lt;/a&gt; first. He is found held captive in a cave room next to Mulahey's makeshift throne room in the &lt;a href=\"Nashkel%20Mines\"&gt;Nashkel Mines&lt;/a&gt;, and will ask to help the party defeat him if they haven't already done so. Note that he will leave permanently if you turn him down at this point, but if his offer to join the party (whether Mulahey has already been killed or not) is accepted he can subsequently be released from the party and he will remain wherever he is until recruited again.\nHe also appears in the tutorial of \u00a0and the Enhanced Editions, where he explains how the wizard spells work.\nGameplay.\nXan's &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; is Enchanter, so he can't scribe and cast Evocation spells from his spellbook, either powerful offensive ones like &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;, or good defensive ones like &lt;a href=\"Shield_%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;. But alternatively he can use all the powerful arcane wands, like the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Wand of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Wand of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, and also items like the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Amulet\"&gt;Shield Amulet&lt;/a&gt; instead of some of the spells. Combined with the casting of non-evocation \"nukes\" (like &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull Trap&lt;/a&gt;), Xan can deal significant spell damage when required.\nHowever, his specialization means that his Enchantment spells are more powerful against enemies, who receive a -2 penalty to their saving throws. Being able to hinder or even shut down enemy groups \u2014 and a good way to do this is with Enchantment spells like for example &lt;a href=\"Sleep\"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Hold Person&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 might be even more crucial in Baldur's Gate (being a low level setting) than dealing a lot of damage.\nWhen first encountered he is injured and has no spells memorized, though there is a &lt;a href=\"Moonblade%20%28Nashkel%20Mines%29\"&gt;Moonblade&lt;/a&gt; in a nearby chest which can only be wielded by Xan. It is very powerful, but due to Xan's low constitution he should really only use the weapon either defensively (with high enough fire resistance, fire damage will actually heal Xan) or to finish off disabled enemy units.\nHis low hit points mean that spells like &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; might be crucial for him. Also, using potions like the &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fortitude\"&gt;Potion of Fortitude&lt;/a&gt; when needed can raise his survival chances by a lot.\nPersonality.\nXan is a wellspring of pessimistic dialogue, often making defeatist comments and expressing surprise at the party's positive achievements. His excessive gloom, despondency and moroseness is received differently by players; some find the character humorous, others are annoyed by him.\nA closer inspection of Xan's &lt;a href=\"%23Quotes\"&gt;voiced remarks&lt;/a&gt; against other NPCs, however, reveals a sarcastic \u2013 even snide \u2013 nature to his comments (especially against &lt;a href=\"Ajantis%20Ilvastarr\"&gt;Ajantis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eldoth%20Kron\"&gt;Eldoth&lt;/a&gt;), which adds a new dimension to his personality by keeping the player guessing about how serious he actually is with his pessimism. This conflicting persona is reflected by how the character wields a Moonblade \u2013 an extremely powerful, semi-sentient, good-aligned magical weapon that will actually kill a user it deems unworthy of wielding it.\nMod content.\nWith installation of the &lt;a href=\"Xan%20BG2%20NPC\"&gt;Xan BG2 NPC&lt;/a&gt; mod, Xan can be met again in &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Government\"&gt;Government district&lt;/a&gt; and once more become a &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;."}

Yeslick was one of the survivors. He went to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sembia\"&gt;Sembia&lt;/a&gt;, where he met &lt;a href=\"Rieltar%20Anchev\"&gt;Rieltar&lt;/a&gt; and eventually told him of his old home. This proved to be a huge mistake, as Rieltar betrayed Yeslick and forced him to disclose the location of the mine. He has been imprisoned ever since.\n&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; &amp;.\nRecruitment.\nYeslick is available from &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Four\"&gt;Chapter Four&lt;/a&gt;.

If, upon freeing him, the player declines his help, he will exit the map. If declined in this way in the \"\", he can be found later in &lt;a href=\"Jopalin%27s%20Tavern\"&gt;Jopalin's Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"south%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;south Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, if you recruit him, and he later quits your party, he may end up at &lt;a href=\"the%20Friendly%20Arm%20Inn\"&gt;the Friendly Arm Inn&lt;/a&gt;. In either inn, if Yeslick is spoken to he will merely comment on the party's efforts; to get him to offer his services as a party member, simply speak to him a second time.\nRecruitment bug: \nYeslick's close relation to the Cloakwood Mines means that any bugs relating to that quest relate to him as well; the bug that caused him to complain that the mines were not flooded even though they were, was supposed to have been fixed in an early BG patch, still exists in the final version of the original game 1.3.5521:\nSuppose Yeslick is recruited in the mines and is in the party when the mines are flooded. Then, if he is later dismissed from the party he will declare that the mines must be flooded to dampen the plans of the Iron Throne. Talk to him again and he says something to the effect of \"bust some heads,\" but the recruitment dialogue is not initiated. Strangely, talk to him yet again, and the recruitment dialogue returns. Subsequent Yeslick dismissals get the \"bust some heads\" comment without any further mention of the mines.\nGameplay.\nAs a dwarf with 17 &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;, Yeslick receives a -4 bonus to his &lt;a href=\"save\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt;s against Death, Spells and Wands. He also gains +2\u00a0hp every fighter level and +1\u00a0hp every cleric level. He can cast &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28Yeslick%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; once per day as an innate ability.\nWhen he joins the party, he has no items in his inventory, consistent with his status as a prisoner of the Iron Throne. If the Yeslick accessed through the &lt;a href=\"Console\"&gt;Console&lt;/a&gt; is any indication, then there is no particular advantage to recruiting him early. At Fighter 2, Cleric 3, the console Yeslick has 2 more HP than of the maximum possible HP, and at Fighter 4, Cleric 5, he has 1 more HP (and would save a lot of saving and reloading to keep that +2).\nTo start, he has two proficiency pips in slings and warhammers.\nYeslick has only 7 Intelligence, which means that he cannot use wands -like for example the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Wand of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;- or cast spells from scrolls (unless he boosts his Intelligence first).\u00a0"}

It is at this juncture that Yoshimo is revealed to be his puppet. This occurs after the prison cells tour while navigating the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Main%20Floor\"&gt;Spellhold Main Floor&lt;/a&gt; area. It doesn't matter which method the party managed to get inside Spellhold, whether via &lt;a href=\"Desharik\"&gt;Desharik&lt;/a&gt; or using the &lt;a href=\"Wardstone%20for%20Asylum\"&gt;Wardstone for Asylum&lt;/a&gt;. In both cases Yoshimo's plot will occur.\nThe party will speak of their disgust over this betrayal. Once the party is incapacitated by a sleep gas - Yoshimo is present with Irenicus while he performs a procedure to drain the Bhaalspawn's soul essence.\nDuring your escape you'll encounter Yoshimo again, he will teleport into the laboratory during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20with%20Irenicus%20in%20Spellhold\"&gt;Battle with Irenicus in Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; at the same time that Irenicus is escaping the battle due to damage. Following that, Yoshimo delivers some dialogue and then goes hostile. Seconds later the &lt;a href=\"Murderer\"&gt;Murderer&lt;/a&gt; thieves will begin to attempt to enter the lab as well. It's also revealed by Yoshimo that Irenicus has somehow probably placed sort of &lt;a href=\"geas\"&gt;geas&lt;/a&gt; upon him, forcing him to obey his will or die instantly. After Yoshimo's inevitable death, you may pick up &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo%27s%20Heart\"&gt;his heart&lt;/a&gt; and bring it to a priest of &lt;a href=\"Ilmater\"&gt;Ilmater&lt;/a&gt; later to grant him final rest in the afterlife, you earn for doing so.\nHowever, if you dismiss him and ask him to stay in the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt; before entering Spellhold, he will not be mentioned by Jon Irenicus at all after the inmate cells tour. \nOnce the party returns to Athkatla in chapter 6, if the party visits the Copper Coronet, Yoshimo automatically dies when you step inside. There will no heart to collect. Thus ends Yoshimo's appearance in the saga. \nThere are also tricks in to keep him alive, at least until \"\". However, this isn't recommended, as the game has no dialogue for Yoshimo after a certain game point and wasn't designed for him to be present. Circumnavigating or using various exploits to achieve this is outside the scope of the wiki, although it can be found on the internet if the player wishes to investigate that exploit. \n&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nGameplay.\nHe is the only pure (non-dual class) &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; in \"Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn\". In both BG2 and BG2EE he has the kit &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Hunter\"&gt;Bounty Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nYoshimo has the following items when joining the party: &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo%27s%20Katana\"&gt;his katana&lt;/a&gt; which can only be used by him, a short bow, studded leather armor and some arrows.\nYoshimo can &lt;a href=\"dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;. If you do so before leaving Irenicus's Dungeon in Chapter 1 he can become a strong archer, thanks to his 18 Dexterity and potential for grandmastery (due to the large experience gain upon completing the prologue). However, this is not advised for new players unless they have a backup thief until he regains his thief skills.\nDialogues.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTrivia.\n Interestingly, the game files include a line of dialogue for Yoshimo when the party enters the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, which\u00a0suggests that the developers of the original game initially had different plans for his role in the plot.\n&lt;br&gt;\nMod content.\nFurther interaction with Yoshimo is available through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/SpellholdStudios/YoshimoFriendship\"&gt;Yoshimo Friendship&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//downloads.weaselmods.net/download/yoshimo-romance/\"&gt;Yoshimo Romance&lt;/a&gt; mods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.gibberlings3.net/mods/npcs/yoshi/\"&gt;Keeping Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; mod allows players to retain Yoshimo past Spellhold."}

All yuan-ti seen in-game have a snake-like head, scaly humanoid upper torso, and a legless, snake-like lower body. They vary in size depending upon the type of Yuan-ti encountered and some are capable of casting spells.\nYuan-ti are infamous for worshipping the demonic god &lt;a href=\"Sseth\"&gt;Sseth&lt;/a&gt; and feeling deep hatred towards scaleless humanoid races. Usually inhabiting the jungles in the southern parts of &lt;a href=\"Toril\"&gt;Toril&lt;/a&gt;, they are rarely found within the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast\"&gt;Sword Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe majority of standard warrior Yuan-ti encountered in the saga are the 7 HD 48 HP version. A slightly more powerful version is found in chapter 8 as part of the &lt;a href=\"Neera\"&gt;Neera&lt;/a&gt; questline in .\nNote: The standard Yuan-ti has no proficiency with a Long Sword or any weapon except for \"Spiked Weapons\". As the creatures do not wield those weapon types, there are no proficiency bonuses applied to this creature, unlike the BG2EE (ohnyuan) version, which do benefit from properly set weapon proficiency.\nThe (ohnyuan) version is scripted to use their carried &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt; if wounded and triggered at a predefined threshold. \nLocations.\nICYUAN01.cre\n\"Shadows of Amn\".\nFixed Locations:\nIf &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; is 2,000,000 or greater, two Yuan-ti will spawn in the following places:\nRandom Spawn Locations:\n_________________________________&lt;br&gt;\nohnyuan.cre\nMod content.\nMods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes revisions to all Yuan-ti's in the game. The warrior types have new default SCS fighter scripts for improved tactical awareness and targeting behavior. The script also provides use of carried potions if they have them.\nAdditionally, the creature is assigned a Fighter Class and given proper weapon proficiencies - 4 pips in Long Sword proficiency and 2 pips in single weapon fighting style. This improves THAC0, APR, weapon damage and armor class. \nExtra Hit Points are present to reflect their Fighter Class, as well as improved DEX and CON scores. These revisions will make the creatures less fragile and increase challenge commensurate with their D&amp;D size and creature lore.\n&lt;a href=\"Afaaq%20the%20Djinni%20Companion\"&gt;Afaaq the Djinni Companion&lt;/a&gt; mod quest will see the party having to teleport to the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chult\"&gt;Jungles of Chult&lt;/a&gt; where extensive and tougher Yuan-ti adversaries are encountered. More Yuan-ti's are present in this scenario than the any other unmodified area of the BG2 Saga."}
