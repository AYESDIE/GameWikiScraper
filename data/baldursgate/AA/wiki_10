She willingly undertook a ritual to remove her memories in order to protect the secrets of her fellow Shar worshippers.

She can be left in the pod or released via several methods.\nIf she is released, she will join your party as you proceed to the helm. She will then be found unconscious near your starting position. She will be grateful you helped her.\nIf she is not released, she will be found a little further on, pounding on a locked door. She will be unhappy that you left her in the pod and may fight you.\nIf you do not interact with her in the beach, or if you take a long rest immediately upon arriving at the beach, she can be found in the Druid Grove.\nPlaying as Shadowheart.\nYou will start the prologue in the normal starting location, and the pod in which you usually find Shadowheart will be empty. The artifact will be found next to you on the ground, and you will be prompted to pick it up and bring it to Baldur's Gate.\nLater, the beach will have no other party members, which will make the initial fight with the intellect devourers significantly tougher. To compensate, there will only be two instead of three intellect devourers. But if Shadowheart is downed, then you will experience an immediate game over. (It is possible to bypass this fight by climbing/jumping up the rocks to the right of where you can first see the intellect devourers. If you come back later with two or more party members, there will be three of them to fight.)\nInteractions.\nThis could use serious improvements! The idea is to log interactions between characters, player, detecting what increases and decreases approval, what events can be triggered and how to trigger them, and what classes and/or races have alternate conversation options and path.\nConversation.\nDefault Conversation.\n(Shadowheart): Something the matter? \n(Player): I want to talk about all that's happened to us. \n(Shadowheart): Fine. What's on your mind? \n-(Player): How am I holding up in your estimations? If player is neutral approval: \n-(Shadowheart): I must admit, you've been a surprise, and not an unplesant one. Kindred spirits are few and far between for me. If player saved shadowheart on the nautiloid: \n-(Shadowheart): Besides, you saved my life aboard the nautiloid. How can I do anything but sing your praise?\nEmerald Grove.\n(Shadowheart): This place seems remarkably tense for a sacred grove. Perhaps we shouldn't linger. But let's at least see if there's a healer to be found, first of all."}

They gain their power through alliances with powers of the \"spirit world\" and act as intermediaries between them and the corporeal inhabitants of the visible world. Constantly aware of spirits that others cannot see, shamans fit unevenly into society, even compared with others who draw on similar powers such as druids.\nShamans may cast &lt;a href=\"Druid%23Druid%20spells\"&gt;druid spells&lt;/a&gt; as well as several shaman-specific spells and &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;high-level abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nShamans only learn new spells when they reach certain levels, and as a result, the number of different spells shamans can know is very limited compared to druids.\u00a0After selecting a desired spell to learn in the level-up screen, they need to &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; before it can be cast, and each casting will subtract 1 from the total casting number of the spell level the spell is from. They will need to rest to replenish the total casting number of each spell level.\nOne significant advantage of Shamans is that they don't have to choose which spells to make available ahead of time like Druids do. All the spells they know will be available to them after resting and may be used as needed.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;s may become shamans.\nShamans may not dual-class.\nAbility Scores Table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, other Races have modified ability scores.\nClass description.\nShamans forge a divine connection with the natural world, similar to the way Druids commune with nature, but Shamans are more spiritual than primal. They directly tap into the energies that flow through the earth and air, through plants and animals, and even through the dead, and shape these energies to obey their will. Nowhere is this more evident than in their ability to summon powerful spirits as guardians and defenders. A being of two worlds, Shamans value balance over dominance.\nClass features:\nThe type of the summoned spirit is randomly determined from all the spirits available at the Shaman's level. For example, a level 12 Shaman will summon either a minor nature spirit, a major animal spirit or a minor animal spirit, but cannot choose which one appears. Spirits will do their best to protect the Shaman but are not controlled directly.\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom lv 18, shamans receive quest level priests spells which are added to their level 7 spellbook, most spells can only be selected once. &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Form\"&gt;Spirit Form&lt;/a&gt; may be selected multiple times and is a pre requisite for &lt;a href=\"Favored%20of%20the%20Spirits\"&gt;Favored of the Spirits&lt;/a&gt;.

The table below accurately portrays this.\nCreature Statistics.\nAll spirit allies have the following immunities: &lt;a href=\"Critical%20hit\"&gt;Critical hit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;Disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20modifier\"&gt;Intelligence drain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Held\"&gt;Hold creature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Confused\"&gt;Confusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feeblemindedness\"&gt;Feeblemindedness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt;, Detect Alignment, &lt;a href=\"Charm%20creature\"&gt;Charm/Domination&lt;/a&gt; and Psionics.\nThey are also immune to being selected by the player, which means that the player has no direct control over them.\nAll spirit allies also have 50% resistance to &lt;a href=\"Slashing%20damage\"&gt;Slashing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piercing%20damage\"&gt;Piercing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Missile%20damage\"&gt;Missile&lt;/a&gt; damage, and 100% resistance to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nThe attacks of the spirit allies are also enchanted, meaning that they can bypass certain immunities. Note that this does not affect their Thac0 and damage. Moreover, all of their special abilities (on crit effects and fireshields) are either nonmagical (so they bypass MR) or magical but still bypass MR anyway.\nSpirits are vulnerable to the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Fog\"&gt;Death Fog&lt;/a&gt;, which means enemies with those spells can immediately kill all summoned spirits.\nAnimal Spirits.\nMinor Animal Spirits.\nThe minor animal spirits are the Fox, Snake and Hound. They all have 2 Hit Dice and Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores of 3. The Hound Spirit is anomalous and its mental attributes are instead 7.\nMajor Animal Spirits.\nThe major animal spirits are the Bear, Panther and Boar. They all have 4 Hit Dice and Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores of 3.\nNature Spirits.\nMinor Nature Spirits.\nThe minor nature spirits are the Lesser Fire, Lesser Air and Lesser Earth. They all have 8 Hit Dice and Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores of 7. The Lesser Air Spirit is also under non-dispellable Improved Invisibility, which, amongst other things means that its saving throws are 4 points better than what is shown in the tables below.\nMajor Nature Spirits.\nThe major nature spirits are the Fire, Air and Earth. They all have 12 Hit Dice and Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores of 7. The Air Spirit is also under non-dispellable Improved Invisibility, which, amongst other things means that its saving throws are 4 points better than what is shown in the tables below.\nRelated Items.\nThere are three items that, when equipped, affect summoned spirit allies; The &lt;a href=\"Circlet%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Circlet of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt; gives them a permanent &lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt; effect, the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Heart of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; gives them +10 Hit Points, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Soulherder%27s%20Staff\"&gt;The Soulherder's Staff&lt;/a&gt; gives them +1 Strength. Note: The Soulherder's Staff is only usable by &lt;a href=\"M%27Khiin%20Grubdoubler\"&gt;M'khiin&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt should be noted that these effects \"will\" be applied to an existing spirit ally if the item is equipped after the spirit has already been summoned. Strangely though, if the item is removed, the spirit allies do \"not\" lose these bonuses.\nGameplay.\nSpirit allies seem to always be summoned starting northeast of the character, regardless of the direction the shaman is facing. To summon them to the south, filling the northern \"slots\" with other companions (or even walls and other obstructions) will force them to be summoned south. This is the only thing that the player can control regarding the spirit allies, since after they are summoned, they do their own thing.\nWhen multiple shamans are dancing, their combined summoning limit is equal to the limit of the highest level shaman. As an example, when an 18th level shaman is dancing alongside two 7th level shamans, a maximum of 5 spirit allies will be summoned. It should be noted that once the limit for the lower level shamans is reached (3 in this scenario), then only the higher level shaman's dance will contribute. Also, the spirit allies are unsummoned only when \"all\" shamans stop dancing, and which shaman is left dancing makes no difference. In the previous example, even if the 18th level shaman stops dancing, no spirit ally is unsummoned, even though the 7th level shamans only have a limit of 3. It should also be noted that spirit allies count towards the normal summoning limit as well.\nThe only ways to \"select\" different spirit allies when dancing is to either unsummon them and try again, or kill the undesired ones. It should be noted though that the (lesser) air spirit cannot be attacked unless it attacks something else first (due to its improved invisibility), and that the (lesser) fire spirit will damage whoever attacks it in melee.\nA Shaman may utilize a clone (obtained through the use of Vhailor's Helm) to help speed up the process of reaching the summoning limit. However, if the original, non-clone, Shaman moves, all of the spirits will be unsummoned, even if the clone keeps dancing. To make better use of this setup, you should continue dancing with the original Shaman when the limit is reached, and use the clone to perform other actions, like casting spells.\nSpirit summoning is not interrupted upon taking damage. Enemies initiating dialogue with the player can sometimes cancel Shamanic Dance. It is possible to move a few steps and keep up Shamanic Dance, as long as it is re-activated before the beginning of the next round. Likewise, the ability to cast spells is not restored immediatly upon stoping the dance, but there's a short cooldown period that has to pass first.\nThe party gains normal experience for enemies that your summons kill.\nBugs.\nThe hound spirit has greater mental attributes than the rest of the animal spirits. While almost certainly a bug, it has no impact on gameplay.\nThe (Lesser) Air and (Lesser) Earth Spirits have respective Electricity and Acid resistance values of -50%. This is probably a bug since +50% resistances seem more likely given the nature of these spirits.\nWhen the spirit allies follow an enemy out of sight of the shaman (possibly to chase a fleeing enemy), more often than not they stop attacking completely.\nSome people believe that the summoning limit behaviour of the shamanic dance (in terms of multiple shamans sharing the same limit of spirits) is a bug. It is, however, possible that this is the intended behaviour.\nThe ability is also mostly definitely bugged in that regular summons count towards the \"spirit limit\" as well. For example, if a shaman of level 6 (with a limit of 3 spirits) casts Animal Summoning I to summon two dire wolves and then starts dancing, they'll only be able to summon one spirit. This, however, does not apply to summons that do not count towards the regular summon limit (like Elemental Princes, Devas/Planetars and Demons/Devils or even Simulacrum clones)."}

If you enter the &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Rune%20Hideout\"&gt;hideout of his organization&lt;/a&gt;, he will greet you in short conversation, before he and several other members of Twisted Rune appear and will be hostile.\nGameplay.\nWhen a party member moves onto a hidden proximity trigger on the area map, this initiates the appearance of Shangalar in an impassable zone on top of the large conference table in the main room of the hideout. \nShangalar will attempt to initiate dialogue, but only if he can detect a player character in range. Being hidden or invisible, or if under the effects of a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Undead\"&gt;Protection From Undead&lt;/a&gt; spell will stymie this initiated speech. This can interfere with progressing the plot, as the dialogue sets in motion Shangalar's hostility state and teleport move to another map area. \nFor a better encounter outcome without any potential bugs or glitches in the scripting, it is advised to have at least one party member able to be detected by the lich so the dialogue can progress properly.\nAssuming Shangalar is able to initiate dialogue, an exchange of dialogue will occur with the party member first detected by the lich, which will go something like this:\nThe party selects a reply, and Shangalar will respond, which can differ depending on the selection.\nIn the end, the dialogue ends with the lich not accepting any retreat or explanations given by the party - leading to a hostile reaction.\nThe lich teleports from the center of the great conference table into the antechamber where the party first entered into this place. Several other members of the Twisted Rune also teleport in in different locations on the area map. All will attack any that are detected.\nThe lich will have an initial preparatory buff chain manifest on itself (unless instantly slain by some kind of trap damage or similar party pre-battle action).\nThe InfoBox lays out the main scripted spell casting decisions for the lich - note that this creature isn't designed to look for or respond to the party's protections or immunities. Shangalar never attempts to remove/dispel or take down any party protections. \nShangalar has the standard protections afforded to a lich, as noted on the InfoBox. He has no special extra powers or abilities beyond that.\nMod content.\nThe mod &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/RoxanneSHS/The-Rune\"&gt;Twisting With the Rune&lt;/a&gt; adds dialogue and context to Shangalar and the other Rune members in his company and ties their activities to other events in the game. In fact, Shangalar may utter the following: \"\"Hmm. I suppose the fool Koshi wrote it down. If you destroyed him to get it, you have my thanks. Punishing the fool has been getting boring of late\".\" This refers to &lt;a href=\"Koshi\"&gt;Koshi&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Guarded%20Compound\"&gt;Guarded Compound&lt;/a&gt;, who will have a special Rogue Stone \"key\".\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises this creature in several ways, influenced by the player's installed mod components.\nShangalar's experience level is raised to 29, and a random mage specialty kit is assigned (Conjurer, Enchanter, Invoker, or Necromancer). The kit determines the allocated spell script that Shangalar uses, including the content of his &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith SCS this lich now has the &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; innate power.\nExpect a more comprehensive and robust chain of initial buffs when the lich begins combat after his mini-teleport move.\nShangalar will recognize many protections and status effect that are active on characters. and his spell casting scripts are adjusted to take those into account - for instance, he won't waste time or cast certain spells at targets that are immune to specific effects or damage and try a different spell or find a more vulnerable target.\nSCS Shangalar is able to use &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, and has several spell protection removing options - on higher game difficult settings he has use of two mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;HLA's&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe drops the \"Lesser Grimoire of Demon Binding\" when defeated. \nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, Shangalar's arcane magic will be the SR versions.\nIf you are playing with the &lt;a href=\"Tactics%20for%20BG2EE\"&gt;Tactics for BG2EE&lt;/a&gt; mod and the \"Improved Twisted Rune\" component, Shangalar's script is different than the SCS script, although still challenging. The Lich's opening contingency battery of buffs is:\n&lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; followed by a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; during which a bunch of self-buffs are applied, making him pretty much invulnerable to all attacks, for several rounds. The creature will cast an assortment of offensive spells at regular intervals, and every four rounds put up a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; on closest enemies. Several more Time stops are possible, during which a Remove magic and followed two &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt; attacks will launch. Several &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt; creatures are summoned to help. Many other spells are cast during the battle. The Lich, by script, really doesn't run out of any spells, as they are mostly done on timed intervals. This scripting isn't as smart as SCS but is more complex than the unmodded game by far. "}

The Black Bear form is exactly the same as the Brown Bear form, except it has worse AC.\nThe wolf form is defensively stronger and has the best damage dice, but its low APR makes it ineffective as a damage dealer.\n All three forms allow offhand weapons and shields to be used as normal. They all benefit from Sword and Shield Style while using shields and Single Weapon Style otherwise (even while equipped with an offhand weapon). In all forms, reequipping armor only provides bonuses (eg AC modifiers against damage types or Fire Resistance), it doesn't alter the character's Base AC.\nShields may be used as normal (if equipped before transforming), but offhand weapons cannot attack, they only provide bonuses (eg +1 APR from Belm or +50% Fire Resistance from Icingdeath) and charge abilities (eg 1x/day Summon Spectral Blade from the Spectral Brand). All forms benefit from Sword and Shield style while equipped with a shield, Single Weapon Style while the offhand is empty and no weapon style while the offhand has a weapon. In all forms, reequipping armor provides full benefits, including altering the character's Base AC (if better).\n1 - This is applied to the base movement speed of a normal brown/black bear. These forms actually move ~15% slower than normal speed.\n2 - This form moves ~25% faster than normal speed.\nAvenger Forms.\nThese forms are accessible by the Avenger only.\u00a0\u00a0All values were obtained from the Enhanced Editions.\nThe baby wyvern and sword spider forms have great synergy with &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;, which the Avenger has access to as part of its kit bonuses.\u00a0 The Avenger can render groups of enemies helpless, then transform and pick off enemies.\nThe baby wyvern's poison is highly effective, dealing a total of 100 damage (even more, if the enemy is under a &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt;) and interrupting almost all spellcasting.\u00a0 Its high save penalty and the wyvern's higher APR make it very reliable as well.\nThe fire salamander can easily reach over 100% fire resistance using spells such as &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fire%20and%20Cold\"&gt;Resist Fire and Cold&lt;/a&gt; or equipment such as &lt;a href=\"Batalista%27s%20Passport\"&gt;Batalista's Passport&lt;/a&gt;, making it effective against\u00a0fire using enemies.\u00a0 It also has the highest enchantment level of any shapeshifting form, but has low APR. But its Breathe Fireball ability allows one to easily damage Mages, as it's considered a nonmagical ability and, therefore, ignores all spell protections (and even Fire Resistance won't prevent stagger, meaning the ability can still disrupt spellcasting while doing 0 damage). One is also able to renew the 3x Breathe Fireball casts once by using the Salamander shapeshift ability again (while already being in Salamander form), meaning one Avenger can use it a total of six times in a single encounter.\n The Baby Wyvern and Sword Spider forms allow offhand weapons and shields to be used as normal, while the Fire Salamander form does not, it can only use charge abilities from offhand shields or weapons. The Baby Wyvern and Sword Spider forms benefit from Sword and Shield Style while using shields and Single Weapon Style otherwise (even while equipped with an offhand weapon), while the Fire Salamander form benefits from the Two-Handed Weapon Style. In all forms, reequipping armor only provides bonuses (eg AC modifiers against damage types or Fire Resistance), it doesn't alter the character's Base AC.\nIn Baby Wyvern and Sword Spider forms, shields may be used as normal (if equipped before transforming), but offhand weapons cannot attack, they only provide bonuses (eg +1 APR from Belm or +50% Fire Resistance from Icingdeath) and charge abilities (eg 1x/day Summon Spectral Blade from the Spectral Brand), while in Fire Salamander form, shields and offhand weapons only provide charge abilities, if any. The Baby Wyvern and Sword Spider forms benefit from Sword and Shield style while equipped with a shield, Single Weapon Style while the offhand is empty and no weapon style while the offhand has a weapon, while the Fire Salamander form benefits from Two-Handed Weapon Style. In all forms, reequipping armor provides full benefits, including altering the character's Base AC (if better).\n3 - The fire salamander's weapon is a &lt;a href=\"Spear%20%2B1\"&gt;Spear +1&lt;/a&gt; and the caster gains the benefits of &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;Two-Handed Weapon Style&lt;/a&gt; if the caster has placed points into it.\n4 - In , movement speed is increased to 11 \u2014 by default, a humanoid character moves at 9. In the original edition of , the Salamander Form has a permanent &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Weak Haste effect&lt;/a&gt; and moves at speed 14 in addition to other Haste bonuses.\n5 - With the innate Haste effect, this is actually 5 APR."}

She will be an effective front line character with the dagger of venom and a shield. Even if you don't trust her on the front line, daggers have the versatility of giving her a ranged option too. Throwing daggers come with an extra attack per round and add her strength bonus to damage. \nIt is also worth noting her potential as an archer.\u00a0 With 18/58 strength she may use composite longbows, which is complemented by her high dexterity, and as a pure class fighter has no limitations in proficiency points spent in longbow.\u00a0 This advantage is not lost should she dual class to thief, granting her a diverse range of tactics with backstab and ranged attacks, both of which minimize the risks that come with her low constitution.\nIn the original version, her initial &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;weapon proficiency&lt;/a&gt; allocation makes her able to attain grand mastery in either sword category if she is recruited at level 2 and duals to thief after level 3.

Because of her troubled past, she has developed hatred towards males of any race and an urge to constantly prove herself better than them at everything, abusing them verbally and physically in the process.\nShe expresses particular enjoyment in adventuring in a party consisting only of female characters, although this is hard to pull off since she requires the presence of a male character in the party to be recruited."}

It reflects the rays of &lt;a href=\"beholders\"&gt;beholders&lt;/a&gt;. The only disadvantage of wearing this &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; is that it lowers the &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; of the wielder by one point while in use.\nTechnical Mechanics.\nThe shield reflects certain beholder rays back at their source. It implements this using Opcode 197 \"Bounce Projectile\". The shield bounces two projectiles, No. 208 and 320, which are exclusively used by the gauth, beholder and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Golem\"&gt;Magic Golem&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn the unmodded basic and EE games, the most frequently fired projectile by a gauth or beholder is the \"Cause Serious Wound\" beholder blast ray, which is projectile No. 208, and will bounce off the shield, and return the blast to the source. \nThere are some other beholder blast projectiles that are not bounced by the shield, such as the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt;. \nHowever, most harmful eye rays such as the Paralyze Ray, Death Ray, Disintegrate Ray etc. are reflected back to the source with the shield equipped.\nSee the creature article pages for &lt;a href=\"Gauth\"&gt;Gauth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholder&lt;/a&gt; for more projectile and eye beam blast information.\nGameplay.\nIt is highly advisable to bring this shield before embarking to the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt; will prevent a few of the rays from striking you, and &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt; to protect the psyche and intellect, their \"Anti-Mage ray\" has a &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; component. Items that grant immunity to some of the innate beholder blasts and especially &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Person\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt; immunity and instant death effects (such as &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt;) are needed to be able to survive and destroy them without this shield. The battles become much more difficult and complicated when exposed to multiple beholder blasts, with varied detrimental effects. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Sewers\"&gt;Cloak of the Sewers&lt;/a&gt; is a more affordable alternative to handle the beholders as part of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Eyeless\"&gt;Cult of the Eyeless&lt;/a&gt; quest, but its &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20Jelly\"&gt;Mustard Jelly&lt;/a&gt; polymorph time is limited, requiring one to perhaps rest multiple times in order to clear the entire lair should one want to.\nTrivia.\nPlayers often refer to this item as the \"Shield of Cheese\", as it trivializes the threat from Gauths, and to a lesser extent, Beholders. Even worse, the unmodded game artificial intelligence does not give a beholder a means to recognize that its rays are being reflected back at themselves, and so it is somewhat overpowered, and reduces the game challenge level. See Mod Content below for a method to revise this. \nAchievements.\nIn Balduran's Image.\nDon the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Balduran%20%28BG2%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, shield, &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;helm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Plate%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Balduran\"&gt;Balduran&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod and the \"Smarter Beholders\" component changes how beholders react to the Shield of Balduran. The beholders can now use their telekinesis power to steal the Cloak of Mirroring and the Shield of Balduran. They don't do it in the first couple of rounds, then they have a 1/3 chance per round (per beholder). The idea isn't to make the items useless but to block the move of just giving them to one person and sending them in. If it annoys you, you can turn it off at the console: set DMWWDisableBeholderTheft to 1.\nSCS also has another component that is optional, that allows the Shield of Balduran to be removed from the game entirely, if you should wish to take away the temptation to use such an item in gameplay, making it lactose free from cheese."}

If you offer to help her, she will restore your dead party member and you must battle &lt;a href=\"Droth\"&gt;Droth&lt;/a&gt; - an &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Mage\"&gt;Ogre Mage&lt;/a&gt;. Kill him and talk to Shoal afterwards for 750 xp. If you act quickly, you may still be able to kill Shoal for 5,000 xp with no loss to &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;. Killing her for the 5,000 xp without talking to her to get 750 xp more is much easier though.\nMad Arcand.\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"Mad%20Arcand\"&gt;Mad Arcand&lt;/a&gt; (2005, 1263). If your NPC Reaction is 15-20 he asks you to collect &lt;a href=\"Discipliner\"&gt;a ring&lt;/a&gt; from the wrecked ship SW from his position. Agree. Collect the ring and return it to him. Even if your Reaction is too low for him to ask for your help you can still bring the ring to him. It's cursed so don't wear it or keep it.\nThe Surgeon.\nAsk &lt;a href=\"the%20Surgeon\"&gt;the Surgeon&lt;/a&gt; (2888, 2079) who he is and he will give you a potion and start healing injured party members. He can be pickpocketed, but if pickpocketing fails he will become hostile and attack the party with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; spells. If you kill him after he goes hostile, you receive 975XP for no reputation loss, and he drops the items which could be pickpocketed from him.\nMod content.\nIn the mod (EET) this area is named Rocky Coast."}

The vine-like overlay effect won't be displayed on them, but they'll still receive the AC penalty and their movement speed will be set to 0 (so they receive the full effect).

It is said that Gesen prepared to retire from his craft after selling the invaluable weapon, only to have the bow wrested from his grasp by a thief who used it to end Gesen's own life. A side effect of the bow bestows protection from electricity upon the user.\"\nGameplay.\nThe Gesen Bow requires a minimum Strength of 3 to use and can't be used by Clerics, Druids or Mages. \nWhen equipped it grants a -4 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; bonus, and the bow produces its own endless +4 enchantment ammunition which inflicts 2 &lt;a href=\"Piercing%20damage\"&gt;Piercing damage&lt;/a&gt; + 1D8 &lt;a href=\"Electricity%20damage\"&gt;Electricity damage&lt;/a&gt; per successful missile hit.\nThe bow user can opt to use this bow with other eligible arrow ammunition as desired. When other arrows are utilized, the ammunition selected will be fired from the Gesen Bow, and whatever ammunition type is launched will reflect that particular missile's attributes.\nFor example, If the bowman uses the Gesen bow to launch an &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Arrow of Fire&lt;/a&gt; at a creature that requires +2 enchantment to hit it, then that missile will fail as \"weapon ineffective\".\nRegardless of what type of ammunition is fired from the bow, it boosts the effect with an additional 2 piercing damage and 1d8 electricity damage to the hit.\nThis bow can open up various tactical opportunities for the player, and ammunition choices can be planned to achieve better outcomes against certain opponents.\nThe bow also bestows the wielder with + 20% electricity damage resistance.\nNotes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Velithuu\"&gt;Velithuu&lt;/a&gt; demon uses this bow and its produced ammunition. Now the party can experience what it is like to be on the receiving end of Gesen Khan's creation.\nBugs.\nLaunchers that generate their own ammo (e.g. Gesen's Bow or the Firetooth crossbow) would override the projectile of loaded ammo, meaning it could interact with the target protections incorrectly. This is identified and corrected in &lt;a href=\"The%20Enhanced%20Edition%20Fixpack%20%28EEFP%29\"&gt;The Enhanced Edition Fixpack (EEFP)&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nThe Shortbow of Gesen was taken from the \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3ABook%20of%20Artifacts\"&gt;Book of Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;\", an official \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3ADungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons\"&gt;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3ACategory%3ASourcebooks\"&gt;sourcebook&lt;/a&gt;, where it's listed under the name \"Iron Bow of Gesen\"."}

There are some in-game mechanisms that determine how this is calculated and implemented (see the Notes section for more on this). The clone is a real temporary living being and can be hurt/killed, stunned, held, webbed, slowed etc. If the clone is killed, it leaves a corpse (or the clone can be \"chunked\") just like any corporeal body.\nAs the created clone is a real creature, it can perform a number of actions just like the caster. Unlike a &lt;a href=\"Project%20Image\"&gt;Project Image&lt;/a&gt; clone, this creature isn't destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effects or removed by certain upper echelon divination attacks, such as &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt;, or a Thief's detect illusion skill. \nSimulacrum clones do not count toward the 5 summoned creature limit per area map. Perhaps they should, but they currently don't. The number of Simulacrums on a map is only restricted by the party's ability to cast the spell and how long they last. \nWhat the simulacrum clone can do.\nThe simulacrum clone is an approximate 60% version of the caster. It can and must be controlled by the caster in order to do anything. It won't act on its own and has no actual AI script or default intelligence. \nThe clone may move, attack with weaponry and can cast any memorized spells available and use most innate abilities the caster had at the time the clone was created.\nThe clone is created with all of the caster's worn equipment items, and those items function on the clone. For example, A &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Regeneration\"&gt;Ring of Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Power\"&gt;Amulet of Power&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Elvenkind\"&gt;Boots of Elvenkind&lt;/a&gt; all provide their powers and ability modifiers to the clone.\nSimilarly, items with use charges assigned to the image's equipped items, such as weapons, rings, helmet, etc. can be selected from the \"Use Item\" menu, as normal.\nThe clone may use any items that are in the \"Quick Items\" slots at the time of its creation, such as scrolls, potions, wand or similar.\nThe clone may also open up the \"Special Abilities\" menu and activate any of those abilities.\nAn image from a caster with thieving abilities is limited to only attempting to perform pickpocketing tasks - it can retain stolen items in its empty inventory slots (which will be dropped on the ground when the image is expired/destroyed); The clone can set traps and activate any buttons found in the Special Abilities menu.\nSimulacrun clone restrictions.\nThe clone cannot engage another creature in dialogue or initiate a conversation - it also doesn't trigger dialogue from other creatures even if it is within the creature's dialogue activation range. The game's AI scripts don't recognize the image as a valid dialogue trigger.\nThe clone cannot clear the fog of war and explore with its own sight radius, such as a familiar can or the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Eye\"&gt;Wizard Eye&lt;/a&gt; spell provides.\nThe clone isn't able to pick up loot (although the clone's \"Quick Loot\" button will show the loot), interact with containers, pull levers, push buttons, open or close doors, or transition to other area maps - the simulacrum also is unable to receive items into its inventory from other party members, and nor can any of its equipment or items be moved/transferred/dropped.\nThe clone cannot activate the \"Find Traps/Detect Illusions\" button, nor the \"Stealth\" button.\nThe caster's sequencers, spell trigger and contingency type buttons don't transfer to the image and thus aren't available to use. If the clone attempts to create its own sequencer for use, the game allows the spell to be selected and a short casting animation will play out, but the creation menu doesn't progress, and the creation process is finished/nothing was accomplished.\nA simulacrum that casts/uses a scroll to attempt a &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Project%20Image\"&gt;Project Image&lt;/a&gt; or a simulacrum will begin the casting sequence, but the spell will fail and not achieve anything - the same applies if the clone activates &lt;a href=\"Vhailor%27s%20Helm\"&gt;Vhailor's Helm&lt;/a&gt;; a clone cannot create another clone of itself.\nA simulacrum that has the &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; ability will have the ability button available on the clone's character record. The ability button can be selected to switch on the turn undead power - however, it doesn't actually radiate the effect and thus does nothing to affect undead creatures. It seems that the divine power granted by the deity to turn, destroy or control undead is not passed on to the clone.\nIf a clone casts &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Restoration\"&gt;Lesser Restoration&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Restoration\"&gt;Greater Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, including from a scroll, the spell will appear to cast as normal, but it will not remove the level-drain effect on the clone.\nNotes.\nA Simulacrum's level is lowered through an unblockable &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; effect. Level drain imposes a number of downsides, in particular a potentially significant reduction of &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt; values when compared to the original character. More information is on the Level drain article.\nAll droppable equipment, quick slot and inventory items worn by the caster of Simulacrum are fully duplicated. They are worn by the clone in their respective slot, with the difference that they are made undroppable. The clone's item stacks and charges are entirely independent from the original caster.\nThe caster's undroppable equipment and items are not copied to the clone. For example &lt;a href=\"Hexxat%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Hexxat's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Signet%20Ring\"&gt;D'Arnise Signet Ring&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Edwin%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Edwin's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells and abilities.\nThe lists of known spells and abilities are copied over to the clone.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset has a 7th-level Wizard spell \"Simulacrum\". The spell's casting time and creation process requires other spells and components to work, and this particular spell is entirely unsuited for use during combat and also has no specific duration. A simulacrum duplicate is an actual creation process. The spell creates the form of the creature, but it is only a zombielike creation. A \"Reincarnation (Wizard Spell)\" spell must be used to give the duplicate a vital force, and a \"Limited Wish (Wizard Spell)\" spell must be used to empower the duplicate with 40% to 65% (35% + 5 to 30%) of the knowledge and personality of the original. The level of the simulacrum, if any, is from 20% to 50% of that of the original creature. There are more restrictions and rules, especially to repair damage to the duplicate. See the External links for further reading.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes changes to several spells, Including Simulacrum - but only if you are not playing with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod. This is a component of the Mod you can select to install, or not, if you don't want it. From the SCS Readme:\nPrevent clones made by the Simulacrum and Project Image spells from using their magic items (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)\nAt present, clones can use magic items belonging to their creator - even one-shot items - which arguably isn't what the spell is intended to do. This component blocks use of useable items, by greying out the quick-item bar for clones. Magic weapons, armor, and protective devices still function normally.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects and description. See below:\nSimulacrum\nLevel: 8\nSchool: Illusion\nRange: Personal\nDuration: 1 round/level\nCasting Time: 1 round\nArea of Effect: Caster\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is cast, the caster taps energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of himself. The duplicate is a near-perfect copy of the caster, making it a very powerful ally. The simulacrum is created at 60% of the level of the caster and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level. It also has 60% of the hit points of the caster. The simulacrum is fully under the control of the caster. The caster may have only one simulacrum at a time.\nAlso, with Spell Revisions - &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt; does not dispel illusionary clones such as those conjured by Mislead or Simulacrum, but instead clearly highlights them, revealing them as deceptions. \nSpell Revisions doesn't allow a Simulacrum to use quick slot items.\nA Simulacrum may not make another Simulacrum of itself. This is the case with Spell Revisions by itself or with SCS installed alongside it."}

{"id": "52063", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=52063", "title": "Simyaz", "text": "Simyaz is first encountered in an adjacent cell within the &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayers%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Mind Flayers in Underdark&lt;/a&gt; complex as a fellow captive.\nGameplay.\nSimyaz and his fellow githyanki captives will engage in dialogue with the party while all are being held by the Illithids in a connected cell. \nMuch dialogue is available, with various interjections triggered from core companions. The general gist is that the party will be able to ask questions and find out what the githyanki are doing here, and they will explain the power of the illithid in this place, because of &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20Brain\"&gt;The Master Brain&lt;/a&gt;. There is no way to escape, and the doors will not open to the underdark without killing it. Additionally, unless the githyanki distract the illithid with their own psionic powers, then no one will be able to leave the fighting arena. So, the party must accept the escape plan put forth.\nOnce the party prevails and slays the kuo-toa and other creatures in the arena, the party can escape through a door back nearby the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Mind%20Flayer%20Jailer%29\"&gt;Ogre (Mind Flayer Jailer)&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the party will see that the githyanki have managed to break the psionic web of the illithid. The group teleports nearby the party and has words. They do not have the power to also transport the party out and reiterate that slaying the Master elder brain thing is the only way to escape. They then leave the party behind.\nAssuming the party has triumphed and escaped the illithid clutches - while traveling back to &lt;a href=\"Ust%20Natha\"&gt;Ust Natha&lt;/a&gt; the githyanki are encountered again. In short, through various dialogue, the party can return the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sword\"&gt;Silver Sword&lt;/a&gt; to them and the githyanki allow you to depart, or the githyanki will attack. If for some reason the party got rid of it, then that also leads to an attack.\nIn battle, Simyaz behaves as a Fighter/mage. Upon the initiation of hostilities, a sequencer fires applying &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;. After this all his spell casts will be interruptible. All of the scripted spells used, and their order of use is laid out in the InfoBox.\nDuring the battle two &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; powers are also scripted for use, directed at the closest target to Simyaz.\nIn melee combat the githyanki FM wields his bastard sword, but the game has assigned no weapon proficiencies to him, so gets no bonuses in combat.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; makes some changes to Simyaz. SCS revises the experience levels to 11/9 fighter/mage. The mod adds a revised default fighter mage AI script to make the githyanki do a smarter job in combat. Several &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt; are available for use when wound levels trigger their quaffing.\nThe mod also adds a +2 weapon proficiency bonus internally to the creature's THAC0. Upon the start of combat Simyaz will have the following \"previously cast\" spells applied instatly: &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Armor\"&gt;Ghost Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;.\nOffensive damage and disabling spells as well as possible summoning spells are scripted for use (commensurate with a level 9 mage). No psionic abilities are scripted for use, as the spells are likely better anyway. Expect a &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Color%20Spray\"&gt;Color Spray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt; and others. \nIf the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod is installed, then those spell versions will be used by this Fighter/mage, such as \"Vitriolic Sphere \" or \"Waves of Fatigue\" included in the script."}

They bear the appearance of human women but posses an unearthly beauty though they are not nearly as beautiful as &lt;a href=\"Nymph\"&gt;Nymph&lt;/a&gt;s. All Sirines are female and their skin tones vary from tan to light blue. Like &lt;a href=\"Nymph\"&gt;Nymph&lt;/a&gt;s, Sirines cannot abide captivity and will die if kept from the sea for too long. \nSirines fight with bows as well as magic. They are less magically powerful than &lt;a href=\"Nymph\"&gt;Nymph&lt;/a&gt;s but are still formidable. They attack with charm spells and can paralyze their foes. They are also able to make themselves invisible if they are cornered. \nThey are very protective of their waters and frequently accost travelers with deadly force sometimes killing them with a kiss. Though more violent than their &lt;a href=\"Dryad\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nymph\"&gt;Nymph&lt;/a&gt; cousins they are not evil \"per se\". They are found frequently as enemies along the sword coast and occasionally as allies of a sort. Their actions mirror the sea; sometimes violent and treacherous, sometimes generous and life-giving.\nNotable Sirines.\nBaldur's Gate.\nLarriaz.\n&lt;a href=\"Larriaz\"&gt;Larriaz&lt;/a&gt; is a Sirine in a house on the far southeast side of &lt;a href=\"south%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;south Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. She was abducted by fishermen and dies soon after the player finds her.\nMeilala.\nOn the third level of the &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Durlag's Tower&lt;/a&gt; dungeon, you will find five statues of failed adventurers, one of who is a Sirine named Meiala. Clicking on her statue will cause her to come to life and join your side for a limited time before turning hostile and trying to kill you.\nSil.\nHostile sirines can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Lighthouse\"&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; area. &lt;a href=\"Sil\"&gt;Sil&lt;/a&gt; and two others guard the entrance to Black Alaric's cave. Three others are on the beach on the bay near the center of the map.\nSirine Queen.\nThere is also the &lt;a href=\"Sirine%20Queen\"&gt;Sirine Queen&lt;/a&gt; on the northern part of the Isle of Balduran. You will be asked by &lt;a href=\"Evalt\"&gt;Evalt&lt;/a&gt; to rescue his brother &lt;a href=\"Evan\"&gt;Evan&lt;/a&gt;. You can collect the body of &lt;a href=\"Evan\"&gt;Evan&lt;/a&gt; off of the &lt;a href=\"Sirine%20Queen\"&gt;Sirine Queen's&lt;/a&gt; dead body.\nOther.\nThere are four Sirines with &lt;a href=\"Kelddath%20Ormlyr\"&gt;Kelddath Ormlyr&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20the%20Morning%20Temple\"&gt;Song of the Morning Temple&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; area. No dancing, but each stands on a disk at the four cardinal points, singing. They can be pickpocketed for one &lt;a href=\"Pearl\"&gt;Pearl&lt;/a&gt; each. If you attack Kelddath, they will immediately fight to defend him. \nAnother three sirines are found in the south-western corner (&lt;a href=\"Coordinates\"&gt;1000.3400&lt;/a&gt;) of the &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Shipwreck's Coast&lt;/a&gt; area west of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hedge\"&gt;High Hedge&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Charm\"&gt;Dire Charm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, sirines are formidable foes unless you can run them out of spells. Keep your melee fighters at a safe distance and use spells like &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Summoning%20I\"&gt;Monster Summoning I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt; to occupy their attention if you can, otherwise send in a single high-hp fighter. Spells such as &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Insects\"&gt;Summon Insects&lt;/a&gt; will help disrupt their casting. &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; will remove a &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Charm\"&gt;Dire Charm&lt;/a&gt; spell, and the charm ability of &lt;a href=\"Algernon%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;Algernon's Cloak&lt;/a&gt; will (often) counter it, as will (perhaps) the spells &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Person\"&gt;Charm Person&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Person%20or%20Mammal\"&gt;Charm Person or Mammal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt; is immune to charm spells whle using his &lt;a href=\"Berserk%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; ability, as is anyone wielding the &lt;a href=\"Two-handed%20Sword%2C%20Cursed%20Berserking%20%2B3\"&gt;Two-handed Sword, Cursed Berserking +3&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Brage\"&gt;Brage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Archaeological%20Site\"&gt;Archaeological Site&lt;/a&gt; area to the south. Again, send Minsc or the berserk sword wielder in alone so that they will not attack other party members.\nHaving a powerful melee character quaff a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Clarity\"&gt;Potion of Clarity&lt;/a&gt; is also very effective."}

This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, other Races have modified ability scores.\nSpecial abilities of the Skald.\n&lt;a href=\"Skald%20Song\"&gt;Skald Song&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe signature ability of the bard is their battle song. Skalds have a special version of that song which gives party members massive combat bonuses:\n1st level: Grants allies a -2 bonus to &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;, +2 bonus to damage rolls, and a -2 bonus to &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;AC&lt;/a&gt;15th level: Grants allies a -4 bonus to THAC0, +4 bonus to damage rolls, -4 bonus to AC and immunity to fear20th level: Grants allies a -4 bonus to THAC0, +4 bonus to damage rolls, -4 bonus to AC, immunity to fear, stun, and confusion\nAll Bard songs work within a limited range, roughly 5 to 6 meters, and the singer\u2019s view must not be blocked by doors, corners. In \"EE version 2.0+\", Bard song of the same type no longer stacks, and all songs break &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkalds can still select the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Bard%20Song\"&gt;Enhanced Bard Song&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;HLA&lt;/a&gt;. It will replace their Skald song, though it provides only some relatively minor improvements over the level 20 version, and comes into play fairly late in game - the Skald must be at least level 24 ( only).\nGameplay\nPick pockets.\nSkalds are quite ineffective at pick-pocketing. Human skalds start with 10 points in this skill (half-elves: 12) and receive a quarter the normal points (i.e. 1.25) per level. The skill caps at the score of 28 at level 16, plus a quarter of the normal &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; modifier.\nLore.\nBards have the highest Lore rating of any class, allowing them to identify many of the magical items they or their party discover. They receive 10 &lt;a href=\"Lore\"&gt;Lore&lt;/a&gt; points per level.\nWizard spellbook.\nBards begin to advance in &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;wizard spells&lt;/a&gt; slots when they reach level 2, up to the 6th spell level.\nIn order for bards to cast a spell, first they need to successfully scribe a mage spell scroll into their spell book (scroll lost in process regardless of success or failure), in which they must prepare the spell by putting it into an empty spell slot, then they have to rest to get the spell ready. Spellcasting is also affected by armor, wearing an armor of any kind (other than the rare &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Chain%20Mail\"&gt;Elven Chain Mail&lt;/a&gt;) renders it impossible.\nBards are known for their quick levelling, which gives them a slight advantage over &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s when using spells that indefinitely scale with the caster's level \u2013 like &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt;, etc. As the level difference between mages and bards always favors the latter, bards surprisingly get the upper hand when casting those spells and keep their advantage all the way up to reaching the level cap, as mages cannot progress past lvl 31, while bards can get to lvl 40.\nThe advantage fades when using spells with effect that is capped at a certain level, like &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; - the bard will be the first to get the maximal possible effect at lvl 10, but lose all advantage once the mage reaches the same level.\nGameplay.\nSkalds , like all other bards, have a supporting role in the party. As long as they keep singing, they will buff the party considerably without having to worry about spell duration. The Skald song can be viewed as a more powerful replacement for &lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chant\"&gt;Chant&lt;/a&gt; which decreases the number of active party members by 1 (as the Skald cannot perform combat actions/cast spells while singing, although with the right timing you can get a spell or ranged attack out in the same round before resuming singing).\nIt is highly advisable to protect the Skald before combat with spells like &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; (against those pesky &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;s) and keep a spell of &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt; prepared, as silenced Skalds are near useless.\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nBards have almost the same high-level class abilities as &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of &lt;a href=\"Assassination\"&gt;Assassination&lt;/a&gt;, they have enhanced bards song and magic flute, despite no skill points into Set Traps the traps HLAs available to the Bard will never fail or accidentally trigger on the Bard.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a number of gameplay revisions and changes to all Rogues, including their kits. It is a comprehensive modification to nearly all aspects of the Rogues (Bards and Thieves) abilities and strives to bring them closer to their Pen and Paper AD&amp;D counterparts. New and revised abilities are included, as well as new equipment and rogue specific items. Separate user installed components are available to customize selection of content and changes. Go to the link for further information. \nBard kit revisions\nThis component will modify all Bard kits so that they match their PnP counterparts more closely, as described in the 2E AD&amp;D \"Complete Bard's Handbook\" supplement. The kits now get additional benefits but also receive new disadvantages. The default Bard song has also been altered (it was largely defunct in the unmodded game) and is now based on the PnP version of this ability. Furthermore, the hearing range of all battlesongs has been standardized and now extends slightly above the in-game visual range of the performing Bard.\nSkald kit revisions\nSkald\nSkalds now have a +1 penalty to the casting speed of all spells as an additional disadvantage. Their battlesong has been slightly revised as well. The updated kit description reads as follows:\nSKALD: This Nordic bard is also a warrior of great strength, skill and virtue. His songs are inspiring sagas of battle and valor, and the Skald devotes his life to those pursuits. Skalds are honored and respected as great warrior-poets who memorize the feats of each raid and battle, setting them down in the form of poetry. Spells are nearly unknown in the Skald's society and they are viewed with suspicion in any event. Using magic is slightly more difficult for a Skald and requires additional time and effort.\nAdvantages:\n- Gains Skald's Song at first level. This ability further improves at 9th and 18th level\n- Gains a +1 bonus to hit and damage with all weapons at first level\nDisadvantages:\n- Pick pockets ability one-quarter normal\n- Suffers a 1 point penalty to spellcasting speed\nSkald's Song:\nBy chanting a war song, a Skald can inspire allies as they go forward into combat. Chanting can elevate spirits, remove concerns about danger, keep men's minds focused on combat and fill friendly forces with a sense of being larger than life. The effects of the song further improve as the Skald gains more levels:\n1st: gives allies +2 to hit, +2 to damage, -2 to AC and immunity to Fear\n9th: gives allies +3 to hit, +3 to damage, -3 to AC, immunity to Fear and Confusion\n18th: gives allies +4 to hit, +4 to damage, -4 to AC, immunity to Fear, Stun and Confusion.\nBard High Level Ability revisions\nThis component will remove all Traps and other Thief-specific HLAs from the Bard High Level Ability table and replace them with new abilities which are more fitting for the Bard class. These new HLAs are: Mass Charm, Sound Burst, Enthralling Melody, Lingering Song, Resonating Weapon and Sound Barrier. Furthermore, the Magic Flute and Alchemy HLAs will be revised and each Bard kit will get a unique version of the Enhanced Battlesong HLA.\nEnhanced Skald Song (Skald only)\nThis mighty battle chant grants the Skald and his allies +5 to hit, +5 to damage, -5 to AC, +10% resistance to physical damage, immunity to Fear, Stun and Confusion. The Skald himself receives a 10 point bonus to his armor class while singing the song.\nExperience and character stats table.\nSkalds also start with a +1 bonus to THAC0 and damage, which is not included in the table and is retained separately from their base THAC0.\n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBards protagonists may &lt;a href=\"Running%20the%20Five%20Flagons%20Playhouse\"&gt;run the Five Flagons Inn stage&lt;/a&gt; after they &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Raelis%20and%20Haer%27Dalis%20from%20the%20Planar%20Prison\"&gt;rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the planar prison&lt;/a&gt;"}

Do notice the delay before the explosion though and place the traps accordingly.\nWhere to obtain its scroll.\n\"Shadows of Amn\".\nTreasure\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Skulltrap\" (note D&amp;D spelling) has several differences than the game's implementation of the spell. In the Pen and Paper version, the spell is actually a ward, and not an offensive damage spell - it is placed on an actual skeletal skull and is triggered when touched by living matter - it doesn't have an area proximity triggering ability. A saving throw vs. Breath weapon allows a reduced damage potential. The spell implies that a creature associated with the Negative Energy plane, like undead, would be immune. See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects, scaling, and saving throw. See below for description:\nSkull Trap\nLevel: 3\nSchool: Necromancy\nRange: Medium\nDuration: Special\nCasting Time: 3\nArea of Effect: 20\u2019 radius\nSaving Throw: Breath half\nUpon casting this spell, a skull is thrown by the caster at the target area. The skull floats in the area until a creature comes within 15 feet of it. When this happens, the skull is triggered and explodes, damaging everyone within a 20 foot radius. The explosion deals 1d6 points of magic damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6), with a save vs. breath at -2 allowed for half damage. When casting this spell, it is wise to set it far away from the party, lest they set it off accidentally. Undead creatures are not affected by this spell."}

The source sometimes allows a saving throw or applies Slay only if the target is below a certain level or belongs to a certain species. Check the source you're interested in for such details. It is likely to help find ways to prevent Slay from being applied to party members, so they don't have to resist it explicitly using one of the means described in this article.\nGeneral Prevention.\nResisting Slay can be done with the spell &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt; or the high-level abilities &lt;a href=\"Avoid%20Death\"&gt;Avoid Death&lt;/a&gt; (Rogue) and &lt;a href=\"Favored%20of%20the%20Spirits\"&gt;Favored of the Spirits&lt;/a&gt; (Shaman). Often times a Slay status effect allows a saving throw versus Death, so boosting saving throws can help.

It replaces all dream abilities gained from the \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur\u2019s Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" campaign.\nAcquisition.\nAfter Gorion's Ward and party have entered &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; reveals himself and through the use of magic, strips and traps the Ward's soul, while the Ward begins the &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29%23The%20Fourth%20Dream\"&gt;fourth dream&lt;/a&gt;. When this dream is over, all &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt; abilities previously gained from the &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;dreams&lt;/a&gt; that took place during the \"Baldur's Gate\" campaign are lost, while giving the essence of Bhaal within the chance to grow stronger. When the party nears the exit point to level three of &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%203\"&gt;Bodhi's Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, an attack by &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; and two fellow &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s triggers a transformation in which Gorion's Ward becomes the Slayer and attacks Bodhi - and then turns on the party when she flees, only to revert to normal after a minute or two.\nThe first time the party rests after this first transformation, the Ward will wake spontaneously and transform again, attacking the party before reverting to normal.\nResting after this will cause Gorion's Ward to experience a &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29%23The%20Fifth%20Dream\"&gt;final dream&lt;/a&gt;. When the dream has ended, the Ward will possess the power to transform into the Slayer at will, with a &lt;a href=\"Time%20System\"&gt;3-turn&lt;/a&gt; cool-down.\nGameplay.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; has gained the \"Slayer\" transformation ability, an icon button is now present on the character's record under the \"Special Abilities\" button (F12 on keyboard game platforms) - an icon button is titled \"Slayer Change\", see the icon on the InfoBox for a depiction.\nShould the Ward decide to transform, simply activate the button with the cursor, and the ward's sprite will quickly have a 3D graphic effect render over it lasting a few seconds (Holy light pillar), as well as a sound effect.\nThe caster has not yet changed into the Slayer. A moment later a dialogue box generates and displays the Wards's portrait, reading:\nSelect from the following choices:\nIf the \"No\" choice is selected, the transformation won't occur, and the Slayer Change icon is now gone from the Special Abilities menu temporarily (about three turns before it reappears).\nIf the \"I accept\" answer is selected, the transformation occurs, a flaming 3D graphic renders over the caster's sprite and a sound effect audibles, as well as a text display, reading, \"The Party's Reputation Has Decreased: 2\".\nA moment later, another 3D graphic and sound effect occurs, and the Ward assumes the Slayer form.\nOn the Special Abilities menu is a new button with a blue humanoid icon, titled \"End Slayer Change\" - select this button with the cursor or designated Keyboard \"F\" key, and revert to original form when desired. Doing that shows another flaming 3D graphic and a sound effect. The Slayer Change icon is now gone and won't return for 3 turns.\nEffects of the Slayer change.\nOnce the slayer form is active, the Ward may now begin any actions desired, subject to the limitations imposed by the Slayer change.\nAfter 20 seconds has passed the Ward is subjected to 5 &lt;a href=\"magical%20damage\"&gt;magical damage&lt;/a&gt;, and a text display reads \"You feel your control slipping...\". \nAfter another round has transpired, the Ward is damaged again, this time for 10 damage and a similar message. This process continues every round, with increasing damage until the fifth time the damage climbs to 1,500, which will be game over for the bhaalspawn, unless protected by some suitable form of magic damage mitigation that must be very close to 100%.\nUnless this action is taken, then the best policy to avoid death is to revert the Slayer Change to normal form no later than the fourth damage application.\nHowever, if the Ward is sufficiently protected from magical damage, then the bhaalspawn can continue as the slayer as long as desired.\nIf the Slayer form transitions to a different area map, the ward will involuntarily revert to normal form.\nNotes.\nIt is still possible to use items, thieving skills, including &lt;a href=\"Thief%23Backstabbing\"&gt;backstabbing&lt;/a&gt; and all other class abilities, as well as any spell sequencers in effect, from the special abilities menu.\nRetains bonuses from &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;single-weapon style&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe \"Armor\" slot on the character's &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt; screen value is superseded by the set &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; value of the Slayer change, but magical bonuses from other equipment (e.g. helmets) apply.\nDespite the description of the ability, the Slayer form \"sets\" current and max hit points to 100, and does not quite provide immunity to missile weapons, but immunity to a limited set of projectiles.\nWhen transforming back to original form, the Bhaalspawn is not healed.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Tenser%27s%20Transformation\"&gt;Tenser's Transformation&lt;/a&gt; is active before the shapechange, it will double the Slayer's HP to 200, or it will be higher if the Ward's original HP was greater than 100, for instance if the Ward had 115 HP, and cast Tenser's it is raised to 230, but then with slayer change it is 215.\nAs with most shape-changes, many buffs/effects that are active on the Ward at the time of transformation, will be active on the Slayer as well, for example &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; etc.\nMod content.\nMods:.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; mod, by Throne of Bhaal's design director &lt;a href=\"David%20Gaider\"&gt;David Gaider&lt;/a&gt; and updated for the Enhanced Edition by the author of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; David W., includes an option to improve the Slayer Form, causing it to grow more powerful as the player increases their total &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; exceed 2 million, 4 million and 6 million, plus the potential to eventually let the Ward transform into the Ravager, a more powerful form of the Slayer, while maintaining the choice to transfer into either.\nAchievements.\nTime to Slay.\nTook the form of the Slayer."}

Cooperating with him is not the only way to help these sick crusaders though, as he can also be attacked in order to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"BDPOTN06\"&gt;Slime Sickness Curative&lt;/a&gt; from his dead body. The curative should also be able to be pickpocketed from him.\nUpon returning to the soldiers, all but one of them will be revived by the cure, rewarding the party with 6,000 EXP for completing the quest; one soldier succumbs to the slime sickness and instead transforms into a &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20Jelly\"&gt;Mustard Jelly&lt;/a&gt;, which is worth 2,000 EXP when defeated. The leader of the sick soldiers will also reward with a &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Caelar\"&gt;Seal of Caelar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhilst this marks the official completion of the quest, the party can also speak to &lt;a href=\"Ladle\"&gt;Ladle&lt;/a&gt; and inform him of having found and cured the sick crusaders, as the leader of the (formerly) sick soldiers suggests. He will express his gratitude for this:\nRefuse to Help.\nIf the player declares that they will not help the sick crusaders, they all instantly succumb to their disease and transform into a collection of &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20Jelly\"&gt;Mustard Jellies&lt;/a&gt;, which immediately attack the party.\nIn newer game versions, it is no longer possible to refuse to help (confirmed for v. 2.6.6.0), the journal entry will always be the same, regardless of the chosen dialog options, and the crusaders will transform after a while."}

These can be seen as \"normal\" states of mind stemming from the creature's psyche. They affect combat behavior as Morale states, which must not be confused with &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics.\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, each creature keeps track of its current morale, breaking point and recovery rate. The stat is an integer between 0 and 20 which may plummet in various situations such as witnessing the death of an ally, taking a lot of damage over a short period of time or being low on &lt;a href=\"hit%20point\"&gt;hit point&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen a creature goes through enough mental pressure that its stat reaches or falls below its stat, its behavior changes in one of two ways reported in the combat logs like so:\nA creature in such a state is said to be in \"morale failure\", and the circle at its feet should become yellow. If it was in the player's control, that control is lost until recovery.\nA stat of 0 means immunity to morale failure. The &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; and many creatures have permanent immunity thanks to this.\nMorale recovery.\nNatural recovery occurs one point at a time. The stat describes the amount of &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23A\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; ticks that must pass for morale to increase one point. Most creatures have this value set to 60. With the game's default configuration, 15 AI ticks occur within one second, so 4 seconds are needed for to grow one point with a stat of 60.\nCompanion morale stats.\nWhile the protagonist has unbreakable morale (excepting &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Goblet\"&gt;Durlag's Goblet&lt;/a&gt;), this cannot be said of all companions. Their stats are listed below. There has often been talks of &lt;a href=\"Khalid\"&gt;Khalid&lt;/a&gt; being more sensitive to morale failure, or of high &lt;a href=\"Charisma\"&gt;Charisma&lt;/a&gt; from the party \"leader\" being a good way to keep party morale in check, but whether this is true (and how) is unclear.

The Swords is immune to all forms of physical and elemental damage, except for magical energy damage.\nGameplay.\nThe Wizard doesn't have to aim this spell, but simply casts it, and the summoned sword will appear in an elaborate animation lasting several seconds adjacent to the caster, maybe to the side, rear, or front depending on the space available on the map, and if other creatures and objects are occupying the space.\nOnce the sword appears it can be given orders to float (move) in a direction or to target another creature.\nThe sword counts toward the total summoned creature limit.\nThe sword cannot open doors or interact with objects/containers.\nThe sword cannot dispel the fog of war, nor can the sword detect/attack invisible/hidden creatures.\nIf the sword isn't given any orders, it will behave according to its default AI script, which frankly is limited and very basic.\nThe sword has a host of immunities to status effects and is mostly immune to damage.\nHowever, it can still be destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Death%20Fog\"&gt;Death Fog&lt;/a&gt;, excessive &lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;Magical damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt;, ability score drain (except &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;), disintegrate, imprisonment, and all insta-kill effects.\nThe sword will disappear from the map when the spell's duration elapses, and a text display will read \"Unsummoned\".\nTriva.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Mordenkainen's Sword\" differs considerably in its implementation compared to the BG game's version. For instance, the spellcaster is able to mentally wield this weapon (to the exclusion of all activities other than movement), causing it to move and strike as if it were being used by a fighter. It hits any Armor Class on a roll of 19 or 20. it can be removed with a Dispel Magic. See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects, and description. See below:\nMordenkainen\u2019s Sword\nLevel: 7\nSchool: Evocation\nRange: Personal\nDuration: 1 round/level\nCasting Time: 7\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nUpon casting this spell, the wizard brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. Once the spell is cast, the sword will float in the air completely under the control of the caster, until the spell duration expires, or the sword is dispelled. The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and attacks on its own once each round, inflicting 5d4 damage when it hits a target. It has 100% resistance to almost all forms of damage (acid, cold, fire, electricity, poison, etc.), and 95% resistance to physical damage, but it\u2019s vulnerable to pure magic damage. The sword is immune to mind affecting spells, has 36 hit points, AC 5, and THAC0 2. Note that this spell does not prevent the caster from performing any other actions while the spell is in effect.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod installed, enemy mages often employ these summoned swords, and sometimes more than one at a time in a battle. Most level 13+ SCS mages can recognize summoned creatures via the AI and are also scripted to destroy them with &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;. "}

They traveled to the citadel of &lt;a href=\"Jergal\"&gt;Jergal&lt;/a&gt; who, tired of his position, gave up his portfolios willingly. Breaking off his skeletal knucklebones after an argument over which of the three would rule over the other two, they were each thrown by the mortals to determine which of Jergal's portfolios they would receive.

The coding for this attack means that items matching the 'Item Type' value on the targeted creature(s) will have their charges drained. It is coded so that Magical items including weapons will be drained of their charges. One charge will be drained from each item, per hit. \nThis includes items equipped by the target, and in the quick item use slots (such as wands or similar items). Items just sitting in the backpack slots or within a container (like a &lt;a href=\"Gem%20Bag\"&gt;Gem Bag&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Holding\"&gt;Bag of Holding&lt;/a&gt; won't be touched).\nThe second effect is to drain Wizard spells from the target (using Opcode 244). Drains spells from a wizard's memory. This effect always drains the highest-level possible spell first and drains the number set by the Number to Drain parameter. The weapon is set to drain 1 spell per hit.\nThe item also has a passive power that protects the user from the 5th wizard level spell &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod Content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod makes changes to the &lt;a href=\"Nishruu\"&gt;Nishruu&lt;/a&gt; creature summoned by the spell &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Nishruu\"&gt;Summon Nishruu&lt;/a&gt;. The mod also revises this weapon item used by the creature.\nIt is now a +3 enchanted item that provides a -3 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; bonus to hit. Any hit on a target does the same as the unmodified weapon, plus it applies a 3 round &lt;a href=\"Feeblemindedness\"&gt;Feeblemindedness&lt;/a&gt; effect that can't be resisted or blocked, although a &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; vs. spells will negate.\nThe item also provides passive extra immunities to the Nishruu that were not provided to the original creature (some coding omissions probably). This weapon makes the Nishruu immune to both &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt;. It also provides complete immunity to &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe last change made is the item furnishes the creature with a passive &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;Detect Illusion&lt;/a&gt; percentage, that is always on, with a 20% chance of working per round. Any illusions in range of detection will be destroyed with a 20% chance of success - checked once per round."}

Though called a spell, it does not have its own casting time, nor does it have casting delay.\u00a0 All that it does is\u00a0simply let Wild Mages use the level 1 spell slot to cast\u00a0any of their other known spells (Note: sequencer/trigger and contingency\u00a0spells cannot be cast this way in the Enhanced Edition).\u00a0 If two or more level 1 spell slots are filled with this\u00a0spell, as soon as one slot is used to cast one\u00a0spell, another slot can be activated\u00a0to cast another spell, as if the caster were constantly under the effect of &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis spell\u00a0is the ultimate reason why lower-level Wild Mages can be very risky to play, and\u00a0higher-level Wild Mages can be extremely\u00a0powerful.\nThere are no scrolls for this spell in the game.\nGameplay.\nThe wild mage casts this spell on self and is instantly activated.\nThe caster now selects any spell known to the mage (it doesn't even have to be memorized, just in the spell book).\nThe dweomer causes a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge\"&gt;Wild Surge&lt;/a&gt; to occur which will randomly affect the known spell as determined by the random probability roll and influenced in the mage's favor by their experience level and any chaos shield modifiers.\nAs the wild mage advances in experience, the results of the wild surges get more likely to produce the desired spell effect and less likely to result in some manner of disaster.\nDweomering sequencers and contingencies in the original game.\n A sequencer or contingency won't surge. But the next spell you cast will, 100%. This is a so-called postponed surge. You need to burn it with a dummy spell. Do not forget to do that.\nPostponed surges are\u00a0cumulative. If you dweomer minor sequencer, contingency, and then spell trigger, none of them will surge, but then the next\u00a03\u00a0spells will surge.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wild Mage spell \"Nahal's Reckless Dweomer \"differs from the BG game's implementation, as well as the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//adnd2e.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Magic_Tables_%28TOM%29%23Table_2%3A_Wild_Surge_Results\"&gt;Wild Surge Table Results&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the chance of failure using this spell is much greater in the Pen and Paper game than the Bioware video game version - showing that this spell was meant to be a last-resort action, not a planned regular use spell. See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, changing its effects, and school. See below for description:\nNahal\u2019s Reckless Dweomer\nLevel: 1\nSchool: None\nRange: Personal\nDuration: Special\nCasting Time: 1\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: Special\nThis spell is the wild mage\u2019s ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.\nTo use Reckless Dweomer, simply cast it and then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the wild mage tries to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (found in your manual).\nBecause the release of energy is planned by the mage, his level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result may be beneficial to the mage, or it may be completely disastrous; this is the risk the mage takes in casting Nahal\u2019s Reckless Dweomer."}

She doesn't have &lt;a href=\"Imoen%23Gameplay\"&gt;special powers&lt;/a&gt; like Imoen (but these powers aren't unlocked until the last chapters of the game), and her thieving skills are slightly lower, but she makes up for it by being in the possession of a unique &lt;a href=\"de%27Arnise%20Signet%20Ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;, which grants 2 bonus points to her &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;armor class&lt;/a&gt; and to all her &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt;s, plus 50% resistance to fire, and can be worn together with other protection items. Nalia is also available very early in the game, with the potential to gain much more &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile her thief skills aren't impressive, being a thief dual-class does allow her to equip the &lt;a href=\"Dak%27kon%27s%20Zerth%20Blade\"&gt;Dak'kon's Zerth Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nNalia was of a particularly charitable bent. She was appalled at the unfairness of the class system in her country and others like it, and consequently very preoccupied with helping the needy, to the point of criticizing charity that was too small. She insisted that she did not \"go slumming\", and thought she was really in touch with the people she was trying to help, but she had some difficulty shaking off the feeling of superiority she was raised with, and was seen as well-intentioned but not so good as she thought she was.\nBelow are excerpts of conversation taken from the game to help characterize Nalia:\nHer discontent with the current class system is also reflected by her aversion to Amn's various churches and what is done with the donations poor people give to them to better their lives. This is shown when visiting Keldorn's house, which is quite the Villa bought and paid for by the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Noble%20Order%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt;. But no matter how much she hates the system, she loves her Aunty and can accept that her generation \"is set in their ways\"."}

From what little is known, he attempted to work some magic to divine what lays \"beyond the gods\", and, according to &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;, something apparently didn't like him looking. He was struck by a magical malady that reduced him to the mental level of a child, but still possessing his full magical capabilities, a dangerous combination that saw him banished to Spellhold.\nHe is killed as part of the efforts by &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and their friends to defeat Jon Irenicus, falling in battle against the cursed elven archmage.\nGameplay.\nThe player can interact with Naljier Skal when they first arrive at the Main Floor for Spellhold. Either \"The Coordinator\" will introduce them to Naljier as he gives them a tour of the asylum's inmates, or they can encounter Naljier as they explore the common rooms once &lt;a href=\"Lonk\"&gt;Lonk&lt;/a&gt; lets them out of their cells.\nIf the player talks to Naljier during this stage, and brings up the topic of \"pretties\", he will give the player a random gemstone. This even can occur several times and is driven by dialogue and interest in his ramblings. After several gems are produced, he loses interest, and the free gemstones cease. No more pretties for the party.\nWhile in the cellblock, Naljier is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt; to prevent death and for plot purposes. Once he's involved in the battle with Irenicus later in the adventure, he is vulnerable. Like all the other inmates who participate in that fight, their death is a scripted certainty. \nNaljier has no scripted use of mage spells in the unmodified game and carries no weaponry. When the bard goes into the battle against Irenicus with the other inmates and the party, Naljier can't contribute anything meaningful. He has no bard song use either.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes revisions to this bard so that it can contribute some spellcasting during the battle with Irenicus.\nNaljier is provided an AI script that allows an opening \"previously cast\" trigger that applies &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;. If able, he can cast &lt;a href=\"Glitterdust\"&gt;Glitterdust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; and \"Icelance\" (if the IWD spell component is also installed). A \"Soundburst\" spell will be attempted with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed.\nTwp potions for quaffing are supplied and scripted for use during the battle. One for boosting protections and the other to heal damage. No melee weapon is given for fighting."}

A saving throw with a penalty can negate this, as well as other potential protections, see the spell link for details. \nIt is unlikely she will be able to do this again, as there is a long delay between her ability to cast this spell a second time, but it is possible if the party doesn't put her down in for a few turns.\nHer only other threat to the party is her potent touch attack - although she is a fragile opponent in melee combat and can't take a beating.\nIf she is able to connect with her touch attack, then several bad outcomes can afflict the victim - See the on-hit effects in the InfoBox or the Touch weapon link.\nUpon death she drops a rare &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish scroll&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt; and two random treasures.\nBugs.\nNalmissra's regeneration ability timing mode is set as permanent, but that setting requires a duration to work, and it has no duration, and therefore it doesn't operate correctly.

This issue is included in &lt;a href=\"The%20Enhanced%20Edition%20Fixpack%20%28EEFP%29\"&gt;The Enhanced Edition Fixpack (EEFP)&lt;/a&gt; and is already identified to Beamdog for possible fixing in the future.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises Nalmissra, and especially with the \"Improved Fiends and Celestials\" component.\nShe now will behave as a powerful succubus, and her abilities reflect this.\nA &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt; is added to her initial buffs. The permanent Improved haste effect is removed, but a movement modifier bonus of +9 is added.\nThe Mass charm person spell is removed, and she instead can cast the powerful single-target &lt;a href=\"Succubus%20charm%20male\"&gt;Succubus charm male&lt;/a&gt; spell, and this can and will be done much more often and she has an endless supply. Despite its title it can work on Male or Female persons, but her AI mainly looks for male targets.\nShe can also heal herself with innate version of &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Critical%20Wounds\"&gt;Cure Critical Wounds&lt;/a&gt; at certain damage thresholds and can be imitated as required if the condition trigger is applicable.\n\"Teleport without error\" is also a used ability. It is often employed to escape from being pounded in melee, to jump across the map to a vulnerable foe, and other reasons.\nShe also gets the &lt;a href=\"Ethereal\"&gt;Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; power, triggered by wounds or spell failure. She'll regenerate, be invisible, and gain extra magic resistance. It is resistant to being destroyed by divination and can't be dispelled."}

If any party member that is not a thief is within sight (see also &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs\"&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt;), Narlen will refuse to start the job; these could instead hide north of the tavern or inside a building.\nNarlen will lead your thief to the lookout position and enter the De\u2019Mallonblade household, supposedly with his partner, Redege. A few seconds later, a Flaming Fist Mercenary will approach, and your thief will be given three options.\nChoosing option 1 and escaping the guard is the preferred option. The easiest way to make the guard disappear is to go into the Blushing Mermaid which is right there, and rest for 8 hours. (You can have the rest of your party already be waiting for you there.) After returning to the Thieves' Guild and speaking to Narlen, he will reward you with 100 gp.\nChoosing option 1 and killing the guard fails the test for your thief, and Narlen will not give you the second test. Killing the guard will give you 420 xp and decrease your party's reputation by 10. After returning to the Thieves' Guild and speaking to Narlen, he will reward you with 300 gp and leave. It is irrelevant who or what caused the guard's death. The only thing that matters for Narlen's response is whether or not the guard has been killed.\nChoosing option 2 or option 3 and walking away without warning Narlen fails the test for your thief. If you return to the Thieves' Guild and speak to Narlen, he will tell you that Rededge was killed by the guards and challenge you to a duel.\nIf you fight fair, meaning only your thief attacks Narlen, none of the other members of the guild, including Alatos, will turn hostile. Killing Narlen grants you 975 xp, leather armor, 16 arrows, a short bow, a short sword, 75 gp, and a chrysoberyl gem. If anyone other than your thief attacks, then the entire guild will turn hostile and attack, however, Narlen will not be alive to support you during subsequent Thieves' Guild quests and obviously will not give you the second test. If Narlen somehow kills your thief (seems highly unlikely), he will stand there and give his default greeting without offering the tests, and the rest of the guild will act as before. Either way, you can still trade with Black Lily.\nNarlen's Second Test.\nIf you pass the first test, Narlen will give you a second test in the Thieves' Guild immediately after reporting and being rewarded for the first test.\nNarlen Darkwalk: 'Tis so for me an' Rededge. The mark tonight is a ripe plum for plucking, and a mite more dangerous. No petty gold, 'cause you passed that intro. This dark holds a jewel fence, with pretties brought stolen from Waterdeep. A mage of meager power called for a component gem called a rogue stone, and Gantolandan answered. His home be our target, but he be a side more cagey than last. We join at dusk by the Blade and Stars to sort the deed.\nFor the second test, Narlen will have your thief meet him outside the Blade and Stars in &lt;a href=\"southeast%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;southeast Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; after dark. Regardless of what Narlen said, you can meet him during the same night if it's still dark. If the rest of your party is within sight, Narlen will refuse to start the job just like during the first test.\nNarlen Darkwalk: This dark we'll see how ye are on the inside. Rededge will eye spy the alley while ye and I are search an' keep. Follow on to the door, I'll be the picker. Once we're inside, get the gems, then we make for the Guild. Ye won't be seeing much of me, I'll be keeping to the shadows.\nYou'll follow Narlen into &lt;a href=\"Gantolandan%27s%20Home\"&gt;Gantolandan's Home&lt;/a&gt;, and that's the last you'll see of Narlen. No one is downstairs, and there is 39 gp in a locked chest and a mundane book in each bookcase. Head upstairs where you'll see Gantolandan sleeping. The &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Stone\"&gt;Rogue Stone&lt;/a&gt; is in a trapped and locked chest of drawers in the northwest corner of the room, and two bookcases on the eastern wall hold one mundane book each. If you are hiding in shadows and moving silently, Gantolandan stays sleeping. If you are not silent, including rummaging through containers, Gantolandan will start to wake up. If you convince him to go back to sleep and don't quickly leave the room, he'll start to wake up the next time you make noise. Convincing him to go back to sleep is fun with the typical Baldur's Gate flair. Return to Narlen for your reward.\nNarlen Darkwalk: Well snuck, by any measure! Gantolandan wakes this morn none the wiser, but more the poorer! All the guild will hear o' this, and ye be welcomed as brethren. Split the gemmies thrice, and tonight we'll suck the monkey a keg apiece tavern-wise!\nNarlen will take the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Stone\"&gt;Rogue Stone&lt;/a&gt; from you, give you 3 pearls, and walk away.\nIf instead you wake up Gantolandan, he'll attack you, and you fail the test. It doesn't matter if you run away, kill him, or he kills your thief. If you kill Gantolandan, you will receive 1,200 xp, a Long Sword +1, and 64 gp. When you return to Narlen, he'll be upset and leave.\nNarlen Darkwalk: Never has fallen to Faerun a more bungled thief! Wakin' Gantolandan brought more guard than rats to cheese. Or mayhaps cats to rats! I don't fancy being the rodent in the mix! Not a gem fer the trouble neither. If this be common knowin' I'll get no rest in guild. Neither ye, 'cause many brethren will query Alatos why he sought ye. Ye no proved yer worth this night past.If you return to Narlen without a rogue stone after stealing it, by selling it or dropping it on the ground, he will react the same way as if you woke Gantolandan, even if that never happened. The quest will then fail in the same way as if Gantolandan was woken."}

The EE version is discussed on this page.\nUpon initiation of hostilities (usually because Necre has been attacked or detects a party member), the mage has a scripted array of spells that do not match up very well with the memorized spells in the InfoBox, and the script is actually going to do different things, so just basically ignore the spells shown in that listing in terms of planning a response. It will not ever attempt to cast over half of those spells, and it has other spells in the script that are not memorized.\nThe mage's opening spell move will first attempt an &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt; on the first detected intruder in range. At the same time, his partner &lt;a href=\"Taibela\"&gt;Taibela&lt;/a&gt; will be doing instant preparatory buffs. The two &lt;a href=\"Halfling%20Warrior%20%28Athas%29\"&gt;Halfling Warrior (Athas)&lt;/a&gt; in the room with both mages will charge ahead and attack with their morning stars. \nAfter this, the mage will attempt to cast &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Touch\"&gt;Ghoul Touch&lt;/a&gt; on self and engage in touch attacks, as well as to protect itself with &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt;. Necre will also try a &lt;a href=\"Confusion%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Confusion (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; spell cast and then apply &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; to self. If the battle is still ongoing a &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20to%20Stone\"&gt;Flesh to Stone&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Hold Person (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; will be attempted at the nearest detected target. More self-buffs may be attempted further into the battle. If any hostile summoned creatures are detected a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; will be tried to banish them.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises this creature with a new default AI script, and especially with the \"Smarter Mages\" component installed. An entire reworked spell book is memorized, and spell choices are changed as well. The mage retains the Necromancer kit, and spell casting choice will naturally be favoring that school.\nNecre will open up with a group of (previously cast) protective buffs including: &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI: Abjuration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;.\nWill then launch its prepared &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; to apply &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt; on self. Necre will continue to self-buff, attempting to cast &lt;a href=\"Mantle\"&gt;Mantle&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Prismatic Mantle\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt;). \nThe mage will now respond with offensive and disabling spells, perhaps even Undead summons, based up the AI's threat assessment scripting. It will be variable depending on the party's actions and their protections. \nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed, Necre's spell use will the SR versions. Expect a gated \"Death Knight\", which may teleport without error into the midst of the party, especially if the door to the Furnace Room has been shut, and the party has retreated away. The party can run but cannot hide."}

After Neera's preemptive teleportation of Ekandor, Edwin pulls rank with the remaining mages since he is the ranking Red Wizard in Ekandor's absence.

Go to &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20District\"&gt;Bridge District&lt;/a&gt;, head south till you hear three peasants talking about the shadow thief bodes, travel further south, then back to the area entrance, there you'll witness Neera rescue a girl named &lt;a href=\"Mereth\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt; from some &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wizards%20of%20Thay\"&gt;Red Wizards of Thay&lt;/a&gt; (no comments from &lt;a href=\"Edwin\"&gt;Edwin&lt;/a&gt; if he's in party). You'll encounter her again in your next travel, unlocking &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Forest\"&gt;Wild Forest&lt;/a&gt;, where Neera is waiting to join near the entrance.\nEdwin can't be in the same party with Neera and will either leave or prevent the questline from advancing at certain stages; Neera herself is also not necessarily needed to be brought along. Her presence will be required at some points in order to proceed with the quest, but the game does this automatically (as does in her companion quests in BG1 EE).\n&lt;a href=\"Wild%20Forest\"&gt;Wild Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis entire area is a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge\"&gt;wild surge&lt;/a&gt; zone, so it's probably a good idea to keep spellcasting at a minimum.\nOur goal here is to make it to the north-eastern corner of the map, start out by following the road to the north-east, you'll find a gnome named &lt;a href=\"Quaid\"&gt;Quaid&lt;/a&gt; (x=1620 y=2840), who turns out to be an illusion and will be launching Fireballs if you press him too much. The trapped cart behind contains some goodies to loot:\nActually, you have to be careful with traps throughout the forest. There are several of them along the path.\nContinue east, a few foes (Wolf, Giant Spider, Sword Spider) and a few traps to disarm (x=2060 y=2600), (x=2100 y=3000), (x=3400 y=3070), (x=4700 y=2090), (x=3270 y=1400).\nExplore north along the western end of the map, keeping an eye out for traps (x=620 y=2600), (x=1800 y=2100) as you go. North of where Quaid's cart is a Speaking Snake (x=2150 y=1780), again a verbal deterrent that is trying to fend off transpassers.\nContinue north to find a group of Gnolls being chased by an \"Ettin\", unfortunately the creator wild mage shows incompetence again and the illusion vanishes, the Gnolls, annoyed by the trick, turn on you and get themselves killed. The Gnoll Captain will drop random goodies. Trap here, be careful (x=360 y=1360).\nHead over to the bridge (x=4370, y=720), which seems inaccessible at first, just walk Neera over to it and she'll expose the illusion to get through. Alternatively, find A Pile of Gravel in a ditch (x=4600 y=1100) south-east of the bridge, and with it reveal the true state of the bridge, then cross it. Exit this area and travel to the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Refuge\"&gt;Hidden Refuge&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeware of the Polymorph trap (x=3345, y=3132)!\u00a0Approaching it from below, Neera warns you about it, then two squirrels wander in and become ogres, then\u00a0attack.\n&lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Refuge\"&gt;Hidden Refuge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis entire area is a wild surge zone.\n2000 xp each party member upon arriving here. Neera is near the starting point if you dismissed her earlier, and in order to get in the refuge, she must be in party. It's impossible to have both her and Edwin in the party at the same time, and Edwin will leave immediately at this stage if Neera joins.\u00a0\nAfter meeting &lt;a href=\"Hayes\"&gt;Hayes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Telana\"&gt;Telana&lt;/a&gt; at the gate, your next move is to find &lt;a href=\"Daxus%20Taralom\"&gt;Daxus Taralom&lt;/a&gt;, but before that, explore a bit, people around the camp have their own affairs, it\u2019s recommended to complete these mini quests before triggering Daxus's rescue in &lt;a href=\"Delosar%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Delosar's Inn&lt;/a&gt; for more rewards there and after.\nTreasures around the camp:\nFinding Daxus Taralom.\nNow on to main quest line, talk to Hayes first if you wish, then Telana, go to the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20District\"&gt;Bridge District&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt;. Hayes will be waiting south-west of &lt;a href=\"Delosar%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Delosar's Inn&lt;/a&gt;, go inside to find &lt;a href=\"Daxus%20Taralom\"&gt;Daxus Taralom&lt;/a&gt; on the lower floor with the bar and patrons. Note that if you don't have &lt;a href=\"Neera\"&gt;Neera&lt;/a&gt; with you, then Daxus won't start the performance required for the quest to continue. If you have &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20of%20the%20Hearthfire\"&gt;Talisman of the Hearthfire&lt;/a&gt;, tell Daxus to teleport with it so that you only have to fend off one enemy wave plus a 5000xp later, it doesn\u2019t matter if you talk to Hayes again afterwards but his dialogue may lead to some clue... otherwise decline Daxus\u2019s offer to aid you in battle, you don\u2019t want an unexpected surge mid-battle in the presence of many innocent bar patrons, including a few Amnian Guardsmen. After defeating the Red Wizards and mercenaries which teleport in abruptly to prevent Daxus from leaving with you, you may elect to leave Daxus behind and then proceed outside the Inn to scout for more Red Wizards. And there are another group awaiting you. Deal with the reinforcement outside, then Hayes will take Daxus away via teleportation (if he's still around and hasn't used the Talisman earlier). Note that from an experience gaining standpoint, using the Talisman will net your party an additional 5,000 XP later on in the quest.\nBack to Hidden Refuge, you'll find it in a sorry state, many are gone, Telana is here, as are Mereth and Kirik, if you completed their quests. After talking to Telana, we\u2019re off to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wizard%20Enclave\"&gt;Red Wizard Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack to camp.\nReturning to the Hidden Refuge after completing the Red Wizard Enclave adventure, report back to Telana, the party receives 10,000 XP. Neera will ask to come along with your party, agree and you\u2019ll receive &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20Bird\"&gt;Mechanical Bird&lt;/a&gt;, which is worth either or xp to &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Collector\"&gt;Strange Collector&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Amkethran\"&gt;Amkethran&lt;/a&gt; during the \"Throne of Bhaal\" campaign (at the Zephir inn; Neera has to be in your party). Talk to Telana again to receive &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Goodman%20Hayes\"&gt;Robe of Goodman Hayes&lt;/a&gt;, speak to Reginald (if you talked and saved him previously) for &lt;a href=\"The%20Brick\"&gt;The Brick +2&lt;/a&gt;. Now, although optional, there's one more thing to do before we wrap this quest up, let's go find the traitor in &lt;a href=\"Trademeet\"&gt;Trademeet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe loose end.\nEnter &lt;a href=\"Vyatri%27s%20Pub\"&gt;Vyatri's Pub&lt;/a&gt; in Trademeet and you'll find Hayes drinking himself to death. You have a choice here. You can help him to that end and then bring the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Tunic%20of%20Hayes\"&gt;Bloodied Tunic of Hayes&lt;/a&gt; back to Telana, which she'll have mixed feelings about. Or you can speak with him and leave the man to his wretched depression, showing some mercy."}

{"id": "45196", "revid": "47673695", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=45196", "title": "Nevaziah", "text": "Nevaziah is a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; hiding in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Dungeons\"&gt;Southern Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; below the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Athkatla Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. It appears during &lt;a href=\"Find%20the%20Nether%20Scroll%20for%20Edwin\"&gt;Find the Nether Scroll for Edwin&lt;/a&gt; quest. At first contact with the party the lich is neutral but becomes hostile when &lt;a href=\"Edwin\"&gt;Edwin&lt;/a&gt; insists on demanding the Nether Scroll from him. Note that this scroll has no actual object in the game and isn't an \"item\" that can be placed into an inventory and carried or moved around.\nGameplay.\nThis creature is reduced in spell casting potential, as the Lich will not utilize spells greater than level 5. Nevaziah has unique physical damage resistances and is extra vulnerable to fire damage. The Lich also cannot see through Invisibility. \nIn terms of the creature's immunities and general abilities, have a look on the &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; article for a run down.\nUpon hostilities the creature may initially, if not disrupted, turn invisible with a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;. It may also attempt a &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;. If it can, it will cast offensive spells such as &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;. That is all it has in its script arsenal, aside from an &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Animate Dead (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Summoning%20III\"&gt;Monster Summoning III&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nIf Edwin is kept far enough away from the Lich (so as not to trigger Edwin's dialogue), then you can attack Nevaziah in a surprise assault and get the drop on the creature. To get the Nether Scroll, you must defeat the creature by violence. Once the creature is destroyed, then Edwin's dialogue should continue regarding the Scroll and keep the quest moving forward.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises Nevaziah to a level 14 Necromancer. In terms of spell selection and the \"Smarter Mage\" AI. SCS does in fact allow up to level 7 spell casts appropriate to a level 14 Necromancer. As is normal for SCS, an opening uninterruptible contingency is launched to raise some protective buffs. In the case of this lich, if a party member is under invisibility the lich will know someone approaching within range is invisible and cast a &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; spell and may say \"\"Strange... let's see what a little divination will show\", or \"Come out, spy... I can sense your presence\"\".\nIf made hostile, the lich will launch its precast buff contingency consisting of &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;. It will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; cast afterwards, as well as the SCS lich innate ability \"Fear Aura\", which tics every two rounds continuously. Now that its buffs are up, if the lich is not yet dead or disabled it will go on the offensive. The script has a large variable response based on the target vulnerability assessment. The choice of spells is wide. A &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt; may be cast to weaken a target. A &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20Field\"&gt;Teleport Field&lt;/a&gt; is usual to break up the party's melee assault. \nA &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; is scripted to banish summoned party creatures will occur. The Lich will also summon a &lt;a href=\"Nabassu\"&gt;Nabassu&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;s. It has a high probability of casting &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;. If a party member is up close in melee with the Lich, it will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Touch\"&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/a&gt; spell. All in all, except a much tougher encounter than the unmodified game.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed (which works with SCS), the lich will have the SR spell versions. For example, in its opening contingency it will have a \"\"Dispel Shield\" instead of Spell Immunity Abjuration. Instead of summoning a Nabassu, SR replaces that with a gated \"Death Knight\"\"."}

Also unlike BG, it is based on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons v3.5\"\u00a0rules instead of \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition\".\nThere are two main games in the series, both of which received a number of expansion packs:\nSetting.\nLike \"Baldur's Gate\", \"Neverwinter Nights\" is set in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Realms\"&gt;Forgotten Realms&lt;/a&gt; and mainly focuses on the eponymous city of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Neverwinter\"&gt;Neverwinter&lt;/a&gt;, which lies at the northern half of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast\"&gt;Sword Coast&lt;/a&gt; but takes the player to all sorts of places, such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Rashemen\"&gt;Rashemen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Maztica\"&gt;Maztica&lt;/a&gt;.\nCross-references between Games.\nIn addition to general cross-references based on the setting, there exist a number of game-specific references.\nMod content.\nDeveloped over the course of 5 years by Russian modder AGKanevchev (with help from paladin84 in relation to weidu and bug-fixing), the mod &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forums.beamdog.com/discussion/88115/mod-neverwinter-for-baldurs-gate/p1\"&gt;Neverwinter for Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; recreates Neverwinter Nights 1 (the base game, without expansions) in the BG2(EE) engine through clever use of Infinity Engine games and Pillars of Eternity 1+2 art assets. Some creative liberties were taken, however, in terms of gameplay: the mod completely rebalances the adventure to fit much higher level combat from the start (in fact, the NPC to start the mod will only spawn once Gorion's Ward reaches 1350000 XP) and, of course, it utilizes BG2(EE)'s version of the 2e AD&amp;D ruleset instead of the 3e ruleset."}

He and the xvarts he leads are the ones responsible for the recent livestock raids in the &lt;a href=\"Nashkel\"&gt;Nashkel&lt;/a&gt; area. Appearance-wise, Nexlit is indistinguishable from a regular xvart.\nSummary.\nUpon entering the Xvart Village, Nexlit will approach &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and party and accuse them of being monsters who kill xvarts indiscriminately, even when the xvarts have done nothing to merit such treatment. This accusation is, of course, false, as all xvarts the party encounters throughout the game are hostile and will attempt to kill the party on sight, with the exception of one group in the &lt;a href=\"Lonely%20Peaks\"&gt;Lonely Peaks&lt;/a&gt; that is too preoccupied with trying to kill &lt;a href=\"Hulrik\"&gt;Hulrik's&lt;/a&gt; cow first. \nNexlit's outrage does make a little more sense if the party stepped in, unprovoked, to defeat the Lonely Peaks raiding party prior to entering the village, especially considering the &lt;a href=\"Xvart%20Raids\"&gt;accompanying quest&lt;/a&gt; involves clearing out the village in order to stop the raids. However, Nexlit's reaction is the same whether Gorion's Ward has been to the Lonely Peaks or not. \nNexlit also gives Gorion's Ward no chance for a nonviolent confrontation. After his accusation, he, like all other xvarts, rushes in to attack. First, though, he calls upon the village's \"guardian\", &lt;a href=\"Ursa%20the%20Cave%20Bear\"&gt;Ursa the Cave Bear&lt;/a&gt;, to join the fight, claiming that she will protect him and the other villagers because she is kind. \nNote: Ursa, despite Nexlit's claims that she is a kind guardian, is a wild animal like any other, and as such, is just as likely to attack Nexlit and the other xvarts as she is to attack your party, so if you can arrange to get Nexlit between yourselves and Ursa before attacking, she may well become a (very temporary) ally.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Xvart%20Raids\"&gt;Xvart Raids&lt;/a&gt;.\nNexlit and the other inhabitants of the Xvart Village are the ones responsible for the recent livestock raids in the Nashkel area. Gorion's Ward first finds out about these raids when they encounter a farmer named &lt;a href=\"Hulrik\"&gt;Hulrik&lt;/a&gt; whose cow is under attack by a xvart raiding party, and is subsequently prompted to find and clear out the xvarts' base of operations. There are two such bases. Nexlit's little village is one of them, and defeating him is a part of the quest. The quest, however, is bugged, and the accompanying journal entry will not be cleared even after Gorion's Ward has successfully laid waste to the xvarts in both areas. "}

Its many wharves and docks jut out along its western point where the River Chionthar flows into the starry Sea of Swords. A bridge from this western shore links the mainland with a rocky islet on which perches the old, massive Seatower of Balduran. It is there that the true tale begins. Do you wish me to continue?\"\n\"Balduran was a well-known and good-natured pirate who sailed the Sea of Swords in times gone by. He built the Seatower that bears his name to guide him to his home port and provide warning of invasion to his kin and clan that made their home along the northern riverbank. In time, a vibrant group of traders and fellow sea captains gathered there and built the city's inner wall to protect their wares and belongings from the ever-present danger of rival pirates or orcish raids... You look distracted. Do you still wish me to continue?\"\n\"Balduran was away from port during the time in which the decision to build the wall was made and, when he returned, he learned that many of his kin and clan now lay outside the new wall and vulnerable to any attack made upon the settlement! As the orcs advanced upon the city in the early summer, it erupted into a state of civil chaos. It was at this point that Balduran's sails were spotted upon the horizon, returning home to port... Ahem, are you still with me?\"\n\"In a rage, Balduran slew the entire council of captains and merchants for such arrogance and selfishness. He spared only the four who had spoken out against the council's decision. Together, they ordered the immediate construction of the city's outer wall and the bridge gate from which Baldur's Gate gets its name. Facing a united city and a stout defense, the orcs were defeated and, for their valor, Balduran appointed the four captains as Dukes of the city... Well, that's Baldur's Gate in a nutshell. I'm quite impressed with your perseverance.\"\n\"Well, there's really not that much more to tell... Balduran eventually died\u2014apparently lost at sea\u2014and the four Dukes passed on their titles in a hereditary fashion for many years. Now, of course, Dukes are elected to office, although they keep the title until their death. They have grown softer and more tolerant over the years, however, and I think many people would like to see someone with a more extravagant, forceful approach ascend to the position. But that is the future, not the past, and who knows what it shall hold.\"\n\"You are quite welcome and thank you for bending your ear to an old man.\"\nIf you try to get him to tell more tales:"}

Nilthiri only appears during the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; quest, &lt;a href=\"Heeding%20the%20Spirit%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Heeding the Spirit of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Spirit of the Grove&lt;/a&gt; will inform the protagonist that Nilthiri threatens the balance, and therefore must be slain so that hordes of trolls won't be summoned to overrun the grove.\nNilithri can be found east of &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Mound\"&gt;Troll Mound&lt;/a&gt;, along with three other &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; (worth each).\nWhen battle starts, the shaman will self-protect with instantly cast &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Mirror\"&gt;Physical Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Archons\"&gt;Shield of the Archons&lt;/a&gt;.\nRight afterwards, the shaman will spawn a large group of &lt;a href=\"Diseased%20Rat\"&gt;Diseased Rat&lt;/a&gt; creatures and deals a little bit of acid damage to the troll as well (system shock). (ref: SPIN715.spl).\nThe first instance where Nilthri takes any damage, an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Skins\"&gt;Iron Skins&lt;/a&gt; is applied for protection.\nOffensively, the shaman will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Poison (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Blight\"&gt;Unholy Blight&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a &lt;a href=\"Cause%20Critical%20Wounds\"&gt;Cause Critical Wounds&lt;/a&gt;. If the troll is still in fighting shape it may try a &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Hold Person (priest)&lt;/a&gt; at a non &lt;a href=\"Helpless\"&gt;Helpless&lt;/a&gt; close by opponent. \nIt's also scripted to try and cast a &lt;a href=\"Insect%20Plague\"&gt;Insect Plague&lt;/a&gt;, though later in the battle.\nNote.\nIn the classic game, the creature gender was listed as Female, but this is changed to Neither in the Enhanced Edition. This does not affect gameplay or dialogue pronouns.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes some revisions to the shaman. First, the troll now has a level 14 Druid class. A new array of memorized spells are provided as well.\nNilthri is provided with an equipped shapeshift Bear token in its off-hand (shield) weapon slot. By script it can use it as well, based on certain triggers/conditions. \nThe troll will open with &lt;a href=\"Barkskin\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Mirror\"&gt;Physical Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and two different summoning spells, including possibly &lt;a href=\"Call%20Woodland%20Beings\"&gt;Call Woodland Beings&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Earth%20Elemental%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Conjure Earth Elemental (priest)&lt;/a&gt; for support. After that it will bring forth a dozen \"\"Diseased Rats\", with a displayed combat log text message stating: \"The troll shakes, twitches, and convulses as a dozen sickly rats tear their way from its body and scramble towards you, fangs bared in angry grimaces\"\". The rats may be subsequently buffed with a &lt;a href=\"Chant\"&gt;Chant&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly a &lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt; according to in-game testing.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Dale\"&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/a&gt; spell component installed, SCS adds the \"Icelance\" spell to its arsenal. A plethora of offensive and disabling spells can be cast as determined by the AI's vulnerability assessment of opponents and enemy protections. The troll can even attempt a &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Beauty\"&gt;Nature's Beauty&lt;/a&gt; spell, the only 7th level druid spell it knows.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed, druid spells are much better in terms of offensive capability, and those will be noticeable in this battle. The Nymph summoned by &lt;a href=\"Call%20Woodland%20Beings\"&gt;Call Woodland Beings&lt;/a&gt; is a particularly problematic spell caster."}

Under Irenicus' command, Nizidramanii'yt is now tasked with guarding the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Goblet%20of%20Life\"&gt;Golden Goblet of Life&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Clearing\"&gt;Forest Clearing&lt;/a&gt; to prevent anyone from reaching him whilst draining the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life\"&gt;Tree of Life&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nWhen the party moves into the clearing, a massive black dragon is eventually observed, which is neutral at the moment. When the beast has detected a party member (it can see invisible or hidden creatures) it will immediately challenge the intruders and begin with a rumbling remark that the party is viewed as a source of food. \nThis leads to a series of dialogue choices between the dragon and party spokesperson. As is usual for dragons, they have a sense of ego and self-worth that may be arrogant or display an air of confident superiority. It is obvious that Nizidramanii'yt is not entirely satisfied with his status as a hired soldier for Irenicus. \nThe party can explore this fact, and perhaps come to an agreement, or bargain if you will, to obtain the sought after &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Goblet%20of%20Life\"&gt;Golden Goblet of Life&lt;/a&gt; that the party seeks. \nTo bargain with it for the Goblet you have to have at least 30,000 gold and choose the correct dialogue options. If the party doesn't have sufficient funds, the dialogue option doesn't appear. Then all your gold and most inventory carried will be exchanged for the Goblet. Once the dialogue choice is made and the correct conditions are met, the game script will initiate the \"Blackdragon items\" global from 1, to 2, and execute the \"Destroy All Destructible Equipment\" code. However, the following items will not be taken from the party:\nThis bargain is really not a good deal, as the party by this stage of the saga isn't so weak that a lone dragon should dictate the party's actions and prevent their goals. If the party chooses to fight its way through, then there are obvious dialogue paths to accomplish this. Most likely if you can get the dragon to reply with:\n\"Then I will kill you as I should have done the moment I saw you. Mere cattle should not be bargained with.\"\nThe battle will now begin, and the dragon becomes a hostile creature.\nThe dragon opens with a burst of uninterruptible force cast spells including &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; on self and a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; on the nearest opponent within range (also possibly exposing other party members in the AoE).\nIt will shortly afterwards radiate a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Fear\"&gt;Dragon Fear&lt;/a&gt; aura and spew a full-throated &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Breath\"&gt;Black Dragon Breath&lt;/a&gt; at the nearest party member, followed by a &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Buffet\"&gt;Wing Buffet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnyone in the party in melee range will be a target for the beast's claw attacks, and with the Haste effect on (if not dispelled earlier) it will be 4 &lt;a href=\"attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;attacks per round&lt;/a&gt; plus 2 off-hand slashing attacks. Both types count as +5 weapons.\nEvery three rounds the dragon will blast another acidic dragon breath attack on a timed interval.\nIf the dragon's original Hit Point total decreases to 50%, then an automatic contingency will deploy that will cast a &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; spell on itself.\nIf the dragon is still alive and functioning after several rounds, it will deploy two other innate abilities, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Insects%20%28innate%29\"&gt;Summon Insects (innate)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe insect swarm will spread to most party members on the map.\nA long time into the battle, perhaps never occurring if the beast is slain in less than a turn, will be an attempted &lt;a href=\"Plant%20Growth\"&gt;Plant Growth&lt;/a&gt; innate ability - sort of like a powerful &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt; effect. The party may never face this ability since it is only used after a long period of time from the start of hostilities.\nThe cycle of dragon breath attacks and additional wing buffets will continue, and there is a 35% chance the dragon will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Person\"&gt;Charm Person&lt;/a&gt; spell as well.\nThat is the gist of the scripted abilities of this dragon. Be wary of its potent acid breath attack, as protection from acid is difficult in the game, without being a Mage, or having access to the green &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Acid%20%28protection%20scroll%29\"&gt;Protection From Acid (protection scroll)&lt;/a&gt;. Oddly enough, the dragon is not scripted to do anything special against summoned creatures - it has no &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; or banishment ability.\nDefeating the dragon will give access to the creature's carried hoard, and the required &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Goblet%20of%20Life\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;.\nAchievements.\nBlack Dragon Slayer Achievement icon BG2EE.jpg|\nBlack Dragon Slayer.\nSlew the black dragon, Nizidramanii'yt.\nMod Content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises Nizidramanii'yt in several ways. Especially if you install the \"Smarter Dragons\" component (which is responsive to the game difficulty selection). His SCS AI improves targeting and recognition of opponent's protections, which means he will fight smarter and not waste attacks on someone he cannot hit or damage. It will also influence his tactical options and attack methods. First, some mention of the dragon's stats and abilities. In most cases, all of the unmodded ones are still applicable:\nImmunities in addition to the unmodified dragon version:\nThe dragon follows the unmodified game script closely, however depending on the game difficulty selection, will perform breath attacks more frequently (every two rounds). Additionally, the dragon is able to cast &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt; twice each. Instead of charm person it can cast &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Charm\"&gt;Dire Charm&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf any cloud type spells are cast at the dragon, including &lt;a href=\"Incendiary%20Cloud\"&gt;Incendiary Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, then the script will initiate a Wing Buffet to clear it from the map.\nWith SCS, dragon breath weapons are not assigned to any school of magic and have no secondary type - so the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt; has no effect, nor will &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; and similar protections have any interaction.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod adds \"The Manual of Golem Building Vol. 5\" to the dragon's carried loot.

It also has a 10% magic resistance rating.\nThe djinni is a hostile creature who is scripted to advance upon the nearest opponent in detection range and attack in melee combat until dead. Oddly enough, the game gives the magical creature no offensive or defensive spells to employ in its script.\nNote.\nThe saving throws for the Noble Djinni are worse than some varieties of an ordinary version.

By script they cast wizard spells (sometimes instantly depending on game difficulty selection). The creature will turn into mist form (and it is impervious to damage while in that form) and rapidly regenerate hit points when damaged over 50%. Careful timing and delivered damage can overcome the mist regeneration phase - if it isn't done correctly, the creature can take a long time to kill, as it is constantly going into mist form, regenerating, and then reforming etc.&lt;br&gt;\nThe scripted spells use and number of times it can cast them is as follows: \n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nSpells will be attempted as determined by the AI's recognition of the target's spell protections and carried items.

The planned quest was abandoned.\nThe content already completed for the area maps &lt;a href=\"Small%20Teeth%20Pass\"&gt;Small Teeth Pass&lt;/a&gt;, North Forest and &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Tethir\"&gt;Forest of Tethir&lt;/a&gt; were retained in the game and do have some unaffiliated encounters, spawns, treasure etc. - but no longer are tied to the unrealized Rhynn Lanthorn recovery.\nOn the map.\nThe player is furnished no \"Automap Notes\" for this area.\nWalkthrough.\nIf the player elects to travel to this location - the party will transition to this forested place and arrives in the north central sector of the map.\nThe party has no quest required actions in this area in the unmodified game, and can freely explore it as they desire, or the area can be ignored and never visited at the discretion of the player.\nVarious deer, rabbit and moose wildlife wander the forest here.\nCircle of stones and central altar/sarcophagus.\nNearby where the party enters a map is a small, elevated mound with a circle of stone posts surrounding an Altar, or perhaps a stone sarcophagus (marked as altar in the game files). During daytime hours an &lt;a href=\"Efreeti\"&gt;Efreeti&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Dao%20%28North%20Forest%29\"&gt;Dao djinni&lt;/a&gt; seemingly guard this place. They are hostile and will attack any detected party members. \nDuring nighttime hours the guardians are replaced by a pair of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Ancient%29\"&gt;Ancient vampires&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party is able to best these foes, the lid on the central container has a complex lock (difficulty 95). Once opened, much random rich treasure is discovered.\nMercenary group.\nNear the center of the map is a gathered group of unknown humanoids and a skeleton warrior. A large plate mail clad Orog is present here, and an armored dwarf as well. A real mixed bag of races. Perhaps they are adventurers or mercenaries. If any party members are detected, they don't bother to hail the party or try to converse - they attack on sight.\nThe group is composed of a &lt;a href=\"Archer%20%28North%20Forest%29\"&gt;Archer (North Forest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duergar%20%28North%20Forest%29\"&gt;Duergar (North Forest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28North%20Forest%29\"&gt;Sorcerer (North Forest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20%28North%20Forest%29\"&gt;Mercenary (North Forest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Cyric%20%28North%20Forest%29\"&gt;Priest of Cyric (North Forest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28North%20Forest%29\"&gt;Thief (North Forest)&lt;/a&gt; (who is invisible to start with and may not be seen initially).\nThe group aren't pushovers, and have some competent experience levels, some enchanted equipment items and a variety of spell casting options. Note that the Sorcerer is already protected with an active stoneskin - in case the party planned a backstabbing attack.\nOther spawned encounters.\nVarious spawn points on the map exist and will generate hostile enemy creatures at those locations when the area map is entered. The time of the day/night plays into the creature types encountered at some of the spawn points. See the creatures section below.\nNotes.\nAfter exploring and defeating any map enemies here, the North Forest area has no additional offerings. Subsequent visits after a rest period can still spawn more creatures on this map - so it is possible to get some XP \"farming\" in this area. However, there is more exciting and mission-oriented gameplay opportunities in Chapter 7.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises various creatures on this map with new AI scripts for more flexible and \"smarter\" behavior.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a \"Lesser Adamantine\" golem to the mercenary group.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/RoxanneSHS/LensHunt\"&gt;The Broken Lanthorn&lt;/a&gt; mod has content in this area and is necessary to complete this mod's questline.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/31605-restored-rhynn-lanthorn-quest/\"&gt;Restored Rhynn Lanthorn Quest&lt;/a&gt; mod also has content here in the North Forest. Note that this mod isn't compatible with The Broken Lanthorn mod above, and vice versa. Only one lanthorn mod at a time is needed and workable."}

They look much like human or elven women. Nymphs are one of the creatures that can be summoned by druids to aid their allies in combat. Though they are gentle creatures by nature, nymphs are well equipped to defend themselves. Instead of attacking their enemies directly they tend to charm or confuse them to make them fight each other.\nNymphs could be compared to &lt;a href=\"sirine\"&gt;sirine&lt;/a&gt;s, as they are both beautiful fey beings that take mortal lovers, but nymphs are generally not hostile and more inclined to frolicking and love-making than violence. They are also a much rarer sight than sirines, though neither sirines nor nymphs can abide captivity. If a nymph is held captive outside her natural habitat for too long, she will languish and die.\nThe body parts of nymphs are highly sought after by some mages and craftspeople for use in spells or magical items, such as the &lt;a href=\"Nymph%20Cloak\"&gt;Nymph Cloak&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, they are sometimes hunted; however, this is not the only way to acquire such prizes. &lt;a href=\"Lock%20of%20Nymph%27s%20Hair\"&gt;Locks of hair&lt;/a&gt; are sometimes given by nymphs as a sign of favor or as a boon.\nNymphs can also be summoned to help the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic spell &lt;a href=\"Call%20Woodland%20Beings\"&gt;Call Woodland Beings&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpell Book.\nNote: (#) indicates the number of times the spell can be cast by this person.\nTrivia.\nThe offical website for the original game, now archived, had the following information about these :\"So beautiful that a glimpse can &lt;a href=\"Blinded\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt; or even kill a man, the nymphs are the embodiment of loveliness, a triumph of nature.A nymph's beauty is beyond words - an ever-young woman with sleek figure and long, thick hair, radiant skin and perfect teeth, full lips and gentle eyes.

But more about these may be presented later, if the party undertakes the quest.\nAlthough the game allows the player to attack Odren and the vigil knights at the first meeting and anytime afterwards, this action will result in the knight's defending themselves and shouting:\nThis action will have several plot altering repercussions on many variable scripts - the results of which aren't revealed to the player ahead of time. The gist of this action will be a shuttering and closure of several potential quest paths. In essence, the intended choices available to resolve this quest will be limited. Less overall experience points, roleplay options, rewards and gameplay will be the end result. Attacking the helmites provides no beneficial outcomes, and only less than ideal consequences. \nClearly, this is a less optimal path to take, so it isn't a recommended action. Additionally, several core Bioware companions will react negatively to this action. Mazzy (and others) may become hostile or leave the party forever. In the end, it's up to the player if they wish to go full-evil mode and exact revenge on the Helmites. But you'll have to live with the decision.\nIf the party ends up in combat with Odren he'll have access to both Cleric and some Druidic spells, as outlined in the InfoBox's scripted spell use.\nHe is also a competent level 20 fighter that dual wields enchanted maces.

Some appear as named creatures and a couple of these creatures are tough opponents if encountered early in the game (see notable ogre mages below).\nIt appears from the game files that an ogre mage may be summoned as an ally in the , but this needs verification.\nGameplay.\nMost Ogre Mages are under level 6 and so vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Command\"&gt;Command&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey all have well developed spellbooks and will utilize every spell in battle. Most of them come equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword\"&gt;Bastard Sword&lt;/a&gt; which they use in melee combat once their spells are depleted, although the weapon isn't dropped upon death and can't be pickpocketed. A couple of ogre mages use &lt;a href=\"Katana\"&gt;Katana&lt;/a&gt;s, instead of bastard swords, which are dropped upon death. Those ogre mages that are equipped with a bastard sword as a weapon will instead drop from their inventory either a &lt;a href=\"Scimitar\"&gt;Scimitar&lt;/a&gt; or different bastard sword . Most of them also drop between three to four items of &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure%23RNDTRE05\"&gt;rich random treasure&lt;/a&gt; while a few will drop no treasure at all.\nMany of them also wear an undroppable/unstealable &lt;a href=\"MAGE01.ITM\"&gt;Sandthief's Ring&lt;/a&gt; which is triggered anytime an area where they are located is entered. Some mages will also utilize the ring before every spell casting attempt.\nThe InfoBox to the right lists all of those stats which mostly remain unchanged for all ogre mage creatures found throughout all of the games."}

But the mage came here with a purpose...\nGameplay.\n In the original Shadow of Amn (SoA),\u00a0the XP cap was set to 2.95 million. As a result, it was impossible to reach a level that would allow any\u00a0player\u00a0character to pick\u00a0or memorize\u00a0level 9 spells.\u00a0 The only way to access\u00a0level 9 spells, such as Time Stop, was to find\u00a0a scroll.\u00a0 Such\u00a0scrolls were extremely rare.\u00a0 Vithal\u00a0was well known among experienced players for holding the very first &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; scroll that a player could get hands on through normal gameplay.\n As of BG2EE v.2.5.16.6, all the \"treasures\"\u00a0in Vithal's inventory can be pickpocketed, including a total of five\u00a0level 8 or 9 scrolls.\u00a0If killed the mage will additionally drop the ritual book that you gave him and a plain quarterstaff.\u00a0\u00a0Even if provoked, however, he is not interested in fighting the player\u00a0and will teleport away once the quest is over, with only a few brief moments before disappearing from the game for good.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Quest Pack&lt;/a&gt; Mod adds a \"Reward Negotiation\" component. The player will be able to select specifically what items constitute their share of the loot during the division of Vithal's spoils from the Underdark portals. Some dialogue will be added, and reactions from Vithal will differ from the regular game. \nWith this mod, he can be made hostile, and he'll not attempt to flee but instead defend himself and all his treasures. Also, a failed pickpocket attempt with this mod may lead to a provoked battle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; increases the elemental guardians at each Portal.

Engage in as much conversation as possible with this one, and ask any questions you wish in the dialogue choices. Paraphrased below are some of the replies and information he shares:\nGameplay.\nIt should become apparent that there is a mage that was defeated in battle nearby, who has been affected by the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; spell effect. Based on the information available from Uder, it is likely the mage was pursuing some kind of artifact hunt before being unceremoniously trapped in a confined area below the surface.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Odesseiron\"&gt;Edwin Odesseiron&lt;/a&gt; is a party member he'll have an interjection and show keen interest in these alleged artifacts.\nUder Mordin says this imprisonment event occurred just north of their location. After this dialogue, the party will receive a Journal Update officially marking the side quest.\nYou will note that &lt;a href=\"Carlig\"&gt;Carlig&lt;/a&gt; who is the storekeeper for the duergar has a &lt;a href=\"Freedom\"&gt;Freedom&lt;/a&gt; scroll available. Perhaps this could be put to use, and possibly free this trapped mage?\nShould the party cast the freedom spell in the duergar's area (perhaps a bit north of them), then your suspicions are proven correct. Indeed, a mage was trapped by Imprisonment, and use of the Freedom spell by the party will summon the captive back to the exact location he was - before being spirited away to eternal stasis.\nThe mage, named &lt;a href=\"Vithal\"&gt;Vithal&lt;/a&gt;, will of course speak with the party and be thankful. He will also provide a chance to undertake another task, so he can finish his original exploration and hunt for artifacts.

He charges the party to provide the tour. After accepting the payment, he heads towards the Inn and disappears.\nWhen the party arrives at Durlag's Tower, they'll find Ike waiting on a stone bridge that is located just past the first gate of the entrance way to the tower. Upon speaking to him, he will berate the party for being late and then head off towards the main entrance.\nSpeaking to him again will begin the tour. He'll start talking about the history of the tower and the enormous fortune located within before heading inside. Moving inside to the &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Ground%20Floor%29\"&gt;ground floor&lt;/a&gt;, the party will find Ike along with several &lt;a href=\"Tourist\"&gt;tourists&lt;/a&gt; standing in the foyer.\nHe must then be spoken to four more times. Each time Ike will provide more insight into what caused the tower's eventual decline, the magical wards &lt;a href=\"Durlag%20Trollkiller\"&gt;Durlag&lt;/a&gt; installed within the tower to protect himself, and even a few sensational examples of the horror's to be found throughout the tower. After the fourth time, one of the tourists will wander off and trigger a silent &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt; trap and fry himself.\nThe final time Ike's spoken to, he will offer for what he claims to be is a true wardstone that will give the party access at least as far down as the &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20Three%29\"&gt;third level&lt;/a&gt; of the dungeon. Whichever dialogue option you pick as a response, they will all end with the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Knight\"&gt;Demon Knight&lt;/a&gt; teleporting into the foyer and killing Ike and the tourist with fireballs. So you cannot lose any money as Ike will simply drop anything you gave him, including the wardstone if you did not purchase it. At this point the quest ends."}

The highest possible value for any score is 25, it can not be raised further by any means.\nIf any of the ability scores is reduced to less than 1, the creature will be killed.\nIn Character Generation.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%2526_Dragons\"&gt;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&lt;/a&gt; sees strength, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma as characters' 'stats' or sometimes 'attributes' of other games, though D&amp;D games were the progenitors of the stats system. Those scores are required by certain classes; the computer handles this by never rolling those numbers lower than the requirements, which skews the totals somewhat.\nThe abilities screen at &lt;a href=\"Character%20Generation\"&gt;Character Generation&lt;/a&gt; is weighted in favor of 'secondary' classes that have high attribute requirements. These numbers are always a set amount, and can only be equal to or higher than that, and the other numbers are rolled as normal, rather than being adjusted - it can be compared with a magic weapon; a +1 dagger will do 2-5 damage instead of 1-4; the +1 is the threshold that attributes cannot go under.\nIn general, it can be said that the lower the requirements, the lower the ability rolls will be, although this is within a range of 10 or so ability points out of around 85-95 ability points in total. It is usually time-consuming to obtain total ability scores near or above 90.\nClass kits have different minimum scores, for example, specialist Mages, an interesting group of requirements, adding other attributes to the expected Int:\nMulti-class characters have requirements that are combinations of their two classes, which are not, of course, cumulative; consequently, they are often redundant with respect to the enhanced stat rolls. More importantly, all of the non-redundant combinations are combinations of classes with low requirements, with the exception of Druid-Fighter, which works out to rolls in between the low-stat requirement group and the high.\nAchievement.\nIncrease any of the six attribute score to 25."}

Raising an ability score by +1 costs 1 point, until it reaches 13 points; raising it above 13 costs 2 points for each +1 increase.\nIn addition, bonuses of +1 and +2 can be applied to two ability scores, potentially raising them as high as 16 or 17.\nThe character's Primary Ability is marked with a star, depending on the class's specialty. For spellcasters it's the ability uses for spellcasting; for other classes it's the ability used for melee or ranged attacks.\nAt Class levels 4, 8, and 12, a character can earn 2 additional points that can be applied to one ability or split between two abilities, to a maximum score of 20.\nAbility modifiers.\nAbility scores are typically not used directly; instead a corresponding ability modifier is calculated by subtracting 10 from the ability score and dividing the result by 2, rounding down. This modifier is then added to die rolls that rely on that ability. For example a Strength of 15 gives a strength modifier of +2 (15 - 10 = 5, divide by 2 = 2.5, round down to 2)."}

In theory, it has an uncountable quantity of layers. Currently, it is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Tanar%27ri\"&gt;Tanar'ri&lt;/a&gt;. It is associated with Chaos and Evil.\nSee the external link for a much more detailed description of the Dungeon's and Dragons lore of the abyss - and how it is viewed and referred to in the Forgotten Realms campaign, to which this game is set in.\nNote that &lt;a href=\"The%20Abyss\"&gt;The Abyss&lt;/a&gt; is an area reachable at the tail end of during &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%207\"&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nGame use of \"Abyss\".\nAlthough the game files refer to a map and area as &lt;a href=\"The%20Abyss\"&gt;The Abyss&lt;/a&gt; - the dialogue, journal entries and text refer to this area as \"Hell\" or the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Hells\"&gt;Nine Hells&lt;/a&gt; as several of the Tears of Bhaal tests fiends call it. The plot at this point is making it clear that the party is somewhere in the Nine Hells. \nIn fact, there will be a player journal entry registered here titled &lt;a href=\"Finding%20Irenicus%20in%20Hell\"&gt;Finding Irenicus in Hell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bioware Game design isn't really following the lore on the differences between The Abyss and the Nine Hells at this point of the game. For instance, the player will interact with Demons, and not Devils, or maybe just refer to them as \"Fiend\" to get around this. The Abyss area map even has an Automap note feature titled \"The Abyssal Door\".\nOn older BG2 forums and various fan made mods or web pages, the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Tears of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; tests are often referred to as the \"Hell Trials\" - but that misnomer isn't ever used by the game.

This will bring Turin running to investigate and allow the party to move on through the doors into the Warrens, as well as rewarding the party with 6,000 EXP.\nIf the party doesn't already have a Potion of Fire Breath, one can be found amongst the crates at the entrance-way camp, next to &lt;a href=\"Ladle\"&gt;Ladle&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnconfirmed.\nIf the player has &lt;a href=\"Keherrem%27s%20Badge\"&gt;Keherrem's Badge&lt;/a&gt;, they can show it to her to prove that they are part of the Shining Crusade but she will inform them that access to the Warrens is restricted to higher-ranking members of the Crusade; that token is insufficient proof to gain access.\nChapter Warning.\nOnce the party enters the Warrens, they can lock themselves out of visiting many previous locations, such as &lt;a href=\"Dragonspear%20Castle%20Exterior\"&gt;Dragonspear Castle Exterior&lt;/a&gt;, since the Warrens may trigger the shift to the finale of Chapter Ten."}

She will know if the party obtained the &lt;a href=\"Light%20Gem\"&gt;Light Gem&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Goldander%20Blackenrock\"&gt;Goldander Blackenrock&lt;/a&gt; by doing the good deed of destroying the &lt;a href=\"Balor%20%28Underdark%29\"&gt;Balor (Underdark)&lt;/a&gt;, and she'll also know if it was obtained in other fashion, such as being stolen. If it was obtained in an underhanded fashion, then the dragon will make known her displeasure and say:\n\"\"You have come here through trickery, without granting the wishes of Goldander Blackenrock. He and his people will fall to the balor they unearthed because of it.\"\nIf any murders of the Svirfneblin gnomes have occurred, she will also know this and likely say:\n\"You committed pointless murder in your travels, leaving Therndle with no son, and you used trickery to get here without helping Goldander Blackenrock. If they are not dead now, they soon will be. You are vile in many ways, but I have need of you. I also know that you have need of me.\" \nFurther dialogue will continue, as she explains her purpose, and may answer a question or two. She knows of Bhodi and Irenicus. but eventually will inform the party that she requires a task be performed. Adlaon explains:\nIf you agree to do the task, Adalon will give instructions, and explain how her powerful magic will make the party appear as drow. She also gives a plausible back story for you to adopt, instructing the party to pretend they are from the drow city of Ched Nasad. Gorion's Ward should use the common name \"Veldrin\". In this manner and using subterfuge, the party is to find her eggs, and safely return them to her. In return she shall assist in leaving the Underdark and give a worthy item from her hoard as an extra reward.\nIf the party refuses, then finding a way out of the Underdark can only be accomplished by other means. The party has no idea how to do that, if it is even possible, and must figure it out on their own. No clues are provided in the game about leaving the Underdark without Adalon's help.\nThe most optimal way of leaving the Underdark is to undertake the quest to retrieve Adalon's Dragon Eggs. Unless the party is granted an illusory disguise to \"appear\" as, \"speak\" as, and \"understand\" the drow language, then there is no really ideal method to leave the Underdark.\nIt will also be impossible to enter the city of Ust Natha unless the party is disguised to appear as drow. Even if the party has a drow party member such as &lt;a href=\"Viconia%20DeVir\"&gt;Viconia DeVir&lt;/a&gt;, that won't be enough to allow entry. In practical terms, the game saga is designed to encourage the party pursue the Dragon Egg quest. There really is no good game playing reason to try and figure out a way to get out of it, as the rewards (especially Experience points) for the quest are substantial, plus there is more adventuring, and over all immersive play opportunity. \nHowever, there are two ways to avoid the Dragon Egg quest and to depart the Underdark, if the player is bent on doing that:\nIf the party has indeed managed to secure Adalon's eggs, and is ready to leave the Underdark, then return to her lair. A reward will be given, and then she'll eventually change to a more appropriate form as a humanoid and teleport the party and herself to an area close to the exit gate and the &lt;a href=\"Drow%20gate%20guardians\"&gt;Drow gate guardians&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Kuo%20Toa%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Western Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, assist with a spell cast, and then take her leave. As promised, she has broken the ward on the exit gate, but the party will still need to battle through the guardians, although she will cast a spell to weaken the defenders.\nIt's possible to kill Adalon before this occurs. Perhaps the party is interested in obtaining a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20a%20Silver%20Dragon\"&gt;Blood of a Silver Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. This can be attempted in two ways. Try it in her humanoid form or do it in her Dragon form. In the human form, after she change shape and teleport you near the exit of Underdark. You should use spells like finger of death otherwise she could turn hostile and teleport. If killed this way you will get full experience for the kill, and you can freely loot her. This can is difficult to accomplish, due to timing restriction, as she will teleport away once made hostile. If the player isn't bothered by \"save scumming\", and just reloading until it is successful, well, then it can be accomplished at some point. This instant death attempt will not work with &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; installed.\nIt's also possible, though considerably more difficult, to complete the quest and still have Adalon be killed in dragon form. Through very precise timing (and some luck on saving throws), you can begin the conversation to return the eggs and reap the rewards, whilst simultaneously attacking her, perhaps with by an instant-kill spells (such as Finger of Death). This doesn't provide any other benefits to the method described above, and you do not get teleported to the exit of the Underdark. The instant death attempt will not work with &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; installed.\nCertainly, a full-on battle with the Silver Dragon may provide a way for an evil party to test their mettle.\nFighting Adalon.\nShould the party instigate an attack on Adalon, or if Adalon herself initiates hostilities the following actions will occur:\nIn between these events, Adalon will engage in physical combat with any party member in range using her melee attack.\nExpect that the closest party members will be exposed to Dragon Fear, Remove Magic, and dragon &lt;a href=\"Wing%20buffet\"&gt;Wing buffet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll dragons have a specific type of breath attack, and the silver dragon is no exception. However, Adalon has two varieties of breath weapon, one which inflicts cold damage, and the other a paralyzing breath that actually applies a &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; effect. Saving throws will apply to these for half damage and to negate the status effects, but magic resistance and spell level immunity protection like &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt; offer no protection.\nDuring the battle she will attempt several offensive damage and or disabling spells depending on target opportunities, such as &lt;a href=\"Silence%2C%2015%27%20Radius\"&gt;Silence, 15' Radius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Hold Person&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt; and a few others. \nParty reaction to fighting Adalon.\nSeveral good-aligned party members will take exception to siding with the Lesser Demon Lord in the final stages of the &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt;'s ritual. They will either become hostile to the PC or just leave the party forever.\nHowever, this is not the case if the party attacks Adalon (which seems like an oversight). For example, while &lt;a href=\"Keldorn%20Firecam\"&gt;Keldorn Firecam&lt;/a&gt; will fight the party if siding with the Lesser Demon Lord, he won't have a reaction if the party attacks Adalon, and will carry on as normal.\nThe only exception to this is &lt;a href=\"Rasaad%20yn%20Bashir\"&gt;Rasaad yn Bashir&lt;/a&gt;. He will leave the party permanently if Adalon is attacked, so plan accordingly.\nAchievements.\nSilver Dragon Slayer.\nSlew the silver dragon, Adalon.\nMod Content.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod installed and the \"Smarter Dragons\" component, Adalon has some revisions which are responsive to the game difficulty settings. Adalon has all the immunities and powers of the unmodified dragon, with the following additional changes:\nImmunities in addition to the unmodified dragon version:\nAdalon has an opening Spell Sequencer that applies &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Fear\"&gt;Dragon Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, which is uninterruptible and takes only 1 second to deploy. All party members in range not protected from fear must make a saving throw or possibly suffer &lt;a href=\"panic\"&gt;panic&lt;/a&gt;. Adalon also has &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; already applied without the need for casting it.\n&lt;a href=\"Adalon%27s%20Blood\"&gt;Adalon's Blood&lt;/a&gt; Mod is available to bargain with the Silver Dragon to get some of her blood. This blood can be used to resolve the &lt;a href=\"Finish%20the%20leather%20armor%20begun%20by%20Rejiek%20Hidesman\"&gt;Finish the leather armor begun by Rejiek Hidesman&lt;/a&gt; quest. Instead of trying to slay her for the blood, you can convince her to give you some of her own Silver Dragon's Blood voluntarily - if you do a task for her."}

See Mod content below for exceptions.\nThese golems possess the innate ability to create a &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Cloud\"&gt;Gas Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, which causes poison damage. See the link for details.\nIn battle, these blundering constructs rush toward the nearest detected enemy and begin trying to smash it with their crushing fists. After a few rounds, the golem will discharge a gas cloud over itself. The golem can do this periodically as long as it is still functional.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod and the installation of the \"\"AI Enhancement's\" component improves many aspects of creatures encountered in the game. In regards to golems, the mod implements the following:\nImproved Golems (BG2, BG2EE, BGT/EET)&lt;br&gt;\nThis component doesn't really make golems smarter (they're supposed to be stupid) But it streamlines their scripts a bit, gives their weapons a sensible range, makes them immune to \"Lower Resistance\" and to poison, and tries to prevent situations where golems get stuck behind barricades. It also fixes an animation glitch in the Iron Golem animation - this hopefully makes Adamantite golems a bit prettier when they attack and blow clouds.\nAdamantite golems are immune to the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt; spells.&lt;br&gt;\nIf you damage an iron golem, and then decide to back away and rest somewhere, to continue the fight later, the golem will be restored to full health.&lt;br&gt;\nThe golem has a advanced script allowing better targeting and tactical behavior. It will also apply its Gas Cloud at least every three rounds of combat, and if it is dispersed by a &lt;a href=\"Zone%20of%20Sweet%20Air\"&gt;Zone of Sweet Air&lt;/a&gt; effect.&lt;br&gt;\nThe golem will do a better job of chasing down PC party members attacking from afar, as long as it can reach them via movement. It will follow and hunt down attackers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; Mod adds a necessary lootable component to Adamantite golems, so that the player can start amassing enough material in order to build its own \"lesser Adamantite Golem\", \"Adamantite Golem\", \"Greater Adamantite Golem or \"Perfect Adamantite Golem\". \nThis mod also replaces the golem's &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Cloud\"&gt;Gas Cloud&lt;/a&gt; ability with a new mod-only ability called \"Trample\":\nTrample&lt;br&gt;\nRange: 0&lt;br&gt;\nDuration: Instant&lt;br&gt;\nArea of Effect: 1 creature&lt;br&gt;\nSaving Throw: Special&lt;br&gt;\nBecause of the golem's huge size and weight, it can literally run over opponents that are smaller than itself. The trample ability deals 8d10+30 points of crushing damage and stuns the target for one round. A successful Saving Throw vs. Death at -4 can reduce damage to half and prevent the stun effect. Huge creatures, like dragons or giants, are not affected."}

As soon as this dialogue is finished the fight will start. Aec'Letec will spawn in the center of the red circle, and there are a number of Cult Guard standing passively around the outside.\nAbilities.\nAs a denizen of the lower planes, Aec'Letec has a high Magic Resistance, making it difficult to harm it with spells. Aec'Letec is also immune to normal weapons, immune to fire, electricity, poison and resistant to cold. It is also immune to most mind-affecting spells and hold.\nAec'Letec can avoid death by taking over the bodies of its worshipers. If it is killed while any of the six &lt;a href=\"Cult%20Guard\"&gt;Cult Guard&lt;/a&gt;s are still alive, it will re-incarnate at full health from the body of a Cult Guard and the fight will continue until no Cult Guards are left alive. The priority therefore is to kill the cult guards before focusing on the demon.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Touch\"&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/a&gt;.\nAec'Letec will frequently cast this spell on anything that comes into touch spell range. It heals the demon and increases its survivability considerably when anything other than undead minions attack it.\nDeath Gaze Attack.\nAec'Letec will cast a spell on your characters which first acts like a &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person\"&gt;Hold Person&lt;/a&gt; spell, and will also add a debuff named 'Dying', which will kill the affected character in 30 seconds, spawning a hostile &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghast&lt;/a&gt; in its place. This can be countered in a number of ways, such as:\n1: Dispel Magic.\nThe easiest way is by use of the 3rd-level &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; spell Dispel Magic. &lt;a href=\"Yeslick%20Orothiar\"&gt;Yeslick&lt;/a&gt; is good here for his special innate ability to cast Dispel Magic. In the , &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; paladins also can gain innate, rapid and highly effective daily uses of Dispel Magic. Using &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Dispelling\"&gt;arrows of dispelling&lt;/a&gt; by having one party member shoot another also works. Regardless of delivery, however, it will also dispel any buffs you might have cast.\n2: &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Mirrored%20Eyes\"&gt;Potion of Mirrored Eyes&lt;/a&gt;.\nPotion of Mirrored Eyes is confirmed to make characters immune to Aec'Letec's Death Gaze. This will prevent said character from turning into a ghast for the duration of the potion. The &lt;a href=\"Ulgoth%27s%20Beard%20Inn\"&gt;Ulgoth's Beard Inn&lt;/a&gt; sells them, as well as &lt;a href=\"Sorcerous%20Sundries\"&gt;Sorcerous Sundries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;East Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the potion does not dispel the Death Gaze attack, so consuming one after a character has been affected by it will do nothing.\n3: Mercy Killing.\n\"[Confirmation Needed]\"Another, and less preferable, way to prevent the permanent death of a character affected by the gaze is to kill the character before they turn into a ghast. It is not advisable to do this if the protagonist is the recipient of said gaze, for obvious reasons.\n4: Buffing with spells and equipment before the battle\nProtection from Evil, Chant, Luck, etc and any other spell that increases your saving throw can give you a decent chance of coming out unaffected. If you have a scroll of Protection from Evil in 10 Radius, this is a good time to use it.\nStrategy.\nParty Configuration.\nYou will probably want at least two clerics or two mages, or one cleric and one mage in order to deal with his gaze attack. Key spells to have memorized are &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; (Level 3 wizard/cleric), &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt; and some form of &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Fear\"&gt;Remove Fear&lt;/a&gt;. The aforementioned potions of Mirrored Eyes help a lot as well. Just protect fully your vanguard fighters, haste everyone and go get in the basement with mass invisibility. You can move before the talk, attack the bottom green robe guy, all enemies head there for easy nuking. Dialogue triggers as well after a few blows get exchanged, just don't kill the talker too fast. With a bunch of enemies clustered near one well armored invulnerable to magic fighter its scorched earth time.\nDistracting Aec'Letec.\nSummoned Skeletons are very good at keeping his attention (and the occasional gaze attack) away from your valuable party members. If he lands a gaze on any target, it will, after a few seconds, dismember and turn into an undead ghast, preventing any form of resurrection, so it's best to let a summoned creature die instead of them.\nBy summoning undead creatures directly on top of Aec'Letec, then dispelling magic whenever he casts his gaze on a party member, the characters in the party should be free to move around the outside of the circle killing the Cult Guards (500 XP each). If you run out of &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s to summon, casting &lt;a href=\"Otiluke%27s%20Resilient%20Sphere\"&gt;Otiluke's Resilient Sphere&lt;/a&gt; on the target he is attacking can keep him occupied for a while. Once all the Cult Guards are dead, it is a simple matter of finishing off Aec'Letec for good.\nGameplay (community).\nAlternative strategy.\nSend down one of your fighters to initiate the conversation with Tracea Carol. Afterwards send your fighter back up and Tracea Carol will follow you upstairs. This fight should not be a problem. Now all the Cult Guards need to die first. By having a few invisible mages, one can kill all the Cult Guards with fireballs, skull traps or similar damaging spells or potions from each corner avoiding attacks from Aec'Letec which will not be able to see you. Once all the Cult Guards are dead, Aec'Letec will not be able to respawn. Be aware that anti-hold spells, items, potions, etc., such as Edventar's Gift do NOT render the Death Gaze Attack ineffective. You will avoid the hold but will still suffer the Death debuff. "}

She is the final companion available before chapter two, as further companions will require going through &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Slums\"&gt;The Slums&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAerie is from the folk of the &lt;a href=\"Avariel\"&gt;Avariel&lt;/a&gt;, a race of winged elves, and was abducted by slavers when she was young, who sold her to a circus where she was put in a tiny cage. The terrible living conditions damaged her wings so badly, that they had to be cut off and no longer being of use to the circus, she was tossed aside. &lt;a href=\"Quayle\"&gt;Quayle&lt;/a&gt; took pity on her and attended to her wounds, but the damage turned out to be irreparable. He taught her of &lt;a href=\"Baervan%20Wildwanderer\"&gt;Baervan Wildwanderer&lt;/a&gt; and the two of them are still with the circus.\nPersonality.\nAerie is a sweet and timid young woman. She is idealistic through and through but also rather shy and unsure. Deeply traumatized by being abducted, imprisoned and losing her ability to fly, she is driven by the need to help others the best she can and often overexerts herself in the process. She hasn't seen much of the world yet, but she is a very quick learner and will soon be apt at dealing with any challenge thrown at her.\nRelationships.\nRomance.\nMale &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"halfling\"&gt;halfling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;s can &lt;a href=\"romance\"&gt;romance&lt;/a&gt; Aerie.

Each contact exposes the target to the potentially damaging 3d6 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis spell can damage friendly party members should they cross the jet.\nTactical positioning from the caster can achieve clever fire damage dealing opportunities to groups of enemy creatures through maneuvering the caster and exposing multiple creatures to the jet.

Upon detection of an enemy the Mephit will instantly apply a &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt; spell effect, that is essentially the same as the wizard spell. This will improve armor class and saving throws. \nThe mephit will also launch the \"Breathes Grit\" attack, which can't be blocked by any type of protection except &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and it deals a paltry 1d6 damage and has an area of effect similar to a &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt;. The unmodified game Air Mephit can only attempt this innate ability attack every 5 rounds after the initial grit launch, meaning that it will likely be dead well before its second attempt. A Mephit is really only a threat in large numbers, and maybe slightly worse if part of a mixed variety of them.\nThe Air Mephit have no magic, physical damage or elemental resistance.

He is determined and dutiful and not afraid to die for the greater good. But he\u00b4s\u00a0also rather naive and sees the world in only black and white. Furthermore, he is a gentleman and will make sure people behave when women are around.\n\"Baldur's Gate\".\nOn a quest to fight the bandits and put an end to their operations, Ajantis has come to the region to prove his worth to the Order, hoping it will earn him knighthood.\nRecruitment.\nAjantis is available to be recruited for the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20One\"&gt;Chapter One&lt;/a&gt; on.

He will either be level 2, 4 or 6.\nHe has a rather poor skill set, as the Bastard Sword that he initially specialized in, and comes equipped with, is a one-handed weapon.

On the third floor you will be hailed by one of the three daughters. They will get suspicious of you and subsequently fighting will break out. The three items needed for the quest are stored away in an unlocked vanity in one of the bedrooms. Nobody else in the house will have noticed your violent slaughter of the wizards so you can leave undisturbed.\nIt is possible to retrieve the items without any killing if you send in somebody using &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; to pick them up. There is nobody in the room where the items are stored, so you can easily grab them and sneak out again without being spotted. &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; makes the heist even simpler since there is no need to recast it after collecting the goods. Avoiding conflict is useful if you want to avoid angering &lt;a href=\"Shandalar\"&gt;Shandalar&lt;/a&gt; by killing his daughters.\nIn , if your thief is discovered, you can still complete the quest with only a loss of one &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; point. Leave all extra party members outside the Estate. Take your thief and attempt to bypass the sisters' conversation. If that fails and your &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; doesn't work, allow the combat but do not engage the sisters. Immediately move to the desk and loot it. Then immediately proceed downstairs and exit the Estate. Your party members will attack and kill the sisters, regardless of their alignment. Immediately exit the map to avoid the &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist\"&gt;Flaming Fist&lt;/a&gt; and loss of party members with good &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;Alignment&lt;/a&gt;. Come back to the map and loot.\nEither way, return to the thieves' guild and speak to Alatos again. Alatos will rebuke you if you killed the sisters and use it for justification as &lt;a href=\"Resar\"&gt;Resar&lt;/a&gt; removes the items and attacks you for being a loose end. Only Resar will become hostile, as long as you don't hurt any of the thieves during the fighting, and he can be killed without any loss of reputation within the guild."}

His stats are identical to that of a generic unnamed Lich. This Lich is ready to seek revenge on his captors, but instead of being grateful to you for freeing him, he regards you as unworthy pieces of meat and becomes hostile.\nGameplay.\nFree this creature by manipulating the fourth facet on the soul entrapment device. Where \"fourth facet\" corresponds to a west to east (or left to right) orientation if facing the device.\nOnce the lich is freed and materializes nearby the party member who activated the release on the Soul Trap Device, some dialogue will be said by the creature. Regardless of what the party does, the lich regards all as target for destruction, and the undead mage is clearly bent on getting revenge on the drow - after taking care of player's party first.\nThe player's journal will update with the following:\nIf not immediately destroyed in some manner, the lich will instantly release a series of self-protective magics including, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter that, expect a &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; to assist with dispelling illusions, then possibly a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;. If able, the Lich will then attempt a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, and then may try to use a prepared Spell Trigger with &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; and possibly some Symbol spells.\nThe Lich has another emergency self-protective application of &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; if needed during the battle.\nAny targets in range during the encounter may be attacked with various disabling spells, instant death spells like &lt;a href=\"Wail%20of%20the%20Banshee\"&gt;Wail of the Banshee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, and also area offensive damage spells like &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lich can summon a &lt;a href=\"Efreeti\"&gt;Efreeti&lt;/a&gt; to help as well.\nNot all the spells listed in the InfoBox are scripted for use. The undead wizard won't try a &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20Swarm\"&gt;Meteor Swarm&lt;/a&gt;, despite being in memory.\nSee the InfoBox for a summary of the lich's abilities and immunities.\nAlchra Diagott is able to cast most, but not all, of the memorized spells shown in the InfoBox. The unmodified script for this creature does not attempt to take down opponent spell protections except via Remove magic. It doesn't use Breach or Pierce magic for example. The script focuses on a few preparatory buffs and then goes on the offensive with various spells. A party member could conceivably protect self from magical and elemental damage and a spell level protection such as &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and engage the Lich with melee and survive the encounter and slay the lich - one on one.\nPotential bug.\nThis creature is only an 11th level conjurer. This is quite low for a lich in this game saga, or in Dungeons and Dragons. It will influence the power of its spell casts to lower than typically found in the rest of the game regarding a lich's assigned experience levels. This may or may not be on purpose - perhaps to help with difficulty for first time or occasional players.\nMod Content.\nThe Lich's opening self-protective magics may include &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blade\"&gt;Energy Blade&lt;/a&gt; (its scripted early attack weapon), &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Geater Spell Deflection\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI: Divination&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Dispelling Screen\" with SR), &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Acid%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Protection From Acid (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Magic Energy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe innate lich ability to radiate a \"Fear Aura\" will now deploy around the lich. Immediate support from a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; will be summoned as well.\nExpect a Timestop after the lich has initiated the defensive spell triggers. During the Timestop it may hit the party with several necromantic spells, like &lt;a href=\"Wail%20of%20the%20Banshee\"&gt;Wail of the Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word Kill&lt;/a&gt;. If HLA's are used, perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt; will be cast.\nAlchra Diagott has a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; prepared for scripted use.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod will change the lich's spellbook to the SR versions.

{"id": "27217", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27217", "title": "Alhoon", "text": "An Alhoon is a unique undead &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt;. The term is used to describe all outcasts from mind flayer societies who had defied the ruling Elder Brains to achieve a limited form of lichdom. Only the most powerful mind flayer mages could achieve true lichdom and were known as illithiliches.\nAlhoons combined powerful wizardry and sorcery with their innate &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt;. The lore about the Alhoon strongly suggests that they are formidable foes, however, the in-game version is configured to be well below those expectations and more akin to a Ulitharid who can get up a few protection spell buffs, but only once. So, fear not if you are a new player - they aren't really much tougher than a standard mind flayer.\nGameplay.\nThe Alhoon's covered on this page share the same AI scripting, and mostly will perform in identical fashion. There may be different combat log displays that are triggered and or inserted by the specific Area scripts the creatures appear in.\nWhen the creature is alerted to an enemy, it will apply &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; on self (uninteruuptible).\nThe next action will be to launch a &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Blast\"&gt;Psionic Blast&lt;/a&gt;, which has a moderate Area of Effect and can expose party members clustered together to the potential &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nIf the creature manages to survive a few more rounds it will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Domination\"&gt;Psionic Domination&lt;/a&gt; at the nearest target.\nIf one of its nearby opponents is damaged below 25% of original HP, the Alhoon will try and cast a &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; arcane spell at it.\nThis creature can use its tentacle tendrils and attack in melee combat like any illithid, causing minor crushing damage and a \"Devour Brain\" effect, temporarily draining 5 &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis creature can't assess an opponent's protections and immunities and won't know if a target is immune to charm or stun. It can however tell if a target is already affected by stun, and that will alter its behavior slightly in battle.\nIn the unmodified game, the Alhoon won't be able to survive a party onslaught very long and has limited staying power. The creature isn't provided with the 100% elemental resistances that a standard Mind Flayer has, which may be an oversight, as it is supposed to be some sort of lich. Even normal weapons can strike it as well.\nMod Content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revitalizes the theme that the Alhoon is a powerful illthid creature with a potent spell casting ability. In basic terms the mod designs the creature as a lich in many respects, but with the psionic powers of a Ulitharid. If the player installs the \"Smarter Mind Flayers\" component, then the Alhoon will be at its peak potential.\nOn Hardcore and above difficulty settings the Alhoon will get additional 50% physical damage resistance (due to its alien physiology and psionics). In addition, the creature now is equipped with the &lt;a href=\"LICH.ITM\"&gt;LICH.ITM&lt;/a&gt; which gives the Alhoon the same immunities as a standard &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;. It can also &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; and is under a permanent &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; power.\nThe creature has been revised to a level 20 caster and an improved &lt;a href=\"THACO\"&gt;THACO&lt;/a&gt; of 3, and with the SCS \"Smarter Mage\" component is scripted to select spells to cast from an entire spell book repertoire, and on the higher game difficulty setting will also have mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; choices. Prepared &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; are ready to use as well.\nExpect several reactionary castings of protective spells to remain immune to magical weapons. The script knows when a spell has expired or been dispelled/breached and will renew it.\nThe Alhoon will summon help to include twin &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Efreeti\"&gt;Efreeti&lt;/a&gt; allies, and one of its HLA's is a gated &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe creature can also launch any of the innate illithid abilities discussed on the &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; article, sometimes in the same round as a spell cast. It's &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Blast\"&gt;Psionic Blast&lt;/a&gt; is the more potent Ulitharid version with a -4 saving throw penalty.\nIf the party flees the room or closes the door - then the Alhoon and any remaining illithids with it may \"Planar Travel\" across the map to the party's \"rear' areas - no one is entirely safe from being followed anywhere on the map. Because psionics.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod is installed, the Alhoon's spell choices will be the SR version.\nIf the SCS Icewind Dale spell component is installed, or the &lt;a href=\"IWDification\"&gt;IWDification&lt;/a&gt; mod, then some spells will be those versions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Brain%20Golem\"&gt;Brain Golem&lt;/a&gt; to this Alhoon's lair as well."}

Their morality is simplified down to being good, neutral or evil, while their stance toward rules boils down to being lawful, neutral or chaotic. Alignment is somewhat helpful for a person playing the tabletop RPG to stay \"in character\", but it also has a tangible reality that fictional characters themselves can leverage to gain information about others, using spells like &lt;a href=\"Know%20Alignment%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Know Alignment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Evil%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Detect Evil&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, however, beings exist that represent the spiritual embodiment of an alignment, and planes that bend people and even physics to fit one alignment. For example in the plane that embodies chaos of the purest kind, &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3ALimbo\"&gt;Limbo&lt;/a&gt;, even beings that embody pure law may become corrupted over time, and the laws of physics themselves are abolished. In the planes, alignment shapes reality, not the other way around \u2014 entire cities may shift and change plane if the alignments of its inhabitants start to collectively lean too strongly toward it. Things are not so drastic in the Prime Material plane, where the mind has a much smaller impact on hard rock.\nConcretely, alignment represents all combinations of these two axes of three values, meaning a total of nine possible alignments. The law-chaos axis is always expressed before the good-evil axis. A \"Neutral good\" character has a neutral stance as far as rules are concerned, but seeks to do good. In the \"Baldur's Gate\" series, alignment is used in gameplay to disallow equipping certain items, open or close certain dialogue paths, affect &lt;a href=\"Companions\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; reaction to the party's &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;, adapt the effects of a few spells, and other minor things.\nLawful Good.\nLawful Good is known as the \"Saintly\" or \"Crusader\" alignment. A Lawful Good character typically acts with compassion, and always with honor and a sense of duty. A Lawful Good nation would consist of a well-organized government that works for the benefit of its citizens. Lawful Good characters include righteous knights, paladins, and most dwarves. Lawful Good creatures include the noble golden dragons. Lawful Good outsiders are known as Archons.\nLawful Good characters, especially &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, may sometimes find themselves faced with the dilemma of whether to obey the law or good when the two conflict\u2014for example, upholding a sworn oath when it would lead innocents to come to harm\u2014or conflicts between two orders, such as between their religious law and the law of the local ruler.\n&lt;a href=\"%23ex\"&gt;Examples from the \"Complete Scoundrel\"&lt;/a&gt;: , and are cited as being lawful good characters.\nNeutral Good.\nNeutral Good is known as the \"Benefactor\" alignment. A Neutral Good character is guided by his or her conscience and typically acts altruistically, without regard for or against Lawful precepts such as rules or tradition. A Neutral Good character has no problems with co-operating with lawful officials, but does not feel beholden to them. In the event that doing the right thing requires the bending or breaking of rules, they do not suffer the same inner conflict that a Lawful Good character would.\n&lt;a href=\"%23ex\"&gt;Examples&lt;/a&gt; of Neutral Good characters include and . The Neutral Good outsiders are known as &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3AGuardinal\"&gt;Guardinals&lt;/a&gt;.\nChaotic Good.\nChaotic Good is known as the \"Beatific,\" \"Rebel,\" or \"Cynic\" alignment. A Chaotic Good character favors change for a greater good, disdains bureaucratic organizations that get in the way of social improvement, and places a high value on personal freedom, not only for oneself, but for others as well. They always intend to do the right thing, but their methods are generally disorganized and often out of alignment with the rest of society. They may create conflict in a team if they feel they are being pushed around, and often view extensive organization and planning as pointless, preferring to improvise.\n and are &lt;a href=\"%23ex\"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of Chaotic Good individuals. &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3ACelestial%20eladrin\"&gt;Eladrin&lt;/a&gt; are the outsider race representing Chaotic Good.\nLawful Neutral.\nThe game manual takes this text from the \"Player's Handbook\" of AD&amp;D 2, but adds one sentence and changes one of the two examples given.

For &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, this makes it a consideration towards &lt;a href=\"dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt; possibilities. In addition to the &lt;a href=\"ability%20score\"&gt;ability score&lt;/a&gt; requirements, the character must have a compatible alignment to be able to dual into a particular class.\nNo wizard kit has any alignment restrictions, though alignment does have a minor effect on their &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; selection. &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Planetar&lt;/a&gt; is for good wizards, while &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt; is for evil wizards. Those of neutral morality can choose one or the other, but not both.\nAlignment for clerics and paladins.\nAll &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s must be lawful good, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"blackguard\"&gt;blackguard&lt;/a&gt;s, who can have any evil alignment. The base &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt; class has no alignment restrictions, but all of its kits do:\nFor kitless clerics, alignment will determine which &lt;a href=\"Cleric%23Class_exclusive_items\"&gt;holy symbol&lt;/a&gt; will be obtained upon reaching level 25. For &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;, it also determines the &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20Stronghold\"&gt;Cleric Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe moral alignment of a cleric or paladin will determine the effects of &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;. Evil ones can start taking control of undead monsters with this ability as they level, while those of other alignments will instantly destroy them. Moral alignment will also affect their spell selection: &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Smite\"&gt;Holy Smite&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Word\"&gt;Holy Word&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Deva\"&gt;Summon Deva&lt;/a&gt; cannot be cast by evil clerics or blackguards, while &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Blight\"&gt;Unholy Blight&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Word\"&gt;Unholy Word&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Fallen%20Deva\"&gt;Summon Fallen Deva&lt;/a&gt; are barred from good clerics and paladins. Neutral clerics can cast all the spells.\nAlignment for Gorion's Ward.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Throne of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;\", the alignment of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; will affect the first two &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28area%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane&lt;/a&gt; challenges.

Across the series, companions' &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0tolerance ranges are determined by their moral alignment.\nEquipment.\nSome items restrict the alignment of the user by excluding certain alignment combinations. This can result in multiple alignment combinations being restricted as follows:\nRogues with the &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; can ignore these restrictions.\nAlignment changes.\nIn the first game, equipping the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Opposite%20Alignment\"&gt;Helm of Opposite Alignment&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is the only way to change anybody's alignment. In \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II&lt;/a&gt;\", certain characters can have alignment changes based on choices made."}

For further details and latest updates, recommend visiting at the mod's hosted web location.\nThis mod offers two new possibilities to consider when making the decision about whether to side with the Shadow Thieves or with Valen's Mistress. In addition to the traditional two, the player may now opt to side with a group even the paladins in the party could have no objection to... or he may opt to skip the whole decision entirely and set sail for Maztica.\nAlternatives also offers a different way to satisfy Mae Var's demand that the protagonist steal an artifact from a temple.\nIt is nearly impossible for a lawful good character to go through the game and remain completely true to his or her alignment. Siding with thieves is not a very lawful thing to do, nor is allying with undead a particularly good deed. The \"Paladin Route\" offers a third option, the ability to work for an unimpeachably good organization and eliminate two evils. The \"Assassin Route\" came about a bit later, as a result of some musing about how a character who has no real interest in either rescuing Imoen or going out of his or her way to take revenge on Irenicus might want to avoid the whole decision entirely and get the hells out of Amn. Jastey never liked the concept of stealing prized artifacts from temples while running errands for Mae Var, so she created a work-around for that, as well. The latter component is also incorporated in Jastey's Ajantis mod, so Ajantis is installed, the \"Temple Thievery Alternative\" component will not be installed.\nBoth new options begin after Valen and Brus make their traditional appearances. To begin the \"Paladin Route,\" visit the Government District after speaking with Brus. To begin the \"Assassin Route,\" go to the Slums, where a garishly dressed nobleman by the name of Malficus will make an attractive offer. He is standing outside the Copper Coronet, not far from the road that leads to the southern entrance to the Slums.\nOnce the protagonist has committed to performing the first task of the \"Paladin Route,\" all other paths are disabled, but it is possible to do two of the three tasks Malficus sets before you and then change sides.\nTo access the \"Temple Thievery Alternative\" options, speak to people in the temple about your concerns.\nSUGGESTIONS: When one deals with dishonorable people, some treachery and double-dealing is only to be expected. Also, when embarking on a new venture, it is always advisable to tie up loose ends first. Thieves, especially, or those wishing to get to know Renal Bloodscalp a little better or recruit a certain Red Wizard, would be well advised to complete all thieves' guild tasks prior to going to the Five Flagons in or making any final arrangements with Malficus. The quest givers of both routes will warn you when you are approaching the point of no return.\nFor more information see the link."}

She originally appears as a well-intended woman when the protagonist arrives in &lt;a href=\"Saradush\"&gt;Saradush&lt;/a&gt;, a city under siege by &lt;a href=\"Yaga-Shura\"&gt;Yaga-Shura&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful and seemingly invincible &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nShe and a group of civilians are trying to gain an audience with &lt;a href=\"Gromnir%20Il-Khan\"&gt;Gromnir Il-Khan&lt;/a&gt;, a Bhaalspawn Half-orc who is a veteran general and has locked himself up in the castle. The guards at the door refuse this audience and will turn hostile towards the party and the civilians.\nMelissan recognizes &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; as a child of Bhaal, as she has met many Bhaalspawn during her journeys to bring them to Saradush, for an unknown reason. She will ask you to help defend the city and defeat Yaga-Shura before the walls are breached. Your first task is that you must find a way into the castle and convince Gromnir to stop his soldiers from making the situation worse than it already is. After infiltrating the castle and going to the council chamber, the paranoid Gromnir accuses Melissan of being in league with the Five and bringing as many Bhaalspawn as possible to Saradush, not as a sanctuary, but to make the killing of rival Bhaalspawn as easy as possible for the alliance of the five most powerful Bhaalspawn. Gromnir also believes that the party of Gorion's Ward are assassins sent by Melissan to kill him, which makes it impossible to avoid bloodshed.\nNow you have dealt with Gromnir, you must find a way to defeat Yaga-Shura before he has breached the city gates. After you have obtained the means to kill Yaga-Shura, the walls of Saradush are breached and you must defeat him. After he is defeated, Mellisan appears once more and tells you that she will meet you in &lt;a href=\"Amkethran\"&gt;Amkethran&lt;/a&gt;, where she will acquire the locations of another two Bhaalspawn, who are members of the Five. However, when you arrive there, she has moved on, but a local head of the monastery, &lt;a href=\"Balthazar\"&gt;Balthazar&lt;/a&gt;, will give you the locations.\nWhen the last member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Five\"&gt;The Five&lt;/a&gt; is killed, &lt;a href=\"Solar\"&gt;Solar&lt;/a&gt; will summon Melissan to the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28area%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane&lt;/a&gt;. Then you will find out that she is in fact Amelyssan the Blackhearted, a chaotic evil high priestess of Bhaal and Deathstalker and that she was the most trusted follower of &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;. She is the only one who has access to his essence of his many children. As more children lost their lives, the more essence she gained and the more powerful she became. She has deceived the Five with false promises of becoming powerful servants of Bhaal, used Gorion's Ward to do her dirty job of killing the Five for her, and she has deceived all children of Bhaal who were brought to Saradush, which was not a sanctuary, but in fact a deathtrap when Yaga-Shura started to siege this city. This means that Gromnir Il-Khan's paranoid ideas were true after all.\nBut she betrayed Bhaal as well, as she refuses to begin the rituals required to resurrect him, only to become a goddess of the portfolio of murder herself. She only wants to kill you for your essence, as you turned out to be the most powerful Bhaalspawn of them all. After overcoming the challenge of The Ravager, you must use the teleporter. You will be transported to the actual &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Throne of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;, which is the start of the &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%2010\"&gt;final chapter&lt;/a&gt;. You will fight Amelyssan, who has started absorbing Bhaal's essence, which has made her very powerful. The battle consists of four battles with Melissan, with three fights with, in order, the Prince of Elemental Air, three Greater Air Elementals, and two Vampiric Mists, then a battle with two Frost Salamanders, the Prince of Ice Elementals, and a couple Greater Ice Elementals, then a battle with a lot of demons, interspersed within. You cannot rest there through normal means.\nThe final battle with Amelyssan.\nAmelyssan is the final boss of the original Baldur's Gate saga. In &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%2010\"&gt;the final chapter&lt;/a&gt;, the party finally faces Amelyssan at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Throne%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;The Throne of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Forge\"&gt;Mana Forge&lt;/a&gt; in the center of it.\nTips for fight.\nThis fight is considered the hardest in the saga. Melissan has four stages, all elemental and magical resistances, 50% physical damage reduction, immunity to the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; spell, and summons several enemies. Combined with the inability to rest between phases, it is highly advised to have buffs applied and stock up on healing items before entering The Throne of Bhaal. \nOne of options to win is using a lot of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt; packed in a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; and then cast level 2+ spells (like &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull trap&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Wilting&lt;/a&gt;). Along this path you need at least 12 lower resistance. Also, you can use &lt;a href=\"Project%20Image\"&gt;Project Image&lt;/a&gt;, then use &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; on image and cast lower resistance from image.

{"id": "6152", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6152", "title": "Amkethran", "text": "Amkethran is a village in the Calim Desert, &lt;a href=\"Calimshan\"&gt;Calimshan&lt;/a&gt;. It was unofficially led by &lt;a href=\"Balthazar\"&gt;Balthazar&lt;/a&gt; and his monks. This area is accessible when &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%209\"&gt;Chapter 9&lt;/a&gt; is started.\nBackstory.\nAmkethran is built on a plateau of sand and rock, and is a village in very bad shape, the inhabitants can't survive without the help of the smugglers and the monastery. Its inhabitants live in poverty and have to contend with Balthazar's mercenaries residing there and doing whatever they please.\nLayout.\nThe largest structure in Amkethran is a fortified monastery. The village also has two caves, one used as the graveyard, and the other utilized by smugglers (which seem to be tolerated as an important part of Amkethran's supply chain - according to Zakhee the local Innkeeper). A &lt;a href=\"The%20Zephir\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt; is the only official drinking and eating establishment, which also sells armaments and a few other goods. &lt;a href=\"Kerrick%27s%20Smithy%20and%20Arcana%20Archives%20II\"&gt;Kerrick's Smithy and Arcana Archives II&lt;/a&gt; is located above the inn. There is an unusual sundial apparatus as well, up on the raised terraces of the homes/shops. Shepards and commoners come and go in the village. Numerous mercenaries are also present, hired by someone, and they strut about the streets and seem to have pushed aside the local villager's usual peaceful existence. One place of worship is established in the village, a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Waukeen%20%28Amkethran%29\"&gt;Temple of Waukeen (Amkethran)&lt;/a&gt;. \nExploring Amkethran (a walkthrough/gameplay option).\nCheck-in with Balthazar.\nUpon entering Amkethran, you can speak with &lt;a href=\"Balthazar\"&gt;Balthazar&lt;/a&gt; first, a short conversation all told. After the dialogue, your &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;World Map&lt;/a&gt; will be updated and show the locations of two new areas you can travel to including &lt;a href=\"Abazigal%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Abazigal's Lair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Enclave\"&gt;Sendai's Enclave&lt;/a&gt;.\nStart exploring.\nthe Party may now explore the village and take in the locale's offerings and layout. Here is a suggested order of what to visit, based on story flow and information gleaned to clarify the village's offerings and current situation of the inhabitants. Note: You don't have to do this as described below, and are free to explore in any order or path as you desire - it is just one suggested \"play-tested\" path only:\nThe Cave of the Dead.\nLook at your overview Map of Amekethran, and move your party towards the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Cave of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. You'll soon spot a boy (labelled \"Boy\") and speak with him. He says: \"You don't wanna go in that cavern. That's where we bury our dead, but now it's full of really bad creatures, my momma says\". There will be more dialogue, and eventually you will receive a quest for your journal called &lt;a href=\"The%20Graveyard%20Lich\"&gt;The Graveyard Lich&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, some stranger arrived in the village and has been heard to claim that undead were looking for him, and that a girl that was with him got sick as well. Also, the boy claims that Balthazar won't do anything about it, and just sealed the cavern. The boy then hurries off. For the moment, press on with your exploration of the village. \nNext, speak with the monk guard who is nearby the boy (labelled \"Monk\"). The Monk says: \"This cavern is sealed off by order of Balthazar. I do not suggest you enter\". Dialogue will continue, and you will learn that there are disturbing reports of dead having risen, and powerful creatures awoken inside. He says they do not know why. You may continue to try and get more information from the monk, but he basically makes known that he is not at liberty to go into details and is here to warn the villagers about the cavern. Eventually the monk says he doesn't like what you are implying and to go away and mind your own affairs.\nVillage Mayor's dilemma.\nNow head a little further south where you can see a fat man (the village mayor), a woman and two armor clad mercenary types. As you near, a woman named \"&lt;a href=\"Asana%20Haraad\"&gt;Asana Haraad&lt;/a&gt;\" speaks aloud and you overhear her saying \"\"Please, please spare me... I beg you\"!\". \"The male &lt;a href=\"Mercenary%20%28Balthazar%29\"&gt;Mercenary (Balthazar)&lt;/a&gt; replies to her \"\"Thieving Wench! Begging won't save you now!\". The female mercenary then interjects \"We will make a harsh example of you, and maybe others will think twice before they steal from us!\"\" The village Mayor named \"&lt;a href=\"Omar%20Haraad\"&gt;Omar Haraad&lt;/a&gt;\" speaks up and says \"Please, my daughter meant no harm. Her motives were pure, even if her actions were wrong\". More accusations and dialogue continue between the mercenaries and the mayor and daughter, concluding with a decision to punish Asana by summary execution for thievery. \nEventually the Mayor asks you to intervene, explaining that Asana was wrong to steal to obtain gold, but it was for purchasing food to feed the starving children villagers - and that she did not deserve to be killed for that. You may choose to help or let Asana be punished by death. If you decide to assist her, even if it is not an overt hostile action, the mercenaries will have little patience for your interference, and attack you. Should you intervene and put down the mercenaries, the mayor and Asana will express gratitude, and you gain +1 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Montolio%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;Montolio's Cloak&lt;/a&gt;, 500 GP and each party member 5,000 XP as a reward. If you do not intervene, you lose 1 reputation point after Asana is executed in cold blood in the street. \nSeemon Havarian and the Mercenaries.\nHead due south and make your way past a small collection of villagers and you'll see some more mercenaries. Again, you'll overhear one that is addressing your old 'friend' &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; (whom you owe a debt of pain to). The mercenary proclaims, \"\"So you thought your smugglers could sell our stolen gear and get away with it, eh, Esamon?\", and a different mercenary then says \"Or should we just call you Saemon? We know all about your shady reputation, Saemon Havarian!\". Saemon then replies \"Er, let's not do anything hasty, gentlemen. As you know, I could not have been involved, as I have only recently returned to Amekethran...\"\". \nThe verbal sparring goes back and forth, when Saemon spots your arrival, and somehow, is able to insinuate that your party is actually in possession of their stolen gear. The mercenaries focus their attention on you and eventually blame you for having the gear. Saemon skillfully is able to initiate a teleport and escape the fix he is in, and you are left facing some hostile mercenaries, bent on getting \"their stolen\" gear back. Your old 'friend' has stabbed you in the back again. \nPriest of Waukeen vs. Monastery Monk.\nAfter that little skirmish, your party should just continue south, until you happen upon a Priest of Waukeen named &lt;a href=\"Chyil\"&gt;Chyil&lt;/a&gt; and one of the Monastery Monks. The priest can be overheard in a heated exchange, he says \"\"Your Monastery once cared for this town. But under Balthazar, you have abandoned us. The people are starving, and your master does nothing!\". The Monk replies \"Balthazar is concerned with other matters, old man\". Livid, the Priest of Waukeen shouts \"BAH! He is gathering mercenaries and wizards for an army! How is this more important than bringing in food for the starving children?\". The argument continues, with the Priest demanding an audience with Balthazar, and the Monk refusing, then telling the Priest \"You dare attack me old man? Your death shall be quick and painful!\". \nThe priest and Monk begin to square off for a fight. If you don't step in and distract, attack or attempt to subdue the Monk, then the Priest will likely be killed. Assuming you do something, then suddenly a Mage teleports in and immediately announces \"Cease this at once! You dare raise your hand to an emissary of the Monastery?\"\". If you back off, the Mage explains that he will let you off with a warning if you respect Balthazar's Monks. The Mage and Monk both teleport away from the scene. The Priest of Waukeen thanks you, then apologizes for losing his temper, but also explains his frustration and the fact that his temple has spent all its coin feeding the poor. You can leave him or offer 1,000 gold to the Temple. If you do make a donation, the Priest expresses his profound thanks. The party gains +1 reputation, each party member gains 3,000 XP, and he hands you the &lt;a href=\"Oaken%20Ring\"&gt;Oaken Ring&lt;/a&gt; as a reward.\nVisit the Temple of Waukeen.\nIf you wish to, enter the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Waukeen%20%28Amkethran%29\"&gt;Temple of Waukeen (Amkethran)&lt;/a&gt;. The Priest within has the usual temple services available, including the buying and selling of goods (at a good rate as well). There are a few decent potions and a scroll and potion storage containers. The priest also will tell you his opinions and what he knows about Balthazar, Melissan, Sendai and Abazigal if you ask about each, furnishing information you will not have heard so far in your adventures.\nCaptain Erelon trains his Archers.\nNext to the Temple, slightly northwest, is a gathering of a different type of Mercenary, under the command of a &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Erelon\"&gt;Captain Erelon&lt;/a&gt;. He appears to be overseeing a drill for five mercenary archers. The captain occasionally summons a creature for the Archers to aim for and slay (such as an Umberhulk). If you initiate talk with the captain, he impatiently says \"Can't you see I'm busy? My archers need to stay in top form!\". If you keep interrupting Captain Erelon again, or say the wrong thing, the entire group will become hostile, and start their target practice on you and the party. \nGo to the Inn.\nPerhaps it's time for some rest and refreshment. See what is happening in the village's only Inn &lt;a href=\"The%20Zephir\"&gt;The Zephir&lt;/a&gt;."}

Another two are assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20City%20Gates\"&gt;Athkatla City Gates&lt;/a&gt; (AMNG2.cre and AESOLD.cre)\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Government\"&gt;Athkatla Government&lt;/a&gt; district there are many. One has in interaction with a beggar (GGUARD01.cre) and party dialogue.\nAmnian soldiers attacked and or killed will impose a severe reputation penalty on the party. Stealing items from the soldiers is possible, but getting caught will also expose the would-be thief to a hostile encounter. This can spiral out of control if the guard calls for help (which they are scripted to do). Beware the repercussions of these actions.\nBugs.\nAmnian soldiers are assigned grandmastery in Large Sword, but wield Spears. Not only do they get no bonuses from this, but actually have a THAC0 penalty.\nVarious Soldiers with dialogue.\nThe Amnian soldier that appears in the Promenade is one of only several Soldiers with any significant dialogue. if you speak with him, he'll give you some very limited information on &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;'s possible whereabouts and infer to the illegality of using magic outdoors in the city. Find out more by engaging in discssion with him.\nAnother Amnian Soldier is stationed in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Slums\"&gt;Athkatla Slums&lt;/a&gt;, his post is nearby the &lt;a href=\"Slaver%20Stockade\"&gt;Slaver Stockade&lt;/a&gt; ship/building. This soldier has some unique dialogue as well, some of it related to &lt;a href=\"Free%20Hendak%20and%20the%20slaves\"&gt;Free Hendak and the slaves&lt;/a&gt; questline, and the Slavers in general. This guard may be corrupt or taking bribes to \"look the other way\".\nYet another two Amnian Soldiers are posted at the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20City%20Gates\"&gt;Athkatla City Gates&lt;/a&gt;, as one would expect. Again, there may be some problems with corruption here, or bribery to allow contraband to smuggle into the city, as is shown with a third Amnian Soldier (AESOLD.Cre).\nOver in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Government\"&gt;Athkatla Government&lt;/a&gt; distric are many posted soldiers. One soldier (GGUARD01.cre) spots a beggar (GBEGG01.cre) that you may have donated a coin to. This leads to potential dialogue (especially &lt;a href=\"Keldorn%20Firecam\"&gt;Keldorn Firecam&lt;/a&gt; and or &lt;a href=\"Viconia%20DeVir\"&gt;Viconia DeVir&lt;/a&gt; if they are in the party. \nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; standardizes the weapon proficiencies and fighting styles for the Amnian Soldiers, to match what they are wielding (Spears). They also have SCS Fighter AI scripts included for smarter tactical behavior and improved \"Shouts\" for help. The soldiers now have 3 pips in Spears and 2 pips in Two-handed weapon fighting style. Additional SCS random treasure is placed in the inventory."}

It is actually summoned by script, not some kind of conjuring from a specific spell casting &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin\"&gt;Sahuagin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe triggered events that lead to this creature's appearance relate to whether the party is viewed as an enemy of the &lt;a href=\"King%20Ixilthetocal\"&gt;King Ixilthetocal&lt;/a&gt; and the entire city populace is made hostile to the PC. Once a global called \"hatePC's\" is set, then it's too late, and the events will initiate.\nFor example, right from the very first exchange of dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Royal%20High%20Priestess%20Senityili\"&gt;Royal High Priestess Senityili&lt;/a&gt; the party can refuse to cooperate even a little bit with the sahuagin. This will make the entire populace hostile to the party (shuttering &lt;a href=\"The%20prophecy%20of%20Sekolah\"&gt;The prophecy of Sekolah&lt;/a&gt; quest elements). If that occurs, then the script will trigger that can summon the Anguillan and other creatures to help defend the city.\nThe summoning of the Anguiliian is also accompanied by various summoned &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; (such as several &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; creatures, and holy retribution spell casts on the party (ostensibly by Sekolah), including &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Command\"&gt;Command&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rigid%20Thinking\"&gt;Rigid Thinking&lt;/a&gt;. \nThese creatures appear alongside other sahuagin defenders in the center part of the map, and there are two scripted summoning events.\nAs interesting as this event may sound, these summoned creatures really aren't a threat of any consequence to a party at this stage of the saga. The retribution of Sekola is mostly for visual enhancement and a bit of flavor to the fact that the party has decided to take on the whole populace and forego any role-playing opportunities in this area. Every sahuagin will be an enemy on this map from now on. Let the slaughter commence.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises the creature by assigning spear and two-handed weapon style proficiencies (which the base game did not do).\nIt also provides immunities to entangle, web and few other effects that are to reflect that these creatures are large and can't be restricted by that sort of stuff.\nThe original &lt;a href=\"Tactics%20Mod\"&gt;Tactics Mod&lt;/a&gt; which can still work with the non-EE original classic game made the challenge level much greater in the City of Caverns. That mod increases the difficulty factor to a real threat."}
