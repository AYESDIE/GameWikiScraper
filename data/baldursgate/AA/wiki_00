They are strong, resistant, and utterly loyal to their master. Unfortunately, they are mostly hostile towards you.\nThis mod makes an attempt to change it. It scatters a number of tomes across Faer\u00fbn containing the secret knowledge of how to construct golems. Reading these books allows you to build golems by yourself, provided you have enough experience, and all the required materials at hand. Only characters knowledgeable in the arcane arts are able to understand the complex theories behind the golem construction.\nGolems can exist for a virtually unlimited time (with exceptions), or until destroyed. They can travel with the party all over the world and follow the commands of their master unconditionally.\n----Visit the SHS Forums or the Beamdog Forums if you have questions or download the latest version from Spellhold Studios or GitHub.\nInstallation.\nThis is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the zip file into the installation directory of your game and run either \"setup-A7-GolemConstruction.exe\" (Windows) or \"setup-A7-GolemConstruction.command\" (macOS). Follow the instructions, and you are ready to start. It is strongly recommend to start a new game after installing the mod.\nTo uninstall, run \"setup-A7-GolemConstruction.exe\" or \"setup-A7-GolemConstruction.command\" again and follow the prompts.\nImportant: All supported games must be patched to v2.0 or higher to install this mod.\nCompatibility.\nScales of Balance subcomponent \"IWO - IWDEE Item Tweaks\" (as of version 5.19) conflicts with this mod in IWD:EE. Either skip that component or install it before this mod.\nMod Components.\nDetails.\nSee \"golem_information.txt\" in the mod's \"readme\" folder. It provides information about the minimum caster level and required materials for each golem type, as well as detailed stats, skills and abilities of each golem. IWD:EE specific information can be found in \"golem_information-iwdee.txt\" instead."}

Gorion's Ward was brought to &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt; when he or she was only a few months old, and has been at Candlekeep for 20 years before the story starts.

Gorion's Ward grew up with &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;, who was brought to Candlekeep by Gorion ten years after the player.\nDuring the , an additional piece of information is gained, when the former priestess of Bhaal &lt;a href=\"Madele\"&gt;Madele&lt;/a&gt; speaks of how her cult had collected an unknown number of Bhaal's children, planning to sacrifice them, but were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Harpers\"&gt;Harpers&lt;/a&gt; and the children \"kidnapped.\" Considering the known association of Gorion with the Harpers, this implies the protagonist may have been one of the children, though it is never confirmed.\nBaldur's Gate.\nBiography.\nThe biography of the player character in Baldur's Gate is generated in two pieces. The first is set based on the class. Class kits will use the biography of their base class (except for Barbarians and Blackguards). The second is mostly unchanging, but has a section based on the player's race. In \"Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition\" the biography is customizable.\nPrologue and chapter 1.\nIn Baldur's Gate, Gorion's Ward is the player character. They are asked to buy equipment for long travels by Gorion, who is waiting near the entrance of the library, and for unknown reasons, wants to leave as soon as possible. After leaving Candlekeep behind, Gorion and his ward get separated in the area just east of &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt; after an ambush involving &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;an armored figure&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, and a mage, who is later discovered to be &lt;a href=\"Tamoko\"&gt;Tamoko&lt;/a&gt;. After the ambush, Gorion's Ward is found by &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, who managed to sneak out of Candlekeep, follow them, and saw how Gorion was killed. As return to Candlekeep is not an option, they travel with Imoen to the &lt;a href=\"Friendly%20Arm%20Inn\"&gt;Friendly Arm Inn&lt;/a&gt;, to find the contacts Gorion spoke of, &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khalid\"&gt;Khalid&lt;/a&gt;, who knew &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt; personally and are willing to travel to &lt;a href=\"Nashkel\"&gt;Nashkel&lt;/a&gt; and its mines, where some strange things are happening. It may give a clue about the iron crisis in an iron rich region.\nChapter 2.\nThere are some strange things happening at the &lt;a href=\"Nashkel%20Mines\"&gt;Nashkel Mines&lt;/a&gt;. The iron mined there is too corrupted to be used for armor and weapons and the miners are dying at the hand of some creatures haunting the mines. The mayor of Nashkel lacks the military force to clean the mines, so they are hiring adventurers to explore the mines and find the source of the corruption. At the bottom of the mine, you find a half-orc called &lt;a href=\"Mulahey\"&gt;Mulahey&lt;/a&gt;, who is in command of the kobolds, who are corrupting the ore using a certain substance on purpose.\nBhaalspawn abilities.\nAfter beginning a new in the game, Gorion's Ward has a &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;dream&lt;/a&gt; during one of their first &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt;s, except for &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20One\"&gt;Chapter One&lt;/a&gt;. In each of these dreams, Gorion's Ward acquires a special \u2013 due to being &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt;, as learned later. These are and can be accessed from the special abilities menu (button at the bottom right corner of the screen).\nWhich abilities are acquired, depends on the Ward's &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;. With an \"average\" of 10 or higher, these are healing and supporting abilities, while a reputation of 9 or lower yields offensive ones:\nIf the Ward's reputation fluctuates between 9 and 10 from one chapter to the next, all six special abilities may be acquired.\nWhen using that scale with character level \u2014 Draw Upon Holy Might and Vampiric Touch in our case \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Dual-class\"&gt;dual&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"multi-class\"&gt;multi-class&lt;/a&gt;ed protagonists cast at a level equal to the average of their class levels, rounded up. For example, both a Fighter 7 \u2192 Thief 1 dual-class and a level 3/3/4 Fighter/Mage/Thief multi-class will do damage with the innate Vampiric Touch as if they were level 4.\n\"Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn\".\nBhaalspawn abilities.\nIf \"Shadows of Amn\" is started by &lt;a href=\"importing\"&gt;importing&lt;/a&gt; Gorion's Ward from \"Baldur's Gate\", they will retain their gained through the &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;dreams&lt;/a&gt; during the first chapter of the saga.\nA newly &lt;a href=\"Character%20Generation\"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; protagonist, however, doesn't follow \"exactly\" the above mentioned rules. Depending on their starting &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;, determined through the initial &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt;, the following powers will be assigned to Gorion's Ward:\nGorion's Ward will &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;lose&lt;/a&gt; these abilities &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%204\"&gt;later in the game&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe protagonist's biography in Baldur's Gate II can be customized on player creation. The following is the default biography.\nStrongholds.\nIn Baldur's Gate II, the character receives a stronghold which can be used to store some items and get some quests related to it as well. &lt;a href=\"Multi-class\"&gt;Multi-class&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt; characters can claim any of the strongholds that they qualify for, but may only take one. &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s have no stronghold.\nPre-made protagonists.\nIn the Baldur's Gate series, the player can pick a pre-made protagonist instead of making their own protagonist, which requires much less time than creating their own character and gives the new player a decent character to start the games with. In this section, you can find a list of pre-made characters to choose from for each game or expansion pack. Only in the original \"Baldur's Gate\", the player is required to make a new character each time when starting a new game."}

If a creature is under a &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt; it falls to about 4 etc.\nOnce a creature has failed the saving throw their movement rate is lowered for the duration of the spell, whether they are still within the greasy area or not; perhaps the greasy film covers their footwear/feet.\nA player character affected by the spell will show an icon (No. 145) titled \"Grease\" on their portrait.\nThis spell can be blocked by &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; will negate the grease spell.\nA &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Free Action (spell)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Potion of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; can prevent or cure the movement modifier reduction of the grease spell.\n&lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effects won't remove the actual grease spell from the map but can possibly remove it from an affected individual.\nA creature affected by a \"Grease\" spell will be unaffected by another of the same spell, to prevent \"stacking\" - once greasy, you are as greasy as you can be.\nA grease spell causes innocent and neutral creatures to become hostile.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Grease\" differs in its implementation than the game version. The spell can also be applied to objects like a rope or ladder, or even to an opponent's weapon handle (although they get a saving throw to avoid it). The D&amp;D Grease spell doesn't slow movement, it makes victims slip, skid, unable to retain balance and fall over, or drop items and lose their grip.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects and saving throw. See below for description:\nGrease\nLevel: 1\nSchool: Conjuration\nRange: Medium\nDuration: 1 turn\nCasting Time: 1\nArea of Effect: 10\u2019 radius\nSaving Throw: Breath partial\nA Grease spell covers a material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. breath at +2 bonus or fall to the ground for one round. Those who enter the area or remain within it must make a save each round until they reach the nearest non-greased surface. A creature that succeeds on their saving throw can walk within or through the area of grease but will have their movements slowed considerably. Incorporeal and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell, as are exceptionally large creatures who suffer little to no distress from the greasy coating."}

{"id": "11318", "revid": "53053884", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11318", "title": "Greater Basilisk", "text": "Greater Basilisk is a stronger variant of a &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Basilisk\"&gt;Lesser Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;. Greater basilisks are exceptionally dangerous, eight-legged reptilian creatures. They are ruddy brown in appearance, unlike the lesser one which is a pale greenish-yellow. Both types have dark bands around the tail.\nThey kill their enemies with their petrifying gaze, making &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Mirrored%20Eyes\"&gt;Potions of Mirrored Eyes&lt;/a&gt; a necessity when fighting them, as a single basilisk can easily wipe out even a mid- to high-level party very quickly. Scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Petrification%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Protection From Petrification&lt;/a&gt; can also be purchased and memorized by mages or bards. If the worst does happen, scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20to%20Flesh\"&gt;Stone to Flesh&lt;/a&gt; can be bought to restore petrified party members provided the party member was not shattered.\nEffective means to protect the party from the petrifying gaze include:\nWhen killed they drop one item of &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure%23RNDTRE05\"&gt;rich random treasure&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll three of the Greater Basilisk's attacks (two melee and ranged petrification) have a speed factor of 3. That means a party coming out of hiding/invisibility and using low speed factor weapons (eg +2 daggers with speed factor 0) should be able to get one attack in before the Basilisk is able to make an attack itself. But keep in mind the Greater Basilisk can attack 3 times per round, no matter which \"weapon\" it uses, so further attacks will probably have at least one Basilisk attack in-between them, even with low speed factor.\nMoreover, considering the fact they start with their ranged \"weapon\" equipped, that means melee attackers will get both a -4 THAC0 and +4 damage bonus against the Basilisk until the creature decides to switch to their melee \"weapon\". As such, a properly-equipped party with access to invisibility and/or hide-in-shadows (available not just for Thieves, but also Monks and Rangers) could take down an isolated Basilisk even without access to any form of protection against petrification. And that's especially the case if there are any backstabbers involved, as that +4 damage bonus against the Basilisk is factored into backstabs. Though it's certainly harder to do compared to a Lesser Basilisk due to the aforementioned 3 attacks per round and their much larger hp pool.\nTheir ranged petrification attack comes with a massive 32767 bonus to hit, meaning it effectively cannot be avoided unless the Basilisk rolls a 1. So targeted characters are almost guaranteed to have to roll a save vs petrification (that carries a hefty -4 penalty).\nFinally, unlike Lesser Basilisks, Greater Basilisks also have a third attack: a melee one that inflicts a 1 damage per second poison for 10 seconds on a failed save vs poison (with a fortunate +4 bonus to save against it)."}

For example: equipping &lt;a href=\"Edventar%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Edventar's Gift&lt;/a&gt; before imbibing will prevent the slow effect altogether (one can even unequip the ring afterward) and level 5+ Monks are simply immune to slow. As for the Constitution loss, the &lt;a href=\"Girdle%20of%20Fortitude\"&gt;Girdle of Fortitude&lt;/a&gt; allows a character to raise it to 18 after this potion lowers it (and, once again, the girdle can be unequipped after it's used).\nIn , five of them can be acquired via the &lt;a href=\"Where%27s%20Wilson%3F\"&gt;Where's Wilson?&lt;/a&gt; quest."}

A green slime attack has the ability to poison or infect its target upon a successful hit.\nIn both BGEE and BG2EE, a green slime can only engage in melee, with an unenchanted attack that exposes the target to two effects on a failed saving throw vs. Death/Poison (with a +4 bonus): a poison that inflicts 2 poison damage per round for 8 seconds and a delayed &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Kill target&lt;/a&gt; effect that may kill the target after 10 seconds. Both effects are nonmagical and, therefore, cannot be dispelled via &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt;. Immunity to kill target effects can prevent that effect from taking place even on a failed save, but poison immunity prevents both effects (poison + kill target) at once. \n In the original game, the poison simply does 4 points of damage over 8 seconds and then kills the target after two more seconds. Both of these effects can be avoided with a save vs. death with a +4 bonus. Curing the poison will not prevent the delayed death, and it cannot be dispelled, but spells like &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt; can protect from it.\nGame play.\nThe Green Slimes encountered on the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Elemental%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Elemental Level&lt;/a&gt; are tougher than the typical Green Slime creature. They have many more resistances to physical and elemental damages. You will find your axes, clubs and swords doing very little damage, and acids having no effect. Even fire and cold damage will be resisted to a high extent. See the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Slime%20%28WK%20Elemental%20level%29\"&gt;Green Slime (WK Elemental level)&lt;/a&gt; page for more details."}

It is part of the story line for and is where the party will eventually face &lt;a href=\"Gromnir%20Il-Khan\"&gt;Gromnir Il-Khan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the warring bhaalspawns in the saga. This will take place in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%208\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 8&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nA moderately sized chamber with an ornate staircase on one side, with steps descending to &lt;a href=\"Gronmir%201st%20Level\"&gt;Gronmir 1st Level&lt;/a&gt; and steps ascending to Saradush proper. Several pillars and stone columns with decorative details support a high ceiling. Lit glass sconces illuminate the room and send warm light to reflect from the elaborate gold-laced mosaics on the walls and floor. A dais is raised on one side of the chamber with a marble throne, draped with velvet cushioning. It is a regal setting.\nGameplay.\nTo even reach this room has been a hazardous journey through several other previous areas and dungeons, populated by hostile forces of which many were under Gromnir's control. \nWhen the party reaches this \"Throne Room\" from the level below, a cut scene will play in which Gromnir and &lt;a href=\"Amelyssan\"&gt;Melissan&lt;/a&gt; are in the midst of a verbal confrontation. Eventually Gromnir has her led away from the chamber by the two &lt;a href=\"Il-Khan%20Soldier\"&gt;Il-Khan Soldier&lt;/a&gt; guards, presumably to be locked up somewhere - as he does not trust her and thinks she plots against him. \nSoon after, the party is spotted by Gromnir and he calls the party out as assassins, and hostilities begin immediately. And so, as is often the case, violence and bloodshed are inevitable.\nWhen the fight breaks out the party will face Gromnir who is assisted by the mage &lt;a href=\"Karun%20the%20Black\"&gt;Karun the Black&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Il-Khan%20Battle%20Mage\"&gt;Il-Khan Battle Mage&lt;/a&gt;. Just a few seconds into the hostilities, three other allies of Gromnir appear - including &lt;a href=\"Eler%20Had\"&gt;Eler Had&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berena%20Elkan\"&gt;Berena Elkan&lt;/a&gt; and a Il-Khan soldier with a bow. If playing modded content, there may be more opponents present and perhaps reinforcements on their way.\nGromnir, and the mages will spring into action with initial innate ability spells, or actual spell casts. The other three opponents will attack in melee combat or attempt thrown weapons or missile fire if they are able to. See the individual creature pages for notes and abilities to help with the player's in-game tactics. \nWhen the battle is over, &lt;a href=\"Melissan\"&gt;Melissan&lt;/a&gt; will show herself again in the throne room and lament that Gromnir has been slain. She continues dialogue and exchange with the party, and finally after learning that &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; is actually not trapped in the Saradush by the besieging army (because of the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane travel ability&lt;/a&gt;), she advances some important information. \nIf you agree to help the city of Saradush, she will unlock certain map areas - such as the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Mir\"&gt;Forest of Mir&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Marching%20Mountains\"&gt;Marching Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Now the party can pursue how to defeat the seemingly invincible &lt;a href=\"Yaga-Shura\"&gt;Yaga-Shura&lt;/a&gt;. The army besieging the city can be broken once the Fire Giant is defeated. Melissan teleports away, and the party is free to loot the room and carry on with the adventure.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a great cat leopard to the fight, named Ramazith. This feline is 10 HD creature with 18 strength, 20% magic resistance, a high movement rate, and a moderate physical damage resistance. Attacks 3 times per round with raking claws.\nAbout four rounds into the battle, Ascension adds two reinforcement creatures to the battle. These are a Minotaur Battle Priest and a Il-Khan Medusa.\nMinotaur Battle Priest (GROMMIN.cre): This giant humanoid is a level 16 LE Cleric with 160 HP, wields an Axe, Adjusted THAC0 -2, 2 APR. Has a 19 Strength. Adjusted AC is 0. The creature has a +3 movement modifier, +2 Spell Casting Speed modifier bonus, and is immune to &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; effects (because it's a Minotaur). \nIf the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod is installed, then a full spell book of divine spells is assigned for the creature for use. Upon appearing in the battle will instantly self-buff (previously cast) with &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spiritual%20Hammer\"&gt;Spiritual Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire (priest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Free Action (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt; will follow. Other spell casts will be in accordance with the 'Smarter Priests' component, looking at the opponent's vulnerabilities and protections to select appropriate magic, examples include &lt;a href=\"Silence%2C%2015%27%20Radius\"&gt;Silence, 15' Radius&lt;/a&gt; at Mage or Cleric class opponents, and multiple &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Person%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Hold Person (priest)&lt;/a&gt; spells. \nWith the Spiritual Hammer as its melee weapon, installation of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//sampsca.github.io/hammers-english.html\"&gt;Thrown Hammers&lt;/a&gt; mod means that the priest will toss at least two of these per round as a ranged weapon. \nIl-Khan Medusa {JUMJUM.cre): This creature has a &lt;a href=\"Sirine%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Sirine&lt;/a&gt; appearance and is a classified as a 8 HD LE Human female with a Greater Basilisk class. The creature has 70 HP, 20% magic resistance and 25% resistant to physical damage. The creature regenerates 2 HP/round. The creature is immune to poison, Miscast Magic and Disintegrate effects. \nA unique weapon is employed by the creature - it is non magical and can induce a &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; effect with a save to negate, as well as reducing movement speed by 50% for three rounds (no save). Any hit will also have a percentage chance of applying a &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20to%20Stone\"&gt;Flesh to Stone&lt;/a&gt; spell upon the struck target (there is a slight delay after the hit before the spell is cast).\nPeriodically she will force cast a uninterruptible 'Basilisk' spell with a range of 30'. The spell does the same Slow effect and delayed Flesh to Stone as the on-hit weapon effect. She does not run out of these spells and will be targeting the closest detected opponent about every other round.\nFor the cast of characters and how the Ascension and &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mods change them, see the links in the gameplay section."}

His adjusted &lt;a href=\"THACO\"&gt;THACO&lt;/a&gt; is quite formidable and can hit party members routinely even with impressive Armor Class ratings.\nIf defeated, Gromnir can be pilfered for some unique and interesting loot, as displayed in the InfoBox.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; mod revises all five bhaalspawn as well as some of their supporting creatures.

It is now worn by Gromnir Il-Khan, who is not afraid to use it, and will employ a Simulacrum of himself at the outset of hostilities.\nBoth Ascension and SCS mods individually and combined will improve Gronmnir's toughness and abilities. \nGromnir is changed to a unique Bhaalspawn Level 24 Berserker, with uses of &lt;a href=\"War%20Cry\"&gt;War Cry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hardiness\"&gt;Hardiness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Whirlwind Attack&lt;/a&gt;, which he will apply. He has 3 pips proficiency in Morning star. The bhaalspawn has a several unique Bhaalspawn powers and adjusted abilities including:\nAt death, drops the same as the unmodified creature, except no Morningstar +3 or Potion of Extra Healing. Any leftover potions not used by script are dropped. A SCS random treasure is also provided with that mod installed. May also drop Vhailor's Helm if that SCS component was installed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod places two allied golems in Gromnir's Lair for support and will help defend him. These are a \"Perfect Clay Golem\" and a \"Perfect Stone Golem\". Note that the clay golem will probably apply a &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Haste\"&gt;Golem Haste&lt;/a&gt; effect upon Gromnir and several allies in the throne room at the outset of battle."}

The vampire can be struck with normal weapons, and its melee attack can drain 3 experience levels. The creature will open hostilities with a protective buff contingency, and periodically reapply others as scripted. Offensive spell casts will be attempted, if able, as long as the vampire can identify a target, and complete a spell cast.

He has 4 attacks per round, THAC0 0 and -4 Armor Class. His melee strike drains 3 experience levels or 3 CON. The creature utilizes a default SCS \"Smarter Mage\" script rather than the \"Improved Vampire\" one. As such, the guard will behave as a spell caster, but still be able to fight in melee as a vampire effectively as well. At least +3 or better enchanted weapons are needed to strike the vampire, and it regenerates at 1 HP/second. \nUpon initial hostilities, the vampire will self-buff (Cast Previously) with uninterruptible instant cast spells such as &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. The creature has a mostly different set of memorized spells, and all of them are scripted for use as determined by opponent threat assessments, their protections, and what spells are still available as the vampire uses them up. The creature can cast &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; to take down the party's protections and has a number of offensive damage dealing spells as well as disabling type as well. If the vampire cannot find a spell applicable to the target, it can engage in melee attack."}

{"id": "13555", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13555", "title": "Guarded Compound", "text": "The Guarded Compound is a residential building located in Athkatla's &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"High%20Hall%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;High Hall of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt; is next door and the building faces towards the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Lathander%20%28Temple%20District%29\"&gt;Temple of Lathander&lt;/a&gt;. The front door is unlocked, and the interior consists of two floors.\nGameplay first floor.\nUpon entering the first floor, the party will be instantly greeted by &lt;a href=\"Sion\"&gt;Sion&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly powerful &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, and the rogue &lt;a href=\"Ketta\"&gt;Ketta&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party soon finds out that this is private property, and they aren't wanted here. Dialogue choices include apologizing and departing or insisting on trespassing and remaining within. Either way, Sion will teleport both of them upstairs, with some amused and curt remarks. What kind of place is this?\nTraps.\nMoving further into the room towards the staircase triggers a silent trap that spawns a &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Glabrezu,&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0an &lt;a href=\"Efreeti\"&gt;Efreeti&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Nishruu\"&gt;Nishruu&lt;/a&gt;, and a random assortment of &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Berserker\"&gt;Ogre Berserkers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ettercap\"&gt;Ettercaps&lt;/a&gt; that totals three creatures. The trigger is located behind the piano, just in front of a small circular table with two chairs, and crosses the entire room. All but the Glabrezu can be instantly killed by a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;, but none of the spawned creatures are worth any experience points when killed. \nThe Glabrezu: \nContainers.\nThe altar in the first room can be examined.\nThe first bedroom on the left:\nThe bedroom with the three bunk beds:\nThe library on the right contains copies of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20North%20IV\"&gt;History of the North IV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20North%20VI\"&gt;-VI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20North%20VIII\"&gt;VIII&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first dining room table on the left contains an item of average random treasure and the table against the back wall contains a copy of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20North%20III\"&gt;History of the North III&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe storage container in the kitchen contains an item of wealthy random treasure.\nGameplay second floor.\nTraps.\nTwo sets of stairs go up to the second floor, where four traps (two on each landing) guard entry into this large central living room. The two inner traps (which extend from the columns to the stair railing) are &lt;a href=\"Acid%20damage\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt; traps which can also &lt;a href=\"Held\"&gt;hold&lt;/a&gt; the victim for a brief period. Two more traps extend from the columns to the outer walls of this room. These are &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; traps, designed to thwart any type of secretive surprise attack by parties that think they're pretty tricky by taking precautions to avoid detection before exploring this floor. Moving into the room to attack its occupants will trigger the traps, unless they're disarmed. Retreating back downstairs avoids the acid traps, but the enemies will follow the party.\nOccupant defense.\nEntering the second floor from either of the two staircases is possible. The party will observe a group of now hostile defenders. Sion leads a well-balanced hostile group. Besides Sion and Ketta, there is the priest &lt;a href=\"Stalman\"&gt;Stalman&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"Maferan\"&gt;Maferan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20Rassmusen\"&gt;Olaf Rassmusen&lt;/a&gt;, and the sword saint &lt;a href=\"Koshi\"&gt;Koshi&lt;/a&gt; wielding &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Fury\"&gt;Celestial Fury&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful Katana. The whole group is worth a total of if defeated.\nExpect that the rogue will be invisible and most likely attempt a &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; attack on any detected party member. She will then quaff a potion of invisibility, perhaps multiple times, and repeat this tactic, if allowed. Stalman and Sion will initially launch protective buffing spells and continue to cast disabling and offensive varieties unless disrupted or silenced, or stopped somehow. The fighter opponents will move forward to engage in melee strikes.\nIf any of the party are made &lt;a href=\"Helpless\"&gt;Helpless&lt;/a&gt; due to any of the initial traps, they are in peril of being automatically hit, multiple times, and can be killed swiftly. So once you're upstairs, it's better to not move forward before detecting and disarming them.\nContainers.\nIn the northwestern bedroom there are four chests, an armoire and two bookcases:\nThe southwestern bedroom has two armoires: \nTo the northeast is a large storage room with three unlocked containers:\nBetween the storage and master bedroom is a small, secret room with a safe and two tables: \nThe master bedroom has two bookcases:\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; makes changes to the creatures upstairs and downstairs. The \"Summons Trigger\" on the ground floor will spawn a &lt;a href=\"Nishruu\"&gt;Nishruu&lt;/a&gt;, two Ogre Berserkers, an &lt;a href=\"Efreeti\"&gt;Efreeti&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Glabrezu%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Glabrezu (Shadows of Amn)&lt;/a&gt;, just like in the base game. But the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod changes the Efreeti to a \"gated\" creature so it and the demon can't be banished with a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;. The Efreeti will also regenerate and then heal itself while in its mist form (during which it is impervious to damage). The Glabrezu will use its SCS \"Improved Fiends\" innate abilities as well, if that component is installed, such as teleport without error and mirror images. The Ogre Berserkers will initiate their innate &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nUpstairs, all the guarded compound residents have SCS AI code edited into the original scripts for smarter tactical response and targeting (rather than default SCS scripts). \nThe first big change with this mod is that once the party has visited the second floor, it cannot retreat back to the ground floor. A text displaying a message \"An invisible wall of force blocks your path\" makes it clear if the party attempts to retreat back down the steps. All the guarded compound enemies must be defeated before the pathway is unblocked.\nThe mage and cleric will self-buff with the smarter mage/clerics component, then aggressively cast offensive damage and disabling spells as well as summoning help - such as Mordenkainen's Sword and a Giant Skeleton warrior or similar. The mage has a ready to use trio of minor spell sequencer, spell sequencer and spell trigger prepared. The Thief will make use of ample potions of invisibility and attempt backstab attacks, and a True Sight/Seeing will not stop her from quaffing a potion each round, and after each attack - all these just like in the base game - but with SCS she will be selecting the weakest, and especially mages, to attack first. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a lesser iron golem to the defenders on the second floor. Probably belongs to Sion.\nThe venerable &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/RoxanneSHS/The-Rune\"&gt;Twisting with the Rune&lt;/a&gt; Mod for EET and BGEE/SoD returns Koshi's special Rogue Stone with a clue, and other content regarding the Twisted Rune. Koshi's Rogue Stone has an inscription \"I am in the Bridge District of Athkatla. What kind of tricks are you playing on me?\""}

There are several suboptions here:\nRegardless of which story is chosen, the party will be granted the right to freely move through the sahuagin's chamber as they wish."}

Because they actually gain some bonuses simply for being half-elf, there are no situations in which you should not be one over a human unless it's a dual-class.

They usually have green skin, large tusk-like teeth protruding from the lower jaw, large muscular builds and thick body hair. They also receive a -2 penalty to intelligence but their reputation as being mentally-deficient is generally exaggerated.\nHalf-orcs are usually tolerated but not accepted. One reason for this is that, more often than not, unions between orc and human are not consensual. To say a consensual union has never occurred is inaccurate but it is not as common. There is a heavy stigma associated with having orc blood even generations down the line and, should a half orc have children with a member of another race, orc traits such as teeth, skin color, body hair, and large build can be passed on to third or even fourth generation children and sometimes skip a generation.\nLike many half-breeds, half-orcs have no home or culture of their own. They are not orcs and they are not human. They walk the line between the races as cultural outcasts. Not surprisingly, most half-orcs have little care for laws and social niceties though some do attempt to fit into human society. Many half-orcs do menial labor or become mercenaries or bandits finding no other place in the world.

She has 2.5 &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;, THAC0 6 and -3 Armor Class. A default SCS script is assigned allowing Vampire Domination ability every 2 rounds, and attacks with either a level drain or \"\"Blood Drain\" temporarily reducing CON by 3. She can only be struck by +3 or better weapons. She can shape change into bat or wolf form, and summon bats, rats or wolves with the \"children of the night\"\" ability.\nThe second version of this vampire (C6HAREI.CRE) is a level 12/12 Fighter/Thief with 160 HP, STR20, DEX 20, CON 19. She has 2.5 attacks per round, THAC0 4 and -3 Armor Class. Her melee strike drains 3 experience levels or 3 CON. She also has a different default script, making her akin to an ancient vampire, that has all the abilities of the former version plus the innate &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Fear\"&gt;Vampire Fear&lt;/a&gt; ability and the \"Mesmerize\" feeblemindedness attack. She will recognize opponents protected from level drain and charm and many other \"buffs\" for intelligent targeting."}

This component modifies Harm to work more like the 3rd edition spell: it inflicts 150 hp damage, with no saving throw, on a successful touch attack, to a minimum of 1 hp. The rationale for this is that Harm (especially combined with Critical Strike) is otherwise an almost-instant way of eliminating even foes with hundreds of hit points. Harm remains lethal in this component, but is not quite so overwhelming.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod makes changes to Harm, spell description below:\nHarm&lt;br&gt;\nLevel: 6&lt;br&gt;\nSchool: Necromancy&lt;br&gt;\nSphere: Necromantic&lt;br&gt;\nRange: Personal&lt;br&gt;\nDuration: 1 turn&lt;br&gt;\nCasting Time: 6&lt;br&gt;\nArea of Effect: 1 creature&lt;br&gt;\nSaving Throw: Spell half&lt;br&gt;\nThis spell is the reverse of Heal. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage. On a successful touch from the priest, the spell inflicts 90 points of damage upon the target. Harm cannot reduce the target\u2019s hit points to less than 1. The spell expires once the priest makes a successful melee attack or after 1 turn has passed. The priest gains a +4 bonus to hit the target. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.\nIf both SCS and SR are installed, the SR version will be the one implemented."}

Weak Haste is not available to players in .\nEffect on tick rate.\nThe following only applies to . In the original edition of , the multiplier discussed below is always x2, and the extra tick occurs halfway within the period.\nAny effect that triggers repeatedly based on time is affected by the Haste effect. The main ones are &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; and the damage-inflicting types of &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;Disease&lt;/a&gt;.

Instead, each extra tick occurs at 50% of the remaining time in the period. For example, an effect that ticks once per 60 seconds will tick 7 times per 60 seconds under Haste. But of the 6 extra ticks, the first one will not occur until the 30s mark, the second one until the 45s mark, the third one until 52.5s, etc, meaning that 4 out of the seven ticks will occur within the last 4 seconds. The 7th tick will occur at the 60s mark; it is the initial, un-hasted tick.\nWhat Haste does NOT do.\nThe Haste effect halves round duration, but this doesn't have the wide implications of the &lt;a href=\"Slow%20effect\"&gt;Slow effect&lt;/a&gt;.

Neither do &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection From Magic&lt;/a&gt; scrolls help.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Time Stop\" has at least two major differences from the BG Video game version - The caster may only act during the pause in time if remaining in the spell's 15-ft. radius sphere. Leaving the sphere cancels the spell immediately. The second difference is a variable spell duration of 1d3 rounds (unknown to the caster). See the external links for further reading. \nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its description. See below:\nTime Stop\nLevel: 9\nSchool: Alteration\nRange: Personal\nDuration: 3 rounds\nCasting Time: 1 round\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nUpon casting a Time Stop spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop in the entire area that the caster is currently in. Outside this area the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an instant. Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for three rounds of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the time clock. Nothing can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also. When the spell duration ceases, everyone is again operating in normal time. All spells cast during the Time Stop will take effect immediately after time returns to normal.\nWith both the &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mods, both forms of &lt;a href=\"Abazigal\"&gt;Abazigal&lt;/a&gt; are immune to Time Stop."}
{"id": "20855", "revid": "285108", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20855", "title": "Time System", "text": "Baldur's Gate follows a Time System based on the AD&amp;D system. Days in the world of Toril last 24 hours, just like in the real world.\nTimekeeping.\nLike in the real world, there are 60 game seconds in one game minute, 60 game minutes in one game hour, and 24 game hours in one game day. There are 12 game months in a game year as well. However, one game week is called a tenday and lasts 10 game days, and one game month always has 30 game days.\nAnother difference is the rate at which time passes in the game, which is twelve times faster than real time. That means conversion from real time to game time happens at a factor 12: One game hour, or 60 game minutes, equal 5 real minutes. One game day, or 24 game hours, equal 2 real hours.\nDay/night cycle.\nNight falls during hour 21, with a small period of time at the start of the night (\"dusk\") being a bit brighter than the rest of it. Similarly, daytime begins during hour 6, with a small period at the start (\"dawn\") that is a bit darker than the rest of the day. Thus, for each 24-hour day in the game, 9 hours are night, and 15 hours are day. A lighting filter is used to visually illustrate the current time of day, and certain maps (such as outdoor areas in Baldur's Gate city and the Nashkel Carnival) also have an alternate background image used during the night.\nNote that some quests and characters are only active or encountered at certain times of day. These need not be the actual day/night transition points; i.e. a character may be present on the map from 3:30 until 20:30.\nThe time system during combat.\nCombat is divided in rounds and turns. One round equals 6 real seconds, and one turn equals 10 rounds or 1 real minute.\nA spell that lasts for 2 turns and 3 rounds, like &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; at level 20+, will stay active for 2mn18s of real time, or 27mn36s of game time.\nA spell that lasts for 2 game hours, like &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt;, will stay active for 10 real minutes, that is to say 10 turns of combat (100 rounds).\nWhat you can do in one round.\nThe number of actions a character can accomplish in one round, i.e, in six seconds of real time, is limited. Some actions can only be performed once per round. These actions are: casting a spell, using a quick item such as a potion or a scroll, using an ability from an equipped item such as the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Sewers\"&gt;Cloak of the Sewers&lt;/a&gt;' polymorph, or using an innate ability like the Kensai's &lt;a href=\"Kai\"&gt;Kai&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt;. In any given round, it is only possible to use one action taken from all categories combined. It should be noted that the wizard spell &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; lifts this restriction for spells and innate abilities, which can then be used at will.\nWithout Improved Alacrity, if a character wants to perform two of these actions in succession, a full round must pass between the moment he starts the first one and the moment he starts the second one. Weapon or fist attacks are not subject to this limitation, though. Often, combat involves creatures or characters able to attack more than once in a single round. This can be due to multiple attack forms (like claws and bite), skill with a weapon, or character level.\nA character can therefore initiate combat by throwing a quick projectile like the &lt;a href=\"Boomerang%20Dagger\"&gt;Boomerang Dagger&lt;/a&gt;, then cast a quick spell, then resume attacking until the end of the round, assuming they have more than one attack per round. But they cannot use a potion, the Cloak of the Sewer or the ability Kai, because they already used a spell, which belongs to the one-action-per-round group. If spellcasting is still in cooldown and a second spell is immediately queued, the character will stop auto-attacking and wait till they can cast the spell. Thus it can be advisable to order the character to make an attack before starting another spell, to utilize the round fully.\nA modal ability (Bard songs, &lt;a href=\"Find%20Traps%20/%20Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;Find Traps / Detect Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt;) can also be activated in the same round as all of the above actions, but it will end all further actions while it is active.\nCasting Time.\nThe casting time of a spell is the number of tenths of rounds that it takes to cast the spell. A tenth of a round is 0.6 seconds of real time. Casting times range from 1 to 9, therefore, the quickest spells are cast in 0.6 seconds, while the slowest spells are cast in 5.4 seconds.\nA couple exceptional items reduce casting time, like the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Vecna\"&gt;Robe of Vecna&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Power\"&gt;Amulet of Power&lt;/a&gt;. Even with those items, the minimum casting time for a spell is 0, which means it is cast instantaneously.\nFinally, the &lt;a href=\"slow%20effect\"&gt;slow effect&lt;/a&gt; and the slow type of &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; double all casting times. The &lt;a href=\"haste%20effect\"&gt;haste effect&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, halves casting time only for scrolls and item abilities.\nSpell Duration.\nSpell descriptions in the game will display a variety of time units, giving spell effect durations in seconds, sometimes in rounds, or turns or even hours.\nHowever, if viewing spells and durations with an Infinity Engine editor tool, these durations are given in seconds. Some examples:\nRate of Fire.\nBows, crossbow, and many other missile weapons have different rates of fire (ROF) \u2014the number of missiles they can shoot in a single round. Arrows can be shot and daggers thrown at a rate of up to two shots per round. Some weapons, like crossbows and slings, take a long time to load; while others, like throwing axes, are too large to throw quickly, and can thus be fired only once per round. Darts can be hurled at a rate of three per round.\nActivation delay.\nActivating any item ability, e.g. , spell scrolls or charges from equipped items, will take some time while the character prepares the item. This delay does not apply to &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, which are consumed immediately. The activation delay can be halved by the &lt;a href=\"haste%20effect\"&gt;haste effect&lt;/a&gt;, and is doubled by the &lt;a href=\"slow%20effect\"&gt;slow effect&lt;/a&gt;."}

A &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; can be cast to banish summoned foes, and a &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt; is ready to counter silence. \nHis mage assistant will also be getting up some magical defenses and then try and attack via spell casting as well.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises Tolgerias (and his assistant mage in the Planar Sphere) assigns a default \"Smarter Mages SCS AI for improved tactical behavior and spell casting.

E.g. a Thief with 70 points in the Set Snare ability and a current luck of 1 will have a 71% chance to succeed whenever they try to set a trap.\nThe trap activates when an enemy gets within a certain distance (doesn't have to walk directly over it), and shoots out projectiles that hit all enemies in the area. Allies of the thief are not affected. The Thief can set one trap per rest at level 1, plus one for every 5th level thereafter. Traps remain even after rest, so it's possible to setup more even at level 1, but there's a per-area trap limit of 7.\nEvery trap effect is considered nonmagical and completely bypasses &lt;a href=\"magic%20resistance\"&gt;magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt; ability traps damage:\nIn addition, the kit &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Hunter\"&gt;Bounty Hunter&lt;/a&gt; for the Thief class gets access to the ability to &lt;a href=\"Set%20Special%20Snare\"&gt;Set Special Snare&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf chosen, some &lt;a href=\"high-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;high-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt; allows one to get three types of traps; the &lt;a href=\"Set%20Exploding%20Trap\"&gt;Exploding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Set%20Spike%20Trap\"&gt;Spike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Set%20Time%20Trap\"&gt;Time Trap&lt;/a&gt;. \nCertain classes with enough skill points spend in the class ability &lt;a href=\"Find%20Traps%20/%20Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;Find Traps&lt;/a&gt; enables the detection and disarming of traps laid by enemies. The priest spell &lt;a href=\"Find%20Traps%20%28spell%29\"&gt;by the same name&lt;/a&gt; divines their location, but doesn't disarm them.\nSetting a trap activates the same cooldown as casting a spell or using any magical item, meaning you can't use a potion or spell or set another trap within 6 seconds (1 round).\nFinally, TRAPLIMIT.2DA determines the area trap limit (per class/class combo) and it's set to whatever numbers appear in there +1. So, for example, if the number for single-class Thieves was set to 1, a Thief would be able to set 2 traps in a single area."}

The ancient Tree of Life stretches massive branches in all directions, both vertically and horizontally. For the purposes of party movement (and gravity) the gameplay here is focused on the branches that are horizontal and can be moved upon by foot.\nThe artwork of the map indicates that smaller trees and undergrowth are visible at lower elevations below the Tree of Life, so it is likely that the party is still over a hundred feet from the forest floor below.\nThis area is technically considered an outdoor area and is subject to the effects on daylight and nighttime. Resting/camping can occur here, with no disturbances from attacking creatures.\nGameplay.\nEnter the Tree of Life.\nThe party descends stairs revealed in The Palace, previously hidden at the bottom of a pool of water.\nThey appear in the northeast corner of the Tree of Life map on a staircase formed from a tree trunk.\nWithin detection range is seen a blurred image of &lt;a href=\"Ellesime\"&gt;Ellesime&lt;/a&gt; to the west of the arrival point.\nConverse with Ellesime's image.\nA few seconds after arrival, &lt;a href=\"Ellesime\"&gt;Ellesime&lt;/a&gt;, seen as a blurred image of herself and projected by her magic and will - initiates dialogue, she says:\nGorion's Ward may reply. Ellesime will continue:\nThe ward asks about the parasites, the Queen replies:\nThe PC asks how to find the parasites, Ellesime answers:\nWith that the image fades, and the player's Journal updates with the &lt;a href=\"Freeing%20Queen%20Ellesime\"&gt;Freeing Queen Ellesime&lt;/a&gt; questline - which reads:\nFind and destroy the parasites.\nThe party can now begin exploring the branches and look for anything out of place, especially any \"parasites\" that are supposedly somewhere sapping the Tree of Life of its vigor and vitality.\nThe party can go any direction it wishes. It doesn't matter really - and visual indicators that may seem to be gaps in the tree branches may be crossable as long as the party has the &lt;a href=\"Small%20Tree%20of%20Life%20Nut\"&gt;Small Tree of Life Nut&lt;/a&gt; items in their inventory. If the player doesn't have these nuts, then they won't be able to complete the game properly.\nAs the Queen has previously stated, they will facilitate a hyper growth branch repair at sections that are eligible for that action. \nThis effect will happen automatically by the game engine script - and a text message will be displayed indicating when it occurs. \nEach time it happens, one of the small nuts is consumed. The player can just control the party's movement and move forward as normal without having to worry about falling to their death or similar.\nIrenicus and Ellesime in a cage.\nAs the party explores, it is possible that they will come upon Irenicus and Ellemise (who is in a cage) on a small platform. \nThis can occur before any parasites are found. Irenicus is seemly oblivious and in a trance of some sort - unaffected by the outside world and within a protective magic shell of unknown power. The tree's life force is being drawn out by the parasites and funneled to Jon. He doesn't react to the party, and no attacks will do anything to him (immune to all arcane and divine spells and most damage types). \nIf the party tries to select to talk with Irenicus a text displays:\nEllesime cannot be spoken to in her cage either. For now, the party can safely resume their exploration for the parasites.\nA parasite is located.\nNavigating the tree branches will lead to discovering a strange object as shown in the screenshot.\nEvery few seconds an \"Acid Attack\" animation plays next to it, indicating the parasite is damaging and draining the Tree of Life.\nThe parasite can be targeted with the player's \"sword/attack\" icon. If the attack is commenced, a message is displayed on the information box:\nA second attack generates and another text message:\nThe guardians appear adjacent to the parasite and will be a pair of 12-HD elementals, either Air, Earth or Fire variety depending on which parasite is attacked.\nWhen the elementals are destroyed, attack the parasite again. This displays a final message:\nThat's all there is to the process of destroying one of the three parasites on the tree.\nDestroy all three parasites.\nAfter destruction of the second parasite, Ellesime's projected image appears by the party and speaks some encouragement and warning to continue and to make haste.\nThe player's Journal now updates the &lt;a href=\"Freeing%20Queen%20Ellesime\"&gt;Freeing Queen Ellesime&lt;/a&gt; quest, and a text displays:\nOnce the third and final parasite is destroyed, the game script takes over and transfers the party to the central platform with Irenicus and Ellesime in her cage.\nIrenicus is interrupted.\nThe player's party is positioned near Irenicus and Ellesime is now outside her cage. Irenicus is surprised and says:\nMore dialogue continues, and eventually Ellesime enters the with her remarks. Jon and the queen have a back-and-forth exchange, revealing more background regarding Jon's ties to the elven court, and the lost love connection between he and Ellesime.\nLater in the dialogue Imoen, Jaheria and Minsc (if they are in the party) have their own interjections.\nEllesime disappears from the map now that she has been freed and is done with her dialogue with Irenicus. The player's Journal updates the &lt;a href=\"Freeing%20Queen%20Ellesime\"&gt;Freeing Queen Ellesime&lt;/a&gt; quest.\nJon eventually reverts back to his unrepented self, with only revenge left as his driving purpose, and says:\nBattle Irenicus on the Tree of Life.\nJon is scripted to \"Applyspell\" command an initial preparatory string of protective buffs (even if damaged it won't be interrupted).\nFor a more in-depth look at of this version of Irenicus, see the &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus%20%28Tree%20of%20Life%29\"&gt;Jon Irenicus (Tree of Life)&lt;/a&gt; article.\nAssuming the protagonist and party are able to get Jon to one Hit Point, he will make a final incredulous remark about being killed.\nGorion's Ward will now show several introspective dialogue boxes that describe a strange sensation and realization that something weird is occurring.\nThe incessant tug and pull of the force draws Gorion's Ward and the party into the void.\nA cinematic cut scene will take over - eventually culminating with the party transported to &lt;a href=\"The%20Abyss\"&gt;The Abyss&lt;/a&gt; area. See that page for what transpires next.\nContainers.\nA small nonvisible niche is located right at the area entrance stairs. A rich &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt; is within for the taking.\nBug.\nThe Irenicus version that is found within his magical shell was clearly designed to be mostly impervious to being killed. But there are some loopholes, and he can be killed if the player is determined to do so (verified by testing). This version of Irenicus is just for looks and animation at this point in the plot. \nHowever, if Irenicus is killed here, it will foul up the script that triggers opening dialogue between the party, Ellesime and Jon Irenicus (and everything following that). This will mean the game can't progress properly. The player's game will essentially end right here with no further developments happening. So, don't break your game. Wait for the scripted dialogue between the party, Ellesime and Irenicus to play out, and allow Jon to turn hostile before attacking him."}

For other types, see &lt;a href=\"Trolls\"&gt;Trolls, Disambiguation&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod and the \"Tactical Challenges for BG2\" component can offer the following regarding Troll creatures:\nRebalanced Troll Regeneration\nBy default, the trolls in Infinity Engine games regenerate slowly, but upon being reduced to 1 hp go into a coma - in the coma they can be killed by fire or acid but are immune to all other effects. By fairly common consent, this doesn't work so well. \nTroll regeneration is too slow to make much difference in combat, and the iconic role of fire or acid is reduced to a coup de grace. (It doesn't help that the actual implementation is a bit glitchy, with trolls often taking a while to enter their coma phase.)\nThis component (inspired by the Pathfinder RPG) makes two modifications to trolls. Firstly, their base regeneration rate is doubled, and while regenerating they cannot die (they still go into a coma at 1 hp). But secondly, any time they take fire or acid damage their regeneration is halted for one round. So as long as you keep fire or acid damage active on a troll, they can be harmed and killed normally - but if you stop doing so, they will rapidly recover."}

Succeeding at this route the same rewards as the &lt;a href=\"%23violent%20pacification\"&gt;violent pacification&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote.\nAs described on Sindret's page, it is ill-advised to talk to her whilst &lt;a href=\"Viconia%20DeVir\"&gt;Viconia DeVir&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Baeloth%20Barrityl\"&gt;Baeloth Barrityl&lt;/a&gt; is both in the party and within Sindret's visual range. She will brush it off the first time, if the player chooses the right options, but if they insist on speaking to a militant anti-drow fanatic with a drow close to hand, she will turn hostile, causing the rest of the camp to do the same. Speaking with the troll will reveal that the troll's name is Ulori, and she is female."}

See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod replaces \"True Sight\" with \"True Seeing\". It also protects against blindness. See below for description:\nTrue Seeing\nLevel: 6\nSchool: Divination\nRange: Personal\nDuration: 1 turn\nCasting Time: 5\nArea of Effect: 30\u2019 radius\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is cast, the caster gains the ability to see the exact locations of creatures or objects under displacement or invisibility effects and see through illusions. This effectively neutralize spells such as Blur and Mirror Image, allow the caster to see and target invisible creatures normally, and make him unaffected by hostile illusion spells such as Spook. The caster is also cured from any form of blindness and is immune to it for the duration of the spell.\nNote: True Seeing does not dispel illusionary clones such as those conjured by Mislead or Simulacrum, but instead clearly highlights them, revealing them as deceptions.\nWith the Spell Revisions mod, spells such as &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt; cannot penetrate a creature protected by the &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt; spell. This is a big game changer in the magic duels that occur in the game, especially with &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;SCS&lt;/a&gt;. This new mage chess-match dynamic replaces the somewhat clunky Spell Immunity: Divination mechanic in the base game."}

When this mode is activated and the are in range of the character, there is a possibility the undead, if they are of equal or lower &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Dice\"&gt;Hit Dice&lt;/a&gt; (monster level) than the Turn Undead level, will stop attacking their targets and run away from the character until the effect is worn off.\nIf the Turn Undead level of a good or neutral aligned character is sufficiently higher than the HD of the undead, this mode will instead destroy it instantly, while evil characters will bring it under their control for 10 rounds (tested in BG1EE, doesn't seem to scale with level).\nWhile the mode is active, the character using it can't perform any actions aside from moving. Silenced characters can still Turn Undead. Clerics under &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; can also activate their TU button and move around.\nHostile &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladins&lt;/a&gt; can also be turned by opposing Clerics of higher level.\nTechnical details.\nThe Turn Undead Level under the Miscellaneous tab [in \"&lt;a href=\"Save%20Editors\"&gt;EE Keeper&lt;/a&gt;\"] is used. The effect state isn't used\u2014it's not updated in-game.\nThe -2 is hardcoded for paladins.\nHow this works for a cleric is:\nCharacter level + turn undead level = total turn undead level\nHow it works for a paladin is:\n(Character level - 2) + turn undead level = total turn undead level\nIn both cases, if the level is below 0 before the bonus is applied, it will use 0 instead.\nNow, in the case of the undead you're trying to turn, what happens here is this:\nA skeleton at level 1 is nearby. You're a paladin at level 1, so you get -2 straight away. Your turn undead level is equal to (your level) 1 - (paladin penalty) 2 = -1. This converts to 0 since it's already below 0. Finally, the Turn Undead Level variable is added\u2014let's say you set that at 10. Your total is now (0 + 10).\nThe 1d4 roll is made, since it's random let's take 3 as an example. The undead's level is now 1 + 3 + 5. Your total of 10 is more than that and will either destroy the undead or charm it (depending on whether your character is evil).\nIf that wasn't successful, it attempts the second check.\nLet's say your Turn Undead Level is a total of 5 instead. That's 1 + 3 from the skeleton versus your 0 + 5, which causes the skeleton to run away from your paladin."}

Their rarity supports the reverence they receive from other illithids, who view them as a blessing and second only to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20Brain\"&gt;The Master Brain&lt;/a&gt;. Their ego reflects their privileged position, as they view the common mind flayer as a lesser being.\nThe game plays fast and loose with the supposedly rarity factor of this creature. For example, in the &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayers%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Mind Flayers in Underdark&lt;/a&gt; area there are at least five of them.\nLocations.\nUlitharids typically inhabit mind flayer lairs in various dungeons. They are usually accompanied by regular mind flayers and &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;umber hulks&lt;/a&gt;. They carry no gold nor any treasure, however the &lt;a href=\"Ulitharid%20%28Spellhold%29\"&gt;Ulitharid&lt;/a&gt; encountered in &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%203\"&gt;Spellhold Bodhi's Hunt Level 3&lt;/a&gt; will drop the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Flame of the North&lt;/a&gt; when defeated. The game will award different experience point values for different varieties of the Ulitharids encountered. The XP noted in the info box is for the fully implemented and common form.\nGameplay.\nUlitharids are an effectively more powerful version of the ordinary mind flayer. Ulitharids are able to force cast &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Serious%20Wounds\"&gt;Cure Serious Wounds&lt;/a&gt; upon themselves when their &lt;a href=\"Hit%20point\"&gt;Hit point&lt;/a&gt; level is reduced to 50 percent of their maximum HP. Ulitharids also have better stats \u2013 greater &lt;a href=\"Hit%20point\"&gt;Hit point&lt;/a&gt; value, better &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt;. In addition are fifty percent resistant to &lt;a href=\"Missile%20damage\"&gt;Missile damage&lt;/a&gt;. Their movement rate is slightly faster than the ordinary illithid. These creatures are highly resistant to magic.\nA ulitharid also attacks with a 5 &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt; round (the ordinary Mind Flayer has 4). \nWhen an enemy is detected with current hit points at 25% of maximum, a &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; spell will be attempted at that enemy.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; normally attempted is a &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Domination\"&gt;Psionic Domination&lt;/a&gt; power, at the closest enemy detected. After that the &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Blast\"&gt;Psionic Blast&lt;/a&gt; ability is launched at targets, about every two rounds. If an enemy is in melee range, the ulitharid may attempt to strike with the \"devour brain\" melee attack, which temporarily drains 5 points of intelligence per successful hit.\nBugs.\n As ulitharids have no &lt;a href=\"Class%23Class%20kits\"&gt;class kit&lt;/a&gt; assigned, they receive due to a bug the &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt; bonuses of a &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;specialist mage&lt;/a&gt; who would be trained in no specific school: they save with a bonus of -2 against school-less abilities and add a penalty of +2 for recipients of their own such attacks. This applies to their &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Blast\"&gt;Psionic Blast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Domination\"&gt;Psionic Domination&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; improves illithids of all varieties. The Ulithatid is no exception and SCS raises their Hit Dice to level 14. A reworked AI script is also designed to improve the decision logic of the creature, and to recognize opponent's vulnerabilities and protections to act in a smarter tactical manner. For example, it knows if a player is under effects of &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt;. It can detect the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Charm%20Protection\"&gt;Helm of Charm Protection&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Harmony\"&gt;Shield of Harmony&lt;/a&gt;. It makes different targeting or attack option decisions with this information.\nIf any kind of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; are detected, they will be attacked with the &lt;a href=\"Detonate\"&gt;Detonate&lt;/a&gt; ability, which destroys the creature in SCS.\nThe Ulitharid will quaff potions or apply oils to heal or boost abilities (the same as a party member). They carry three or more different potions (random SCS selection).such &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Potion of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Potion of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe creature is scripted to use the following innate psionic abilities: Planar Travel , &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Maze\"&gt;Psionic Maze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ballistic%20Attack\"&gt;Ballistic Attack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detonate\"&gt;Detonate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Serious%20Wounds\"&gt;Cure Serious Wounds&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Blast\"&gt;Psionic Blast&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Domination\"&gt;Psionic Domination&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that the Ulitharid uses the more potent Psionic Blast version, with a -4 saving throw penalty.\nThe Ulitharid's devour brain melee attack has a range of 3 in SCS.\nSCS Ulitharids often begin the battle under Improved Invisibility. These crafty creatures will use the \"Planar Travel\" ability to dimension door to parts of the area map, including adjacent to vulnerable characters, or party members in the rear or even in another room from the main battle."}

This may be the first game encounter of this creature type for the party. \nGameplay.\nThis ulitharid will usually commence attacks on the nearest enemy using &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Domination\"&gt;Psionic Domination&lt;/a&gt;, within 2 rounds of hostilities. \nAny creature in melee range may be attacked with the devour brain melee attack, and this creature has 5 &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;, although the &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; is not particularly accurate.\nIf still able to function after a few rounds, the illithid will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Blast\"&gt;Psionic Blast&lt;/a&gt; at the nearest enemy. More of these can be tried over the course of the battle, with only a scripted delay between uses. In between these psionic abilities the creature will continue with devour brain melee strikes.\nWhen the creature is wounded to a certain threshold it applies a &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Serious%20Wounds\"&gt;Cure Serious Wounds&lt;/a&gt; ability to self.\nIn the unlikely case where a party member's &lt;a href=\"Hit%20point\"&gt;Hit point&lt;/a&gt; total is at 25% of its maximum, the ulitharid will attempt to actually cast a &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; spell (which can be interrupted) at the wounded person.\nWhen the creature is defeated, find the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Flame of the North&lt;/a&gt; great sword as a loot item on the illithid's corpse.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises this creature and makes it a full-fledged ulitharid with 14 HD. See the &lt;a href=\"Ulitharid\"&gt;Ulitharid&lt;/a&gt; Mod content section for potential changes. This creature is provided with two potions for use during the fight, which it scripted to quaff to boost abilities and heal itself. \nNote that with SCS this illithid will most likely not be faced alone and will be participating in battle with Yuan-ti and Noble Djinni companions.\nThis creature starts off under &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. When it attacks it can be detected, but is still improved invisible, so targeting can be impossible for some party spells, and it also has the augmented armor class bonus. If the invisibility is removed, the Illithid may apply it again. They aren't dumb with SCS.\nExpect a more aggressive and robust use of &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; when battling this illithid with SCS.

She will appear in the village of &lt;a href=\"Imnesvale\"&gt;Imnesvale&lt;/a&gt; portraying herself as the evil \"Umar Witch\", threatening the villagers, and ordering them to leave immediately.\nIn reality she is just someone who wants to lay claim to the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Temple\"&gt;Temple of Amaunator&lt;/a&gt; and is scaring the villagers to prevent them from finding out what her plans are before she's finished setting up her land grab.\nGameplay.\nUmar will probably open up the battle by a &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; spell cast, followed by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; Invocation, then &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.

This script will be much more challenging than the basic or EE version of Umar. Expect contingencies and sequencers, and arcane level 6 and 7 offensive spells directed at you. Umar is now assigned a Necromancer specialist mage kit by SCS.\nUpon hostilities commencing, she will launch a series of uninterruptible self-buffs including &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity Invocation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the self-buff, another instant preparation spell will go off adding a summoned &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; to Umar's allies to contend with. From now on the advanced SCS script will select further spell casting from the witch based on opponent vulnerability assessments and targeting options. She can deploy many different spells including offensive damage types, divination, disabling and also can cast &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Word\"&gt;Secret Word&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; if certain protections are observed on the party. Additional protective contingencies will also instantly reapply if he defenses are removed, dispelled or stripped away, such as Minor Globe, &lt;a href=\"Mantle\"&gt;Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, Stoneskin, shield etc.\nThe witch has the following prepared to launch:\nWatch out for more summoned creatures (such as shadows or a fiend) and the &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer Imp familiar is also a spell caster with SCS and has use of many first through third level arcane spells like &lt;a href=\"Horror\"&gt;Horror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull Trap&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that with Spell Revisions she will have the SR spell versions, which means no Spell Immunity but \"Dispel Shield\", and Mantle replaced with \"Prismatic Mantle\".

They cannot move, attack, or use items. A playable character cannot be directly selected, except to view their status screen. They can receive items, but no items can be taken from their inventory. A creature affected cannot be pick pocketed. \"Unconscious\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Sleep%20%28Status%20Effect%29\"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt;\" are related and use the same Opcode to induce the effect in the game engine.\nA creature affected by the Unconscious status effect is actually being manipulated in-game by Opcode 39, titled \"State: Unconsciousness [39]\". There are separate status icons for Sleep and Unconscious. You can think of sleep as a deep slumber, and unconscious as a \"knocked out\" or comatose state. An in-game message string will use \"\"Unconscious\" when that effect is applied to a creature.\nOpcode 39 applies the Unconscious effect (or \"Unconsciousness -\" is also correct), with a duration assigned. Depending on the cause, the code may also denote if the creature can be freed or awakened by damage from the state. The actual wording in the Opcode description is: \"Applies the unconsciousness effect to the targeted creature(s). If 'Mode' is set to 1, then the unconsciousness won't be removed by getting hurt\".\nIn general, certain creatures are protected and are immune to Opcode 39, such as Undead, constructs like Golems, Elementals, Demons/Devils and Dragons. An exception exists in the game, where Elves and Half Elves are resistant to Sleep with a 90% and 30% resistance respectively. However, Elven kind are not naturally resistant to unconsciousness. The coding in the game engine uses another Opcode titled as \"Protection: Immunity Spell and Message\" [324]\" to denote which creatures are susceptible to sleep vs. unconsciousness. This newer Opcode occurs in EE games, and not the basic game. The basic game engine had to handle this in a different way, and it is not always implemented consistently.\nSome examples of the use of the Unconscious status state/effect are the wizard spells \"&lt;a href=\"Bigby%27s%20Clenched%20Fist\"&gt;Bigby's Clenched Fist&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Bigby%27s%20Crushing%20Hand\"&gt;Bigby's Crushing Hand&lt;/a&gt;\" or a Dragon's &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Buffet\"&gt;Wing Buffet&lt;/a&gt;. An effect induced by a spell can normally be dispelled, and others are on a case-by-case basis - some cannot be cured or removed, and the affected creature must wait for the status duration to expire."}

Within the Underdark lie many wonders as well as cities, such as Menzoberranzan, possibly the most infamous and largest of the Drow City-States and is where both &lt;a href=\"Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Viconia%20DeVir\"&gt;Viconia De'Vir&lt;/a&gt; hail from. The Underdark is infamous for being deadly to both outsiders and those who consider it their home in no small part due to being infested with monsters like Aboleths, Illithids, Beholders, Hook Horrors, and Umberhulks, as well as natural disasters like cave-ins.\nPlot recap and entry into the Underdark.\n&lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; is in pursuit of Irenicus and Bodhi. Clues obtained from &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt;, statements from Irenicus, as well as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Journal%20of%20Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;First Journal of Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20Journal%20of%20Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Second Journal of Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; all point to the underdark as the location of their quarry.\nThe party eventually transitions to the underdark, from either the portal in the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Basement\"&gt;Spellhold Basement&lt;/a&gt; or by way of the shaft and &lt;a href=\"Magical%20Rope\"&gt;Magical Rope&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Underwater%20City\"&gt;Underwater City&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon the transition, a cut scene plays exhibiting a meeting between Jon and a matron mother of Lolth in &lt;a href=\"Ust%20Natha\"&gt;Ust Natha&lt;/a&gt;. Some insight is gleaned from this in that Irenicus has worked out some kind of alliance with the dark elves in the city. \nThe party then arrives in the underdark, and shortly after another cutscene movie plays for the beginning of chapter 5, introducing the chapter's plot and a sinister description of the underdark.\nGameplay begins afterwards, and it is up to the party to explore and investigate this strange place and track down Irenicus. For a first-time player, the game does not specify exactly what to do, where to go, or any initial \"must do\" actions.\nCreatures.\nRespawning\nOne-time\nMod content.\nTactical Mod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes various changes to Underdark creatures and assigns new AI scripts as part of various optional components selected during installation. The Balor, Mind Flayers, Beholders, Adalon the Silver Dragon, Kuo-toans, drow warriors and spell casting drow are all potentially improved. The game difficulty setting will adjust the numbers and type of creatures found as determined by the SCS Spawn scripts. Aside from individual creature improvements, there will also be potentially more enemies included in the Drow ambush, drow war party and Kuo-Toan bridge guardian areas, as well as more Umber Hulks and Mind flayers. The harder the difficulty, the more the challenge.\nQuest Mod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Afaaq%20the%20Djinni%20Companion\"&gt;Afaaq the Djinni Companion&lt;/a&gt; Mod has significant new quest content added for the Underdark and Ust Natha.

On higher difficulty levels, this encounter is most likely more difficult than anything taking place in the previous areas in Chapter 4. There is little time to prepare for it, so beware. \n&lt;a href=\"Eilistraee%27s%20Song\"&gt;Eilistraee's Song&lt;/a&gt; Mod begins in the Underdark and adds a new adventure and quests that span beyond chapter 5.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Quest Pack&lt;/a&gt; Mod adds a new area and a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; to the Western Tunnels.

It is referred to in the game as the \"City of Caverns\". If viewing files in the &lt;a href=\"Near%20Infinity\"&gt;Near Infinity&lt;/a&gt; editor - the Area is titled \"Sahguagin City\". Historically, the sahuagin denizens there used to have clashes with the &lt;a href=\"Drow\"&gt;Drow&lt;/a&gt;, and there is still a shaft and tunnel leading from the city to the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nThe city is currently ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Ixilthetocal\"&gt;King Ixilthetocal&lt;/a&gt; although it's embroiled in a civil war between the King and a &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Villynaty\"&gt;Prince Villynaty&lt;/a&gt; who wants to overthrow the possibly mad ruler. If the party accepted &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt;'s way out of &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;, the ship used to return to &lt;a href=\"Amn\"&gt;Amn&lt;/a&gt; is overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sword\"&gt;Silver Sword&lt;/a&gt; hunting &lt;a href=\"Githyanki\"&gt;Githyanki&lt;/a&gt; and then by marauding &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin\"&gt;Sahuagin&lt;/a&gt; - who will take you to their city by force.\nThe party is presented with a choice to side with either of the King or rebels. \nA third option exists that will place the party in conflict against the entire city (King's forces and the rebels). Simply never agree to cooperate with &lt;a href=\"Royal%20High%20Priestess%20Senityili\"&gt;Royal High Priestess Senityili&lt;/a&gt; at the very start of the entry to the city, or later do not agree to help the King. Or further, attack any of the King's forces after agreeing to help. All of those choices will make the city hostile, and close/prevent the &lt;a href=\"The%20prophecy%20of%20Sekolah\"&gt;The prophecy of Sekolah&lt;/a&gt; questline or shutter its progress - forevermore. \nRegardless of the path taken and choices selected, the goal at the end should be to be able to use the exit to the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt; - so that &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; can pursue &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nCertain architectural features can be described on the map of the city, and displayed as text description when the player hovers their 'cursor' over them:\nGameplay.\nThe main plot of this area is driven by the party's response to &lt;a href=\"King%20Ixilthetocal\"&gt;King Ixilthetocal&lt;/a&gt; desire for the player to destroy &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Villynaty\"&gt;Prince Villynaty&lt;/a&gt; and the rebel faction. \nIf the party rejects the King's plans and will not assist him, much of the quest lines, intrigue and potential dialogue will be nixed, and the entire saguagin presence in the city - both King and rebel forces will become hostile. Although a possible choice for the player, it isn't optimal and reduces potential adventuring, role play and experience point gains. It could also be difficult to do and will close down use of the temple store (which has a great selection of scrolls).\nThe abandoned city area.\nIf the party speaks with one of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Sahuagin%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Sahuagin Guard&lt;/a&gt; the party may hear:\nThe section of the city that is abandoned has drow architecture. To begin exploring, a staircase descends to this area. Watch out for a \"slime trap\", which can be detected and disarmed with sufficient skill. Moving onward is a hidden \"spawn point', which when a party member is near enough will generate various &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Spider\"&gt;Sword Spider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ettercap\"&gt;Ettercap&lt;/a&gt; creatures that are hostile and will attack any in their detection range. Continuing onward along the pathway will be a seen a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Golem\"&gt;Bone Golem&lt;/a&gt; guardian, that will move to engage a detected party member in combat. Just beyond the area where the golem was first positioned, is another hidden proximity trap. It too can be detected and disarmed with enough skill.\nMoving forward will be seen a pair of Imps, who initiate dialogue.\nAfter the Imps are finished with their \"game\" (or if the party refused to play and then the Imps departed) - the path continues and a &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; beholder creature can be observed, floating in front of a great chest behind it. The creature is neutral at first contact. When a party member nears, it will initiate dialogue, uttering:\nThe party can continue the conversation with this unusual creature. The party spokesperson's Charisma will be checked, and if it is at least 13, new dialogue options will present in the selection box. Also, certain companions if present in the party, such as &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Odesseiron\"&gt;Edwin Odesseiron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Jansen\"&gt;Jan Jansen&lt;/a&gt; also have interjections and compliment the dialogue choices. If the party spokesperson' charisma is too low, journal entry will display:\nAs the party navigates the dialogue, there is a path to just convince the Spectator to allow the party to look in the chest it's guarding and then retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Sekolah%27s%20Tooth\"&gt;Sekolah's Tooth&lt;/a&gt; item the party is looking for. Much amusing quips and observations from the Spectator will occur, and it will be pleased that its mind-numbing contract to guard a Chest are now pointless - and it can officially end the service - all thanks to the party. After all, the Spectator was to guard the Chest - not anything inside the chest.\nThere may be a different Journal Entry displayed:\nAnother option is to just attack the beholder and open the chest by force. Although this results in no extra experience point reward. \nIf the party is able to do it peacefully then an experience reward of 15,000 is shared by the party and the Sekolah's Tooth item. The party also gets the satisfaction of freeing the beholder from a terribly long contract job.\nThe Pit of blood.\nIn one lonely quadrant of the city is a long set of stairs leading down to a wretched stink - a charnel pool of bloody filth and water - inhabited by various creatures that thrive in such an environment. If the map is interacted with a text description displays:\nIf any party member is foolish enough to venture too close, the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Zombie%20Lord\"&gt;Sea Zombie Lord&lt;/a&gt; and other denizens will move forward to attack. It is likely that some or all of the creatures, including a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Lacedon\"&gt;Greater Lacedon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lacedon\"&gt;Lacedon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Zombie\"&gt;Sea Zombie&lt;/a&gt; monsters will pursue. If the party dares, they may send a few party members down into the muck and destroy them with prejudice. Be aware of the various disease attacks that a member can be exposed to, and worse. If the party is successful, various &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt; and potions may be collected from the twitching horrors.\nSahguagin rebel ambush and spawned enemies.\nAs warned by the King's forces, parts of the Underwater City are not controlled by the King. As the party maneuvers through the area exploring, then various groups of rebel sahuagin will \"spawn\" and attack any detected player members. This will occur even if the party is in possession of the &lt;a href=\"Rebel%27s%20Orb\"&gt;Rebel's Orb&lt;/a&gt;.\nNear the center of the map is a gigantic carved stone monument that is described as:\nWhen a party member moves within a certain hidden trigger point, a group of spawned rebels will ambush the party. This includes a &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin%20Priestess\"&gt;Sahuagin Priestess&lt;/a&gt; and group of crossbow wielding and spear armed saguagin warriors. They are hostile from the get-go. \nFour other spawn points exist on the map. The rebels are watching and waiting for intruders to attack.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod and the \"Tactical Challenges for BG2\" component allow the following option (excerpt from the mod readme):\nImproved Sahuagin\nThis component improves all sahuagin in the game (but especially the ones in the sunken city). \nNo new creatures are added, and no special powers are granted, but the sahuagin statistics are systematised and generally improved slightly, and their scripting is smarter. (Various clues in the vanilla game suggest that sahuagin priestesses are cleric/mages; I disregard this and treat them as standard clerics.)\nOverall, this component should be a bit more difficult than the vanilla sahuagin, but nothing like as powerful as Tactics' Improved Sahuagin.\nAs mentioned above the &lt;a href=\"Tactics%20Mod\"&gt;Tactics Mod&lt;/a&gt; can still be installed and used with the original classic BG2 game version. It won't work properly with the EE games."}

His faithful are then granted new, magical sight.\nLocation.\nThe Unseeing Eye appears at a certain location after a specific party action in the &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Hideout\"&gt;Beholder Hideout&lt;/a&gt; deep below the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvolvement.\nThe monster has to be defeated during the &lt;a href=\"Investigate%20and%20Destroy%20the%20Cult%20of%20the%20Eyeless\"&gt;investigation of the Cult of the Eyeless&lt;/a&gt;. The completed &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Device\"&gt;Rift Device&lt;/a&gt; is necessary to spawn the beholder. The Device also provides a means to weaken it, so that it is much easier to destroy it. Technically it isn't required to be used, but the game text message makes it clear that the party \"should\" use it.\nBackground.\nDespite being classified in-game as an ordinary beholder, the Unseeing Eye's physical description resembles more that of an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt;. Elder Orbs are beholders who have lost their eyesight and are thus unable to launch beholder rays but compensate by casting arcane spells like any other mage would do. However, the unseeing eye may still use at least one eye ray during a confrontation. \nGameplay.\nInitially, after a party member collects the second part of the Rift device, this will trigger an appearance of the Unseeing Eye at a specific location in a tunnel. When the second part is picked up a text message displays:\nThe Unseeing eye will appear in the tunnel, blocking escape from the chamber in which the second part of the rift device was found. At this point the Unseeing eye makes contact in your mind, remarking:\nIn a few moments the beholder will launch its prepared self-buff once it has detected a party member (the creature can see invisible and hidden creatures by script). It will force cast &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Energy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt; on itself (just once in the unmodified game).\nHowever, once the Rift device is fired at the beholder (the device is used like a wand), and it launches a variation of a lightning attack animation - which will strike the Unseeing eye and set the beholder's hit points to 10 with fire damage and will also remove all dispellable effects upon the creature at the same time from a super powered &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effect. \nAfter that attack, the Unseeing Eye takes on the form shown in the InfoBox. It now can be attacked and overcome in combat. Waiting a few moments to use the Rift Device until after the creature has got its protection spells up would be a smart tactical move - the device can take down the Improved Mantle, Protection from Energy and the Stoneskin in one fell swoop. The Rift's attack will go right through the Spell Turning untouched (it also won't remove that spell either).\nOf course, it will put up a fight. In fact, the Rift Device has actually made the beholder much more vulnerable than even a standard beholder - in that it has no immunities to status effects except for &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, it can be confused, stunned, paralyzed, held and other common disabling magical effects. This will not be the case if using the modifications in the Mod content section below.\nIf a second party member is detected that one will be the target of a &lt;a href=\"Beholders\"&gt;beholder's&lt;/a&gt; Fear Ray - (SPIN981.SPL): Save vs. Spell or be under a &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; effect. Projectile 209, spell power level 2. An Enchanter Spell School and Disabling Type spell.\nUnlike other beholders, it furthermore relies on its memorized &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; only, rather than that &lt;a href=\"aberration\"&gt;aberration&lt;/a&gt;'s typical \"ray\" attacks. These are &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;, four uses of &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word, Stun&lt;/a&gt;, three uses &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt; and two uses of &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt;. The Death Spell are primarily if any summoned creatures are detected.\nThus, the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Shield of Balduran&lt;/a&gt; is of no significance in this specific fight.\nMod content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod and the \"Tactical Challenges for BG2\" component makes major changes to the Unseeing Eye creature.\nNotes from the Mod Author: \nWith this mod and component installed it will be extremely difficult to defeat the Unseeing Eye if the Rift Device's one charge is not used against the beholder. With the mod, the creature is nigh invincible because it is equipped with a undroppable mod item that grants 95% physical damage resistance, several complete resistances to elemental damage, and immunity akin to a Demi-lich from spells. If the device is used upon the creature, it removes this device from the creature, and also deals 40 damage to it, as well as a super dispel magic effect.\nThe Elder Orb retains most of the beholder race eye stalks and can deliver eye beams that can: cause serious wounds, charm person, death ray, disintegrate, domination, fear, flesh to stone, paralyze, slow and telekinesis (to disable the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt; and or the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Shield of Balduran&lt;/a&gt;). These beams can fire even while spell casting. Expect about two beams per round, and at least one spell cast per round on top of that. Although the Unseeing eye does not have the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt;, the two &lt;a href=\"Death%20Tyrant\"&gt;Death Tyrant&lt;/a&gt; beholders that accompany it will have that ability.\nThe Elder Orb is immune to most hold effects, entangle, slow, web, stun and similar. It also has a permanent aura cleansing innate power that means it can fire off spells rapidly with no \"weave cool down\" delay. The creature cannot be backstabbed and can see invisible or hidden attackers. SCS Beholders are immune to most of their own eye beams, should they be reflected. \nThis creature has a full repertoire of Mage spells, including levels 1 through 9 offensive and defensive spells. Some examples include; Pierce Shield, Death Spell, Power Word Kill, Imprisonment and others. Depending on the game difficulty setting, the Unseeing Eye will employ up to two different sequencers and a spell trigger during the fight, if it can. \nThe eye initially opens up with a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Moment of Prescience\" with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod). The creature has a second contingency that will automatically launch later in the battle when a predetermined trigger is met - that reapplies the Spell Turning and Improved Mantle and summons two &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword%20%28creature%29\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt; allies.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod is installed, the creature's spells will be the SR versions."}

It overrides restrictions on &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt;, and race.\nUAI does not override restrictions on &lt;a href=\"ability%20scores\"&gt;ability scores&lt;/a&gt;. The rogue must still have 9 &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to use scrolls, 16 intelligence to use the &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Manual\"&gt;Golem Manual&lt;/a&gt;, 18 &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; to use &lt;a href=\"Composite%20Longbow\"&gt;composite longbows&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nUAI does not override normal ability equipment restrictions; the rogue still may not use &lt;a href=\"thieving%20abilities\"&gt;thieving abilities&lt;/a&gt; while wearing heavy armor, may not cast &lt;a href=\"wizard%20spells\"&gt;wizard spells&lt;/a&gt; while wearing any armor aside from and , and may not &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; with weapons outside of the normal single-class thief pool.\nIn the Enhanced Editions, UAI does not circumvent use of items that are only for a specific companion. This is achieved using &lt;a href=\"Opcode\"&gt;Opcode&lt;/a&gt; 319 which is added to the item. Some examples include Keldorn's &lt;a href=\"Firecam%20Full-Plate%20Armor\"&gt;Firecam Full-Plate Armor&lt;/a&gt;, Jan's &lt;a href=\"Jansen%20AdventureWear\"&gt;Jansen AdventureWear&lt;/a&gt;, Cernd's &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20High%20Forest\"&gt;Cloak of the High Forest&lt;/a&gt; and others.\nA &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20mage\"&gt;Specialist mage&lt;/a&gt; gains the ability to cast scrolls from their opposition school, but still may not scribe them.\nWhile this allows the Thief to use any spell scrolls, those will have a significantly lower caster level (10) than if a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; would cast the spell.\nFor items that modify spellcasting, those will generally work with any spellcasting classes the character has. For example, &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Cleric / Thief&lt;/a&gt; can now use &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Vecna\"&gt;Robe of Vecna&lt;/a&gt; to speed up their spells, which is normally mage-exclusive.\nUAI is a passive effect HLA that can only be selected once. Unlike other class abilities, it remains active even if the character &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual-classes&lt;/a&gt; at this stage.\nFor multi-classes, it will override their weapon restrictions so for example a &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Cleric / Thief&lt;/a&gt; is no longer restricted to cleric weapons. However, UAI still does not allow to spend any proficiency points in weapon types that their class is not normally &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;proficient&lt;/a&gt; in. So, a Thief who uses UAI to wield a two-handed sword would get a +3 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; penalty because they're not proficient.\nUAI is especially useful for dual-classed &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Slayer\"&gt;Wizard Slayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kensai\"&gt;Kensai&lt;/a&gt; characters, as it mitigates some of their primary item use restriction drawbacks."}

{"id": "5942", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5942", "title": "Ust Natha", "text": "Ust Natha is a &lt;a href=\"drow\"&gt;drow&lt;/a&gt; city in &lt;a href=\"the%20Underdark\"&gt;the Underdark&lt;/a&gt; located beneath the surface kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Tethyr\"&gt;Tethyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackstory.\nUst Natha is partially walled fortress city mostly built on a series of interconnected platforms above the natural bottom of its cavern, many supported on stalagmites, with most on the same elevation, but a few above the others. Buildings of note in the city include guilds for female and male fighters, a tavern, and a temple of Lolth. This city is run on the basis of several competing houses led by matron mothers.\nThe elven temple in Tethyr and city are fought over regularly by the drow and surface elves, though the silver dragon &lt;a href=\"Adalon\"&gt;Adalon&lt;/a&gt; guards the area and tries to limit the hostilities, often successfully.\nBehavior of the drow in the city.\nThis is a \"Drow\" city. It has a specific hierarchy and order to society. Drow females are the upper echelon of their society, followed by drow males. Almost all creatures native to the city are regarded as either drow citizens of Ust Natha, allowed visitors, or property (slaves, prisoners). The game has a script attached to many city inhabitants. This script covers several events which may occur, including a failed pick pocket attempt (even by a familiar) and drow inhabitants being attacked.\nIf the party doesn't meet quest timer deadlines, it will turn the city hostile as shown in the screenshot (left).\nIn most cases, attacking a citizen creature in the city will lead to near instant hostility by the inhabitants. As the drow's patron deity Lolth favors arachnids, killing a Giant Spider in the city is also considered a hostile act. \nKilling a slave is most likely not going to provoke a hostile reaction. Killing prisoners seems to be allowed, without much fanfare or complaint, the exception being the Trapped Djinni, &lt;a href=\"Dola%20Fadoon\"&gt;Dola Fadoon&lt;/a&gt;. \nKilling a wandering dog or Kobold seems OK, and even killing the visiting Mind Flayers or Githyanki is not going to cause a big reaction. There are some exceptions, so to be on the safe side, do not kill indiscriminately while under the Silver Dragon's Illusion enchantment. If the party makes the city hostile, then many quests will be closed, your illusion will be destroyed, and Adalon's task unfulfilled. Your party has failed its mission.\nShops/merchants in the city.\nThere are three drow merchants in the &lt;a href=\"Ust%20Natha%20Bazaar\"&gt;Ust Natha Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; platform buying and selling goods. Have a look at the items offered, as there are some unique items that are only found here in the game saga. Examples are the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Staff of Earth&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Firetooth%20%28dagger%29\"&gt;Firetooth (dagger)&lt;/a&gt;, and others. These one-of-a-kind items are only available here, so decide if they are worth buying or attempt to steal them. Once the drow city is made hostile or the party leaves the underdark the opportunity to shop here is unavailable.\nGameplay and walkthrough (abbreviated).\nGet into the city without alarming the drow.\nOnce the party has obtained their illusionary facade and the &lt;a href=\"Recover%20the%20Silver%20Dragon%27s%20Eggs\"&gt;Recover the Silver Dragon's Eggs&lt;/a&gt; quest - they may attempt to enter Ust Natha. As the party approaches the main gate\n(they'll cross a hidden trigger point), which will produce a drow official who then challenges the party, forcefully saying: \"Intruders without cause will be killed where they stand! Speak your purpose!\". \nThe player may remember what &lt;a href=\"Adalon\"&gt;Adalon&lt;/a&gt; told your party what to say and how to behave as \"drow\" from Ched Nasad. If Viconia is in the party, she'll chime in and help with the dialogue. However, if the player decides to not follow the advice and go with other certain dialogue responses, it is possible to foul up the process of convincing the official to let the party pass. This will doom your entry into the city, causing a failure to the silver dragon's required quest and resulting in a series of other failures for the party. So, pay attention to the dialogue, and try and steer clear of the obviously problematic responses.\nIf done properly, the gate official will allow entry and instruct \"Enter quickly, and be sure that you seek Solaufein's counsel. He of the Male Fighters' Society will instruct you on your conduct within Ust Natha.\"\nFirst area of Ust Natha.\nThe party may pass through the gate and transition within the city of Ust Natha. Your goal is to find &lt;a href=\"Solaufein\"&gt;Solaufein&lt;/a&gt;, as instructed by the gate official.\nWhen first going into the area, the player will observe a male drow complaining about a duergar slave, and then swiftly slays it. Seconds later a female arrives on scene and informs the male that the slave was valuable property, and he overstepped his bounds, and is slain in-turn as punishment. She killed her son to make a point. This illustrates the drow way of thinking in their society. Disobedience or incompetence to one's superior is punished.\nThe party can explore and look around if they wish, and there are some merchants on the entrance platform open for trading. But the main first task is to report in to Solaufein. He is further on deeper in the city - You'll find him on the main pathway adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Male%20Fighters%27%20Society\"&gt;Male Fighters' Society&lt;/a&gt; spire.\nMake contact with Solaufein.\nWhen close to the male drow fighter Solaufein, he'll initiate conversation with:\n\"\"Ahh. You are the newcomers that have been sent my way, I see. As if I do not have enough to accomplish in a day without suffering for the welfare of the weak!\"\nDialogue will continue, and the party may answer with selective responses that reflect the party's bearing, or perhaps ask some follow-up questions. In the end, he makes it clear that he's in charge of the party, and as unvouched visitors from Ched Nasad, you are to follow his commands. \nThe party has its next short-term goal, and that is to go back to the entrance platform and seek out Solaufein who will be with a Handmaiden. It seems that perhaps there may be a task to be assigned or other service the party will be ordered to perform. Note that there is a time limit for this (so do not tarry for more than 12 game hours) to find Solaufein again. The party may as well press on and get their mission going as soon as practical, as delay can cause consequences.\nMeet with Solaufein and the Handmaiden.\nAt the entrance platform/Bazaar area, the player will observe Solaufein and the Handmaiden &lt;a href=\"Imrae\"&gt;Imrae&lt;/a&gt;. They're both waiting on a circular raised \"patio\" platform with a staircase leading up to them. Your party spokesperson should initiate conversation with either of them. Regardless of which one is spoken to first results in a tongue lashing from Imrae, with threats and various insults delivered, which is common from the Handmaidens of Lolth. She'll eventually say:\n\"\"You are fortunate indeed that many of our finest warriors are busy with... preparations. Elsewhere. Fortunate enough that a matron mother has decided to make use of you. Cling to that sole hope, worms, and do not fail the matron mother... for if you do, the horrors of your punishment shall be far more terrible than had we beset you at the gate! Explain what has occurred, Solaufein. And be quick about it, male, for the Spider Queen demands my attention.\"\nSolaufein takes over and has dialogue with party about your upcoming task. You learn that the Illithids have captured a daughter of the Matron Mother, and the party and Solaufein are to rescue her. Solaufein says:\nSolaufein says that he'll scout ahead, and the party is to meet him in the area southeast of Ust Natha. He explains that you have up to 12 hours to rest or other pursuits, but to ensure you aren't late for the planned rescue.\nThe Githyanki visitors.\nNearby the front gate entrance to the city the player may observe two &lt;a href=\"Githyanki%20%28Race%29\"&gt;Githyanki&lt;/a&gt; creatures. One wields a bastard sword and the other looks as if it has an enchanted long sword. One of the creatures is a &lt;a href=\"Githyanki%20Captain%20%28Ust%20Natha%29\"&gt;ship captain&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is a &lt;a href=\"Githyanki%20%28Ust%20Natha%29\"&gt;sailor&lt;/a&gt; of some type.\nIf you initiate conversation with the sailor, it'll reply:\n\"\"Haaaa... speaking you your tongues, if you must, speaking to our captain must you be. Dealing with you I will not. I am but a sailor on the astral seas, faithful of the ethereal winds, drowling. City here is but a port for our battered ship. Leaving soon are we, surely. Leaving me alone you will, drow. We githyanki be here only because having no choice, us, with damaged ship.\"\nSpeaking with the captain allows the party to ask some questions of this unusual creature (unusual to surfacers). The captain isn't very thrilled to be talking with what he believes are drow. He may say:\nEventually the party won't get any further information from these Gith's, and they obviously have no love for the drow. You'll tell them that you are going to be on your way, to which the captain may say:\nThe Illithid ambassadors.\nAdjacent to the Ust Natha Tavern is a staircase descending down to a smallish circular platform. The party will be able to observe two male drow mages, and a female drow fighter. They seem to be engaged in a parlay or conference with two Illithid's dressed in some fancy robed attire. There is some on-screen conversation that can be overheard, if a party member gets close enough to the group. If you dare - then a party member must interrupt the group and initiate conversation. \"Is this a good idea?\", you may ask yourself. \nIf you address one of the drow mages and ask what is happening, he may reply:\n\"\"It would be better if you left the liaison alone. Dealing with illithids is tiring at best.\". If you try the other mage: \"Do not disturb the liaison. She has much to contemplate.\"\nIf you try and speak with either illithid you find they ignore you, with a quick flick of a tentacle towards you - as if to wave you away.\nButting in and asking the female drow liaison about this meeting will earn a sharp rebuke: \nIf you speak to her again, the anger will be heightened. And if done a third time? The party will find out the hard way.\nAfter a somewhat short parley, the entire group will eventually break up and leave the platform with their meeting concluded.\nIn a brazen and risky move it may be possible to attack the illithids, who naturally will become hostile and defend themselves. Remember, Adalon warned not to draw attention to yourself and jeopardize the hunt for her eggs.\nThe pursuit of the Elven Mage.\nFurther along on one of the pathways of the city, the party will observe a female surface elf, wearing the robes of a mage. She is sprinting, dodging and weaving around any traveling on the pathway. You'll see her wild eyes and frightened face as she breathlessly says to no one in particular:\nSoon after a male Drow Leader wearing adamantine chain mail and wielding a drawn scimitar will stop and ask the party:\nThe party can answer the leader by telling a lie and letting him know she went the opposite direction, or tell the truth, or say that you haven't seen anything. Each response will have a different reply from the leader. Perhaps you feel sorry for the elf, being hunted by the drow. Or maybe you are ambivalent and don't care, or do not wish to be involved. The choice is up to the party. The repercussions of this encounter are unclear at the moment. You do know that if caught, the elf will be in for a painful experience.\nNote that if you try and speak with the surface elf, she is too panicked to speak and won't hold still.\nThe spider buffet.\nFurther into the city past the Male Fighters society, the party will observe a male drow fighter standing sentry and guarding passage into a circular platform. Within the platform is a grisly scene - a duregar, kobold, wild dog and dwarf are struggling against a group of Giant Spiders. If you address the drow, he'll reply:\nThe party can ask some questions and or make some comments to the guard about this event. If the party makes it known that they do not approve of this slaughter by the spiders, then the guard will warn to not interfere, as these prisoners are condemned to die by the spiders of Lolth.\nThe combat log will display text coming from the prisoners in the midst of the spiders such as:\nThe party may still decide to save the prisoners by trying to slay the spiders before than can kill the unfortunate victims. Based on what the party knows of drow society, their cruelty, and worship of Lolth - they should know that disobeying a city official and destroying the revered giant spiders may provoke a response from the drow. Proceed with caution player - you were warned.\nThe duergar impasse.\nIf the party takes the passage (its marked on the map as \"To Upper Levels\") to the upper part of Ust Natha, then as they venture along a pathway, they will observe a pedestrian traffic jam ahead. Three duergar accompanied by two male drow fighters meet a drow priestess, trying to move in the opposite direction. At this point a animation cut scene takes over showing various text messages of the encounter. The priestess announces to the group:\nAnd so, this bottleneck and various confusion continues a bit longer until the priestess finally says: \nIf the party is inclined, they may sort through the fallen creature's gear for loot. They most likely won't be needing it any longer. Waste not, want not.\nThe Spelljammer dock.\nContinuing on past the duergar debacle, the party will arrive on another platform where an odd ship-like vessel with a sail is docked. Standing before it is a male fighter-mage clad in armor. If desired speak with the &lt;a href=\"Spelljammer%20Drow\"&gt;Ship captain&lt;/a&gt;. He'll say:\nThis drow is quite less moody and recalcitrant than others the party has spoken with. He has a certain affable flair and confidence about him, with a mischievous gleam in his eye.\nIn fact, he will offer some stories, and various answers to his current situation, and even offer to hire the party as crew. If the party gets through all the dialogue offered, then various \"Forgotten Realms\" and Dungeons and Dragons lore and trivia will be mentioned. You spy a bulging purse hanging from his belt as well.\nContainers.\nOn the main level of Ust Natha can be found seven separate containers that can be examined to see if there are any items to find within (or used for temporary storage by the party).\nThere may be various &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt; that's free for the taking - as well as a difficult to identify pair of bracers - which might be magically imbued with unknown power.\nMod content.\nTactical content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes some changes to the Drow in the Underdark and within Ust Natha, if you install the \"Improved Drow\" Component, the following is from the Mod author's Readme description of this component: \nImproved Drow\nThis component makes a number of small improvements to the drow of chapter 5 (it doesn't affect the drow of Sendai's enclave). It slightly increases the combat proficiency of drow soldiers, it adds a few extra drow to one of the Underdark ambushes and a few extra priests to the Ghaunadans; it improves the drow battlegroup defending the doors to the Underdark; it slightly optimizes House Jae'llat nobles and adds one more noble and a few commoner priests and mages.\nNotably, it also dramatically beefs up the defenses of Ust Natha (as of SCS version 8). The place is a \"drow city\", not the kind of place that even a 15th level adventuring party should be able to wipe out. Now, more defenders will continuously spawn. Initially, this will be disorganized, low-level groups. After that, the drow will get more organized and start sending serious war-parties against the party. Eventually truly powerful groups of mages and high priestesses will turn up.\nWarning: this component is not intended to make the conquest of the drow city somewhat more interesting and challenging: it is meant to make it virtually impossible, especially on higher difficulty settings. It's possible to beat the drow and conquer Ust Natha without exploits, but it will be extremely difficult and it's not the intended playstyle (i.e., if you manage to do it, don't complain to me that it's too difficult or time-consuming!) The sane thing to do is to get out as soon as you can; even that will probably be a bit trickier than usual.\nThis component is sensitive to the difficulty setting:\nSCS improved drow component gallery.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; Mod will place a \"Perfect Clay Golem\" to assist in defending &lt;a href=\"House%20Jae%27llat\"&gt;House Jae'llat&lt;/a&gt;. A \"Greater Stone Golem\" and \"Greater Clay Golem\" are present in the Temple of Lolth treasury room.\nQuest and other Mods with Ust Natha content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Adalon%27s%20Blood\"&gt;Adalon's Blood&lt;/a&gt; Mod allows you to make some choices, and if you choose to ask the Silver Dragon for her blood (rather than not getting any at all or trying to slay her for it), she will promise to give you some - if you slay the &lt;a href=\"Aboleth\"&gt;Aboleth&lt;/a&gt; for her. The battle to get rid of this abomination of evil will take place in the Bazaar area, and trigger near the Aboleth's Tank.\nDuring the meeting where you receive the Rescue Phaere task, you will be introduced to mod added &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/RoxanneSHS/XulayeEet\"&gt;Xulaye&lt;/a&gt;, who can join your party for the Ust Natha sequence of the game. She is a sister of Phaere with her very own agenda that adds further variations and choices to intrigues among the drow. One way or other, her time with the party will end when Ust Natha's main plot is done. (Note: If you take her in the party, make the NPC you kick out wait at the Bazaar platform to pick him or her up when you finally leave the drow.)\nThe Mod &lt;a href=\"Afaaq%20the%20Djinni%20Companion\"&gt;Afaaq the Djinni Companion&lt;/a&gt; has extensive extra content in the Underdark and Ust Natha. This includes a challenging quest, some choices to make, much dialogue, and possibly a conquest of another drow House in the city. New areas and maps are introduced.\nPlayer party character drow appearance mod portraits.\nThese portraits will replace the ones of your core Bioware and Beamdog party portraits after &lt;a href=\"Adalon\"&gt;Adalon&lt;/a&gt; places her illusion on you so you can enter Ust Natha. Your portraits will revert back to normal after advancing to the appropriate juncture in the questline."}

The ground floor serves as a large common area with a series of tables and seating, a bar, entertainment fighting pit, a dueling arena, as well as a Rest/Lust Chamber area. There is a staircase leading to an upper second floor. \nAttacking or making hostile any of of the drow patrons or staff will alert all the drow in the city that you are an enemy to be destroyed. Any open or incomplete quests involving the drow will be unable to continue. As you are \"visiting\" drow, all Ust Natha residents view you with a mixture of disdain, curiosity and suspicion. You are of a lesser status in Ust Natha. Keep that in mind with your behavior.\nTavern encounters.\nInnkeeper/Bartender/Store.\n&lt;a href=\"Drow%20Bartender\"&gt;Drow Bartender&lt;/a&gt;: is available for food, drink and the opportunity to rest, and perhaps more. He'll reply to your call for service with \"As you say, beds and spirits, that is what I am here for.\" The cost to rest here is 30 &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Piece\"&gt;Gold Piece&lt;/a&gt;s for an 8-hour period. During that period, you will not be disturbed or molested. This tavern employee is not particularly patient or willing to have a lengthy conversation, but he may provide a bit more information if you engage. The Bartender also has some goods available in his Store.\nDueling Arena.\nDuel Arena Manager: &lt;a href=\"Sondal\"&gt;Sondal&lt;/a&gt; is ready to answer your question about the duels taking place in a gated and partially enclosed area of the tavern. If addressed, he opens with \"Welcome. I trust that you have come to my dueling arena because you are tired of seeing pitiful monsters put to death in the name of sport..\" There are a series of duels available for a single party member to attempt. You'll first have to observe a match between Lasaonar and several other drow warriors. He'll win the duel. Through dialogue with Sondal and Lasaonar, he'll challenge the party representee to a fight.\nBeast Fighting Pit.\nFighting Pit: Speak with &lt;a href=\"Szordrin\"&gt;Szordrin&lt;/a&gt;. If you are female then he says \"\"Greetings, lovely female. I am Szordrin, the manager of the fighting pit... entertainment for us all and a chance to gain Lolth's favor\". If you are male he says \"Greetings, fellow male. I am Szordrin, manager of the fighting pit. Here the courageous battle enslaved beasts for the glory of Lolth... and our entertainment\"\". Should you agree to have a party member enter the fighting pit, you basically agree to battle to the death. A brief time is allowed to enter the pit, and then the door to it will be barred behind you. Soon thereafter a beast will appear via a teleportation-like animation in the pit. Hostilities immediately begin. Should you win, the door will open, and you should leave the pit and speak with Szordrin again. Some dialogue and a reward will be passed on for the effort and victory. Another match is offered as well. A total of four beasts are currently available to fight in the pit. Each one is progressively more difficult to defeat (in theory) with a higher monetary reward. Should you defeat all of the offered fights, a global will be set, which can influence your dialogue choices and how you are perceived by the drow in the city. You can build a bit of respect and fame in Ust Natha from winning in the pit.\nUst Natha Tavern Second Floor.\nUst Natha Tavern Second Floor is the uppermost floor of the Inn, only accessible via a staircase from the ground floor of the tavern below. The party enters on an open platform to which are connected two bed chambers (to the west) and a smaller descending stairway leading to another platform (to the east). From this platform is a staircase ascending to a larger platform (to the north) with a huge cage in the center. A ramp descends from the western part of this chamber leading to an observation pier above a pool of reddish muck of some sort.\nThis floor is heavily decorated with lush decor on the walls and ceiling. The mixed scent of incense and aromatic spices is intoxicating. Faint sounds of lust and pain drift and echo in the dim chambers. From the east is a discernable cry of anguish, then a muted explosion - followed by a chorus of laughter.\nThere are eight drow upon this floor, and three drow prisoners in the cage structure. You are free to engage any of them in dialogue.\nLust chambers.\nOn the main entry platform stand two male drow. The one to the party's right (east) if spoken to says \"\"Leave me be, &lt;MALEFEMALE&gt;. I am here to enjoy the time my House has given me to rest... and I do not intend to spend it talking to you.\"\nThe one to your left (west) is garbed as an Inn employee, and bids you welcome. If engaged in dialogue he may say \"\"You come from Ched Nasad. I have heard that the Nasadrans are stuffy and conservative. I am intrigued to see if this matter is the truth or not\".\nYou observe a female drow within a lust chamber. She holds a weapon in one hand and a goblet of drink in the other, and half smiles at you wryly. If you speak with her, she may say \"My most recent male has already left the chambers, and I am not prepared for another partner. Allow me time to rest\".\"\nIn the other lust chamber appears a handsome male drow, also garbed as an Inn employee. He says \"\"I greet you, &lt;MALEFEMALE&gt;, by the Dark Mother and the pleasure her children are entitled to. Here we breathe spices of luxury and enjoy the fruits of our conquests\".\nIf a male party member engages this drow, then the conversation ends quickly. However, a female party member gets an additional dialogue choice to partake in a special sensual oiled massage that will act as a rest period and also an extra feature that will heal all damage upon the party member.\nIf you head east and onto the descending stairs you'll observe a female drow patron. She ignores you and is self-absorbed. \nEntertainment prisoners.\nWithin a decorative yet functional cage are seen three drow prisoners. Two other drow outside the cage structure taunt and belittle them. One says \"Fools! You should have fallen with your House!\". The other exclaims \"\"Now the Mother Lolth has sentenced you to eternal torment in the Demonweb Pits! It is no less than you deserve!\". One of the Prisoners cries out with \n\"No! We are loyal to the Spider Queen! We are her faithful servants!\". It is up to you if you wish to intervene or get involved with this activity. If you have Viconia in your party, there may be some awkward looks.\nPast the cage and down a ramp to the pier structure is a cheerful drow who says to you \"Greetings, friend. Have you tried this amusement? You simply press the button here, and one of the foolish slaves who stands on that rune explodes!\"\". \nYou can try it for yourself for a fee if you are inclined. Perhaps if you are having a problem with a High Reputation, then this may be one way to reduce it."}

Galvena is addressing the battered and tortured &lt;a href=\"Claire\"&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt;. The party overhears various statements made, and Claire who sobs that she has always been loyal. Apparently, Galvena has decided to execute her, for various internal courtesan transgressions. That's the point when the party has arrived, non-too soon as it would happen. There is a chance to free Claire from this fate after all.\nMore debate and statements are made by Galvena and Vadek regarding the party's interruption - which not surprisingly leads to a hostile reaction. Vadek will attempt to begin spell casting to destroy the party, and Galvena will advance - wielding her flail. All this action occurs with poor Claire in a cell just feet away. Careful with Area of Effect spells in this tight space, as those could injure Claire and make the rescue moot. Claire has no protections from friendly fire, and if killed, it will end the whole mission. \nVadek's contribution to this conflict will hinge on if he can survive counterattacks long enough to not get disrupted and cast spells that can affect your party.

If the nearest or second nearest enemy to him is protected with some kind of spell protection, he can launch a Secret Word, Pierce Magic and or Breach. \nIf defeated, Vadek will drop an enchanted Quarterstaff and also has a score of enchanted darts.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises this mage and has assigned an Enchanter kit with a different set of memorized spells and new default \"Smarter Mage\" AI.

The two conversation options do not merely lead to different outcomes, they lead into two alternate realities. In one, where the player protests being aghast at his irresponsible approach to scientific research, he suddenly recalls that the wording of his spell was wrong; he has created deadly, hard-to-damage Green Jellies that can kill with just a touch, and only give 35 xp. He flees from his creations, still neutral, and disappears in seconds (just, and only just, enough time to kill him if the party has strong ranged attacks). In the second, and preferable, reality, the player asks him for a copy of the spell. The mere thought of others reaping the rewards of his work without sharing in the toil makes him hostile, and therefore easier to target, and his control over the Mustard Jellies (easier to hit, Poison and Slow, 2,000 xp each) is as complete as he had hoped. It will probably not do him any good, and once he is killed, the party gets 1400 xp and scrolls of Lightning Bolt and Web\n&lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt; Tomb - 905, 1730: Single &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;, coffin with 85GP.\nRevenant Tomb - 1900, 2840: See &lt;a href=\"Hentold\"&gt;Hentold&lt;/a&gt; encounter above.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghast&lt;/a&gt; Tomb - 4530, 2805: three &lt;a href=\"Ghasts\"&gt;Ghasts&lt;/a&gt;, Chain Mail +1, &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Monster%20Summoning\"&gt;Wand of Monster Summoning&lt;/a&gt; , Pearl Necklace, a Potion, Magic Arrows +1.\nConnections.\nNote 1: Yes, &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Durlag's Tower&lt;/a&gt; may be discovered by exiting this area from either the north or the west.

Their physical attacks can inflict a &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nDuring the main questline, vampires periodically appear in scripted events around &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt;. During some encounters, they seem to be attempting to turn some &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Thieves\"&gt;Shadow Thieves&lt;/a&gt; to their cause. Sometimes they succeed, other times the vampires can be slain by the Shadow Thieves if &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and their party assist them. Most notably, they appear as the members of the unnamed guild, or group that tries to overthrow the Shadow Thieves on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;'s orders. For article page linking purposes, this organization is titled &lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Vampire%20Coven\"&gt;Bodhi's Vampire Coven&lt;/a&gt; by the wiki, as the game doesn't have a consistent title for these vampires. Even Bodhi herself has no name for it. It could be described as a rival \"Guild\".\nThe game files indicate 34 vampire creatures just titled \"Vampire\". This excludes vampires with names like &lt;a href=\"Del\"&gt;Del&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Parisa\"&gt;Parisa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shyressa\"&gt;Shyressa&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these creatures are associated with questlines involving &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, and others have nothing to do with her. \nYou may encounter the following types of vampires in the game saga, that are basically in five varieties (with minor variations in each type):\n- &lt;a href=\"Fledgling%20Vampire\"&gt;Fledgling Vampire&lt;/a&gt;\n- Standard Vampire\n- &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Elder%29\"&gt;Vampire (Elder)&lt;/a&gt;\n- &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Ancient%29\"&gt;Vampire (Ancient)&lt;/a&gt;\n- &lt;a href=\"Vampyre%20%28Vampire%20Sub-type%29\"&gt;Vampyre (Vampire Sub-type)&lt;/a&gt;\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod has an optional component for Vampires, as follows:&lt;br&gt;\nImproved Vampires (BG2, BG2EE, BGT, EET)&lt;br&gt;\nThis component upgrades vampires' intelligence and abilities, roughly in line with pen-and-paper Dungeons and Dragons. They should target their magic more effectively, pick on people vulnerable to their level drain, and so forth. The component also standardizes vampire statistics a bit (usually increasing vampire ability scores slightly). It allows vampires to summon wolves, bats, or rats (the bat summoning was present in earlier versions but has been toned down), to drink blood (which drains Constitution) as well as draining levels, and to make much more use of their various shapeshifting abilities (bat, rat, wolf, gas cloud form).&lt;br&gt;\nThe vampire can also turn into a mist and regenerate, and then return to vampire form later in the battle - as well as can summon bats, rats or wolves. They can also transform into bat form or wolf form and \"hide\" amongst the similar looking summoned bats and wolves (SCS calls this \"'vampire trick\"s\" in the AI script). &lt;br&gt; \nWhile in bat or wolf form, the vampire has all of its original immunities as well as hit points, but a different attack. In the bat form, the base armor class is -8 and movement rate is raised (to 288% of normal movement). The bat can bite plus strength bonus, but it does not level drain or drain blood. As a wolf, the vampire will also have an increased movement modifier (288% over normal) and a 22 Strength. The wolf bite inflicts a 2d8 piercing damage plus strength bonus, but also does not level drain or drain blood.&lt;br&gt;\nSCS vampires have two equipped weapons in their \"quick weapon slots\". The first is the standard &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; attack, and the other is a \"Blood Drain\" attack that temporarily reduces &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; on the target and provides some healing to the vampire. Both attacks bypass magic resistance, spell level protections and have no saving throw. The vampire will choose the most effective attack based on the target's vulnerability to level drain. It knows if you are immune or not. SCS has assigned these weapons as &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; eligible attacks. \nSome SCS vampires are provided with a mod only innate ability to attain &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Dimension%20Door\"&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/a&gt; animation.\nSome SCS vampires can employ the innate ability \"Cloud of Bats\" (SPIN182.spl) which actually launches a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Insects\"&gt;Summon Insects&lt;/a&gt; spell directed at a target.\nAll SCS vampires have a potent &lt;a href=\"Domination%20%28Innate%29\"&gt;Vampire Domination&lt;/a&gt; ability, that allows a save with a penalty, and can be used every round. It can recognize if a party member is protected from &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Creature\"&gt;Charm Creature&lt;/a&gt; effects by item, spell or if the target is an elf. How often this is attempted is determined by the AI's opponent vulnerability assessment of targets in detection range and the game difficulty settings selected.&lt;br&gt; \nSome SCS vampires can use an alternate form of Vampire Domination called \"Mesmerism\" (SPIN182.spl). It behaves in nearly identical fashion to the Vampire Domination innate ability, except it has a -4 Save and induces an 8-round &lt;a href=\"Feeblemindedness\"&gt;Feeblemindedness&lt;/a&gt; effect. It can be dispelled. The SCS script may use this instead of the other ability if the target is protected from Charm effects. How often this is attempted is determined by the AI's opponent vulnerability assessment of targets in detection range and the game difficulty settings selected.&lt;br&gt;\nMost SCS vampires are revised and given a Fighter/Thief class, and of course, remain racially a vampire. This means that the vampire will get at least half to one extra APR. Should they attack from a hidden or invisible state, SCS has changed the .2DA files in the game to allow their attack weapon to count as an eligible &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; weapon. They will do at least triple damage and sometimes quadruple with a backstab hit, depending on the creature's thief XP level.\nThis component does affect Bodhi, but only if you don't install the \"Improved Bodhi\" component (in other words, if you want Bodhi to use her original-game abilities more effectively but don't want to give her the extra powers of that component, install Smarter Vampires but not Improved Bodhi).&lt;br&gt;"}

The ability is initiated via script by the AI. The effect is directed at a single creature target in visible range of the source creature and may affect any enemies of the vampire within the targeted creature's radius.\nThe Vampire Fear ability will require the target and those in the AoE to make a &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; vs. spell with a -4 penalty or suffer a &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; effect or a -2 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; penalty that lasts 12 seconds. If the affected creature has less than 4 Hit Dice, it saves to negate &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt;. If the creature has between 4-14 Hit Dice, it saves to avoid a THAC0 penalty. If the creature is 15 Hit Dice or greater, it will be unaffected.\nThe effect is non-magical and can't be dispelled. Once the effect duration has expired or otherwise been lifted, the target will no longer suffer Panic. \nIf affected by the ability, the targeted party member will have a \"Panic\" graphic Icon (No.36) displayed on their portrait until removed or the duration expires.\nVampire Fear will bypass &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be blocked by spell protections such as &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revised this to change the ability to a secondary type \"Disabling\" and changed the spell power level to 1 from 9, like most innate abilities. Game Play won't be affected."}

He has a propensity to avoid responsibility for his lawless actions, prefers to get others to do his work for him and place the blame for his wrongs on others.\nRegardless of whether you sided with &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aran%20Linvail\"&gt;Aran Linvail&lt;/a&gt;, Saemon will sail you to &lt;a href=\"Brynnlaw\"&gt;Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to rescue &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizards&lt;/a&gt;. If you sided with Aran he will betray you by summoning three of Bodhi's best &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s to attack you.\nAfter you have escaped the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; Dungeon, Saemon will appear again. He will advise you to free all of &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Irenicus'&lt;/a&gt; test subjects to aid you in your battle against their captor. This advice needs to be taken as you cannot defeat Irenicus without them.\nAfter Irenicus has fled, Saemon will offer to sail the party home. If you reject this, you have to go through the portal into the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;. If you accept his offer, he says that his ship is no longer available, and blames the pirates. He says you can steal the pirate's ship. On your journey home you will be assaulted first by &lt;a href=\"Githyanki\"&gt;Githyanki&lt;/a&gt;, then by &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin\"&gt;Sahuagin&lt;/a&gt; and taken to a &lt;a href=\"Underwater%20City\"&gt;Sahuagin city&lt;/a&gt;, while Saemon leaves you behind and teleports away. Either way you will end up in the Underdark, eventually.\nIn Saemon will be engaged in smuggling and using a cave on the edge of &lt;a href=\"Amkethran\"&gt;Amkethran&lt;/a&gt; as his base. When you first explore the village, you will observe and overhear a verbal confrontation between mercenaries and Saemon - he being accused of stealing their items. Once Saemon notices you, he will shift the blame onto you, causing the mercenaries to believe you have actually purchased and possess their stolen items, leading to a fight in the village streets. Naturally, Saemon makes his timely exit with the aid of some sort of teleportation, leaving you to sort out the hostile mercenaries.\nAfter defeating &lt;a href=\"Abazigal\"&gt;Abazigal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sendai\"&gt;Sendai&lt;/a&gt;, Saemon, still in Amkethran in the smugglers' cave, will offer to help you gain entry into &lt;a href=\"Balthazar\"&gt;Balthazar's&lt;/a&gt; monastery. He will disguise himself as someone who is trying to cleanse the Bhaalspawn taint and get you through the gates. Saemon then meets a monk who is glad that he has brought &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; to Balthazar and expects the ward to be drugged so no trouble would be caused, though Saemon says that he didn't drug you and felt he owed you one. He will then flee while you have to fight the monk and his mercenaries.\nDuring this encounter, Saemon has a brief window before he teleports, where he is vulnerable to permanent death (BG2EE 2.6.6). For someone that is tired of Saemon's escape from karmic justice, it is an opportunity to finish his story. A character with &lt;a href=\"The%20Paws%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;The Paws of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and a Vorpal Weapon (&lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sword\"&gt;Silver Sword&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt;) at the edge of the encounter will get in one attack before Saemon teleports. Pray your dice roll goes well. Worry not, you can still enter the monastery if Saemon is dead, because of the timely intervention of an &lt;a href=\"Elminster%20Aumar\"&gt;old friend&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you previously finished the &lt;a href=\"Dorn%27s%20bloody%20path\"&gt;Dorn's&lt;/a&gt; quest line and inscribe Saemon's name in the &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Retribution\"&gt;Scroll of Retribution&lt;/a&gt;, you will encounter this small event after defeating &lt;a href=\"Balthazar\"&gt;Balthazar&lt;/a&gt; and leaving the monastery. Go to the small soldier training area (between &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%209\"&gt;The monastery gates&lt;/a&gt; and the Temple of Waukeen). Here lies the dead Seamon killed by an angel (as you can hear from bystander customer). Dorn will make some comment about this, and you can loot the body for &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Superior%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Superior Healing&lt;/a&gt;, 2 &lt;a href=\"Water%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Water's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Journal%20of%20Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Journal of Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Shadowstep\"&gt;Rod of Shadowstep&lt;/a&gt;. \nSaemon creature file versions.\nAMSAEMON - The version and most speaking appearances. \nOHB2SMON - Also in ToB - no dialogue, Neutral to start. \nOHDSAEM - in ToB, Saemon's lootable corpse is found as part of &lt;a href=\"Dorn%27s%20bloody%20path\"&gt;Dorn's bloody path&lt;/a&gt; adventure. \nPPSAEM - In regarding the voyage and embarkation at &lt;a href=\"Brynnlaw\"&gt;Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt;.

Safana may become a level 7 Thief at 40,000 XP, which will still allow her to reach a level 8 Mage at 90,000 XP (130,000 XP total). This allows a significant investment in 2-3 Thief skills, primarily lock-picking and find traps, as well as a third proficiency point, well placed in . If you want maximize Thief level - dual class immediately after Safana reaches level 7 Thief in order not to waste any earned experience. But if you want reach level 9 Mage to gain level 5 spell slots - dual class at level 6 Thief.\nShe always has the following items when joining the party: a dagger, 10 throwing daggers and studded leather armor, except in\u00a0\u00a0where her weapons are a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ninja-To\"&gt;Ninja-To&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and 20\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dart\"&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPrologue.\nWith an imported party, Safana will temporarily replace a non-SoD thief (such as &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;) until the party returns to the &lt;a href=\"Ducal%20Palace%20%28SoD%29\"&gt;Ducal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, coming in with mid-tier equpment.\nRecruitment.\nSafana is available from , go to the second floor of &lt;a href=\"Elfsong%20Tavern%20%28SoD%29\"&gt;Elfsong Tavern&lt;/a&gt; and see her kicking &lt;a href=\"Coran\"&gt;Coran&lt;/a&gt; out for being promiscuous. She'll then decide to join your march to fight &lt;a href=\"Caelar%20Argent\"&gt;Caelar Argent&lt;/a&gt; to shake off her boredom and stay away from Coran.\n\nSafana and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Coran\"&gt;Coran&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0have been travelling the Sword Coast together and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0finds Coran at the house in &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Tethir%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Forest of Tethir&lt;/a&gt;. She has been kidnapped by wolfweres, and Coran asks the player character to &lt;a href=\"Coran%20and%20the%20Wolfweres\"&gt;rescue her&lt;/a&gt;. However, she has conspired with the wolfweres to kill\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0because she wants to claim the bounty. Safana is killed by &lt;a href=\"Lanfear\"&gt;Lanfear&lt;/a&gt; the wolfwere, as she had other plans in mind for Coran.\nPersonality.\nHer general demeanor is flirtatious, and sometimes her personality borders on provocative. Safana seems to have an overwhelming confidence in herself as a sexual entity. This is most likely due to her beauty (which many take notice of). If the player character dismisses Safana; he or she claims that the party does not need another thief, even if she is completely gorgeous. This is then followed up by the player character's inner monologue reading: \"What am I saying?\""}

In the original ', he is &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20evil\"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt;. In the ' he is chaotic neutral. Saladrex the Ancient One (as referred to by the Githyanki Captain) has his &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%E2%80%93%20Saladrex%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Lair&lt;/a&gt; connected to the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Githyanki%20Encampment\"&gt;Githyanki encampment&lt;/a&gt;. \nHe provides useful information about &lt;a href=\"Carston\"&gt;Carston&lt;/a&gt; and the warring factions created by his mischief, as well as some insight about the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt;, including how to solve a puzzling problem and how to get Carston out of his glass prison. You can ask him all sorts of questions, even about the \"Imprisoned One\". However, he has grown very suspicious of outsiders, thinking they come to steal his hoard. He enjoys adulation and is not overtly looking for conflict or violence. Should you indulge his penchant for flattery, and perhaps \"stroke his ego\" a bit more, you may find out exactly why he is in Watcher's Keep. If you are short with him or rebuff his boasting then he will tire of you. This could lead to hostilities. \nIf defeated, Saladrex drops the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Ram%20%2B4\"&gt;Staff of the Ram +4&lt;/a&gt;, arguably the best &lt;a href=\"Quarterstaves\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; and highest &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;damaging&lt;/a&gt; weapon for a &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; in the saga.\nGameplay.\nSaladrex will initiate dialogue when a party member is in detection range, which is also the same range as the nearest party member can see - the dragon is neutral at the outset of the dialogue.\nThe dialogue can lead to a peaceful outcome, or hostilities. It is up to the player and the choices selected that will determine this.\nIf the party undertakes certain actions in sight of the dragon, it will turn hostile, including directly attacking it, setting traps or snares, and the presence of summoned/conjured creatures.\nAnother trigger for a response is certain arcane or priest spells cast on the party within the dragon's detection range - examples include &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Energy&lt;/a&gt;, and others.\nSaladrex can &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt;.\nCheck the InfoBox for Saladrex's scripted actions and general triggers for use of spells, and innate abilities.\nExpect several &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Buffet\"&gt;Wing Buffet&lt;/a&gt; attacks and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Dragon%20Breath\"&gt;Red Dragon Breath&lt;/a&gt; blasts during the battle. The breath weapons are used no sooner than every three rounds.\nAlmost all of Saladrex's spell attacks are not interruptible by damaging the dragon, and \"ForceSpell\" cast.\nNote that when the dragon's hit points first fall below 50%, a &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; spell will trigger, mending all of his wounds.\nSee the dragon's immunities and special abilities listed on the InfoBox. \nWhen the beast is defeated, take the gold and loot which can be recovered from Saladrex's corpse.\nBugs.\nSaladrex's regeneration ability timing mode is set as permanent, but that setting requires a duration to work, and it has no duration, and therefore it doesn't operate correctly. This is an issue throughout the game in several other creatures as well. This issue is included in &lt;a href=\"The%20Enhanced%20Edition%20Fixpack%20%28EEFP%29\"&gt;The Enhanced Edition Fixpack (EEFP)&lt;/a&gt; and is already identified to Beamdog for possible fixing in the future.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises Saladrex in many ways. Especially if you install the \"Smarter Dragons\" component (which is responsive to the game difficulty selection). His SCS AI improves targeting and recognition of opponent's protections, which means he will fight smarter and not waste attacks on someone he cannot hit or damage. It will also influence his tactical options and attack methods. First, some mention of the dragon's stats and abilities. In most cases, all of the unmodded ones are still applicable:\nImmunities in addition to the unmodded dragon version:\nAs stated in the article above, Saladrex has access to several innate Dragon abilities (which are manifested as \"spells\"). They are uninterruptible. A little bit more on what SCS does with the following:\nSpells: Saladrex is scripted to use the following spells, as determined by the AI's need: Magic Missile , Melf's Acid Arrow , Fire Arrow , Remove Magic , Slow, Greater Malison, Breach , Death Spell, Ruby Ray , and Power Word Blind. \nWith the installation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, some of Saladrex's arcane memorized spells will be the SR version.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod adds the \"Secret Manual of Golem Building (vol. 6)\" to the dragon's hoard."}

This section of the adventure actually falls under the &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Garren%27s%20child%20from%20Firkraag\"&gt;Rescue Garren's child from Firkraag&lt;/a&gt; questline in the player's journal - even though this part of the quest isn't necessary to complete the child rescue. This might be a developer oversight.\nAquisition.\n&lt;a href=\"Samia\"&gt;Samia&lt;/a&gt; will initiate dialogue with the closest party member in a corridor within Firkraag's Maze area. A proposal is offered from her, and if accepted, will trigger a Journal entry, as follows:\nGameplay and abbreviated walkthrough.\nSamia's proposal accepted.\nAfter Samia speaks to the party, various dialogue will ensue - she appears to be an armed and armored fighter with scimitar and shield. She is alone, and neutral at the moment. If the party listens and doesn't immediately attack her, the party will learn her purpose in this dungeon, and have the opportunity to ask her several questions. Samia is a level-headed and reasonable speaker and quite charismatic in her own way.\nParaphrased here are the final remarks from her:\nMore dialogue occurs, and if the player decides to help her, she'll promise compensation and will provide &lt;a href=\"Samia%27s%20Key\"&gt;Samia's Key&lt;/a&gt;, saying:\nThe maze.\nThe corridor in which you spoke to Samia is fitted with several doors, leading West but mostly North. The key she provided will fit one of them, allowing access to the interior maze and burial chambers she spoke of, somewhere beyond. An Automap Note shows the door and a text display shows: Entrance to the maze. It is likely that the King's tomb may be warded against intrusion, so a party member who can discern traps could be of use while exploring the maze. There are probably further doors that are locked as well, needing lockpicking, or forced with strength, or even opened magically with a &lt;a href=\"Knock\"&gt;Knock&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nAdvance through the unlocked door north. A mostly empty room with some dusty debris on the floor is all that is seen, as well as two closed doors. A door to the north or one to the west.\nMoving through the western door leads into another chamber, littered with debris and various trash. Two closed doors are seen, one leading North and the other west. Moving rapidly toward the party from the shadows is an attacking &lt;a href=\"Fell%20Ghast\"&gt;Fell Ghast&lt;/a&gt;. It seems the maze isn't uninhabited after all. A search of the room in one corner leads to finding the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20King%20Strohm%20III\"&gt;Book of King Strohm III&lt;/a&gt; and some other random treasure, possibly a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20to%20Flesh%20Scroll\"&gt;Stone to Flesh Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. The ghast may be carrying a shiny bauble (as they often do) as a keepsake or to occupy its time between meals of manling flesh and bone marrow. Perhaps this Book is the text Samia sought?\nOf course, it couldn't be that easy to solve this task.\nThe room where you found the book has two closed doors. The one to west is a smallish chamber, devoid of furnishings and only some cobwebbed wall shelving. Surprisingly some sort of Genie, maybe an Efreeti stands before you, calmly staring into your gaze. If you draw close to the magical creature it speaks: \nThe creature turns hostile. You must defend yourself!\nThis creature is just one of several &lt;a href=\"Mask%20guardian\"&gt;Mask guardians&lt;/a&gt; within the maze. If the party is able to defeat its physical form, it shrinks into a planar vortex and disappears - leaving behind a single Piece of Burial Mask. What is this for? And what are you supposed to do with it? One thing noticed during the battle with the strange creature is that this guardian was most likely an Efreeti or possibly a Noble Efreeti. That explains the fireball cast upon the party and the eye watering acrid sting of partially combusted sulfur.\nExamination of the Piece of Burial Mask notes the following description:\nHaving heard the cryptic message from a guardian and having examined the found Piece of Burial Mask from the defeated guardian, the party has correctly deduced that exploring this maze and area definitely has something to do with a King Strohm III. The presence of guardians also points to the place being purposefully protected from intrusion, and the mask pieces may be key to solving the whole thing. It now seems that Samia was not lying about the importance of this place and the potential for special texts and perhaps treasures hidden within.\nDelve further and seize the Mask Pieces.\nThe party must penetrate and explore the rest of this maze. More guardians are present ahead. There will be doors to examine, and rooms to search. Methodically scan for traps, and expect some doors to be locked, or maybe even find that there are \"false doors\" that seek to confuse and distract as they lead nowhere.\nFind and destroy the remaining guardians. Each will utter some words of their duty and strange portents of doom for any would-be grave robbers. Ensure all pieces of the mask are collected.\nIn one surprise chamber, a &lt;a href=\"Director\"&gt;Director&lt;/a&gt; beholder will be discovered, which is hostile. It will begin its attack script if any creatures are in its detection range. See the creature page for details.\nAssuming the party is successful in getting all six Mask Pieces, when this occurs a screen text message will display:\nAnd the player's Journal will update as well with:\nEventually the party will come to a chamber (located north of the Director beholder, and nearby one of the Mask guardians). A door leading north is locked, and despite attempts to open it will not budge. Examining the door will reveal an on-screen text message:\n&lt;br&gt;\nDefeat the Final mask guardian and explore King Strohm's tomb.\nWith the clue about the Mask on the door, the party can take the completed &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20King%20Strohm%20III\"&gt;Mask of King Strohm III&lt;/a&gt; and equip it on a party members helmet slot. This action acts as the key needed to open the final door to King Strohm's tomb. \nIt also has one other effect, and that is to reveal the invisible &lt;a href=\"Final%20mask%20guardian\"&gt;Final mask guardian&lt;/a&gt;. This guardian will attack the closest detected party member in melee combat. The guardian resembles a sort of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Elemental\"&gt;Fire Elemental&lt;/a&gt;. For details about the being, see the creature article.\nWhen defeated, the party may enter and explore the last room, which is the tomb of King Strohm III. The player will discover two items in a floor niche amidst some debris, including &lt;a href=\"Peridan\"&gt;Peridan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scale%20Shield\"&gt;Dragon Scale Shield&lt;/a&gt;. When these items are picked up, a script trigger will initiate.\nSamia and cohorts make an appearance.\nBlocking the path out of the maze are Samia and a group of allied relic hunters. Paraphrased below, Samia will speak:\nSamia and her five cohorts will then initiate hostile attacks upon the party. The player has been lied to and must defend against this assault. The following creatures are your new enemies:\n&lt;a href=\"Samia\"&gt;Samia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akae\"&gt;Akae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chak\"&gt;Chak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ferric%20Ironblade\"&gt;Ferric Ironblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaol\"&gt;Kaol&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Legdoril\"&gt;Legdoril&lt;/a&gt;. See their individual pages for details. Additionally, a short journal entry will pop up as soon as the enemy party begins hostilities that basically summarizes that the PC is now aware that she and her party intended to ambush, kill and loot the party all along.\nIf defeated, a journal entry will update:\nAnd so, this ends Samia's proposal."}

The only elemental effects that can harm this golem are &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; (although at only 50%) and &lt;a href=\"Acid%20damage\"&gt;Acid damage&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Sand Golems are completely invulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt;. They are the same general size as the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Golem\"&gt;Flesh Golem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brain%20Golem\"&gt;Brain Golem&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe golem's melee attack dishes out 3d10 &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt; and it is modified by their superior strength. The fist attack counts as a +4 enchanted item for the purpose of what it can strike. They typically only strike once per round, but under the effects of their innate &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Haste\"&gt;Golem Haste&lt;/a&gt; ability, their &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt; increase to 2.\nSand Golems normally empower themselves at the beginning of combat with a \"Golem Haste\" innate ability. This bestows them with a \"normal\" &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt;. It should last for 72 seconds, but it can be dispelled. The haste effect can also be applied to the golem's allies (if there are any) in a 15' radius around the creature when the ability is initiated (possibly hasting other nearby golems or allies). The golem's movement rate will also double while hasted. \nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod and the installation of the \"AI Enhancement's\" component improves many aspects of creatures encountered in the game. In regard to golems, the mod implements the following:\nImproved Golems (BG2, BG2EE, BGT/EET)&lt;br&gt;\nThis component doesn't really make golems smarter (they're supposed to be stupid) But it streamlines their scripts a bit, gives their weapons a sensible range, makes them immune to \"Lower Resistance\" and to poison, and tries to prevent situations where golems get stuck behind barricades. It also fixes an animation glitch in the Iron Golem animation - this hopefully makes iron golems a bit prettier when they attack and blow clouds. As of SCS version 22, it also gives clay golems a cursed-wound weapon, as in PnP Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\nSCS revises the typical Clay Golem fist melee weapon &lt;a href=\"GOLCLA.ITM\"&gt;GOLCLA.ITM&lt;/a&gt;. When the golem hits a target, it applies an instant \"Cursed Wound\" effect (DW#CURSE.spl).\nThe golem hit inflicts its rolled damage, but that damage is now Cursed. \nUpon a hit, a lighting animation will play over the target, the combat log will show a text display \"\"Cursed\" and another one that says \"Unable to Heal\"\". This means that any damage incurred by this weapon cannot be healed by normal means (such as a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Light%20Wounds%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Cure Light Wounds (spell)&lt;/a&gt;. However, a &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; effect can heal this damage.\nWith this component the clay golem is immune to all the status effects in the unmodified version, plus the following spells and additional status effects: &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plant%20Growth\"&gt;Plant Growth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nSand Golems with SCS do not have any innate spells or the Golem Haste ability.\nThis golem now has a melee attack range reach of 2, instead of the unmodified creature's range of 1."}

Therefore, the effect is not constant, but rather is activated when needed, so long as the item is not drained of charges. Its effect is removed by anything that would normally end the Wizard spell Invisibility.\nIn the original \"Baldur's Gate I\" with the \"Tales of the Sword Coast\" expansion, the ring would be destroyed if all of its charges were used up, having neglected to sell and then re-buy it, in order to recharge it back to its maximum number of charges. This could be quite expensive with a base item value of 20,000.\nIn \"Baldur's Gate II\" the ring has one charge per Rest Period and is temporarily \"drained\" not destroyed, so there's no reason to sell and re-buy it anymore in order to recharge it, but instead just rest. Its price has also been lowered significantly.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Cespenar\"&gt;Cespenar&lt;/a&gt; can use the ring to upgrade &lt;a href=\"Thieves%27%20Hood\"&gt;Thieves' Hood&lt;/a&gt; (also requires an &lt;a href=\"Antidote\"&gt;Antidote&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0and 10,000).\nVarious game-controlled NPCs will employ an undroppable Sandthief's ring coupled with the \"useitem.bcs\" script in order to attain invisibility. An example is &lt;a href=\"Regis\"&gt;Regis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Encounter%20-%20Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Encounter - Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt; area."}

Despite this, Saradush became an important way station for trade in the area surrounding the Lake of Steam. Given its proximity to several kinds of terrain, along with increased prominence as trade traffic with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Riatavin\"&gt;Riatavin&lt;/a&gt; rises, Saradush also become a haven for travelers and adventurers alike.\nLater in Saradush history, the unpopular ruling Count Santele was overthrown by the even more tyrannic &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt; half-orc war lord Gromnir Il-Khan. At the same time, a woman named &lt;a href=\"Amelyssan\"&gt;Melissan&lt;/a&gt; came and brought as many Bhaalspawn as she could to the city for their 'protection'. Unknown to them, she was actually Bhaal's right-hand servant and had really lured them to Saradush to gather them all in one place - allowing them to be killed together and Melissan able to gather more of Bhaal's essence for her cause. This would eventually lead to one of Melissan's cohorts, Yaga-Shura, besieging and sacking the city.\nGameplay and walkthrough (abbreviated).\nTravel to Saradush.\nThe party has already had an opportunuity to experience the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane%20%28area%29\"&gt;Pocket Plane (area)&lt;/a&gt; and was introduced to the &lt;a href=\"Solar\"&gt;Solar&lt;/a&gt;. The party has encountered &lt;a href=\"Sarevok\"&gt;Sarevok&lt;/a&gt; and had discussion with the protagonist's \"dead\" brother. Additionally, the party has also completed the first of several challenges - specifically the Challenge: Retribution. \nWhen the party is ready to continue the adventure, exit the pocket plane. A Journal Entry will display soon:\nArriving in Saradush.\nNext a cut scene cinematic will play about the siege of Saradush. Narration and a violent scene of burning buildings and flaming catapult missiles are featured. This transitions into another cutscene focused on the main steps in front of Castle Saradush. A mob of townsfolk are gathered and face a group of human and orc guards. They seek an audience with the town's current ruler, &lt;a href=\"Gromnir%20Il-Khan\"&gt;Gromnir Il-Khan&lt;/a&gt;. The guards refuse, warning all to disperse or face their wrath. Another NPC named &lt;a href=\"Melissan\"&gt;Melissan&lt;/a&gt; talks over the mob and addresses all. She seeks to calm the situation, and says:\nThe soldiers aren't listening and prepare to attack the crowd. Melissan shouts:\nAt this moment the party appears only feet away from the gathering and observes the soldiers' advancing upon the hapless unarmed townsfolk. Melissan says out loud:\nA final soldier shouts that the party are intruders into the city, and to attack. The soldiers are now hostile and change their focus to the party. Defeat the &lt;a href=\"Il-Khan%20Soldier\"&gt;Il-Khan Soldier&lt;/a&gt; forces, and check out their loot drops. The townsfolk flee the local area.\nConverse with Melissan.\nOnce the soldier threat is finished, Melissan will address the protagonist. During her explanations there may be a chance to interject, and further along ask some questions. Some paraphrased dialogue below:\nYou learn more and find out your next goals in the saga:\nShe continues:\nThere are several questions and replies available should the party wish to delve further. Afterwards Melissan teleports away. At that time the player receives two Journal Entries:"}

He is the main antagonist in the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBackground.\nSarevok is one of the &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;, mortal children sired by the Lord of Murder, &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Time%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Time of Troubles&lt;/a&gt; as a part of the &lt;a href=\"Deities\"&gt;god's&lt;/a&gt; plan to circumvent his prophesied death. Sarevok was one of many children who were to be sacrificed by the dead god's priesthood, but the ritual was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"Harpers\"&gt;Harpers&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; was rescued by Gorion himself, Sarevok was left to wander and lived as a street urchin. He was later adopted by &lt;a href=\"Rieltar%20Anchev\"&gt;Rieltar Anchev&lt;/a&gt;, the regional leader of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Throne\"&gt;Iron Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter years of tutoring and encouraging by &lt;a href=\"Winski%20Perorate\"&gt;Winski Perorate&lt;/a&gt; to research the prophecies of &lt;a href=\"Alaundo\"&gt;Alaundo&lt;/a&gt;, Sarevok became convinced that the prophecy focused on him: by destroying his fellow Bhaalspawn and engineering murder on a massive scale, he will ascend to godhood and assume Bhaal's place as the new Lord of Murder. He concealed his true identity, and was aided in his quest by the Iron Throne, through which he had forged a criminal empire.\n\"Baldur's Gate\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;the story that started it all&lt;/a&gt;, Sarevok concocted a plan to use the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Throne\"&gt;Iron Throne&lt;/a&gt; and several bandit groups to drive &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amn\"&gt;Amn&lt;/a&gt; into war.\nSarevok appears as a large, imposing man who frequently wears spiked plate armor and a decorative skull-like helmet with jagged teeth in place of a visor, styled after one of the avatars of &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;. He speaks with a low, booming voice and is strong enough to wield a &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt; in one hand. Sarevok is a powerful &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer\"&gt;Deathbringer&lt;/a&gt;, proving capable of slaying an arch-mage like &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt;.\nUltimately Sarevok does not achieve his ambitions. His failed attempt to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; provoked an unraveling of his plans. Exposed as the true mastermind behind the iron crisis on the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast\"&gt;Sword Coast&lt;/a&gt;, Sarevok flees to a ruined &lt;a href=\"temple%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;temple of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;beneath Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; to which Gorion's Ward tracks him. Sarevok is slain in the ensuing battle ending the game of \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" and the '. The player party (excluding Imoen) starts automatically in &lt;a href=\"Korlasz%20Family%20Tomb%20First%20Floor\"&gt;Korlasz Family Tomb&lt;/a&gt; if ' is installed.\nGameplay.\nSarevok's combat capabilities differ between \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\", the ' and the '. In all editions he is a &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;level 15&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginal \"Baldur's Gate\".\nIn addition to 10% resistances to all kinds of &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;, he has 100% resistances to all &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage\"&gt;elemental damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magic%20resistance\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Due to his slow gait, he is a straightforward opponent for melee or ranged warriors. However, wizards and priests have no way of bypassing his magic resistance. Sarevok is immune to the resetting traps in the Temple of Bhaal, so a fleeing player is likely to fall victim to traps during evasive maneuvers. He has 7/2 &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23A\"&gt;attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;, effectively 3.5, resulting from his grandmastery in &lt;a href=\"Large%20Sword\"&gt;large swords&lt;/a&gt;. With his &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and weapon proficiencies accounted for, he has an effective &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; of -5.\n\"Tales of the Sword Coast\".\nWith the expansion installed, Sarevok's 100% magic resistance is removed completely, together with the 10% physical melee resistances. However, the resistance against &lt;a href=\"missile%20damage\"&gt;missile damage&lt;/a&gt; is raised to 50%. Elemental resistances are also reduced by 10, to 90% for all of them. Instead his &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt;s were all set to 1 and he wears a that applies a Normal &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt; on him whenever a game is loaded. His THAC0 is \"raised\" to 2. Accounting abilities and equipment again, this makes an effective -9. His attacks per round, however, are reduced to only 2 \u2013 which effectively makes 4, regarding the haste, 1 attack per two rounds less than without the expansion. The haste, though indefinite, can be &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;dispelled&lt;/a&gt; with a power of 3, however, setting the attacks per round back to a mere 2, completely ignoring the grandmastery with his weapon. Through the also newly equipped &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; he becomes immune to &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;s, and his &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;armor class&lt;/a&gt; is improved by 1 due to increased &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Enhanced Edition\".\nAll of the &lt;a href=\"%23Tales%20of%20the%20Sword%20Coast\"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt; mentioned changes are carried over into this edition. The only effective change to Sarevok is that he has fewer attacks as a result of the use of the Baldur's Gate 2 engine. This means he has a 1/2 attack less from grandmastery and only receives 1 extra attack from haste (instead of double attacks).\nSimilar to other characters it is possible to kill Sarevok prematurely at Candle Keep library (Korevas 15.000 XP) with the same method as the ghost at Ulcastar (Critical with a poisoned weapon or traps) triggering his death sfx from the final battle but without any cutscenes. Doesn't have any effect on the story.\nAchievement.\nKilling Sarevok finishes or completes the game.\n\"Shadows of Amn\".\nSarevok returns, in a manner of speaking, as &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20Sarevok\"&gt;Wraith Sarevok&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%207\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II Chapter 7&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 as an apparition representing the Wrath of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's ward&lt;/a&gt;. The player must fight the ghost of Sarevok in order to complete the \"Test of Wrath\" in the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Hells\"&gt;Nine Hells&lt;/a&gt;, either by giving into wrath and transforming into the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;, or by rejecting the power of &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; that Sarevok demands you wield and refusing to initiate bloodshed. See the &lt;a href=\"Finding%20Irenicus%20in%20Hell\"&gt;Finding Irenicus in Hell&lt;/a&gt; quest page for details.\n\"Throne of Bhaal\".\nHaving refused to pass on to whatever afterlife or oblivion might've awaited him, in Sarevok's deceased spirit spies &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Plane\"&gt;pocket plane&lt;/a&gt; forming and makes his way there.\nRecruitment.\nSarevok is available to recruit from &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%208\"&gt;Chapter 8&lt;/a&gt;. The player finds this out as part of the normal course of Throne of Bhaal's gameplay. He bargains for a fraction of &lt;a href=\"Bhaal\"&gt;Bhaal's&lt;/a&gt; divine soul to reincarnate him, though he assures that doing so will neither harm &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;, and he would now be entirely mortal. You can either offer a part of your soul or convince &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; to do so. Once Sarevok has been reincarnated, he will then share his knowledge about the prophecy and is willing to fight for you.\nGameplay.\nCompared to his statistics in \"Baldur's Gate\", he has gained 1 point of &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;, 3 points of &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and 2 points in &lt;a href=\"charisma\"&gt;charisma&lt;/a&gt;, but has lost 2 points of &lt;a href=\"wisdom\"&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt;. His high stats allow you to &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt; him into either a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, although dualling any character at such a high level is inadvisable, especially to mages, due to the length of time it would take to level up enough to regain his fighter abilities in this stage of the game.\nBecause he was killed in the events of \"Baldur's Gate\", he is technically no longer a &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt; thus doesn't have any special abilities related to the Lord of Murder, but he still retains the skill &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Assault\"&gt;Deathbringer Assault&lt;/a&gt; - See that article page for details.\nHis starting equipment is &lt;a href=\"Two%20Handed%20Sword%20%2B3\"&gt;Two Handed Sword +3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Full%20Plate%20Armor%20%2B1\"&gt;Full Plate Armor +1&lt;/a&gt;, 30 &lt;a href=\"bolts%20%2B1\"&gt;bolts +1&lt;/a&gt;, 30 &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;bolts of lightning&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Light%20Crossbow%20%2B2\"&gt;Light Crossbow +2&lt;/a&gt; and a helmet. He joins the party as a level 17 &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;.\nChange of alignment.\nSarevok is destined to exist in the Ward's shadows even in his afterlife \u2013 you may influence his personality, and eventually change his &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; by the end of \"Throne of Bhaal\".\nThere are three banters with him throughout the game that might prompt the change. Should you decide to do so, you must refrain from telling him you'll kill him again, and you mustn't talk down to him. Dialog options can help or harm the change; some paths have more than one chance to have an effect, while some choices will apply a doubled harmful effect from a single option, and in some other cases the effects depend on whether or not Sarevok has given an oath. If the number of positive change conversations surpasses the number of harmful change conversations by \"two\", Sarevok's alignment will shift. You'll know it has occurred when he concludes the conversation with the line \"&lt;a href=\"%23BSAREV25s137\"&gt;I... I see.&lt;/a&gt;\"\nTip: The quickest and most reliable way to trigger the conversations required for the change of alignment is to have Sarevok join your party, kick everyone else out (temporarily) and sit idly for about 15 - 30 minutes to trigger each conversation. When the change is successful, reassemble your party (as any other conversation initiated by your other allies during idle time appears to reset the timer for your conversation with Sarevok).\nAchievements TOB.\nWelcome, Brother.\nRecruited Sarevok.\nA Sister's Sacrifice.\nConvinced Imoen to restore Sarevok with her soul."}

He and two of his nearby friends, &lt;a href=\"Zaelas\"&gt;Zaelas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garuk\"&gt;Garuk&lt;/a&gt;, are now considered Cult Outcasts. \nLocation.\nSassar is standing near a sarcophagus in &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Tunnels\"&gt;The Old Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, in an unconventionally locked section called the Inner Chambers, marked on the player's map as &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Tunnels%23Lair%20of%20the%20Cult%20Outcasts%20and%20The%20Lower%20Reaches\"&gt;Lair of the Cult Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;.

When I discovered the true depth of his evil I escaped and met up with others who had left the cult. We tried to stop the beholder, but we lost the senses he gifted to us for taking our eyes. We are truly blind, stumbling in our efforts to stop this evil! ...I discovered that [the Unseeing Eye's] purpose for coming here was to gain the powerful artifact below. It is an item of such destructive power that the gods themselves determined it should not be used again. It was split in two and this half was secreted here. It is protected against intrusion by powerful magic and beasts that live in the caverns. Many of the beholder's followers have perished trying to retrieve it. I know, my Lord, that the beholder has the other half of the rod! If he were to acquire this half, he would be capable of wreaking terrible destruction! We tried to get the second half of the rod ourselves, to use its destructive power to defeat the beholder. That is the only way to destroy the creature. The beholder has failed to acquire the rod because the gods have cursed the item. This lets you determine the artifact's true worth... or threat.\"Sassar also explains that one half of the rod is not enough and says he will tell you how to get the second half once you return with the first half. \"...The beholder's half must be stolen for the power to be used. I know of a way to do this. Retrieve the first half and I shall tell you of it.\"\nShade Lich Sarcophagus.\nHe also warns the party:\"This chamber we are in is safe...so long as the sarcophagus is not opened. I would ask that you do not try to open it yourself... I sense great evil from it. And I do wish my brethren and I to remain safe, here.\"\nRift Device part.\nAgree to get the first half of the rod and your Journal will update:\"I've stumbled across Sassar, who was once the high priest for the beholder until he learned of the creature's true intentions. It has come to this place to recover a piece of a powerful rod that lies in the dungeons below, the match to the piece it already has. Many in the cult have been sent below to make the attempt, and all have apparently failed. Sassar claims that the gods cursed the rod because of its great power, but he couldn't tell me more. He did say, however, that the only way to destroy the beholder would be to use the rod against it. I must retrieve the part of the rod below and then Sassar will tell me how to steal the other half from the beholder.\"Returning from the Lower Reaches, after you have obtained the first Rift Part Device, Sassar will once again speak to you:\"Is...is that you? have you returned successful? ...Let me tell you, then, how the second half of the rod can be acquired. The Unseeing Eye is in a great pit in the center of the cult compound. You cannot enter the pit by the stairs-- the beholder's minions would slay you. But you must get into the pit. There is a niche where the beholder stores his treasure... including the rod. There is a safe way to get to that niche. One of our friends is still in the cult. You must approach him and say the phrase 'the eye is blind.' He will then know who you are and be able to help you. You will find him by the Pit of the Faithless...do hurry, my Lord! The beholder continues to mesmerize and murder the innocent even as we speak!\"You then learn the identity of a Cult Traitor, Sassar's friend &lt;a href=\"Tad\"&gt;Tad&lt;/a&gt;:\"...Remember, do not speak to Gaal. If he senses that you have half of the rod, the plan is doomed. Speak only to Tad!\"When you are through talking to Sassar, head back into the &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Tunnels%23Pit%20of%20the%20Faithless\"&gt;Cult Domain&lt;/a&gt; to speak with Tad. Your journal will also have a new entry:\"Now that I have returned with half of the rod, Sassar has told me of how to steal the other half from the beholder. The beholder lives in a great pit in the cult's temple that cannot be entered directly. I am to find a friend of Sassar's who stands near the Pit of the Faithless and, through him, gain access to a secret entrance to the pit and a niche where the beholder keeps his treasure...including the other half of the rod.\"\nWARNING: If at anytime the cult becomes hostile, forcing you to kill them and their god, before you retrieve the first part of the rod, access to the levels below the Pit of the Faithless will be closed off, even if you have gotten Gaal's Key, and the first half of the rod. Furthermore, Tad will no longer be in the pit to open up access to the levels below the pit. Sassar will only have the following to say upon your return from the Lower Reaches, after which he and his two friends disappear from the game:\"You are a great and wonderful being for what you have done. May the gods smile upon you forever for doing this for that creature.\""}

The save is successful if\u00a0the resulting roll\u00a0meets or exceeds the creature's adjusted saving throw score.\u00a0The adjusted saving throw score is formed by applying bonuses and penalties from both the creature and the effect to the creature's applicable base score.\u00a0The lower the score, the higher the chances of beating it (just like attack rolls and &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;).\u00a0If the\u00a0save is successful,\u00a0the creature will either avoid the effect entirely or\u00a0experience an altered or weakened version of it.\nFor example, &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt; is currently level 17 and is struck with a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;.

The fireball spell offers no additional bonuses or penalties to the save, so the adjusted saving throw score is 6-4=2. His roll of 3 meets or exceeds the adjusted score (2), so his save attempt is successful and as a result he will only take half damage.\nHow it works.\nIn the\u00a0context of this article, the term \"effect\" refers to &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0conditions\u00a0(e.g., blinded) and\u00a0\"some\" sources of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;).\u00a0\nThe game has two systems for determining if an attack succeeds: &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and Saving Throws.\u00a0From a high level point of view, think of THAC0 as handling physical attacks and STs as handling magical or\u00a0\"unusual\"\u00a0attacks (but THAC0 and STs act on the opposite sides of the attack from each other). For example, whether or not a sword succeeds at hitting a creature is handled by the THAC0 of the attacker and whether or not a spell succeeds at affecting a creature is handled by the saving throws of the defender. Things can get a bit fuzzy however, since a magical sword may have a chance of applying additional effects. Whether the magical sword hits is handled by THAC0, but its additional magical effects would be handled using saving throws.\nDepending on the nature (or source) of the effect being resisted, one of five different ST scores will be used:\nThe base values of the ST scores are determined by a character's &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Class%20Group\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and level. For example, a first level &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; has a \"save vs. death\" score of 14 and \"save vs. spell\" of 17. A first level &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0has the same score for death but a 12 for spell. By level 21, the fighter's scores have improved to 3 and 6 and the mage's to 8 and 4, respectively. Classes in the same &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Class%20Groups\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0tend to have the same saving throws, but there are some exceptions (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s).\nA base score can be modified by bonuses and penalties from various sources. Temporary modifiers come from:\nPermanent modifiers come from: \nA third source of ST modifiers is the effect being saved against. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt; spell gives targets no ST against damage, but gives an ST bonus of 6 when saving against its other effects and the spell &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death\"&gt;Finger of Death&lt;/a&gt; imposes an ST penalty of 2 when attempting to resist it.\nThe character record screen shows a character's saving throw scores. A high level fighter with a base \"save vs. spell\"\u00a0score of\u00a04\u00a0might see an entry like this, \"Spell: -2 (-6)\". The number in parentheses (-6) is the sum of all the fighter's current \"save vs. spell\" modifiers. Negative numbers indicate a bonus, and positives a penalty. The first number (-2) is the effective score, which is calculated by adding the modifiers to the base (4 + -6 = -2).\nFrom the above example, you might think our warrior's spell saving throws will always succeed (since the worst d20 roll will always be bigger than the target score of -2), but harmful effects often come with ST\u00a0penalties. For example, our warrior may face a high-level enemy whose attacks require a \"save vs. spell\" at a penalty of 10. This increases the warrior's target score to -2 + 10 = 8, reducing his chances of success to 65%.\nThe game often refers to bonuses as positive numbers and penalties as negatives. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Helm of Balduran&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0mentions \"Saving Throws: +1\", even though that number is reflected as a negative when looking at the character record. This isn't just true of saving throws. That same helm offers a +1 AC bonus, but the Inventory and Combat Stats screens both show it as a -1 instead. To avoid confusion, just remember that bonuses always lower the target score (or increase the roll) and penalties increase the score (or lower the roll) and ignore the sign.\nUnlike attack rolls, it is still possible for a roll of 1 to succeed; there is no such thing as a critical miss\u00a0when making saving throws. If a character is immune to an effect, no saving throw is needed to avoid the effect (and none will be performed).\nAn effect can specify one of 3 saving throw designations:\nNormally, when a saving throw succeeds, the game will display the following feedback (when a character fails their save, no feedback is recorded):\n (creature name): Save vs. (type): (roll number after applying the \"save modifiers\")\nFor example:\n Edwin: Save vs. Spell: 11\nThere\u2019s one exception however, if the effect being resisted has a saving throw bonus and the target wouldn\u2019t have made the successful save without the bonus, then the message will not be displayed at all. For example, let's say a low level mage with an effective Spell ST of 10 is hit by a level 1 chromatic orb. The chromatic orb has an ST bonus of 6, which means the mage needs to roll a 4 or better.\nBonus.\nThe term \"saving throw bonus\" when listed on items or effects is ambiguous. A bonus can be applied in two ways:\nEffectively, this is the same thing. The difference is from a role-playing point of view:\nIn this wiki, we try to avoid ambiguity in text and explain which mechanism is used. However, it is possible you find ambiguous expressions. In this case a \"+1 bonus\" will refer to improved rolls, where a \"-1 bonus\" will refer to lowered saving throw requirements and conversely a \"-1 penalty\" will refer to worsened rolls and a \"+1 penalty\" to increased requirements.\nRacial bonus - \"Shorty\" saving throws.\nCertain Races get a \"Racial Bonus\" to specific saving throws when the creature's &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; is above a certain value. They apply to &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halfling\"&gt;Halfling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee &lt;a href=\"http%3A//baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/%2522Shorty%2522_Saving_Throws\"&gt;\"Shorty\" Saving Throws&lt;/a&gt;. Note that player characters receive these bonuses, especially as they level up. However, the Game creature files do not receive the Shorty Bonuses, as they do not level up. So, these racial bonuses are a player only advantage over the game's opponent creatures.\nSave progression by class groups.\nThe following table shows the default save progression by level for each &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class group&lt;/a&gt;. Some classes and kits have individual bonuses that improve their saves further.\nMulti-class characters get the best saving throws for each of their class levels.\nThe following classes and kits get further save bonuses on top of their base group:\nIf the main character transforms into &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;, it will override the base saves above from his/her class, and set them all to 2 instead, which can then be further improved by all the modifiers.\nMonster saving throws.\nMonster saving throws very often follow the standards of one of the aforementioned class groups - whether they're actually assigned a traditional class or not -, which can make guessing their vulnerabilities an easier task, based on what kind of archetype they fit in. For example:\nAs mentioned before, this is very often the case, but it must be noted that some monsters do feature completely unique saving throws, such as &lt;a href=\"Ettercap\"&gt;Ettercaps&lt;/a&gt; whose saves (4/5/5/6/5) don't match any particular class group nor even any multi-class save progression.\nBGWiki writing formats.\nAs often seen in-game, for example &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Princes\"&gt;Ring of the Princes&lt;/a&gt; states the ST bonus in the description as \"Saving Throws: +1\" (positive number) but is actually implemented as a -1 (negative number) in order to boost the ST, BGW will list all modifiers which directly modify creature's ST scores as -n bonus or +n penalty. While the \"save modifiers\" in game are described as, for example in &lt;a href=\"Silence%2C%2015%27%20Radius\"&gt;Silence, 15' Radius&lt;/a&gt;, \"make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with/at a -5 penalty\", where the stated number directly modifies the d20 roll number, BGW will list all \"save modifiers\" as +n bonus or -n penalty to better synchronize how game works and so that all of the numbers can be directly applied to the minimum roll formula above.\nHowever, using the game's own writing when referring to a Bonus or Penalty, see the quote below from the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt; spell:\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod makes use of all varieties of saving throws to a much different extent than the unmodified game. As stated in the main article above, the game has a distinct tendency to favor the Save vs. Spell as the primary save requirement, even for effects and causes that clearly should be for a different saving throw category. With the SR mod there are a better distribution of all saving throw varieties, such as Wands, Polymorph and especially Breath Weapon saves."}

If the player fully completes that mission, Scar would be informed that the Seven Suns has been infested with doppelgangers and that his friend &lt;a href=\"Jhasso\"&gt;Jhasso&lt;/a&gt; is alive and well. Scar will pay the party 2000 for the information and he'll double it if the party agrees to go back and eliminate the doopelgangers.\n&lt;a href=\"Missing%20Citizens\"&gt;Missing Citizens&lt;/a&gt;.\nScar then wants the player to investigate the disappearances of random people in &lt;a href=\"East%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;East Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;.

Scar will pay the party 1300 for discovering and eliminating the reason for the missing citizens and he'll toss in an extra 3000 for returing the items (the ruby ring) to their rightful owner.\nAfter the second mission, Scar introduces the player and their party to &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Eltan\"&gt;Duke Eltan&lt;/a&gt;, who then gives the party their third and final mission in the fifth chapter. It is important to know, that after introducing you to Duke Eltan, Scar leaves forever, so you might want to complete his two sidequests beforehand. \n(If you are intent on killing him for the 9,000 XP, and various +1 loot, due to his large amount of Hit Points, hitting him with Cloudkill is the easiest route to take to achieve this. Where he is not resistant to poison, and is only Level 6, so only has 6 Hit Dice, he must make a save vs poison at -4 penalty or be slain).\nLater on, whilst the player is back in &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20Six\"&gt;Chapter Six&lt;/a&gt;, Scar is attacked and murdered by two &lt;a href=\"doppelganger\"&gt;doppelganger&lt;/a&gt;s. One of the doppelgangers then took the shape of Scar and attacked Duke Eltan. Though the Duke overcame the attack, he did receive injuries and to make things worse, his healer, &lt;a href=\"Rashad\"&gt;Rashad&lt;/a&gt; was actually a doppelganger whose 'cures' only made the Duke's health worse."}

In the latter case, they are commonly called \"spell scrolls\" and are used for the purpose of casting magic. In Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II, spell scrolls have restrictions on what classes can use them. \nScrolls.\nRegular scrolls, typically called \"scrolls,\" have no magic function and often carry valuable bits of written information that pertain to characters or the world setting. Letters also fall under the scroll item type. Some scrolls can be very important and advance the central plotline or may be required to progress in some quests.\nSpell Scrolls.\nSpell scrolls are a type of item used for the casting of magic, and have 2 main functions. First, by right-clicking they can be written (scribed) into a character's spellbook, where inscription has a chance of success based upon the character's &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and/or specialist school. Second, spell scrolls can be a limited-use item to cast a spell directly, without needing to have the spell prepared or scribed. \u00a0\nThe 3 magic categories of spell scrolls are arcane, divine, and protection. These correspond to the spell type on the scroll. eg Wizard spells are arcane, Cleric spells are divine, and non-type protection spells are protection. Note: since divine spells are innately learned, divine spell scrolls are less common than the others. Notably in , there are no divine spell scrolls, instead various temples offer to perform divine spells for gold. In divine scrolls are found only in Durlag's Tower. \u00a0\nGameplay/mechanics.\nIdentification.\nTo quickly ID which magic category (arcane, divine, protection) a spell scroll belongs, there are signs to reference. Arcane scrolls list the magic school in parenthesis below the name. Protection scrolls have a green icon. Divine scrolls have a blue icon. \nScribing.\nScribing a scroll simply means writing it successfully to the spellbook. (The actual rules for \"casting\" spells from memory are covered in [link]). To do this right-click on the scroll and select 'write.' If a caster hasn't scribed a spell but has the ability to do so, that scroll will be highlighted green. As mentioned previously, writing a scroll to a character's spellbook is not guaranteed to be successful; the rate of success depends upon the caster's &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; score and/or specialist school. Specialist mages get a 15% bonus in writing spells from their specialization school, but a 15% penalty for all schools outside it. \nOnce a spell has been scribed, a scroll is no longer needed to cast the spell, however it still must be memorized and then only has a limited number of uses per rest (depending on the caster's level). \nAs a limited-use item.\nAs a broad 'rule of thumb', the rules for using scrolls are: arcane scrolls can be used by arcane casters, divine scrolls by divine casters, and green protection scrolls by nearly everyone with INT 9 (except for Wizard Slayers). There are, however, some exceptions based on class. For a definite list of spell scroll usage by class, refer to the table below. Note that casting via scrolls doesn't have the same restrictions as casting from memory, and although some information on the wiki pages may appear inconsistent with the rules, this table was vetted by a top wiki contributor. \nSpell scrolls can be used before the caster reaches the XP level required to cast the spell from memory. For example, a level 1 mage can cast the level 5 &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; spell if they have the scroll in inventory. This makes spell scrolls very powerful in certain scenarios. (One example would be if playing solo as a dual-class Level 2 M&gt;F, the character can cast high level mage spells from scrolls whilst gaining high levels in the fighter class). "}

Torches and oil lamps shed some illumination in the dank interior, and a brazier with coals glows against one wall with a pot of some simmering gruel upon it.

If it connects upon a target, there is a 10% change of inflicting a &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;Disease&lt;/a&gt; effect, that can really hurt, inflicting 6 &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt; per second for one turn. That will eventually kill any party member who does not cure it before hit points are all gone. Additional hits are cumulative as well, so it is deadly indeed. Standard poison antidotes will suffice, or an appropriate Cleric spell. \nThe zombie can launch an innate ability (SPIN 666.spl) that is basically a ranged &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; attack that bypasses &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; spell protections, and ignores spell school and secondary type defences. A save vs. Death negates, or two levels are drained. \nThe sea zombie lord's final throes manifest in death with a &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; application over the corpse. A fitting end for such a repulsive creature. Breath deeply the fragrant scent of victory. As any Cloudkill, it can be prematurely ended with &lt;a href=\"Zone%20of%20Sweet%20Air\"&gt;Zone of Sweet Air&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod adds an extra smarter AI script to the creature for improved tactical behavior and opponent vulnerability assessment. The creature may quaff its &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt; if hurt to a pre-set threshold of damage."}

However, they were petrified by a &lt;a href=\"Basilisk\"&gt;Basilisk&lt;/a&gt; the owner of that home had under his control, and their &lt;a href=\"Felonius%20Gist%27s%20Statues\"&gt;statues&lt;/a&gt; later sold to an &lt;a href=\"Felonius%20Gist\"&gt;art collector&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;heart of the city&lt;/a&gt;. After retrieving knowledge of the helmet's whereabouts from unknown sources, now most likely dead, our informant, another evil mage, wishes to acquire it \u2026\nAcquisition.\nThe task can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Degrodel\"&gt;Degrodel&lt;/a&gt;, the evil mage mentioned above, who can be found in his &lt;a href=\"Degrodel%27s%20Home\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; on the southern border of the city's &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;northwestern district&lt;/a&gt;. He wants to take advantage of this &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; that was skilled enough to bypass all of his personal guardians: two &lt;a href=\"Helmed%20Horror\"&gt;Helmed Horror&lt;/a&gt;s, two &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Guard\"&gt;Doom Guard&lt;/a&gt;s and three &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Stalker\"&gt;Invisible Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHowever, Degrodel's not very patient with the trespassers, and any answer other than accepting the quest will lead to him helping &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and party to leave this world, supported by four freshly summoned guardians: two Doom Guards, one Helmed Horror and one Invisible Stalker.\nWalkthrough.\nNorthwest Baldur's Gate.\nAfter announcing as the reward, not negotiable, Degrodel equips the party with six scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20to%20Flesh%20Scroll\"&gt;Stone to Flesh&lt;/a&gt; and the location of the building where the statues are located: \"The &lt;a href=\"Felonius%20Gist%27s%20Manor\"&gt;estate&lt;/a&gt; can be found west of the fairgrounds in center of town.\" \u2013 although not without a warning that the thought of betrayal might be unhealthy.\nThe scrolls will come in handy, as you will have to speak with the correct one to find out what happened to it.\nCentral Baldur's Gate and Undercellear.\nAfter arriving at the heart of the city and a short visit to &lt;a href=\"Diviner%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;the fortune teller&lt;/a&gt;, who unfortunately can't help with further information regarding the current task, the house of the art collector indeed is found across the street to the west of the fairgrounds. Next door is the &lt;a href=\"Drakon%20Tavern\"&gt;Drakon Tavern&lt;/a&gt; and, just as all houses of renowned &lt;a href=\"Nobleman\"&gt;noblemen&lt;/a&gt; in the whole of &lt;a href=\"Faer%C3%BBn\"&gt;Faer\u00fbn&lt;/a&gt; should be, it is well labeled as Felonius Gist's Manor.\nThe owner appears to be about to leave, or he might have heard something when the lock on the left one of two doors was &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;picked&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, standing just behind the entrance, &lt;a href=\"Felonius%20Gist\"&gt;Felonius Gist&lt;/a&gt; seems to be too outraged to react to a horde of roustabouts and ruffians storming his estate.\nThe party now has the option to cement that impression of themselves, and rush on to a collection of statues in the adjacent hall, or to negotiate with Felonius Gist. To remain undisturbed by him requires either , a threat of force or some apologies and the promise to leave \u2013 otherwise he will summon two &lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Fist%20Enforcer%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; and flee.\nWhatever the decision \u2013 passing the nobleman and moving to the building's northwestern wing will reveal the five statues, artfully arranged, along the walls. Judging by their appearance, they seem to represent \u2013 from left to right \u2013 a &lt;a href=\"Faizah%20Tin\"&gt;human mage&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Vail\"&gt;elven fighter&lt;/a&gt;, a heavily armored &lt;a href=\"Cailan\"&gt;human fighter&lt;/a&gt;, a medium armored &lt;a href=\"Achen%20Dell\"&gt;human fighter&lt;/a&gt; and another medium armored &lt;a href=\"Rance\"&gt;human fighter&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt; in the corner, the one in &lt;a href=\"Plate%20Mail\"&gt;Plate Mail&lt;/a&gt;, probably is their leader and the person of the most interest.\nWhen you revive Vail, the leader of the party, he asks why you have rescued him. From this point there are three different options to choose from:\nIf you choose to let Vail go, when you talk to Quenash, she questions your acquaintance with Vail and you must answer her question correctly (\"An elf he was, and his hair was as blond as the sunlight\"). If you do so, she will give up the cloak and you can ask her where the Helm of Balduran is located. She will say that Vail has hidden the helmet in some &lt;a href=\"Helm%20and%20Cloak\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; with a name similar to the items you're trying to acquire.\nIf you didn't let Vail go, you cannot get the cloak from Quenash via dialogue even though a letter on Vail's body says that she's in possession of it. She can be pick-pocketed for the cloak if you have a minimum pick-pocket skill of 50%, or she can be killed for it. An easy way to have her killed without losing reputation is to charm her and make her attack a guard.\nYou can find the helmet behind a trapped painting on the back wall of the second floor of that inn. After you have found it, you can either sell the helm, complete the quest or keep it for yourself. If you give the helmet to Degrodel, you can try to kill him (if you think your party is up to the fight), with no reputation loss and get the helmet back. This latter option is satisfying as, even if you give him the helm, he'll once again summon some of his servants, this time it being two Doom Guards, a Helmed Horror and an Invisible Stalker, and then leave (he doesn't turn hostile). A good way to kill him is using the Haste spell, Arrows of Detonation and the Fireball spell, which also damages the Doom Guards, the Invisible Stalker and the Helmed Horror.\nJournal.\n\"We're to do a service for a wizard named Degrodel. He wants us to find the Helm of Balduran. It can be found on the petrified bodies of a group of adventurers.

When the spell projectile reaches its target, a nearly opaque silver globe surrounds it for a couple seconds as a message is displayed in the combat log, reading \"Spell Protections Removed\". This happens even when the target has no spell protection that could be affected by Secret Word. If the target has multiple such spell protections, only the one with the highest level will be destroyed, leaving the others unaffected. If more than one protection of the highest level exist, one of them is destroyed at random.\nThough a level 4 spell, Secret Word contains level 5 effects in &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;s. As a level 5 &lt;a href=\"Magic%20attack%20type\"&gt;Magic attack&lt;/a&gt;, it can only be thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 which will be consumed as a result, &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Blocking\"&gt;Potion of Magic Blocking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection From Magic&lt;/a&gt; and, in the &lt;a href=\"original%20edition\"&gt;original edition&lt;/a&gt; where it is a level 4 Magic attack, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. Like other spell protection removers, it bypasses the target's &lt;a href=\"magic%20resistance\"&gt;magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; cannot fool it as the images can only soak up &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; effects. At least in Enhanced Editions, it can be cast successfully on &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;sanctuaried&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;hidden&lt;/a&gt; targets.\nIt is able to destroy the same list of spells as the level 6 Wizard spell &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt;, but is faster to cast. On the other hand, Pierce Magic can affect and lowers magic resistance. Liches are innately immune to level 1\u20135 effects and therefore Secret Word.\nCasting a Secret Word on a neutral creature will turn them hostile, and perhaps others in the same vicinity.\nAffected spell protections.\nAny &lt;a href=\"Spell%20protections%20type\"&gt;spell protection&lt;/a&gt; level 8 and below can be destroyed by Secret Word, with the exception of Globe of Invulnerability in the original edition. Below is a list more exhaustive than the in-game description:\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; blocks Secret Word, so it can be used to protect a higher level protection such as Spell Turning, but it is consumed in the process.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeon and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset has no Wizard spell titled or equivalent to \"Secret Word\".\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its school, casting time, effects, and description. See below for description:\nSecret Word\nLevel: 4\nSchool: Enchantment\nRange: Long\nDuration: Instant\nCasting Time: 1\nArea of Effect: 1 creature\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen a Secret Word spell is uttered, it will dispel one spell protection of 7th level or lower on the target. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first. If a target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.\nThe spell protection spells dispelled by Secret Word are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, and Shield of the Archons.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod Secret Word can't target invisible or hidden creatures (with SCS or SR or both mods) without first exposing or revealing the target creature."}

Summons from &lt;a href=\"Cacofiend\"&gt;Cacofiend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Fiend\"&gt;Summon Fiend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gate\"&gt;Gate&lt;/a&gt; also, but those can't be directly controlled by the player.\nThe effect is never added to any equipment, item, spell effect, or ability that the player will have access to.\nMechanics.\nThis effect is almost always added directly to the creature file as an inherent \"always on\" ability available to the creature.\nThe game developers (and mod authors) assign this effect to a creature who is deemed necessary or must be able to sense party members and other creatures that are invisible, without having to cast or apply some kind of divination spell effect in order to do so.\nThis effect will allow the creature to whom has the effect code assigned to see any creatures that are invisible, sanctuaried or under some kind of &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt;. The creature is still subject to normal detection range limitations. The effect does not remove the state of invisibility, it simply is ignored by the AI script as if the detected creature were not hidden at all, just like if they were plainly visible.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt; effect has no influence on this effect.\nThis effect allows the targeting of any invisible/hidden creature in detection range, and even if the creature is under &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. This includes weapon and spell targeting. \nA creature that has the \"see the invisible ability\" suffers no to-hit penalty when striking invisible (or Improved Invisible characters), because the target is detected and targetable.\nThe \"See the invisible\" effect is typically given to powerful creatures or those that have supernatural abilities. It can sometimes be provided to AI controlled creatures that must be able to initiate dialogue with the player's party, even if they are invisible/hidden - for plot or scripting purposes.\nThere is no method in the game available to the player to prevent or block this effect.\nNotes.\nSome AI controlled creatures equip the &lt;a href=\"SEEINVIS.ITM\"&gt;SEEINVIS.ITM&lt;/a&gt; in lieu of having this status effect placed directly in the creature file as an innate ability. Also, in some cases, the creature file and this item are both included with See the invisible ability, making the item redundant - example &lt;a href=\"Cambion%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%29\"&gt;Cambion (Watcher's Keep)&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs this ability doesn't remove the \"State: Invisible\" or \"State: Improved Invisibility\" it doesn't prevent or affect in any way a character's bonuses from those states. So, the 4 point &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; provided from a first strike from invisibility (or multiple strikes from &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;) is still retained. The 4 points &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; bonus is also retained by the character under &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps this isn't a technically correct in-game application, but it is a limitation from the game engine's interaction and execution of code involving \"States\"."}

Moreover the fast-acting poison (even without haste) is especially devastating against spellcasters who won't be able to cast during the effect.\nThe main drawback of the weapon is the 50% chance, as it can't be improved upon with Greater Malison and similar spells. The +2 enchantment rarely matters as the few enemies that require +3 or +4 weapons to be hit tend to already be immune to poison (like balors, pit fiends, ancient vampires and greater mummies), so one should use another weapon against those even if Enchanted Weapon (EE) is available to allow the Serpent Shaft to hit them.\nLocation.\nIt is dropped by the lich on the fifth floor of &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20%28dungeon%29\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt;."}

This an ambush. The appearance of the Beholder is PC level/experience dependent. If you are inexperienced fighting Beholders, you can avoid them by fleeing away from their visual range or going invisible/hidden.\nAt the north spoke is an adventuring group called &lt;a href=\"The%20Hatchetman%27s%20Party\"&gt;The Hatchetman's Party&lt;/a&gt; with whom you may either talk or fight.

There is no choice other than to face the Shade Lord when he is encountered. If &lt;a href=\"Mazzy%20Fentan\"&gt;Mazzy Fentan&lt;/a&gt; is a party companion, there will be additional dialogue and reply options.\nGameplay.\nAfter dialogue, the Shade Lord, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Patrick\"&gt;Shadow Patrick&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; creatures and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Altar\"&gt;Shadow Altar&lt;/a&gt; spring into hostile action. Note that the Shade Lord has access to innate, arcane and divine spells - and they are not limited by memory and aren't exhausted. The script determines when and what spell to attempt based on conditions and timed intervals.\nThe Shade Lord will usually attack the nearest opponent with a \"Shadow Drain\" innate spell attack (SPIN878). A Gaze projectile travels to the target, and it bypasses magic resistance and spell protections. Save vs. Breath negates. Fail and &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; effect value of 2 experience levels, as well as 1 round of &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt;, which has no saving throw. The &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt; could deflect it if the targeted member has that equipped.\nIf Mazzy is detected by the Shade Lord, she will be the target of a &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Symbol, Stun&lt;/a&gt; spell. If any spell casting class (mage, priest, bard or druid and sub classes) are detected, then a &lt;a href=\"Silence%2C%2015%27%20Radius\"&gt;Silence, 15' Radius&lt;/a&gt; will be cast. Also, if any spell casting class is detected a &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt; can be launched.\nIf the Shade lord is hit by crushing damage or its Hit points fall to 25% of maximum a contingency will instantly apply &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis creature can also attempt &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; spell casts at detected enemies.\nAbsent the spell casting, the lord will also engage in melee attacks with its touch attack weapon. it has a 1\u00a0ft range with 0 speed, dealing 3d4+9 &lt;a href=\"piercing%20damage\"&gt;piercing damage&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; of 5, including the &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; bonus. This \"weapon\" is treated as having an &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20item\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; of +1 in the and of +4 in the \"\".\nMod Content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod, and the Tactical Challenges for BG2 component upgrades the Shade Lord, mostly by giving him additional magical powers (though his hit points are also increased). Unlike most components, this one doesn't make any particular effort to stick with the vanilla game or with anything from source material: like the Wolf of Ulcaster, the Shade Lord has his own unique abilities. The Shade Lord casts all spell types at caster level 20. It's saving throws are adjusted slightly in favor of bonuses, especially save vs spell. The creature has 100% cold resistance and is immune to instant death effects like &lt;a href=\"Slay\"&gt;Slay&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the beginning of the battle the Shade Lord instantly applies the following protective buffs (can't be interrupted): &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few tics later an SCS only unique innate spell called \"Darkling Aura\" is force cast over itself, which generates a &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; effect against any opponents in the area of effect. This Necromancy and Disabling type ability is unaffected by magic resistance, spell protections and has no saving throw. It will drain 1 experience level that has a temporary duration of 1 turn. &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Plane%20Protection\"&gt;Negative Plane Protection&lt;/a&gt; or equivalent will prevent the effect.\nNext, the lord will attempt to cast &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20of%20Disaster\"&gt;Black Blade of Disaster&lt;/a&gt;, which has a long casting time, and can be potentially interrupted. If the Black Blade is successful, the creature will alternate weapon attacks and spell casting at the closest opponent in melee range. \nA &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Blind\"&gt;Power Word, Blind&lt;/a&gt; will be directed at the closest opponent within a few rounds of the battle going on.\nIf no one closes, it will continue to cast spells including &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death\"&gt;Finger of Death&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt; unless the only target it can detect is protected against spells or has the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt; equipped. Additionally, the lord can continue to apply the \"Darkling Aura\" about every three rounds.\nThe creature will most likely cast &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt; at some point in the battle after five rounds, if able and still functioning.

He can be found in the penultimate room of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Ruins\"&gt;ruined temple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Amaunator\"&gt;Amaunator&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nUpon descending the staircase from the level above, your party will enter a cathedral-like open area. During daylight hours, dim light penetrates the dark interior from windows higher up on the walls. The stink of rotting flesh and decay assails your nostrils. A dormant hulking beast is visible within, with great folded leathery wings astride its armored body. There are barely discernable signs of life, such as rhythmic deep breathing. Its eyes appear slitted and half-closed. The great tail from the beast is curled protectively around a pile of bones, golden coins and other valuables. Perhaps this black and grey scaled dragon is in some kind of slumber? If you have the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dragon%20Wardstone\"&gt;Shadow Dragon Wardstone&lt;/a&gt; in your possession, the beast doesn't react to your presence. \nThe wardstone will prevent the dragon from being aware of your existence, until some kind of overt action on your part takes place - including speaking to or touching the dragon. Otherwise, it remains still. You do not need to arouse the dragon for any quest completion purpose, and you can safely ignore it. If you wish to claim its treasure hoard or destroy the fell beast then you may do so by announcing yourself by speaking to it, or just attack it with a huge tactical advantage. It is up to you.\nIf you decide to take on the dragon, get its attention by speaking with it, or attacking it in some manner. It will spring to action with a roar of dialogue in the common tongue, and then engage in battle (assuming it survived some kind of initial surprise attack or spell barrage). \nThe dragon has several innate abilities and innate spells it can muster to defend itself and harm you. These abilities and spells can't be interrupted or disrupted by damage. Expect the beast to immediately protect itself with &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; (10 skins) and then launch a level 23 &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; upon the closest enemy. Anyone in melee range may also be attacked by its &lt;a href=\"DRAGBLAW.ITM\"&gt;piercing claws&lt;/a&gt;. It can get at least 3 strikes per round at a target.\nShortly thereafter, the dragon will radiate an aura of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Fear\"&gt;Dragon Fear&lt;/a&gt; in a circle around itself. Those within a certain distance and not immune to &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; effects must make a saving throw to negate this, with a penalty, or they will flee and be uncontrollable (possibly involuntarily wetting their codpiece). \nThis is followed by a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dragon%20Breath\"&gt;Shadow Dragon Breath&lt;/a&gt; blast upon an opponent closest to the dragon, and then several seconds later, a &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Buffet\"&gt;Wing Buffet&lt;/a&gt;. These innate abilities will continue to periodically be unleashed every few rounds (three) - Dragon Fear aura, breath attack and Wing buffet. In between these, the dragon will continue to try and damage the nearest opponent with claw attacks. \nIf the battle rages for a few more rounds, and the beast is still functional, it will begin to auto-cast some innate spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt; and 35% chance of a &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, if the dragon's melee opponent is protected so that the creature's melee attack is \"weapon ineffective\", it may reciprocate and protect itself with &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. All of the dragon's innate spells are inexhaustible, and the only limitation is the time delay between their uses. In other words, the beast will not \"run out\" of spells or innate abilities.\nThaxll'ssillyia has no innate weapon immunities, meaning even normal, unenchanted weapons can hurt it. Switching to normal weapons is one way to hurt it when it casts &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. The player still has to negate its &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; can negate both.\nStrategy.\nThis might be the first dragon faced by the party in the saga. It is one of the more dangerous enemies in the early SoA game, especially if the party decides to face it as soon as &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%202\"&gt;Chapter II&lt;/a&gt;. As usual, proper preparation is the key to winning this battle with minimal strain.\nParty members that will be close to the dragon, especially in melee range - will need protection from &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps a party cleric could cast &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Plane%20Protection\"&gt;Negative Plane Protection&lt;/a&gt;. If the party has an item that provided this protection such as the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Power\"&gt;Amulet of Power&lt;/a&gt;, that would be optimal. A Berserker or Barbarian kit ability can provide protection for a limited time. Unprotected party members in range to the dragon are at high risk. \nProtection from fear effects, like &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; would be prudent for those close by. A &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fear\"&gt;Resist Fear&lt;/a&gt; spell will do the trick. If that isn't available, then boosting saving throws vs. spell would be another method to mitigate the chances of being frightened and uncontrollable.\nStoneskin would be useful to be able to engage in melee with the dragon, as it hits often and for a considerable quantity of damage. A means to heal the damage is also needed, if the skins are consumed. &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; is also a good defense for a limited time. Expect to be damaged while in melee, and the longer it goes on, the more likely healing will required.\nBe prepared for being knocked backwards by the Wing buffeting force. It is hard to resist, especially in unmodded games and early in the saga. You should have a plan for what to do if a single or multiple party members are blown backwards at once. If the dragon has no one to occupy its attention close by, it may advance to another party member (that may be unsuited to go toe to claw with a dragon).\nThe use of summoned creatures may be a great help. Let those creatures occupy the beast, while the party cast spells or fires missiles from a distance.\nSpread out your party so that area of effect spells and attacks can't get multiple members in each use. Keep the dragon busy with at least one party member or summoned creature and overwhelm it with ranged attacks and spells.\nA party member could polymorph into a &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20Jelly\"&gt;Mustard Jelly&lt;/a&gt; via spell or using the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Sewers\"&gt;Cloak of the Sewers&lt;/a&gt;. The form is invulnerable to the dragon's claw attacks. That may be a viable option to increase staying power and get close to the dragon while others deal the damage. If soloing, then this would be good method to eventually defeat the beast. \nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises Thaxll'ssillyia in many ways. Especially if you install the \"Smarter Dragons\" component (which is responsive to the game difficulty selection). His SCS AI improves targeting and recognition of opponent's protections, which means he will fight smarter and not waste attacks on someone he cannot hit or damage. It will also influence his tactical options and attack methods. First, some mention of the dragon's stats and abilities. In most cases, all of the unmodded ones are still applicable:\nImmunities in addition to the unmodded dragon version:\nAs stated in the article above, Thaxll'ssillyia has access to several innate Dragon abilities. They are uninterruptible. A little bit more on what SCS does with the following:\nSpells: Thaxll'ssillyia is scripted to use the following spells, as determined by the AI's need, and your party's protections: &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. \nSCS looks for the party preparing for battle, simulating that Thaxll'ssillyia would be alerted of an imminent hostile action. Any trap setting, creature or demon summoning or certain spells will possibly trigger a hostile reaction. I won't spoil the spells it looks for, but it includes many of the favorite party-wide buffs from wizards and clerics such as Haste and Draw upon Holy Might, Protection from Fire and others. You just can't buff with certain spells in the presence of the dragon without triggering a response. Forget setting a trap near the dragon or within visual range. If you summon an elemental, or some cannon fodder from the wand of summoning of any kind, he will become hostile. Buffing and summoning must occur out of sight from the dragon. If a summoned creature moves into visual range that will also trigger a hostile reaction.\nOne warning for a party facing the dragon. SCS AI can recognize members that are protected from level drain. It sees Blackguards, Undead Hunter, Enrage ability, Negative Plane Protection, and similar. It will try and aim a breath weapon attack at someone who has no level drain protection. Keep those individuals out of the dragon's sight range (which is about 30 feet, at least as good as a party member.) If a breath attack is launched at a member, they may try to run away as the projectile heads toward them and out run it, but that is difficult (but not impossible). A good length of distance is needed for that tactic to work, and Haste or Speed boots.\nOn \"Insane\" difficulty, the dragon has better saving throws (probably will not fail any, unless a Greater Malison is used, and then, rarely). Regains use of Shadow Dragon Breath quicker than the unmodded game. Could potentially by percentage, have a 50% chance each round to blast with it. \nFor the greatest challenge, speak with the dragon in order to hear his threats and boasts, and only then engage in combat. Do not attack unprovoked with the wardstone in your inventory for a fairer battle experience. \nWith the installation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, some of the dragon's arcane memorized spells will be the SR version. The innate abilities mostly are not revised except for the dragon breath. With SCS or SR, the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; bug behavior is fixed, so the spell works as it should. It no longer interacts at all with the Dragon's breath attack. In the unmodded game the Spell Shield bug trivializes the dragon's breath weapon, which is most probably an unintended coding omission.\nAchievements.\nShadow Dragon Slayer.\nSlew the shadow dragon, Thaxll'ssillyia."}
