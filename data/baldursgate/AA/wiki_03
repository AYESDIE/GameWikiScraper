{"id": "9595", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9595", "title": "Demon Knight", "text": "The Demon Knight is a demon who has claimed rulership over &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28building%29\"&gt;Durlag's Tower&lt;/a&gt;. He lures adventures to the tower so they will break through &lt;a href=\"Durlag%20Trollkiller\"&gt;Durlag's&lt;/a&gt; wards and traps for him. Once the traps are gone, he plans to use the tower as a base. He is one of many evil creatures Durlag sought to seal away in the deepest levels of his labyrinth. Though the Demon Knight is surely older than the tower itself, he is not the greatest evil trapped within or the evil Durlag feared the most.\nAppearances.\nHe can be met twice in Tales of the Sword Coast and Baldur's Gate EE. If the player chooses to take a &lt;a href=\"A%20Tour%20of%20Durlag%27s%20Tower\"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt; of Durlag's Tower, he will appear within the entrance hall located on the &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Ground%20Floor%29\"&gt;ground floor&lt;/a&gt; of the tower and attack &lt;a href=\"Ike%20Cascadion%20Vendar\"&gt;Ike&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tourist\"&gt;tourist&lt;/a&gt;s with fireballs. His second appearance is in his &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Knight%20Chamber\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt; which is accessible from the &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20Four%29\"&gt;fourth level&lt;/a&gt; of the labyrinth under the tower. The chamber is where the final battle with the Demon Knight will take place.\nDuring , if an animal sacrifice is made at the Demogorgon statue in the &lt;a href=\"Kuo%20Toa%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Western Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; (of the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;), one or more Demon Knights can be summoned.\nGameplay.\nThe Demon Knight wields a &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20item\"&gt;non-enchanted&lt;/a&gt; specific variant of a two-handed sword that can't be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed from nor will it be dropped by him and with which he has &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;grand mastery&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon itself can be used by him at 2\u00a0ft range and with a speed factor of 2. He strikes with a &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; of -5, dealing 1d10+16 &lt;a href=\"slashing%20damage\"&gt;slashing damage&lt;/a&gt; (weapon, grand mastery and &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; bonuses included).\nStrategy.\nBecause he is so highly resistant to magic and melee combat is difficult, it may be best to avoid using both. Instead, have the fighter with the best constitution and armor class run around the edge of the room as a distraction. Position all other party members in the center of the room and have all ranged fighters target him. &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt; may be helpful for keeping the fighter alive. This method may take some time but is workable. A scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection from Magic&lt;/a&gt; will prevent his fireballs and confusion from affecting a character.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Paws%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;The Paws of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; makes kiting easier.\n2 &lt;a href=\"Batalista%27s%20Passport\"&gt;Batalista's Passport&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Gift of Peace&lt;/a&gt; gives fire immunity.\nA party member with at least 90 hit points e.g. &lt;a href=\"Kagain\"&gt;Kagain&lt;/a&gt; can be immune to &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word, Stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; can be prevented with &lt;a href=\"Greenstone%20Amulet\"&gt;Greenstone Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Rage\"&gt;Barbarian Rage&lt;/a&gt;. Stun can be cured with &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Paralysis\"&gt;Remove Paralysis&lt;/a&gt;. \nA single class Druid (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Faldorn\"&gt;Faldorn&lt;/a&gt;) with at least 90,000 XP could cast &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Resistance%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Magic Resistance (spell)&lt;/a&gt; on the Demon Knight to lower his magic resistance down to 18-20%. If the druid is invisible, the spell shouldn't break invisibility so the Demon Knight may not interrupt the casting with an attack. \nMirror Fiend.\n\"Uncovering\" the Mirror of Opposition (by attacking it in actual gameplay) will summon the Mirror Fiends and the number of fiends summoned will correspond to the number of party members. An exact duplicate of the Demon Knight will also be summoned. Unlike the fiends that represent the party members, this fiend will actually attack only the Demon Knight. Upon its death, it will cast a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; centered upon itself. If the Demon Knight is killed first, the fiend will die too (and still cast the fireball spell).\nStrategy.\nConcentrating your ranged fighters to target the fiend first will get you no experience points but will get you an extra-large shield +1 if you're able to take him down. If the fiend kills the Demon Knight first, it won't drop the shield. And, by killing the fiend first, it will prevent the fiend from killing the Demon Knight so you can get the XP from the Demon Knight too."}

The creature may select a different spell, or eligible target instead. "}

It uses the \"Wailing Virgin\" sprite with a blur effect cosmetic overlay.\nGameplay.\nThe party first enters this chamber through a portal on the north side. The Demon Wraith will greet the party with a screen text message quoted above. \nThere are seven skeletal corpses on the main chamber floor that are related to an immediately formed group of &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Wraith\"&gt;Slave Wraith&lt;/a&gt; creatures, under the demon's command.\nAdditionally, there are several nasty traps in the area - one of which can be encountered with little movement forward, and all can be disarmed with the correct method and skill.\nThe Demon Wraith has many immunities and resistances. See the InfoBox for specifics.\nThe demon's main method of attack is via arcane magic spell casting, some of which are not interruptible. \nIt opens hostilities with instantly applied &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost likely it will also cast a &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt; to take down hostile illusions, although the creature can see invisible and hidden enemies by script even without it.\nShould the demon be silenced, it will counter with a scripted &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf any summoned creatures are detected, a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; will be cast to banish them.\nIf the creature took damage a Contingency will fire with &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; - as long as the party has a member with greater than level 15 XP. At the same time a \"Chain Contingency - Mislead\" will auto cast a &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; spell as well.\nThe creature has a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; scripted, and if it triggers properly then several Symbol spells will be launched and perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Wail%20of%20the%20Banshee\"&gt;Wail of the Banshee&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nLater in the fight, if the demon detects any party members with XP greater than 16, the creature will cast &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Spray\"&gt;Prismatic Spray&lt;/a&gt; at those nearest enemies.\nAfter 30 game seconds, the demon will reevaluate and cast those same spells again until it is destroyed.\nThe demon can also engage in melee combat (and cast spells in the same round), but typically only if a PC is adjacent to the creature and also engaging it up close.\nIn melee combat, the wraith will have 4 attacks per round. Its touch attack can &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt;. The wraith receives a 4-point bonus to &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and damage against party members who are elves.\nNote that the wraith cannot evaluate the party's immunities, protections, or vulnerabilities.

A new \"Smarter Mage\" AI script is furnished as well, which revises the spells it can use, and selection of what spells it launches at self and valid targets. The AI will evaluate target protections and vulnerabilities as part of the scripted spell selection behavior.\nThe mod did not change its attributes or hit points, and it still has the same immunities and innate effects as the unmodified creature.\nThe demon has a spell book with 47 different spells available, and some have multiple uses. The creature also has a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; prepared for instant release during the battle.\nExpect &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Blind\"&gt;Power Word, Blind&lt;/a&gt; more than once, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;, and plenty of AoE or single target disabling and direct damage spells of all types. \nThe creature can try and take down the party's protections with &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt is scripted that the demon wraith will attempt to arm itself with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20of%20Disaster\"&gt;Black Blade of Disaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the SCS &lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Dale\"&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/a&gt; spells component or the &lt;a href=\"IWDification\"&gt;IWDification&lt;/a&gt; mod is installed, there will be several of those spells added to the mix as well.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod is installed, then non IWD spells will be the SR version."}

She suggests starting by questioning the &lt;a href=\"halfling\"&gt;halfling&lt;/a&gt; merchant &lt;a href=\"Waizahb\"&gt;Waizahb&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuestioning Waizahb.\nOf course, Waizahb will deny having any involvement with such a group. The player can select one of several options; only the option \"\u201cFor your sake, I hope that\u2019s not true.\u201d\" is a guaranteed success to set up a meeting with Rhynwis. If they select the options \"\u201cI don\u2019t think so, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\" or \"\u201cI\u2019ve not patience for your games.\u201d\", it will trigger a &lt;a href=\"Charisma\"&gt;Charisma&lt;/a&gt; check or a &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; check, respectively; failure causes the halfling to flee and warn the thieves guild representative. If &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, they also have the unique option to bluff Waizahb by threatening to curse her, which is an automatic success.\nIf successful, she will reveal that Gorion's Ward needs to speak to &lt;a href=\"Rhynwis\"&gt;Rhynwis&lt;/a&gt;, and will set up a meeting.\nTalking to Rhynwis.\nDespite what &lt;a href=\"General%20Stonehand\"&gt;General Stonehand&lt;/a&gt; says, questioning &lt;a href=\"Waizahb\"&gt;Waizahb&lt;/a&gt; is strictly optional; &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; can simply speak to &lt;a href=\"Rhynwis\"&gt;Rhynwis&lt;/a&gt; automatically. There are three options for talking to her.\nFirstly, the player can threaten her by demanding she stop the thievery or pay the price. She will agree. The player can either attack her (she vanishes), ask for a cut of the profits (she will reveal the existence of a cache in the &lt;a href=\"Underground%20River%20Entrance\"&gt;Underground River Entrance&lt;/a&gt;, containing &lt;a href=\"Harold\"&gt;Harold&lt;/a&gt; and minor loot), or demand that the guild assist the Coalition during the battle against the Shining Crusade (thieves make an appearance as allies during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20the%20Camp\"&gt;Siege of the Camp&lt;/a&gt; quest).\nSecondly, the player can ask to join the guild. She refuses, reveals she recognizes them as the Hero of Baldur's Gate, and promises that the guild will disband before vanishing.\nFinally, the player can tell her outright that they want her to stop her operations. Her response varies. If Waizahb set up a meeting, options are presented as per threatening her. Otherwise, she simply agrees and vanishes.\nConclusion.\nOnce Rhynwis has been spoken to, Gorion's Ward can return to General Stonehand. If they explain that they only saw the guild's leader, but leaned on her to aid the coalition, then the general will throw in a bonus &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Mind%20Focusing\"&gt;Potion of Mind Focusing&lt;/a&gt; to her rewards. Otherwise, they get the standard rewards array.\nGeneral Stonehand offers 300 gold pieces for the job.

The First floor is comprised of a saloon and a kitchen. It is where Patricia offers rooms for rent and beverages. An Athkatlan City Guardsman seems to be stationed and on duty in the saloon area. A number of commoners and nobles are in the saloon as well. There are numerous pick pocketing opportunities here.\nDon't forget to try some different Drinks at the bar (see the menu in the info box). You may get &lt;a href=\"Intoxicated\"&gt;Intoxicated&lt;/a&gt; if you sample too many, but the rumors and immersion of various tidbits, scuttlebutt and chit chat can be worth it. So, spend a few golden coins, lubricate your parched throat, and hear the latest unofficial news as well. The more expensive the beverage, the better chance for the rumor quality. Many rumors are actually factual in whole or part.\nThe sleeping quarters are on the second floor, where Mencar Pebblecrusher's party resides. When you are observed, Mencar will address you and quickly insult your party - and unless you leave, will pick a fight. The dialogue options give you an \"out\" to avoid a confrontation, should you feel the need. Of course, you could attack without provocation with no reputation jeopardy, but will miss out on much dialogue. \nIf &lt;a href=\"Korgan%20Bloodaxe\"&gt;Korgan Bloodaxe&lt;/a&gt; is in your party, it will soon be apparent that he and Mencar have some bad blood from a previous dealing with each other. Neither will back down, and violence is unavoidable, along with various excellent Dwarven insults.\nNotable loot.\nMostly equipment carried by Mencar and his gang (2nd floor), but don't neglect the Kitchen (1st Floor):\nMod content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises all of the adventurers upstairs with new assigned AI scripts, weapon proficiencies and for the mage and familiar, spell casting and \"Smarter Mage\" behavior. You will find them noticeably a tougher challenge than the unmodified game. See each creature's article page for more details.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Isra%20NPC%20for%20BGII\"&gt;Isra NPC for BGII&lt;/a&gt; mod introduces Isra a female Paladin Cavalier potential companion.

Shortly after, a group of protective spells are instantly cast to include\n&lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf Layene can detect a party member, a spell trigger deploys and three more spells are applied to her, including: &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.\nShould any party summoned creatures be seen by her she will \"force cast\" a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; to try and banish them. If silenced, she will apply a &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt;. Most likely a &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; will also be cast by her in the first few rounds of the battle.\nAfter that, she'll attempt a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, and then while time is paused, cast a &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20Swarm\"&gt;Meteor Swarm&lt;/a&gt; on a detected party opponent. A &lt;a href=\"Gate%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Gate (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; spell can also be attempted (she will be scripted to try and get a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Evil (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; on herself as well). If the gate works, then a problematic &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Fiend\"&gt;Pit Fiend&lt;/a&gt; will move toward and attack the party if any are detected.\nExpect a &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt; attempt. Another spell trigger can be applied later with &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd a number of other attack and defense options will continue to be attempted, based on if she's able to cast and not disrupted. Various symbol spells, perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Efreeti\"&gt;Efreeti&lt;/a&gt; will be summoned, a &lt;a href=\"Wail%20of%20the%20Banshee\"&gt;Wail of the Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; and other dangerous spells.\nLayene is equipped with the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Staff of the Magi&lt;/a&gt; and receives all of the passive benefits of this item. It can be looted from her corpse if you are victorious.\nMod content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises Layenne. She is a level 25 Conjurer. If the \"Smarter Mages\" component is installed, she will be a formidable Mage. Her memorized spells are mostly different than the unmodded, and can cast &lt;a href=\"Gate\"&gt;Gate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on your game difficulty selection, she has access to mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt;. If given enough time, she will use:\nLayene will likely be invisible from the outset (due to the Staff of the Magi), and will open up with \"previously cast\" buffs including &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, then a contingency with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Abjuration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Hakeashar\"&gt;Summon Hakeashar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, Layene's arcane magic will be the SR versions.\nIf playing with the &lt;a href=\"Tactics%20for%20BG2EE\"&gt;Tactics for BG2EE&lt;/a&gt; mod, a different script is employed for spell use. The script is less dangerous in terms of damage dealing offensive spells but does a very good job of simulating Layene's use of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Staff of the Magi&lt;/a&gt;. After her considerable opening slew of protections (instantly applied while invisible), she will go through her scripted spell casting.\nAfter each spell cast, she is made invisible again as if she re-equipped the staff after performing an invisibility breaking action. This can be performed at least twenty times during the battle. Note she will be tough to target and may be the final foe still around after all the others have been defeated. With the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt; mod also installed, she will be protected with a \"Dispelling Screen \"and a &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;. With SR, Non-detection protects against all divination attacks. An &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt; spells for example will not affect her invisibility.\nOne unusual opening move is her ability to cast a &lt;a href=\"Zone%20of%20Sweet%20Air\"&gt;Zone of Sweet Air&lt;/a&gt; effect. This will immediately clear any cloud spells from the battlefield. She is also scripted to specifically cast &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Revanek\"&gt;Revanek&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is an optional follow-up quest to &lt;a href=\"Escaping%20the%20asylum\"&gt;Escaping the asylum&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubquest walkthrough topics.\nSaemon Havarian's offer.\nWhen leaving the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Basement\"&gt;Spellhold Basement&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20with%20Irenicus%20in%20Spellhold\"&gt;Battle with Irenicus in Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; the party must ascend the staircase to the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Main%20Floor\"&gt;Spellhold Main Floor&lt;/a&gt;. If the characters move west and then turn the corner north, Saemon will be seen ahead waiting for you. \nIf the party is invisible at this point, then Saemon will not detect the group, and all can move past him with no interaction if that is desired. However, the exit to the outdoor area surrounding Spellhold is locked and magically sealed. So, likely it may be a good idea to speak with Saemon.\nAssuming dialogue with Saemon occurs (he'll initiate it if the party is detected), a fair amount of back and forth can occur. Certain core party members have interjections at various stages of the conversation. Saemon has some insight into Irenicus plans and likely destination - he knows that he and Bodhi have fled Spellhold through the portal in the basement. Here are some snippets of what he says and proposes: \nIf the party refuses his offer he'll say:\nIf accepted, Saemon says:\nSaemon Teleports with the party outside the Asylum.\nOn a platform outside the Asylum, the party will appear with Saemon. He says:\nReturn to Brynnlaw.\nThe party can enter Spellhold again if they desire (perhaps something was left behind - or the party reconsidered and wish to take the portal instead). Or, make travel on foot to &lt;a href=\"Brynnlaw\"&gt;Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen in Brynnlaw, the party is free to do whatever it wishes before visiting the &lt;a href=\"The%20Vulgar%20Monkey\"&gt;The Vulgar Monkey&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnter the tavern when ready to meet Saemon - he'll be standing inside awaiting the planned rendezvous. Initiate conversation with him, and he'll say:\nThe party (and several core party members) have interjections. If you hear out Saemon's plan the gist of it is that since his own ship is now out of action, then that leaves only &lt;a href=\"Desharik\"&gt;Desaharik's&lt;/a&gt; personal vessel to \"acquire\"- and with that ship the pursuit of Irenicus and Bodhi can continue, as well as escaping the island. \nIn order to do that a special &lt;a href=\"Pirate%20Horn\"&gt;Pirate Horn&lt;/a&gt; must first be secured from the Pirate Lord's lover &lt;a href=\"Cayia\"&gt;Cayia&lt;/a&gt;. During the day, Desharik has the horn, but during the nighttime, it inside the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Desharik%27s%20Lover\"&gt;House of Desharik's Lover&lt;/a&gt;.\nSaemon explains all this as follows (paraphrased slightly):\nThe party can agree or refuse the offer and tell Saemon that they will use the portal instead.\nIf the party refuses the offer, Saemon will say:\nIf the party accepts Saemon's plan, then all that is left to do is to obtain the Pirate Horn and meet him at the Pirate Lord's ship on the quayside.\nObtain the horn.\nThis task needs be accomplished after sundown or close to it. \nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Desharik%27s%20Lover\"&gt;House of Desharik's Lover&lt;/a&gt; or \"Cayia's House\" is in the southwest of Brynnlaw. The party will know the horn is available if they enter the home and observe Cayia and her bedmate about to drift off to sleep. There will be some dialogue between the two. Being under stealth/invisibility is advised.\nA stealthy character can pluck the Pirate Horn and a &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Stone\"&gt;Rogue Stone&lt;/a&gt; from the table, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt; from the nearby containers. If they are detected, Cayia will summon three pirate fighters and then she and her lover will flee. If desired the party can just depart the house and make for the quayside or fight the guards and send them to Umberlee's watery grave.\nMeet Saemon at Desharik's Ship.\nThe party then heads to the quay at the southeast of the city (east of the ship). Saemon comments on the horn, and remarks about the upcoming caper. Soon after, Desharik will arrive, as well as &lt;a href=\"Cayia\"&gt;Cayia&lt;/a&gt; and some dialogue will ensue. The Pirate Lord sets several cutthroats on the party, whom must be defeated before Saemon can cast off. \nThere can be a bug with Saemon not appearing here, see &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forums.beamdog.com/discussion/25365/saemon-havarian-bug-spoiler\"&gt;this forum entry&lt;/a&gt; for details and solution. \nAs they hit the open seas, the party receives and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Blade\"&gt;Silver Blade&lt;/a&gt;, which Saemon will insist that &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; takes.\nDisaster at sea.\nThe saga narrator displays a scrolling explanation of the ship's voyage. A strange vessel is seen gaining on your ship, and eventually it draws close. Saemon is nervous and the crew draw their weapons.\nThe next scenario opens with Saemon and the party aboard Desharik's stolen ship, when it is announced that all should prepare to repel boarding from a foreign vessel.\nMuch of the ensuing events are done under a cut scene, so the player can only view the scripted performance, dialogue and animation. \nThe ship has been boarded by a group of githyanki, who are using their psionic abilities to subdue the crew.\nEventual control of the party is allowed, and some fighting can occur. The githyanki captain can't be killed, as he eventually delivers some required dialogue. The purpose of this attack as stated by the gith's is to reclaim their so-called holy relic, which is likely to be the silver blade Saemon foisted on the PC. Dialogue with Saemon, the party and the Githyanki Captain will transpire.\nSoon after and suddenly the ship begins sinking. A sailor crew member shouts abandon ship. The Githyanki Captain orders his force to flee and return to their vessel, as a new attacker is present - the shark folk known as the &lt;a href=\"Sahuagin\"&gt;Sahuagin&lt;/a&gt;. \nSaemon announces that he is bailing out on the whole mission and will escape - leaving the party on their own and stuck with the silver blade.\nThe shark creatures will soon sweep onto the deck and carry the party down into the deep as the ship sinks, transporting them to the &lt;a href=\"Underwater%20City\"&gt;Underwater City&lt;/a&gt; and beginning the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20prophecy%20of%20Sekolah\"&gt;The prophecy of Sekolah&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "53029", "revid": "1966519", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=53029", "title": "Legacy of Bhaal", "text": "This article is about the Legacy of Bhaal game difficulty setting for the and . This setting is frequently abbreviated as \"LoB\".\nIntroduction.\nWhen starting a new game, the player is able to select a game difficulty setting. The most difficult setting offered is the \"Legacy of Bhaal\" setting. \nOnce selected, it cannot be changed later in the game. It is essentially \"locked-in\" for the entire Baldur's Gate I saga, or Baldur's gate II saga. \nThe description in the game creation display gives a general explanation of what the setting will do, but it doesn't describe everything. The player will most likely understand that this is going to make combat actions much more difficult. And that will be true.\nWhat the setting does.\nFirst, the Legacy of Bhaal selection incorporates all the elements of the \"Insane difficulty\" setting.\nLegacy of Bhaal can only be selected at the start of the game and once selected cannot be changed.\nThe LoB setting doesn't change anything about the player characters. For instance, it does not gimp, reduce or adjust anything about the player's party to make them less capable.\nInstead, the setting improves and boosts non-party creatures and enemies across the board. Including the following changes:\nA special mention is needed for Summoned creatures in the Legacy of Bhaal game, which applies to enemy and party creatures alike.\nSome examples between Non-LoB / LoB settings:\nGameplay on Legacy of Bhaal Setting.\nThe LoB selection means that beginning characters in BG 1 are at a big disadvantage. Even the most innocuous and weak opponent in a standard game is now many times tougher than before. A giant rat or kobold will require multiple weapon strikes before it is slain. A Fireball will only wound them, and nothing will be killed with a single fireball.\nThief snares and traps aren't automatic killers any longer. Backstabbing isn't a guaranteed instant kill either.\nThe LoB setting won't change any scripts. Enemies and NPCs will behave as before. Spell casting enemies will cast the same spells as usual, however their spells will be boosted in casting level, and depending on the specific spell and how that spell is designed for scaling, can be much more potent. A level 5 Hobgoblin Priest casting &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic (priest)&lt;/a&gt; will be able to Dispel the entire party's buffs in one cast (because it would cast at level 17). The party's mage may find it difficult to dispel any protections on the enemy, because of the casting level difference.\nThe party will be successfully hit by enemies with missiles and weapon attacks more frequently due to the LoB THAC0 bonus for enemy creatures.\nLoB creatures will successfully make their saving throws more often.\nThe party's Armor Class won't protect as well as it did on the non LoB game settings. Conversely, enemies will be more difficult to be successfully hit due their boosted AC.\nBug.\nAs of EE 2.6.6 (and maybe applicable to earlier game update versions) there are reported bugs with the LoB difficulty implementation. The general gist of the problems encountered are regarding the LoB &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; bonus. It seems through gameplay testing and observed game behavior, that if an enemy creature has an existing saving throw lowered so that the value is less than zero, such as -1, or -2 etc. - then the value actually doesn't compute correctly, resulting in a saving throw \"penalty\" to the particular saving throw instead.\nCreatures in the game with normally pretty good saving throws - such as a saving throw of 1 versus spell will see their adjusted LoB saving throw not change to -4 as it should, but instead it will move in the opposite direction and be as poor as 20. This bug is known to Beamdog and is assigned a fix ticket - that is if they release a patch or perhaps a 2.7 game update.\nMod content.\nIf the player is able to install modifications, then consider raising the game challenge using the popular and battle tested &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod in lieu of the LoB option. If the player is particularly masochistic, then play LoB settings and install SCS as well. Good luck with that. You'll need it!"}

It is of a pale greenish-yellow in color and has dark bands around the tail. With its gaze the creature is capable of turning party members to stone. Defeating one is worth 1400 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;. In the original \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\", lesser basilisks can be found in &lt;a href=\"Mutamin%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Mutamin's Garden&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Area East of Temple.\nCombat.\nIt is recommended to keep &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; out of their reach, as the game will end if the party's leader is petrified. It is also highly advisable to purchase a number of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20to%20Flesh\"&gt;Stone to Flesh&lt;/a&gt; scrolls, available from the &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Beregost\"&gt;Beregost&lt;/a&gt;, prior to encountering any basilisks.\nEffective means to protect the party from the petrifying gaze include:\nBoth of the Lesser Basilisk's attacks (melee and ranged petrification) have a speed factor of 3. That means a party coming out of hiding/invisibility and using low speed factor weapons (eg +2 daggers with speed factor 0) should be able to get one attack (or more) in before the Basilisk is able to make an attack itself. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Basilisk\"&gt;Greater Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s, the Lesser Basilisks can only attack once per round.\nMoreover, considering the fact they start with their ranged \"weapon\" equipped, that means melee attackers will get both a -4 THAC0 and +4 damage bonus against the Basilisk until the creature decides to switch to their melee \"weapon\". As such, a properly-equipped party with access to invisibility and/or hide-in-shadows (available not just for Thieves, but also Monks and Rangers) could take down an isolated Basilisk even without access to any form of protection against petrification. And that's especially the case if there are any backstabbers involved, as that +4 damage bonus against the Basilisk is factored into backstabs.\nFinally, their ranged petrification attack comes with a massive 32767 bonus to hit, meaning it effectively cannot be avoided unless the Basilisk rolls a 1. So targeted characters are almost guaranteed to have to roll a save vs petrification (that carries a hefty -4 penalty)."}

{"id": "51563", "revid": "282198", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=51563", "title": "Lesser Demon Lord", "text": "This unique demon is encountered in the ritual chamber within the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Lolth\"&gt;Temple of Lolth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ust%20Natha\"&gt;Ust Natha&lt;/a&gt;. The demon is summoned forth by &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt;, after she is provided certain necessary components provided by the party, including &lt;a href=\"Eyestalk%20of%20an%20Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Eyestalk of an Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuo-toa%27s%20Blood\"&gt;Kuo-toa's Blood&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Brain%20Blood\"&gt;Elder Brain Blood&lt;/a&gt; (or all three).\nThis encounter is part of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Drow%20Summoning%20Ritual\"&gt;The Drow Summoning Ritual&lt;/a&gt; quest.\nThe stats and abilities summarized on this page and in the InfoBox have no bearing on the player's adventure - unless the party faces the demon in battle.\nThe only way to battle this demon is to allow the demon to get its hands on the real dragon eggs - whether from the matron or Phaere. Once that happens the demon will expose the party as non drow intruders and turn hostile (including all drow in the city).\nAnother method is to have the demon lord slay the matron, and just as Phaere is about to hand over the real dragon eggs to the fiend, a dialogue option presents so that the PC can interrupt this process (or remain silent). If interrupted, Phaere and the demon lord will turn hostile, the party will be exposed, and the entire drow city will be immediately hostile as well.\nIf PC is of evil alignment and has the real dragon eggs still in possession, then a dialogue option will present itself. The PC may trade the dragon eggs for a favor from the demon (or remain silent).\nThe choices of what are allowed to ask for and potential rewards are covered in &lt;a href=\"The%20Drow%20Summoning%20Ritual\"&gt;The Drow Summoning Ritual&lt;/a&gt; article.\nIf the demon lord never gets the real dragon eggs and has slain both the matron and Phaere, the PC can just remain silent or tell the demon to return from whence it came. The party then needs to decide if they will grab some loot in the room and head for the Ust Natha exit - or risk remaining in the city longer and attacking the drow.\nGameplay.\nThe lesser demon lord is scripted to attack in melee combat and select targets for various spells. Certain spells are \"force cast\" and thus are not interruptible. All of the spells listed in the InfoBox are scripted for use, some determined by target availability, and others based on timed intervals.\nA +5 or better enchantment level is needed to be able to strike the demon with a weapon. It is unusual that this demon has zero fire resistance, and this vulnerability may be put to use by the party.\nThe demon has a high magic resistance, so effects which do not bypass this are likely to fail against the demon.\nAs long as the party has access to a +5 enchanted item(s), this creature is not defensively tough or durable in any way and will be quickly susceptible to reducing its mediocre hit points. Killing the demon with magic can be problematic due to its magic resistance. Spells that ignore magic resistance can work very well.\nShould the demon be defeated by the party, the creature provides only its assigned XP reward, and drops no loot or items.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod, and the \"Improved Fiends\" component will alter the Lesser Demon Lord.

The demon will adjust its attacks depending on party protective spells and certain items equipped. It will do a good job not squandering attacks on a party member protected against its attacks until that protection is removed, and or will select a more vulnerable target. The game difficulty selection will affect the challenge factor and what the creature is able to do offensively. \nThose not protected against instant death effects will be at risk during this battle, probably exposed to such effects several times. The demon will typically perform melee attacks and one innate ability cast each round, until dead."}

See below:\nLesser Restoration\nLevel: 4\nSchool: Necromancy\nSphere: Necromantic\nRange: Touch\nDuration: Permanent\nCasting Time: 4\nArea of Effect: 1 creature\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient is raised. This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature by a force or monster.\nThe casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, leaving him physically and mentally exhausted. For 5 rounds after the spell is cast, the priest will suffer a -2 penalty to hit, damage, armor class, and casting speed factor."}

{"id": "9117", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9117", "title": "Lich", "text": "Liches are powerful &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magic-users&lt;/a&gt; that can be very dangerous to an under leveled or unprepared party. \nThis article page reflects the creature stats for a \"generic\" lich used in the and games, as well as the enhanced edition versions.\nThis particular cookie cutter game lich will be encountered in several areas, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Temple\"&gt;Ruined Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%202\"&gt;Spellhold Bodhi's Hunt Level 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttention to the fact that the developers made it quite low-level for most liches in the Dungeons and Dragons setting. This won't affect its spell book variety, as it can still cast up to level 9 Wizard spells, but it will make it difficult for it to dispel any magic on the party, and conversely, easier for the party to do so in return - this is most likely done on purpose for novice players. Unfortunately for veteran players looking for the \"real thing\", the lich is somewhat hamstrung by this caster level reduction.\nThe InfoBox on this page reflects the creature used in the game for certain area \"High level spawn\" enemies.\nAbilities.\nMost lich immunities are derived from two undroppable items they have equipped. There is some overlap between the two. The InfoBox breaks these down.\nBeing formidable spellcasters, liches have access to and typically open battles with &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt; to make themselves nigh invincible. They can also cast powerful crowd control spells like &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Stun%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Fear%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Fear&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs undead, liches are vulnerable to anti-undead weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Disruption\"&gt;Mace of Disruption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azuredge\"&gt;Azuredge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Earth\"&gt;The Burning Earth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Daystar\"&gt;Daystar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlmost all Liches are equipped with two undroppable items, one in each Ring slot. These items are used by the game engine to provide the lich with various protections and immunities to status effects, spells, specific damage types, weapon enchantment and other factors. The last item is the Lich's touch attack melee weapon. These items are:\nLich combat actions.\nThese creatures only conduct melee touch attacks as a last resort. They are not a high threat in this style of combat, unless playing a solo character and getting paralyzed. \nTheir THAC0 is not good enough to hit most opponents consistently, and they typically only get one attack per round with their touch attack.\nIt is more likely that a Lich will continue spell casting at point blank range in an unmodded game, rather than engaging in close quarters combat. \nLocations.\nNamed liches.\nSeveral liches in the game have unique names, and differing abilities, stats and sometimes much higher casting levels:\nHigh level spawns.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; has an &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; of at least 2,000,000 points, liches, each time accompanied by two &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20warrior\"&gt;skeleton warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and two &lt;a href=\"greater%20mummies\"&gt;greater mummies&lt;/a&gt;, will spawn at the following locations:\nGeneral strategy.\nSee this article's \"Talk Page\" linked &lt;a href=\"https%3A//baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Talk%3ALich\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for tips, and combat strategy thoughts that generally are effective against a lich.\nMod content.\nMods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod doesn't use this generic 11-th level lich creature and disables it. \nInstead, it will replace the creature with a level 25 lich with a randomly determined specialty mage kit (Conjurer, Enchanter, Invoker or Necromancer.\nSCS has nine different random liches to choose from.\nThe lich creature selected will have unique AI scripts and spell casting abilities will differ depending on the lich's assigned kit.\nThe SCS mod will improve a Lich's AI noticeably over the basic and unmodded EE versions of the creature. If the SCS \"Smarter Mages\" component is also installed, a Lich will be even more formidable, in that it will utilize triggers, sequencers and contingency abilities. This component also works with the game difficulty settings, and this could mean that a Lich will also have access, and use, Mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt;. Most SCS liches can see invisible creatures, and this cannot be blocked or dispelled. The exception is the Lich\" Nevaziah\" in the Lower Tombs as part of &lt;a href=\"Find%20the%20Nether%20Scroll%20for%20Edwin\"&gt;Find the Nether Scroll for Edwin&lt;/a&gt; questline. \nSCS Liches gain a \"Fear Aura\" ability, an innate power they may use with a fairly large area of effect. A saving throw with penalty negates the &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; effect, but it is unaffected by spell level protections and magic resistance. \nSCS will also increase the accompanying creatures present with a spawned Lich as part of the High-level spawns (as mentioned above in the main article). There will probably be additional Giant Skeleton Warrior archers and a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Golem\"&gt;Bone Golem&lt;/a&gt; if the PC is at or above 2M XP. At the highest difficulty a lich spawn is accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mummy\"&gt;Greater Mummy&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Golem\"&gt;Bone Golem&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and Skeleton Warrior Archer .\nSCS adds a Fire Lich to &lt;a href=\"Yaga-Shura%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Yaga-Shura's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. SCS adds an apprentice lich with &lt;a href=\"Odamaron\"&gt;Odamaron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Enclave\"&gt;Sendai's Enclave&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the SCS \"More Consistent Breach\" component is installed, a level 5 &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; Spell can target a Lich, which it cannot in an unmodified game. However, SCS changes Breach to be blocked by all of the Spell Protection options such as Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning and Spell Trap.\nInstalling &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; will change the Liches spells to the SR versions. This is compatible with SCS by design. With SR, several of the \"standard\" favored mage and lich dueling tactics will differ, as there is no &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; option (it's now replaced by a \"Dispelling Screen\"). Both the AI and the party will have more options available to conduct a spell \"chess match\" with this mod installed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Asylum\"&gt;Improved Asylum&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a lich to &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%202\"&gt;Spellhold Bodhi's Hunt Level 2&lt;/a&gt;. If the protagonist has 2M XP, the High-level spawn lich will also be present, right across the hallway.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Quest Pack&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a lich to the &lt;a href=\"Kuo%20Toa%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Western Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;."}

Use this to your advantage.\nIf the party is under some kind of invisibility, sanctuaried, or hidden, the lich will remain neutral and not even speak.\nIt is possible that a stealthy rogue could enter this crypt and investigate the chest and sarcophagus without alerting the undead mage - although it could expose the character as well, depending on what kind of action is taken. It is also possible to pickpocket this creature - if you dare.\nThe safest way to deal with the lich, is to be under the effects of a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Undead\"&gt;Protection From Undead&lt;/a&gt; scroll - with such a scroll the lich won't be able to find or target the interloping character and the monster could be killed with impunity with a simple magical weapon. Clearly this method is almost risk free, but don't expect it to be written into the annals of courage.\nAnother option is to simply get out of the crypt once it is known what is inside and stay out for now, especially if the party is not ready to face such a creature. Let's hope that the lich won't follow the party beyond its crypt.\nMaybe it's better to pay a visit to this lich when the party is better equipped, after having acquired &lt;a href=\"Azuredge\"&gt;Azuredge&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Disruption\"&gt;Mace of Disruption&lt;/a&gt; first, and use them to destroy it.\nShould the party destroy the lich, make sure any desired treasure is collected from the undead mage's robes and purse - and examine that big chest in the chamber too. Who better than a lich to have something worthwhile?\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises some aspects of the encounter with this lich. The first change is that one or more party members who initially enter the Crypt will not be able to leave this area until the lich is destroyed. Other party members who didn't transition with the first group cannot enter the Crypt until the lich is dead. \nWhen a party member tries to leave or enter the Crypt while the lich is still viable - A text will display, reading: \"An invisible wall of force has blocked the doorway.\"\nSCS has raised the experience level of this lich to 30. The mod also assigns a mage specialty kit to the lich, which is randomly selected at installation of the mod, either Conjurer, Enchanter, Invoker or Necromancer.\nThe selected kit determines the available spells that can be cast by the lich.\nThe player's game difficulty selection and specific components installed will determine if this lich has access to mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; use.\nRegardless of what kit the lich has assigned, expect a wide variety of potential spells available, and that the creature will aggressively use dispel/remove magic. It can attempt more than one &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, as well as various spell protection removers like &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khelben%27s%20Warding%20Whip\"&gt;Khelben's Warding Whip&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe lich will have use of prepared &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; options.\nUnlike the base game's lich, this one can &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "35658", "revid": "3234315", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=35658", "title": "Lonk", "text": ""}
{"id": "34932", "revid": "31124876", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34932", "title": "Lonk the Sane", "text": "Lonk the Sane is a dwarven wizard aligned with the Cowled Wizards who serves as a caretaker at &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt;, also known as The Residence for the Magically Deviant. Here, he attempts to keep the inmates docile and in-order with cajoling, offers of baked goods, and powerful magical abilities.\nHistory.\nDuring 1369 DR (the time of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn), Lonk was working at Spellhold. When &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; broke out and massacred the Cowled Wizards working at the asylum, he chose to spare Lonk for reasons that the player never comes to learn.\nGameplay.\nIf the player opts to enter the asylum by having themselves declared insane by the Pirate Lord, Lonk will greet them once they wake up in their cells, explaining who he is in a perfunctory manner before telling them to join the other inmates in their rest period.\nRegardless of how they entered the asylum, after the party fights their way back to the Main Floor from the testing dungeon below, Lonk will intercept them and incredulously demand they go back to their cells. The player can demand or ask for the \"key', but Lonk will never give it to the party (there is no actual key or item for this section of the plot). Other dialogue options are needed to prevent hostilities. The party can try and bribe Lonk or convince him to just free the inmates and step aside.\nConvince Lonk: For brevity's sake, the party spokesperson (position number 1 of the party order) will be checked for an {unknown \"ReactionLT\" value in the game files) lower or upper value (might be Party Reputation, Charisma or Wisdom or combination value ) to convince Lonk to allow the inmates to be freed or offer a bribe. The party may say: \nAnd Lonk will either reply in the negative or positive to convince him, based on the reaction check. He'll say either:\nIf the reaction check is successful, Lonk will say:\nThe party may now move forward to address the wacko inmates. Lonk will never be seen again.\nBribe Lonk: To properly bribe Lonk requires selecting the correct dialogue choice, and to offer 2,000 gold pieces. The player can also offer 200 or 10,000 gold pieces, but these will prompt Lonk to attack - the former for the paltry scale of the bribe, the latter out of incredulous dismissal that the player could have that much money. If the wrong choice is made it's too late to counteroffer or change the offer. If he accepts the bribe Lonk says:\nThe party may progress to address the crazy inmates. Lonk will never be seen again.\nFight Lonk: If the party decides to fight the mage, once hostilities begin the mage will be able to launch a \"forcecast\" group of protective buffs to include: &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Electricity%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Protection From Electricity (spell)&lt;/a&gt;. Next the script looks for the party members in detection range that are under certain spell effects - if any are detected Lonk casts a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;. After that a &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; is attempted.\nNow, if able, the mage will attempt some offensive oriented spell casts. Expect a &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; and so forth. If Lonk is disabled with a Silence effect, he'll initiate a &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt;. Several other contingency triggers can be used to rapidly get up more defenses in the battle, such as more Stoneskin, Spell Turning, or Globe of Invulnerability protections.\nAfter Lonk is destroyed, the party is able to go forward and find the sanity-challenged inmates to progress the plot. Just before doing this, it is a good time to apply some buffs as the battle with irenicus is coming next.\nLonk is fitted with the &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt; during his first appearance, but this is removed during the second encounter.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises Lonk's AI scripts especially with the \"Smarter Mage\" component. Upon install the mod randomizes mage kits, and Lonk might be a Necromancer or Enchanter for example. The mod assigns a new spellbook of available mage spells for use, and depending on the selected game difficulty, can include mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; choices as well.\nLonk opens hostilities with the following \"previously cast\" spells: &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;SI Abjuration&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Dispelling Screen\" with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt; mod, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Animate Dead (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Animate Skeleton Warrior\" with the SR mod).\nLonk has prepared and ready to instantly launch a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt;. Expect a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; and on certain settings a &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; followed by numerous spell casts.\nWith Lonk defeated, the party can just walk into the cellblock area and contact the mentally challenged inmates."}

{"id": "10188", "revid": "273078", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10188", "title": "Lore", "text": "Lore gives a character a 'natural' insight into discerning masked item properties. This insight continues to grow each time a character levels but at a rate determined by its class.\nIntroduction.\nCandidate items requiring identification usually possess some sort of magical enhancement or property, but not always. Some books, potions and scrolls may also need to be identified using the Lore rating of the examining character. Cursed items are always very difficult to detect. The bard class, as part of their innate bardic lore background, are ideally suited for deciphering the hidden treasures that are unearthed.\nTo compare for a moment, \"classic\" D&amp;D uses the Lore function (sometimes implemented as a character \"skill\") to help solve puzzles, determine the characteristics of creatures, discern the terrain or interact with NPCs through conversation, among many other uses. The expanded use is not, however, the case in the &lt;a href=\"game%20mechanics\"&gt;game mechanics&lt;/a&gt;. It just identifies.\nDescription, from the :\n\"\"Each character has a lore rating. Every item has a lore value. If a character's lore rating is equivalent or higher than an item's lore value, then that character may identify that item. As characters gain levels, they are able to identify items based on their experience.\"\n\"A character receives bonuses (and penalties) to their lore rating based on their Intelligence and Wisdom. The modifier is not cumulative with each level, but each ability bonus is applied separately. It is a \"one-time\" bonus at character creation.\"\"\nIn fact, what this means is that it's a flat bonus based only on your Intelligence and Wisdom scores. It is, in fact, recalculated if your Wisdom or Intelligence change, or are buffed or debuffed (contrary to what is stated above): so potions that give temporary bonuses to your Int and Wis will give a bonus to your Lore rating for their duration.\nAssessing lore's in-game impact and utility.\nIn \"Baldur's Gate\", an unidentified item which possesses one or more magical properties does not necessarily need to be identified (via Lore or by a merchant) to be used.\nAs a few examples: an unidentified &lt;a href=\"Algernon%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;Algernon's Cloak&lt;/a&gt; will still charm creatures and an unidentified &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Wizardry\"&gt;Ring of Wizardry&lt;/a&gt; will still double the number of Level 1 mage spells. Also, the character screen will display any item's magical influence regardless of its ID status and the character animation will reflect the item's properties in the same manner (eg. an unidentified pair of &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Boots of Speed&lt;/a&gt; will still increase travel speed of its wearer). Notable exceptions to this game idiosyncrasy are the types of items which must be placed into Quick Item Slots (like wands), items which are not equip-able in those slots until identified.\nThe key, potential hazard of equipping unidentified items is the possibility of being cursed or poly-morphed. In a single-player environment, the danger is less critical since a preemptive save/reload can \"undo\" a player's hasty action. However, in a multi-player game, only a priest with at least 5 levels (or a visit to a temple) can restore a character's well-being. Resting will end the poly-morph effect unless the effect has been combined into a curse.\nGenerally-speaking, identifying every magical item can be expedited inexpensively with either a bard or mage who can write the &lt;a href=\"Identify%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Identify&lt;/a&gt; spell into their spellbook (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Conjurers&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Edwin\"&gt;Edwin&lt;/a&gt;). An Identify scroll costs approximately the same as the merchant fee for identifying a single item so is economical for any arcanist member to have in their spell repertoire to use on demand.\n&lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;, with her uncharacteristic thief INT level (17) is ideal for identifying low Lore value items like magical ammo and most +1 equipment using her Lore rating alone... with her seldom-enlisted roguish cousin, the bard, still better. Mages identify well with the initial Lore boost at character creation due to high INT level but level-up slower than thieves.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Garrick\"&gt;Garrick&lt;/a&gt; is a reliable, early-accessible bard to intermittently enlist for his utility Lore potential since he will readily dispatch and rejoin parties with just about any reputation... a boon of his neutral alignment. Evil &lt;a href=\"Eldoth\"&gt;Eldoth&lt;/a&gt;'s membership may not be as easy to manipulate, depending on the party reputation. All bards can learn the Identify spell.\nItem lore values.\nThe following table displays the minimum Lore ratings needed to identify items. In the \"\", several values were raised.\nLore tweaking.\nThe character with the maximum possible lore, through use of the Export feature or &lt;a href=\"Console\"&gt;Console&lt;/a&gt;, is a level 40 non-Blade bard (base 400), with 25 in both intelligence and wisdom (+80), dual-wielding Balduran's long swords (+20) and using the High Level Ability \"Use Any Item\" to equip the Cloak of Minor Arcana for a total of 510. \nWithout cheating, the Cloak of Minor Arcana cannot carry through from BG1:SoD to BG2:SoA, and has to be cheated in via the console: the Sword of Balduran is a unique item, so a second cannot be obtained without the console: and the maximum Wisdom attainable is 23 (18 to start BG1, +3 from tomes during BG1, +1 from Tear of Bhaal in BG2:SoA, +1 from Machine of Lum in BG2:ToB). Thus, the maximum \"legitimate\" Lore is base 400 (L40 Bard) +40 (25 Int is temporarily possible from stacked Potions of Genius and Mind Focusing, regardless of starting Int) +30 (23 Wis) +10 (1 Sword of Balduran) = 480.\nAchievements.\nLoremaster BG1.\nHave a Lore skill of 100 or more during or .\nLoremaster BG2.\nHave a Lore skill of 100 or more during ."}

The purpose of the spell is to reduce the enemy's resistance to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, making them vulnerable the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Dragon%20Breath\"&gt;Red Dragon Breath&lt;/a&gt; attack.\nEffects.\nThe spell effect is uninterruptable and takes almost no time to deploy. The scripted targeting will fire over a selected target area, and all creatures in the area of effect (except for the caster and caster allies) are subject to the effects. The spell reduces fire resistance by -50% with a duration of 6 rounds (36 seconds). A &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; vs. Spell with a -3 penalty will negate.\nIf the saving throw is missed, then any creature who is affected will have a short animation spell effect graphic played over the figure, as well as an audible sound effect. However, there is no text message displayed. The animation is the blue SHAIR graphic (similar to the one seen if you are struck by a vampire and level drained)."}

The Lower Reaches is also known as The Forgotten Believers\u2014Temple City, and The Rift Area.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Screaming Statue.\nUpon entering the Lower Reaches, you see pipes to the left, a tunnel to the right, a giant hand reaching towards you from the cavern floor, and ahead, a statue that appears to be screaming.\nApproaching the giant hand triggers the spawning of three &lt;a href=\"Huge%20Spider\"&gt;Huge Spiders&lt;/a&gt; off to the right near the pipes.\nHovering the mouse over the statue gives the player the now recognizable question mark that indicates there might be something more to discover here. However, clicking on the statue, rather than giving the player an informational status message, spawns a &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Horror\"&gt;Wandering Horror&lt;/a&gt; () and two &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Spider\"&gt;Sword Spiders&lt;/a&gt; ( each). This spawn event can happen up to five times, once per click, after which the trap runs out of spiders and horrors to summon.\nOn the face of the statue is a treasure stash , trapped with a &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;, which can be looted without enemies spawning.\nWhen you are done farming experience here, continue through the hallway to the right (east).\nTunnel.\nTo the east of the entrance chamber is a connecting tunnel that has three spawn points.\nThe Fallen Bridge and the Rift Guardian.\nBeyond the tunnel, another chamber opens up and a status message reads:\"A great tear in the earth has split asunder the structure before you. The roof of the structure is covered in tiny but intricate designs. You would do well to investigate them.\"This large chamber has a broken bridge that needs to be repaired to cross. There is a &lt;a href=\"Petrified\"&gt;petrification&lt;/a&gt; trap on the stairs. Click on the broken bridge to answer three riddles posed by the \"Rift Guardian\":\nThe section below is a \"Spoiler\". Click on the \"Reveal\" button if you want to be provided the answers to the riddles. Don't do it if you want to figure this out on your own, like a first-time player was meant to.\nThe answers are \"Life,\" \"Time,\" and \"The current one.\" \nAnswer correctly and the bridge will be rejoined, connecting the two halves, and will bestow the party . \nAnswering incorrectly spawns a hostile Undead creature of type depending on which question was asked: \nCrossing to the other side will be a variable size group of &lt;a href=\"Gauth\"&gt;Gauth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholder&lt;/a&gt; defenders from the third spawn trigger, while &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fiend\"&gt;Shadow Fiends&lt;/a&gt; attack from a fourth spawn point in the northwest tunnel.\nFor hints on this battle, see &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Reaches%23Gameplay\"&gt;Gameplay&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the southeastern side of the bridge just below one of its columns is a random treasure stash that includes &lt;a href=\"Ashideena\"&gt;Ashideena&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"War%20Hammer%20%2B2\"&gt;Warhammer +2&lt;/a&gt; that also inflicts an extra point of electrical damage.\nWhen you are ready, continue on through the tunnel to the northwest.\nThe Diseased Ones.\nFollow the hallway leading north from the bridge. There's a &lt;a href=\"Petrified\"&gt;petrification&lt;/a&gt; trap at the end of the tunnel . Enter the cavern and follow the central jetty until you come to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Forgotten%20God\"&gt;Temple of the Forgotten God&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn front of the temple stands a mysterious robed figure called &lt;a href=\"The%20Diseased%20One\"&gt;The Diseased One&lt;/a&gt; who will speak to you when you approach. He is flanked by two Diseased Children (a boy and a girl). On the north jetty is another Diseased Woman, and on the south jetty yet another emaciated Diseased Man. You may ask all of them questions. The sense you get from them is apathy, despair, and ultimately hatred for the one inside the temple, a long-forgotten entity who has tasked them with eternal guardianship. They explain that they have been granted the power by the one they guard to live, die and be reborn endlessly (the cause of their decaying disease), but they no longer remember who or what it is. Likewise, they care nothing of your purpose and will not assist or impede you.\nWhen you are ready, enter the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Forgotten%20God\"&gt;Temple of the Forgotten God&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ancient Temple.\nUpon entering The Ancient Temple you see what appears to be a &lt;a href=\"Tanar%27ri\"&gt;Tanar'ri&lt;/a&gt; demon, perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Nabassu\"&gt;Nabassu&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Empathic%20Manifestation\"&gt;Empathic Manifestation&lt;/a&gt; speaks as it attacks the party:\"Hate is here! Here is hate! Attack with anger and feed the hate! The hate! Hate... Suffering... I feed on these... they harm me not... I feed!\"The manifestation feeds on hatred and suffering. Therefore, combat does not kill it, but only feeds it. This will quickly become apparrent that nothing seems to get rid of this creature, no matter the amount of various damage applied to it. It seems to relish being hurt. Perhaps the party should try the opposite of harming it?\nNote, the \"Reveal\" button below will furnish a method to defeat the Manifestation. This is a \"spoiler\". Can you do it without being provided the answer like a first-time player was meant to?\nThe only thing that will defeat it is the opposite of Wounding; Healing. However, attempting to cast a healing spell on the manifestation while it is attacking is problematic, as its blows disrupt your spell casting. However, as it comes from charged items, the healing from a scroll, the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Curing\"&gt;Staff of Curing&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Gloves%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Gloves of Healing&lt;/a&gt; cannot be disrupted, although their wielders are still open to attack. Likewise, a Paladin or Gorion's Ward may attempt his/her fast-casting Innate Cure ability. Having multiple party members cast some healing on the Empathic Manifestation at the same time makes the odds of one of them landing much better. Once such a healing effect occurs, the manifestation will wither away and disappear from the map.\nDefeating the manifestation itself will not grant the party any experience points, but an Avatar of Amauator appears immediately after it's banishment - to gain any experience points, you must first talk with the Avatar.\nThe Forgotten God Amaunator.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Amaunator\"&gt;Avatar of Amaunator&lt;/a&gt; speaks to you, asking:\"Whoooooo walks in the temple of I? Speak of yourself, you are almost beyond the sight of I.\"\nRegardless of how the player responds, the party will gain .\nEventually, the Avatar gives the party the first half of the rod, the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Device%20Part%20%28first%20part%29\"&gt;Rift Device Part&lt;/a&gt;, and your Journal is updated:\"I have spoken to the avatar of a god that no longer has the faith of the guardians who live in this dungeon. He asked me to take the relic he has vowed to protect, and combine it with the half that the beholder has. I may use the completed item to destroy the beholder...on several conditions. One: it can only be used once.\u00a0 Two: that I tell his people I intend to complete the item so that it can be returned here and destroyed fully.\u00a0 Three: I bring the completed rod back and instill even the briefest moment of faith in his people, so the avatar might have the power to destroy the rod and end the service the guardians have been bound to.\"There is a treasure stash in the torch in the center of the altar behind the Avatar. It may include a healing scroll that can be used in order to banish the Empathic Manifestation if you haven't done this already by other means. Clicking the back portion of the altar also displays the status message, \"There is a sense of holiness about the altar.\"\nNext Steps.\nUpon exiting the temple, the robed Diseased One is there to scoff at the party.\"Have you enjoyed your visit? Of course you found nothing and of course you will leave empty handed. There is... you... You have the great device! What are you doing with that? It cannot be moved! It has not been moved in a millennia!\"You can respond one of two ways: dialog option #1 \"It is the will of your god... it is to be destroyed... You will be free of your duty\", and option #2 \"I have taken it for myself. You cannot stop me.\" Both responses elicit disbelief, despair and his conclusion that nothing will change. The conversation ends. If you try talking to him again, all he has to say at the moment is:\"You have taken what purpose we had left. There is no end here.\"To give them the hope and faith that their god wants them to have, you must join the two rift device parts together to complete the tasks ahead of you.\nGameplay.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Sewers\"&gt;Cloak of the Sewers&lt;/a&gt; can be a big help, but equip it to a -preferably hasted- character who normally has at least two &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;APR&lt;/a&gt;. During the fight against Gauths and/or Beholders, Shadows and Shadow Fiends might also move down from the north, with melee attacks that can quickly defeat the advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20Jelly\"&gt;Mustard Jelly&lt;/a&gt; form. The &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Shield of Balduran&lt;/a&gt; is also a big help against Gauth and Beholder ray attacks. A good combo against Gauths is Skeletons and Cloudkill (1-2 Skeleton Warriors confronting them in an area where 1-2 Cloudkills have been cast), while the rest of the party stays safely back out of the creatures' sight and spells. And the summoned Skeletons can also help against the nearby undead."}

Once the spell casting is finished, a projectile (No. 221) travels toward the target up to 40' from the caster.\nWhen the projectile arrives at the target, a Magic Attack type 3D animation graphic plays over the target sprite, as well as a brief RGB color glow. The combat screen displays \"Magic resistance lowered\" text string message. A sound effect will also audible.\nThe target's magic resistance will be lowered by the percentage amount indicated in the description above, lasting for at least nine rounds (and longer depending on the caster's level). A target with no magic resistance will not have a \"negative\" magic resistance rating. Zero is as low as it can go.\nThe spell can target invisible, hidden or sanctuaried creatures.\nThe spell ignores illusionary defenses such as &lt;a href=\"Reflected%20Image\"&gt;Reflected Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; abjuration doesn't affect this spell.\nThe spell is flagged as a \"Hostile\" spell, if cast at a neutral creature it'll make it hostile.\nHigher-level wizard spells that also lower magic resistance are &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs it is of the &lt;a href=\"magic%20attack%20type\"&gt;magic attack type&lt;/a&gt;, this spell can only be stopped by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; or by level-based immunities (&lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Blocking\"&gt;Potion of Magic Blocking&lt;/a&gt;, innate resistance of &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; enemies to level 5 spells and lower). \nThis spell can be directed at invisible enemies with the targeting cursor, just like other magic attack spells. \nNote.\nIn some cases (like when facing dragons) lower-level parties are actually better off using &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Resistance%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Magic Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, a priest spell, on enemies. Like Lower Resistance, it allows no saving throw but sets MR to (caster level)*2%. Thus a level 12 cleric will set the dragon's MR to 24%, while Lower Resistance from a caster of the same level will lower its MR by -22%. Now, if that dragon has 60% MR it's obvious that 24%&lt;(60%-22%) and thus Magic Resistance is the clear winner. Keep in mind however, that Magic Resistance is a touch range spell with the highest possible casting time (9), which makes it difficult to apply it on enemies, whereas Lower Resistance has greater range and a shorter casting time.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeon's and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Lower Resistance\" has two versions, one from the \"Tome of Magic\" and the other from the \"Wizard's Spell Compendium\". See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its school, effects, duration and description. See below:\nLower Resistance\nLevel: 5\nSchool: Alteration\nRange: Long\nDuration: 1 round/level\nCasting Time: 5\nArea of Effect: 1 creature\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen cast upon a target creature, this spell will lower their magic resistance by 2% per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level). There is no saving throw vs. this spell and magic resistance is ignored. This spell is not affected by dispel magic. Once it has been cast, there is no way to cancel the effects until the spell expires.\nFor example, if a creature has 50% magic resistance and this spell is cast on it by a 15th level mage, then its magic resistance would be lowered by 30% automatically. This effect is cumulative for each casting of this spell. If this spell was cast upon this same creature again, the creature\u2019s magic resistance would be 50% - 30% (initial casting) - 30% (current casting) which would leave the creature with 0% magic resistance after both spells have been cast."}

Use the cursor to select the machine, which will bring up a dialogue box and allow selections to be made.

Not content with his current station, he is planning to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Renal%20Bloodscalp\"&gt;Renal Bloodscalp&lt;/a&gt; so he can rise in rank within the Shadow Thief hierarchy.\nIt is rumored that Mae'Var may have been hired by &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Irenicu&lt;/a&gt;s to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and that he conspired with the Night Knives of Esmeltaran to snatch the Ward outside the city of &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28city%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and bring the prisoner to Amn. \nGameplay.\nOnce hostilities breakout against Mae'Var, he and his fellow guild members will be waiting in the lower level of the guild. By script, he was designed to cast a number of spells, and utilize his fairly high-level mage ability. The creature script is well designed and extensive for the unmodded game. The problem is (developer error?) that he has equipped armor that disables spell casting. So, while it is possible in the game engine coding to force a spell cast by script even if wearing armor, this is actually not the case, and Mae'Var can't cast any of his spells. The info box documents what spells he might have been able to use.\nDuring the events of the \"Shadows of Amn\", Renal Bloodscalp will send you to work under Mae'Var to spy on him and find proof of his suspected treachery. if proof can be found, Renal will most likely want you to dispatch Mae'Var.\nMae'Var has enlisted the thayan mage &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Odesseiron\"&gt;Edwin Odesseiron&lt;/a&gt; to his services - but Gorion's Ward will learn that Edwin is open to betray his new master during the &lt;a href=\"Find%20Proof%20of%20Mae%27Var%27s%20Treachery\"&gt;Mae'Var Treachery quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes some revisions to Mae'Var. He is a level 13/15 Mage/Thief with Conjurer Kit. To begin with, he is assigned a new default AI script combining his ability to backstab and spell cast as a mage. If you have the \"Smarter Mages\" component installed this will be included. He gets some different memorized spells to work with as well. Mae'Var also is no longer wearing any equipped torso armor (he still has the invisible &lt;a href=\"HELMNOAN.ITM\"&gt;HELMNOAN.ITM&lt;/a&gt;). This allows SCS to be able to employ its existing spell casting scripts for the Mage/Thief.\nAt the beginning of hostilities, he will employ a spell contingency protecting himself with Improved Invisibility, Non-detection and Spell Deflection. If he is approached by an invisble opponent, the SCS script will show an on-screen text message indicating he has heard something or suspects a spy, and he auto casts an &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; spell. His cohorts and allied Priest of Cyric will also move toward any detected intruders.\nMae'Var also has a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; loaded with a double &lt;a href=\"Color%20Spray\"&gt;Color Spray&lt;/a&gt; attack. If given enough time, the tricky rogue will also be able to get up a PfMW, and cast &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; at a vulnerable party member. In short, the SCS version of Mae'Var is a much more difficult challenge than the unmodded game. Mae'Var and any allied thieves (who turn invisible via potions) will attempt backstab attacks on the party. "}

For the version in , refer to &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;Mage (Baldur's Gate)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntroduction.\nMages are best known for their ability to cast spells which lead to various effects on creatures and objects. Their magic can be used for offensive ends, inflicting damage and &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt; on the target. It can also be used for supportive goals, improving the stats of the mage or allies, and can be used to summon creatures. Generally, the mage's &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Magic\"&gt;arcane magic&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used to heal; that skill is the domain of divine casters, such as &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;shamans.&lt;/a&gt; Mages are, however, able to &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Curse%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;remove curses&lt;/a&gt; from allies.\nTheir mastery of the magical art comes at the price of weakness in physical combat, as they can neither absorb nor deal large amounts of physical damage. Mages are unable to use most heavy defensive equipment such as shields, headgear and body armor, instead they are largely restricted to magical robes and bracers. For that reason mages aren't usually found on the front line of large battles. They also have a limited selection of weapons, being restricted to staves, daggers, slings and darts, and may place no more than one skill point in any of these. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Specialist Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, mages can learn any spell from all eight schools of magic. Mages are free to choose any alignment they like.\nIn order for mages to cast a spell, first they need to successfully scribe a mage spell scroll into their spellbook (scroll lost in process regardless of success or failure). A mage may have any number of spells scribed and available to memorize. They must choose which spells they will have available for immediate use by placing them into a limited number of spell slots. The mage must then &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; for eight hours to memorize the spells, which prepares them for casting.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; may become mages;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s will automatically become &lt;a href=\"Illusionist\"&gt;Illusionist&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAbility Scores.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for humans; other Races have modified ability scores.\n^ Prime Requisites for &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;Dual-classing&lt;/a&gt;.\n^^ Applies only to standard Mage and the Wild Mage class kit.

To do so, they study strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of their time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic there are different types of wizards. The Mages study all types of magic and learn a wide variety of spells; their broad range makes them well suited to the demands of adventuring.\nClass features:\n&lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Specialist Mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nClass features:\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Wild%20Mage\"&gt;Wild Mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nWild Mages are wizards who specialize in the study of wild magic. They have access to spells to protect themselves from wild magic and bend it to their wills. Wild magic is extremely unpredictable and should be used with caution.\nWild Magic is a new type of magic that is characterized by powerful and dangerous surges of unpredictable magic. Generally considered to be an unfortunate byproduct of the Time of Troubles, wild magic has recently begun to attract the attention of many a curious or scholarly wizard.\nClass features:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nMages start to learn level 10 spells beginning at level 18.

There is no benefit beyond the 8th HLA gain as none may be chosen more than once.\nMemorizable spells progression.\nThe number of memorizable &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; by increases with nearly every newly gained &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;, only from twenty onwards there are some levels without progression. The related game files' table, codice_1, defines spell progression even for levels that cannot be gained by player-controlled characters, marked red below; however, there are a few and &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; mages leveled this high.\nThere are items in the game that, when equipped, allow to memorize more spells of certain levels. Also, mages can gain an additional level 6, 7 and 8 slot by spending a High-Level Ability (HLA).

Compared to single-class thieves, the slower &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; progression reduces backstab success rate and lower HP makes it harder to survive after becoming visible, but these shortcomings can be mitigated by the effective use of spells. For example, &lt;a href=\"Tenser%27s%20Transformation\"&gt;Tenser's Transformation&lt;/a&gt; can dramatically decrease &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and long duration defensive spells such as &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; can be cast before entering stealth to improve survival. When using the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Vecna\"&gt;Robe of Vecna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; can be used to allow the M/T to immediately re-enter stealth after breaking it, avoiding retaliation and setting up for multiple backstabs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; spell is especially notable for this class combination. After using Mislead, attacks will not break invisibility as long as the duplicate image remains, allowing the M/T to continue to backstab until the image is dispelled, destroyed, or expires. &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20Round%23Effects\"&gt;APR-increasing spells&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; can also allow for a greater number of backstabs while Mislead is active. At extremely high levels, the M/T can use &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Set%20Time%20Trap\"&gt;Set Time Trap&lt;/a&gt; in combination with Mislead to guarantee multiple backstabs.\nOutside of backstabbing, the M/T can use the thief's Hide in Shadows ability to position more effectively for encounters. For example, the M/T can position behind an enemy group, allow their party to engage normally, and then use area of effect spells like &lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull Trap&lt;/a&gt; with better precision.\nM/T's are ideally suited to using the &lt;a href=\"Exploits%23Fog%20of%20War%20Trick\"&gt;Fog of War/Line of Sight&lt;/a&gt; strategy since they can both scout for enemies while hidden and then use AOE spells to dispatch them without detection. The ability to cast &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; multiplies the number of available &lt;a href=\"Thief%23High-level%20class%20abilities\"&gt;Thief HLAs&lt;/a&gt; (multiple uses of &lt;a href=\"Assassination\"&gt;Assassination&lt;/a&gt;, more &lt;a href=\"Set%20Spike%20Trap\"&gt;Spike Traps&lt;/a&gt;, etc.).\nThieves' &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Illusion%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Detect Illusion&lt;/a&gt; is also useful for this class, as it can be used as an alternative to &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; and save valuable Level 6 Spell Slots for other spells. Detect Illusion can be increased quickly at the expense of Move Silently and Hide in Shadows. The rationale behind this is that M/T can use &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; to scout ahead and backstab enemies and both these spells occupy lower tier spell slots.\nUnlike for a single-class thief, the &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; HLA offers fewer advantages for this class combination, as they already have access to many of the interesting items from its mage class, and the weapons they gain access to cannot be used to backstab. Even so, it unlocks access to some very helpful equipment, such as additional &lt;a href=\"THAC0%23THAC0%20Boosting%20Equipment\"&gt;THAC0 boosting equipment&lt;/a&gt; (like &lt;a href=\"Wondrous%20Gloves\"&gt;Wondrous Gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Circlet%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Circlet of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt;), which improves the success rate of backstabs, and the coveted &lt;a href=\"Vhailor%27s%20Helm\"&gt;Vhailor's Helm&lt;/a&gt; which gives early access to the powerful &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nAs a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dual-Class\"&gt;Dual-Class&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0can approximate this class by dual-classing if they meet the attribute requirements for doing so. Note when creating a character that they may not be\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;Lawful Good&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and dual-class into thief. As with other dual-class combinations, it is generally preferable to dual from thief into mage, as your HP is better and mages will benefit much more from their uncapped progression than a thief will.\nKit Comparison for Dual-Classing:\nCommon Level Ranges for Dual-Classing:\nNote: In the original \"Baldur's Gate\", it is possible to select a &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Specialist Mage&lt;/a&gt; kit when dual-classing to mage as long as the character meets the secondary attribute requirement for the specialization. These characters lose their specialization when imported to \"Shadows of Amn\" as this feature was removed, and the \"Enhanced Editions\" do not allow it.\nSpecial abilities.\nThe mage/thief is able to combine the special abilities from both of their parent &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt;;\u00a0see there for more details.\u00a0The following list\u00a0summarizes advantages that a mage/thief has over either a pure mage or a pure thief:\nAbility Scores Table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value.\nArmor.\nThe following armors will not disable spell casting or stealth abilities.\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-Level Class Abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh level class abilities are added in the expansion \u00a0and are in . These abilities are available at level 14/16, reached at 3,000,000 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis class gains all HLA's from the standard mage and thief pools.\u00a0 Note that any HLA may be selected regardless of the class which is leveling\u00a0up.\nNote that, because of the required access to certain spell slots (notably 9th level spell slots for the 10th level mage HLA's), most mage HLA's will not be selectable until the class reaches mage level 18 at 6,000,000 XP.\u00a0 The player will have enough level-ups available\u00a0to select all mage HLA's if they choose.\n1 - May only be selected once\nSpell Slots Progression.\nThe M/T gains spell slots identical to those of the unkitted\u00a0mage; however, because of their slightly slower progression, they will have less spell slots during the course of normal play.\u00a0 Note that gnome Illusionist / Thieves will gain a bonus spell slot for each spell level in exchange for the inability to cast Necromancy spells.\n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the\u00a0\"Shadows of Amn\" campaign, M/T protagonists may choose between one of two strongholds.\u00a0 Upon accepting one, they will be unable to accept another."}

It is only available if &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; with no other stronghold, and the &lt;a href=\"Inside%20the%20Planar%20Sphere\"&gt;Inside the Planar Sphere&lt;/a&gt; side quest has been completed. Claiming the sphere will disallow any other strongholds.\nAs part of the \"Planar Sphere\" quest, &lt;a href=\"Lavok%20Corthala\"&gt;Lavok&lt;/a&gt; asks that you take him outside to see the sun of his home world once more before he dies. After a short dialog, Lavok grants you ownership of the sphere and tasks you to use it more wisely than he did.\nTo continue the Mage Stronghold quest, return back inside the sphere where Reyna and her Knights of Solomnia recognize you as the new master of the sphere. They request your help in returning home. Immediately after speaking with the knights, a Cowled Wizard emissary named &lt;a href=\"Teos\"&gt;Teos&lt;/a&gt; enters the hall via &lt;a href=\"Dimension%20Door\"&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/a&gt; and initiates bargaining.\nClaiming the Sphere.\nTeos offers Gorion's Ward a deal: prove you can be \"responsible\" (i.e., obedient to the Cowled Wizards) and they will let you maintain control over the sphere and all its many secrets. The quest is divided into a series of tasks to prove you worthy to keep the sphere.\nBenefits.\nUnlike some Strongholds, the Planar Sphere provides no financial support. It is simply a show of status, and a source of experience while undertaking the quest. However, if the player ensured that all of the apprentices survived the training process, then &lt;a href=\"Morul\"&gt;Morul&lt;/a&gt; will return to the sphere and ask to stay on as the player's apprentice. Accepting means that Morul will randomly produce one of four sets of potions every week, which can be used or sold as the player sees fit.\nGameplay.\nTask 1: Returning the Knights of Solamnia.\nThe first matter is to get the Knights of Solamnia out of the sphere. Teos' advice includes killing the knights, joining the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Radiant%20Heart\"&gt;Order of the Radiant Heart&lt;/a&gt;, or asking &lt;a href=\"Ribald%20Barterman\"&gt;Ribald Barterman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Adventurer%20Mart\"&gt;Adventurer Mart&lt;/a&gt; who may know a wizard able to plane-shift the Knights back to &lt;a href=\"Krynn\"&gt;Krynn&lt;/a&gt;. Killing the knights gets you very little experience or quest award, and no items other than mundane arms and armor, leaving two preferable options.\nTask 2: Apprenticeships.\nTeos returns 24 hours later with your first true assignment; training three young apprentices to become full-fledged Cowled Wizards. &lt;a href=\"Morul\"&gt;Morul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Larz\"&gt;Larz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nara\"&gt;Nara&lt;/a&gt; must undertake three lessons in the Planar Sphere, bending their talents towards proving themselves in three areas, with end-goals set by the player. However, because of the deadliness of magic, it's possible that they may not survive the teaching.\nThe apprentices move to the &lt;a href=\"Inside%20the%20Planar%20Sphere%23The%20Golem%20Laboratory\"&gt;Golem Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; to receive instructions and craft their items.\nRefusing to give instructions.\nIn the dialogue that would lead up to the first lesson, you have the chance to tell the apprentices to just get out of your way and do whatever they want. This results in them creating a &lt;a href=\"Reaching%20Ring\"&gt;Ring of Wizardry: Reaching Ring&lt;/a&gt; but causes them all to die. (The ring will be dropped on the floor.) If you care about nothing other than to get this ring, this is the quickest way to get it; otherwise you can also have them craft it during lesson three at the cost of two of them dying.\nLesson One: Crafting.\nThe first lesson is creating basic magic items. Nara offers to make the &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20of%20CHARNAME\"&gt;Dagger of \"CHARNAME\"&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20%2B1\"&gt;Dagger +1&lt;/a&gt; named after Gorion's Ward), while Larz wants to create a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Apprenti\"&gt;Wand of Apprenti&lt;/a&gt; (randomly fires either a &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;), and Morul offers to make a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Princes\"&gt;Ring of the Princes +1&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of the choice of item, the task will take four days to complete, and requires gold to cover material costs.\nHint: The game engine decides whether the task will succeed or fail right in the moment where you tell the apprentices which item to build, and there's a \"trick\" to figuring out which choice the game made. If the item's creation will succeed, then Morul's dialogue will say that the task will take \"a few days\" (or in the case of the ring, \"four or five days\"). If the creation will fail, Morul instead says that it will take exactly \"four days.\" (The actual time they take doesn't change; only Morul's choice of words.) So if he says that it will take exactly \"four days\" but you really want the item, you may wish to reload the game and try again.\nLesson Two: Scribing.\nThe second lesson is creating spell scrolls. The three choices for this lesson are &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20Swarm\"&gt;Meteor Swarm&lt;/a&gt;, in that order of difficulty. They take 4 days to be fabricated. The higher the spell's level, the more likely it is that its creation will fail.\nLike with the previous lesson, Morul's choice of words after being tasked with the inscription can reveal whether the game decided that the creation of the scroll will fail or not, but this time the meaning of the words depend on the chosen scroll and it only works for the two easier scrolls.\nIf you've chosen Mislead, then the phrase \"a few days\" indicates success and \"another four days\" indicates failure. For ADHW, the phrase \"four or five days\" indicates success whereas \"a few days\" indicates failure. For Meteor Swarm, there's no way to tell from the dialogue whether the game decided on success or failure; your only way to know is to check what the global variable \"Apprenti\" was set to (11 = success, 12 = failure) by using the console or looking at your save game with a tool like Near Infinity.\nLesson Three: Enchanting.\nFor their final lesson, the apprentices must attempt to create a more powerful magical item, offering the choice between the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Apprenti\"&gt;Robe of the Apprenti&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reaching%20Ring\"&gt;Ring of Wizardry: Reaching Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Power\"&gt;Staff of Power&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player may declare that they are not ready to tackle such potent magecraft yet, and that their training is already complete. This is the only way to ensure that nobody dies.\nThere is no way to determine from the dialogue whether the game decided on success or failure for the creation of the item. If item creation was successful, but all apprentices die, the item is dropped to the ground.\nGraduation.\nOne day after the three lessons are complete, return to the Entrance Hall in the sphere, and Teos will hold a short graduation ceremony in the Rune Room. He's amazed if all of them survived, nonchalant about losing one or two, and chides you if you killed them all. If all apprentices survived, you receive . Otherwise, you get nothing.\nA one-time NPC named \"William 'Bill' Williamson\" gives the graduation speech, welcoming them ironically, \"into the real world, a world where [they] are actually restricted from using the skills [they] have studied.\" \nAfter thanking you, any remaining apprentices Dimension Door out of the sphere, and you have the opportunity to ask Teos about Imoen. \"That's it? You've nothing else for me? What about my friend Imoen?\" Teos replies with a clue that he is, \"getting nowhere with official channels... as though we are\" having trouble contacting all of our resources\"...\"\nTask 3: Assassination.\nTwo days after the graduation ceremony, &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Natula\"&gt;Sergeant Natula&lt;/a&gt; will approach you and tell you that Teos wishes to speak to you in the Planar Sphere. When you arrive at the Entrance Hall, Teos is confused. He was told that Gorion's Ward wanted to speak to him.\nBoth parties are then ambushed by Sergeant Natula and his group &lt;a href=\"Gate%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Gating&lt;/a&gt; in to surround the party. While Teos escapes through a Dimension Door, the party is left to fend for themselves against Natula (a fighter), and six others, including three other fighter-assassins named &lt;a href=\"Tyrian\"&gt;Tyrian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vilhelm\"&gt;Vilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jalin%20Tix\"&gt;Jalin Tix&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Alnarow\"&gt;Alnarow&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Mahar\"&gt;Mahar&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Sorsha\"&gt;Sorsha&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;). The entire group is worth when killed.\nAfter the ambush is foiled, Teos returns and explains that Natula was a pawn of an anti-magic fanatic, one &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ketlaar%20Argrim%20%28Fighter%29\"&gt;Lord Ketlaar Argrim&lt;/a&gt;, who wants to see all mages driven from Athkatla, including the Cowled Wizards, and now also, Gorion's Ward. Teos wants you to \"disappear\" Lord Argrim, clarifying:\"I do not mean kill him, I mean disappear. Forever. With a specially attuned Rune of Imprisonment... Obviously the Cowled Wizards cannot be implicated. That is where you come in.\"\nIf you accept the task, Teos gives the protagonist a &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Imprisonment\"&gt;Rune of Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; to make Lord Argrim literally disappear, saying it will be better than killing him, which would create a martyr for others to avenge. He warns, \"Be careful, it will only work on Lord Argrim and it has a frightfully long casting time.\" You can call him out on it, by asking, \"You had this ever-so-special rune on you? I smell a rat.\" Teos admits that perhaps Lord Argrim's Assassins were, \"\"encouraged \"to find you, but that changes nothing. It's him or you...\"\nLord Argrim and his defenders are hiding on the upper floor of the &lt;a href=\"Crooked%20Crane%20Inn\"&gt;Crooked Crane Inn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20City%20Gates\"&gt;Athkatla City Gates&lt;/a&gt;. The entire group is worth to the party. Once his men are dead and Argrim is either Imprisoned or Dead, you may return to the Planar Sphere. After reporting back, the party is granted for dealing with Argrim. Teos is satisfied if you imprisoned Argrim, but will berate you if you killed him, complaining that \"..a hundred more will follow in his wake... Regardless...\" Teos still has \"some news of your friend Imoen...\"\nQuest Completion.\nTeos reveals that &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; was taken to &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; and that, \"The Cowled Wizards are no longer in control of the situation,\" reinforcing the earlier clue about \"trouble contacting their resources\" there. But for now, you have passed all of the Cowled Wizards' tests and the sphere now belongs to you. Teos leaves via Dimension Door.\nIf all of your apprentices survived, Morul will teleport back to the Sphere after Teos leaves, to ask if he may remain as your apprentice. Accepting will give you access to his weekly potion batches.\nMod content.\nMods:.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Planar%20Sphere%20Mod\"&gt;Planar Sphere Mod&lt;/a&gt; \"(or its abridged &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;EE&lt;/a&gt; port, the &lt;a href=\"Expanded%20Mage%20Stronghold\"&gt;Expanded Mage Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; mod)\" expands the mage stronghold. If installed, Teos reappears after the original tasks to make the protagonist a new offer."}

Fist blows can make the creature fall down in a semi-unconscious state, at least for a period of time.

They can be executed, or they may be sent to Spellhold, an asylum for magical deviants.\nThe license to cast arcane spells can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Corneil\"&gt;Corneil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six%20Building\"&gt;Council of Six Building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Government\"&gt;Athkatla Government&lt;/a&gt; district for 5,000 gold. If you purchase a license, no more enforcers will appear. Otherwise, the first time an arcane spell is cast, you will get a warning from a Cowled Wizard who teleports in. The next five times, he will summon three other enforcers and all of them will attack you. If you defeat them, you then have one hour in which you can cast arcane spells freely without anyone responding.\nOn the final time after the warning, the responding wizard will summon three much more powerful mages: a 16th-level Cowled Wizard worth 6,000 XP, an 18th-level Cowled Wizard worth 20,000 XP, and a 30th-level mage named &lt;a href=\"Zallanora\"&gt;Zallanora&lt;/a&gt; worth 6,000 XP. They are armed with high level spells like Time Stop, Power Word Kill, Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting, Simulacrum (which can result in an extra wizard opposing you) and more... Once you succeed in killing them, there will be no further response to any arcane spellcasting in Athkatla: and, indeed, should you decide to go back and purchase a license after having proved your point in such a drastic manner, you will not have the option to do so, the game will treat you as if you already have one.\nNote: While a majority of players will buy the license to have freedom and no trouble in playing, many won't pay and will instead adjust to the gaming style of no arcane spellcasting inside the city. If desired, you can do so until the party is strong enough to actively lure in the enforcers for\u00a0their XP and loot.\nNote: On the matter of roleplay, The Cowled Wizards do not represent the lawful government. They set down the law and they go out to enforce it without the government's approval. &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Inspector%20Brega\"&gt;Chief Inspector Brega&lt;/a&gt; is quite eloquent about this. Thus, it's not against Lawful alignment to kill them. Even Keldorn doesn't twitch an eyebrow.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod has two optional components that can be installed regarding the Cowled Wizards:\nAllow the Cowled Wizards to detect spellcasting in most indoor, above-ground areas in Athkatla (BG2,BG2EE,BGT)\nThe Cowled Wizards claim to ban magic everywhere in Athkatla; in practice, though, they only complain if you cast spells out of doors. This component extends their watch to most indoor, above-ground areas in Athkatla (there are a few exceptions, mostly places where wizards live (e.g. Prebek's tower) or where it's likely that the owners have made arrangements with the Cowled Wizards (e.g. the Copper Coronet).\nIncrease the price of a license to practice magic in Athkatla (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)\nThe default price for a magic license from the Cowled Wizards is 5,000gp. This component allows you to increase it to an amount between 10,000gp and 50,000gp, depending on which option you choose during installation. These options are useful to realistically manage the abundant gold that accumulates, well beyond the player's needs, to make the party's purse feel more realistic and balanced. Otherwise, money is never an issue in the game - and it probably should be a factor that needs to be considered, and a resource with implications."}

Friendly spells and potions are not affected by MR.\nEven if the MR check fails, a saving throw may still prevent the spell. For example, a hostile wizard casts &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Person\"&gt;Charm Person&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and she fails the Magic Resistance check. A &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;save vs. spell&lt;/a&gt; check is now rolled and if she succeeds, she will not be charmed.\nAgainst spells which create multiple projectiles (like &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt;), MR is checked individually for each projectile.\nSome &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the &lt;a href=\"drow\"&gt;drow&lt;/a&gt;, have inherent magic resistance. Many &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s grant a certain, often accumulative magic resistance to their wearer or consumer.\nEnemy magic resistance can be lowered with the following spells: &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Resistance%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Magic Resistance&lt;/a&gt; (if spell output determined by formula [caster level]*2% is lower than creature's natural magic resistance). Those themselves cannot be stopped by MR.\nSome spells bypass magic resistance. These include &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Bolt of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath\"&gt;Dragon's Breath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Implosion\"&gt;Implosion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shocking%20Grasp\"&gt;Shocking Grasp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Drain\"&gt;Energy Drain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Contagion\"&gt;Contagion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deafness\"&gt;Deafness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teleport%20Field\"&gt;Teleport Field&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"False%20Dawn\"&gt;False Dawn&lt;/a&gt; (on undead), &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Globe of Blades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireshield\"&gt;Fireshield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aura%20of%20Flaming%20Death\"&gt;Aura of Flaming Death&lt;/a&gt;, the damage of &lt;a href=\"Earthquake\"&gt;Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; when cast by an &lt;a href=\"Avenger\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and other spells that target MR, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, spells that attack/strip magical defenses, spells like &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; that dispel invisibility / illusions, spells that summon weapons or throwable projectiles like &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sol%27s%20Searing%20Orb\"&gt;Sol's Searing Orb&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shillelagh\"&gt;Shillelagh&lt;/a&gt;, the unconsciousness effect of &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, the death effect of &lt;a href=\"Slay%20Living\"&gt;Slay Living&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;. In the non EE games, &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glitterdust\"&gt;Glitterdust&lt;/a&gt; also bypass MR. See also . It is still possible to become immune to some of these spells, either by using an appropriate &lt;a href=\"Spell%20protections%20type\"&gt;spell protection spell&lt;/a&gt; or by using the rare &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection From Magic&lt;/a&gt; scrolls. Immunities to certain spell levels (&lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Blocking\"&gt;Potion of Magic Blocking&lt;/a&gt;, innate immunities of &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"Rakshasa\"&gt;Rakshasa&lt;/a&gt;s) also completely block spells, even those that bypass MR.\nMagic resistance also applies to some effects tied to or items, but not to others; this differs from case to case. For example, &lt;a href=\"Jester%20Song\"&gt;Jester Song&lt;/a&gt; ignores MR, but a Blackguard's &lt;a href=\"Aura%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Aura of Despair&lt;/a&gt; is blocked by MR. An item can also have different applications for multiple effects, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Fury\"&gt;Celestial Fury&lt;/a&gt; blindness bypasses MR, but its lightning strike does not.\nMagic resistance can be above 100%, up to 127%. Resistance over 100% provides no direct benefits, but is an additional layer of protection against &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nImproving magic resistance.\nTemporary bonuses.\nAbilities.\nShapeshift\nMagic Damage Resistance (MDR).\nMagic resistance is different from to &lt;a href=\"magical%20damage\"&gt;magical damage&lt;/a&gt;: magic(al) damage resistance reduces (positive) or amplifies (negative) the &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; a creature would take if a spell dealing magical damage gets through the former and is applied after any reduction from a saving throw (if one applies). \nFor example, let's say a character with 50% magic resistance is hit by a &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull Trap&lt;/a&gt;. If the MR check succeeds, no damage will be taken. If the MR check fails, a saving throw is performed to determine whether full or half damage is to be applied, and finally is applied. If MDR is negative more damage is applied than what's left after the saving throw.\nMagic Damage Resistance has a hard cap of 127 in either direction. A Magic Damage Resistance over 100% means the character is healed when taking magical damage."}

It seems as though this pass must be traversed in order to open up and visit those other areas.\nBackground.\nThis area was originally planned as part of a plot/story by the Bioware developers to facilitate a quest. The quest was to involve the &lt;a href=\"Rhynn%20Lanthorn\"&gt;Rhynn Lanthorn&lt;/a&gt; recovered from &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;. It isn't completely clear exactly what the plot intended but based on clues left behind in remnants of the game files, it may have involved finding parts or pieces of the Lanthorn, in order to make the artifact whole again. \nDue to game release deadlines, Bioware wasn't able to complete this plot arc before the release of . The planned quest was abandoned.\nThe content already completed for the area maps &lt;a href=\"Small%20Teeth%20Pass\"&gt;Small Teeth Pass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Forest%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;North Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Tethir\"&gt;Forest of Tethir&lt;/a&gt; were retained in the game and do have some unaffiliated encounters, spawns, treasure etc. - but no longer are tied to the unrealized Rhynn Lanthorn recovery.\nOn the map.\nThe player's is furnished no \"Automap Notes\" for this area.\nWalkthrough.\nThe party will enter this map in the northeast sector. Explore the map as desired. A few pheasants and other wildlife will be observed.\nDepending on triggers and some random allocation from spawn points, and whether the party is here during day light or nighttime hours - the party is likely to have at least one random spawned encounter with some hostile creatures. None of these should be of concern at this stage of the saga.\nThere will always be an encounter in one specific map section to southwest with three Ankhegs.\nIf the party desires to leave this map, and traverse through the pass, then exit on any opened section of the southern edge of this map. This will take the player to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;World Map&lt;/a&gt; selection screen - and at this time, the player may select all the usual destinations, or the now reachable North Forest or Forest of Tethir areas.\nTreasure/containers.\nThere are no found treasure or containers to find. There may be some items from spawned Orcs/Hobgoblins if those enemies were generated. The Anhegs will drop their usual &lt;a href=\"Ankheg%20Shell\"&gt;Ankheg Shell&lt;/a&gt; item.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod will revise any spawned creatures found on the map with updated AI scripts and possibly adjusted weapon proficiencies, use of innate powers, and for creatures using weaponry, different melee, missile weapons and ammunition. Potions may be used.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Azengaard\"&gt;Azengaard&lt;/a&gt; mod is installed, the party can resolve the final encounter with the \"Azengaard the Time Lord\" - as well as a \"Time Sorcerer\" and more \"Time Assassins\". A very powerful scimitar can be obtained and some other useful loot if the party is victorious.\nIf the player has installed the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/31605-restored-rhynn-lanthorn-quest/\"&gt;Restored Rhynn Lanthorn Quest&lt;/a&gt;, then a visit to Small Teeth Pass will be required, and successful actions here necessary to make progress in that restored questline.\nAnother take on the lanthorn is available with the installation of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/RoxanneSHS/LensHunt\"&gt;Broken Lanthorn&lt;/a&gt; quest - obtained by returning the lanthorn recovered from &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; and the speaking with Elhan. This action will reveal there are three lanthorn lens pieces hidden - and they must be found in order to repair the artifact. This area must be visited to recover one of the lanthorn's lenses.

The remote nature of the village means that Smugglers play a vital role in the supply chain for the village welfare and for its economy. The cavern has access to an underground stream, which the smuggler's utilize as a secret way to move goods in and out of the area, while avoiding Calimshan government and regional taxes and tariffs. It is implied that some of the goods may be contraband or even stolen items. In the recent past, both the Monastery and the Smugglers coexisted without conflict and that helped with the sustainability of the village, all benefitting from the arrangement. However, &lt;a href=\"Balthazar\"&gt;Balthazar&lt;/a&gt; and his current goals have now disrupted the balance in the village, especially with the influx of mercenary forces to fill out a growing Army and plans for war.\nVisiting the Smuggler's Cave.\nThe party may enter the cave at any point in Chapter 8. Upon entry of your party, you will observe the presence of five smugglers, and a few seconds afterwards will appear four monks. No action can be taken as dialogue plays out - you seem to have entered and overhear the lead monk addressing the smuggler leader &lt;a href=\"Carras\"&gt;Carras&lt;/a&gt;. The monk is heard to say, \"\"These mercenaries have filed a complaint that you are selling stolen goods, Carras. This operation is closed, and all merchandise is forfeit to the monastery\".\"\nCarras relies \"\"This is ridiculous! The monastery has never objected to our actions in the past\".\"\nThe monk then says \"\"Tell us where Esamon is Carras, and we will let you go\".\"\nCarras answers \"Esamon isn't here - I haven't seen him in weeks.\"\nThe monk replies \"\"Then I will arrest you instead. For your sake, I hope Esamon shows up before we find it necessary to... interrogate you\".\"\nCarras cries out \"\"No! You can't do this... This is an outrage! When did the monastery become a puppet slave to the whims of a bunch of foreign mercenaries\"?\"\nMonk says \"\"Silence, Carras! Wait... what is this? It seems we have a would-be customer in our midst. The infamous child of Bhaal, if the descriptions of Balthazar are at all accurate.\"\nThe monk continues, addressing your party, \"I could arrest you for being an accessory, Bhaalspawn. However, I am in a generous mood. I suggest you leave now, and don't interfere in our business here\".\"\nThe party now has some dialogue options. To boil it down - you can either leave the monks to their business, or you can let the monks know that you disagree with their actions. You can even do this in a confrontational and insulting way if you prefer. If you don't leave the monks be, then at some juncture of the dialogue the monk leader will shout \"To arms my brothers! we are attacked!\". The monks will become hostile and engage you in melee combat. They will employ &lt;a href=\"Stunning%20Blow\"&gt;Stunning Blow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quivering%20Palm\"&gt;Quivering Palm&lt;/a&gt; attacks, so beware. The smugglers do not join the fight. Each defeated monk is worth at least 10,000 XP.\nIf you speak with Carras after the monks are defeated, he says \"\"Thank you for your assistance in this... unpleasant matter. I'm sure that if Esamon were here himself, he would offer his thanks as well\".\"\nYou have a few dialogue options that center on your opinion of Esamon, and if his other name is actually &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt;, and whether you owe him a \"debt of pain\" for past treachery. Carras says to this \"\"Our leader goes by many names, but I assure you I do not know his current whereabouts. Whatever your trouble with Saemon... I had nothing to do with it\".\"\nIf you do not attack or harm the smugglers, you can carry on with interacting with them, and perhaps perform some shopping/selling. Visit &lt;a href=\"Carras\"&gt;Carras&lt;/a&gt; page for further information. Note that the smugglers will only be available for basically one shopping session, and will then leave the cave for good.\nContainers.\nThere are four containers, that look like chests in the rear of the cave. There may be goods or loot in them. You can freely explore these if you wish. Perhaps if your party has one with thieving skills, they should check them first."}

He is involved in several quests in connection with Chapter 5's main plot of escaping the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;. He has a complicated relationship with &lt;a href=\"Phaere\"&gt;Phaere&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nSolaufein is the party's point of contact when entering Ust Natha, as ordered by a Handmaiden of Lolth. The party is to report to him, found nearby the &lt;a href=\"Male%20Fighters%27%20Society\"&gt;Male Fighters' Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt a specific point in the saga, Phaere will give the party an order to kill Solaufein.

Generally, sorcerers share the same basic weaknesses as &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;, including low hit dice, THAC0, and restrictions on equipment. Though not good physical fighters by nature, they can transform into potent melee damage dealers or tanks while under the effect of certain arcane spells. \nLorewise, sorcerers in Baldur's Gate differ from mages in that they are born with innate magic ability, or 'magic blood' - as opposed to needing to learn through years of study. \u00a0\nDisadvantages compared to mages.\nFor players who want an arcane spellcaster that specializes in a select number of spells, sorcerers can be quite a powerful class.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; may become sorcerers.\u00a0\nSorcerers may not &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nAbility scores table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, other Races have modified ability scores.\n^ Although Sorcerers are Charisma based casters in the tabletop game, their casting abilities are purely level based in Baldur's Gate series\n^^ The Dragon Disciple class kit has a different set of minimum ability scores.\nSorcerer spells.\nSorcerers are allowed to freely pick from all 8 schools of arcane spells from the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;wizard spellbook&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile they can only know a very limited number of spells per spell level, they can still cast all other wizard spells by using scrolls (but without the benefit of adding their caster level).\nClass kits.\nSorcerer.\nSorcerers are practitioners of magic who are born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.\nClass Features:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Disciple\"&gt;Dragon Disciple&lt;/a&gt; (\"EE\" only).\nDragon Disciples are powerful Sorcerers with dragons' blood somewhere in their lineage. Their natural magical talents bring out their draconic heritage, allowing them to cast powerful magical spells and exhibit dragon-like abilities.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantage:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following spells will be scribed in lv9 spellbook once picked, thus only need to selected once.\nSpell progression.\nThe following table shows the progression of different spells known by the sorcerer base class:\n\"* Starting from character level 18, Sorcerers can learn which are also scribed into their level 9 spellbook.

However, walking pass the crest/crown of the face to disarm traps, sets off a silent trigger that crosses the entire hall. Be prepared for undead that spawn, entering in from alcoves on either side.

This ability is subject to a success or failure skill roll from the Bounty Hunter's \"Set Traps\" skill as a percentage chance. Assuming the setting was successful then the snare is placed on the map and indicated with a small trap sprite.\nWhen an enemy creature (allegiance \"Enemy\", usually a red circled creature) is within about a 16-feet distance of the marker, then the trap is activated or \"trap sprung\".\nThis is mechanically implemented by adding a Spell effect titled \"Set Map Marker\" using &lt;a href=\"Opcode\"&gt;Opcode&lt;/a&gt;/effect code 253. After the trap is sprung, the marker is removed using effect code 254, Spell Effect: \"Remove Map Marker\".\nThe activated snare will now initiate an innate spell effect that exposes any enemy creature within 16 feet of the trap (about a 30-foot diameter of the snare) to the spell's effects.\nThe specific spell effect is determined by the Bounty Hunter's caster level when the snare was placed.\nBounty Hunter level 1-10.\nAll enemy creatures in range of the sprung snare will each face the following effects: \nCreatures affected by the spell will suffer missile damage mitigated only by physical damage resistance or a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;. The Slow effect can be blocked by a spell protection such as &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; does not affect this particular effect, and it can't be dispelled.\nBounty Hunter level 11-15.\nAll enemy creatures in range of the sprung snare will each face the following effects:\nCreatures affected by the spell will suffer missile damage mitigated only by physical damage resistance or a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;. The Hold effect can be blocked by a spell protection such as &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; will also block this particular effect, and it can be dispelled.\nThe hold effect is coded to affect &lt;a href=\"Humanoid\"&gt;Humanoid&lt;/a&gt; general IDS creatures only.\u00a0 For example, it won't work on Animal, Giant Humanoid or Undead. If the creature misses their saving throw, a text will display on the combat log reading \"Held\" and a special effect graphic will play over the held creature.\nBounty Hunter level 16-20.\nAll enemy creatures in range of the sprung snare will each face the following effect:\nThe sphere isn't an actual Wizard's spell of the same name, but this snare's practical application is very close to it. The duration is 7 rounds.\nThere is no Saving throw allowed, and the effects bypass magic resistance. No spell protections can block it, and all effects have a zero Power level. However, the effects can be dispelled.\nDuring the sphere's duration the creature(s) are encased in an immobile sphere, they can't move or function in any way, and also cannot be harmed. In effect, it is 7 round stasis phenomena until it expires, and the creature may act again. What the party does during this time is up to the player.\nBounty Hunter level 21+.\nAll enemy creatures in range of the sprung snare will each face the following effect:\nThe effect isn't an actual Wizard's Maze spell, but a rough equivalent.\nThere is no Saving throw allowed, and the effects bypass magic resistance.\nThe Maze effect has an 8 Powel level, and thus can be blocked by a spell protection that has a capacity for that, such as &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the snare is sprung, enemy creatures in range will immediately have a special effect graphic animation of a barred cage forming around them. Four seconds later the creatures will disappear into their own personal maze.\nThe duration of time spent in the maze is determined by their current &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; attribute, and a random dice roll performed by the AI. Once that duration has been completed, the creature appears in the same location as when they entered the maze. \nA &lt;a href=\"Freedom\"&gt;Freedom&lt;/a&gt; spell can be used to recover any creatures in the maze and return them forthwith, if desired.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; mod allows the player to try different Special Snares for the Bounty Hunter kit. Five tiers of snares replace the four in the unmodified game, and the new snares are now \"Alchemical Traps\" that are non-magical, and thus ignore magic resistance and spell protections. Now the traps can dazzle, slow, entangle, blind or knock unconscious the victim, as well as dealing subdual damage. Gone are the Otiluke's sphere and maze snare, which are arguably not balanced very well. The mod rebalances rogues and their abilities, skills, and offers new tactical use and utility to the classes. Open up a new world of rogue play with this mod."}

The saving throw bonus applies to items such as when an Invoker uses &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Wand of Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order for mages to cast a spell, first they need to successfully scribe a mage spell scroll into their spellbook (scroll lost in process regardless of success or failure). A mage may have any number of spells scribed and available to memorize. They must choose which spells they will have available for immediate use by placing them into a limited number of spell slots. The mage must then &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; for eight hours to memorize the spells, which prepares them for casting.\nSpecialist mages have a 15% bonus in writing spells from scrolls of their specialization to their spellbook, but receive a 15% penalty when writing spells outside their chosen school. Effectively a difference of 3 &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; for most characters to learn new spells.\nRacial constraint: Only &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s can become specialist mages. &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;s will automatically become &lt;a href=\"Illusionist\"&gt;illusionists&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the chosen school, a specialist will have an extra character ability minimum requirement.\nIf a specialist mage dual-classes into &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;, they can cast cleric spells of their opposite school; additionally, cleric spells of their chosen school also gain a -2 save penalty for enemies. See &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Mage%23As%20a%20Dual-Class\"&gt;Cleric / Mage#As a Dual-Class&lt;/a&gt; article for which spells this applies to.\nAbility scores table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, other Races have modified ability scores.\n^ Prime Requisites for &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;Dual-classing&lt;/a&gt;.\n^^ Baseline values for all class kits. Each kit also has one increased minimum ability score.\nTypes of Specialist Mage, race restrictions and min. ability scores.\nThere are eight Specialist Mage class kits, for each of the eight schools of arcane magic. Each school is restricted against learning spells of their opposing school(s). In addition, each school increases one minimum ability score requirement.\nThere are many inconsistencies between the games, their editions and the related &lt;a href=\"Game%20guides\"&gt;manuals&lt;/a&gt;: As in &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3APlayer%27s%20Handbook%202nd%20edition\"&gt;pen-and-paper rules&lt;/a&gt;, the original \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" has for some specialists two schools of opposition applied, namely Conjuration for Invokers and Necromancy for Transmuters. The former, however, isn't listed in the manual. The game's removes these secondary opposing schools but oddly \"fixes\" the missing entry in the manual, displaying now false information for Invokers. The \"Enhanced Editions\" keep the concept of only one school of opposition, but also keep the mistake in the \"&lt;a href=\"Adventurer%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Adventurer's Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" and adding another one by stating, Conjuration would be the opposed school for Enchanters instead of Invocation.\nThe following table uses the correct information directly from the game files.\nSpecialist Mage Spellbook.\nSpecialist mages use spells from the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;wizard spellbook&lt;/a&gt;, excluding those of the respective opposing school.\nFollowing are listed for each specialist the arcane spells (ordered first by level) that benefit from incoming &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt;s as well as from the penalty to those of their enemies; keep in mind that divine spells also carry these advantages. \nSaving throw bonuses also apply to items.\nNote that the Necromancy spell &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt; requires the recipient to make a saving throw when the duration ends, or they will take damage; this makes Necromancers worse suited for casting this spell.\nA quick rundown of some notable spells each specialist gives up. Specialists with a long list of excluded spells clearly have substantial limitations that should be considered when choosing this kit. Spells within &lt; &gt; are similar improved versions, or direct counters of each other:\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nMages can access to level 10 spells, which are added to the level 9 wizard spellbook after they have been chosen. All those spells can be chosen by every Specialist Mage. The spells are:\nNotes on Tiers.\nSpecialist mage classes are not equal in power. In &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, Conjurer is arguably the best overall specialty because its opposing school, Divination, had few useful spells in combat, so there were few drawbacks to being restricted against Divination spells. It required a minimum ability score in Constitution, a useful stat for wizards who gain few HP per level, and it was available to both humans and half-elves. It is no surprise the best wizard in the game, &lt;a href=\"Edwin_Odesseiron\"&gt;Edwin Odesseiron&lt;/a&gt; is a Conjurer.\nIllusionist is also an excellent specialty, available to humans and gnomes with many useful Illusion spells and fewer Necromancy spells as an opportunity cost. The most valuable Necromancy spells in BG1, healing spells, were available only to priests.\nDiviner is arguably the worst class, granting bonuses to very few spells while restricting access to the Monster Summoning series, which were staple spells for some players. Wisdom has few practical effects as a stat for a wizard in BG1, and more &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Understanding\"&gt;Tomes of Understanding&lt;/a&gt; were available in-game than any other attribute manual.\nInvoker and Transmuter were rarely used choices due to having two opposing schools, while Enchanters were locked out of the main way to inflict damage using Evocation spells. Necromancers and Abjurers were in a middle ground: while their drawbacks were not crippling, their opposing schools had a multitude of useful spells and their minimum ability stat (Wisdom) was not helpful.\nCome , the specialties saw some needed balance. Transmuter and Invoker became better by losing their secondary school restriction. Necromancer became a stronger class not only due to more powerful and useful Necromancy spells, but access to Divination spells &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Eye\"&gt;Wizard Eye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt;. No specialty benefited more from the invisibility-granting &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Staff of the Magi&lt;/a&gt; than Necromancers, and these buffs helped mitigate loss of access to Illusion's clone spells.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod addresses the Specialist Mage and their spell selections. Excerpt from the mod's preamble:\nArcane spell schools have also been flushed out, with the belief that each spell level should contain at least one spell from each school. To help fulfill these goals, SR adds a small number of spells to the game and modifies the schools and restrictions of some existing spells where appropriate.\nSR also improves the descriptions of many spells to be more accurate, more consistent, and, occasionally, less boring.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"}

One of them appears in ' and again in '.\nGameplay.\nIt is first met in the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Caverns\"&gt;City of Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, where it's guarding a chest containing &lt;a href=\"Sekolah%27s%20Tooth\"&gt;Sekolah's Tooth&lt;/a&gt;. It is bored of its assignment so it is possible to take the treasure without battle; if the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; member talking with the Spectator has a &lt;a href=\"Wisdom\"&gt;Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; of thirteen or higher, they can debate with the Spectator that its orders do not prevent the creature itself from looking inside the chest. Once it does so, it is so disgusted by the chest's meager contents that it will give them to the player, who then points out that this can be used as justification to set the Spectator free. Much to its jubilation.\nThe EXP reward for peacefully retrieving the tooth from the Spectator is much higher than the EXP for killing it, so it's worth a player's while to try talking and dialogue. If fought, it is worth knowing that Spectators cannot use &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt; (fitting with the lore) - see the InfoBox for it's scripted spell and timed Beholder Blast eye beam attacks. However, even if the party does slay the Spectator - it will be back in Throne of Bhaal, no matter what is done to it in the Underwater City.\nIf its life was spared in Shadows of Amn, the Spectator is met again later in &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Enclave\"&gt;Sendai's Enclave&lt;/a&gt;.

They can only use four eyestalk powers and have no anti-magic ray, but can use &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; - which is fittingly implemented in the game.\nSpectators often serve as guardians and could be relied upon to protect items in all but the direst of situations, even though they actually dislike guarding things for lesser lifeforms, which most mortal summoners would qualify as. After promising to do so, however, their loyalty to their summoner is absolute, guarding the object in question until their time was up. They pride themselves on their guardianship and refuse commands to do anything else until asked to guard something else or being allowed to leave a summoner's grasp."}

{"id": "17117", "revid": "50907129", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17117", "title": "Speed Factor", "text": "Combat is based on &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23R\"&gt;rounds&lt;/a&gt;. Rounds are periods that last for six seconds. The Speed Factor of a weapon determines when within those six seconds a creature wielding that weapon hits. The lower the number, the earlier the hit. A Speed Factor of 0 means that the creature hits at the start of the round. A Speed Factor of 10 means the creature hits at the end of the round.\nAttack animations take 1 second to display. If a character attacks with a two handed sword (Speed Factor 10), the game starts the attack animation 5 seconds into the round so that it finishes (and the hit is delivered) just at the end of the round.\nA level 13 &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; with 2 &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;APRs&lt;/a&gt; wielding the same weapon, but with two attacks this is now split into two three second periods. The weapon will still strike at the very end of the period, but now this will be the end of the 3rd and 6th seconds (again, with the animation beginning slightly earlier to allow the blow to land at the right moment).\nSo what happens to having more APRs? There are weapons like &lt;a href=\"Belm\"&gt;Belm&lt;/a&gt; that give +1 APR, an &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt; doubles APR, and there are &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Greater Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; High-level class abilities (&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;HLA&lt;/a&gt;) that set APR to 10, the maximum amount the game allows. Well, you\u2019ll never exceed 5 APRs no matter which weapon combination you choose or how you wield them, as for IH or GW, the game actually splits one round into two (3 seconds each) and doubles the attack animation speed (0.5 second each) under their effects. Imagine a fighter wielding the same weapon activates GW, for the first 3 seconds, s/he has 5 attacks to complete, the animations will take up to a total of 2.5 (0.5x5) seconds, assuming no pauses between them, so the speed factor has only 0.5 second period to factor in, which is almost negligible. Speaking of GW, the noticeable delay after the HLA activation will surely make its effect go off before the 10th attack finishes, a slight oversight...\nTo sum up, Speed Factor is noticeable for characters with low APRs, but matters less for characters with high APRs.\nThe game also rolls a random initiative factor each round so that even an attack with a worse speed factor can come first. There are claims that initiative rolls affect speed factor from no penalty (attack occurs as described) up to a -2 penalty, capped between 0 and 10 speed factor. While &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; does not increase or decrease the speed factor number directly, it reduces randomness from the initiative factor. With sufficient +luck, a character will strike without any random penalties to their speed factor.\nThings that affect Speed Factor:"}

{"id": "49506", "revid": "35642161", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=49506", "title": "Spell Revisions", "text": "The Spell Revisions mod (\"SR\") aims to fix, tweak, and enhance arcane and divine spells in Baldur's Gate II, Tutu, and Baldur's Gate Trilogy. This originally started as a project to make the spell system more balanced by improving weaker spells and nerfing overpowered ones - but has evolved to also include changes to spells designed to make them more fun and interesting and fixes for spell-related bugs found in the original game.\nMain Component.\nSpell Revisions places a high priority on making all of the existing spells viable choices, while keeping an eye on balance issues. Now, Magic Missile won't be the only first-level arcane spell you'll want to memorize! To help achieve this goal, portions of the old spell system that were consistently underpowered, like healing spells and summons, have been vastly improved so that they are competitive options. In addition, SR takes the stance that low-level spells should not become completely ineffective once characters reach higher levels, so it adds scaling features to many spells.\nAmong other things, the mod makes druid and cleric spell selections more distinct, with druids focusing on animal and elemental spheres for a repertoire of spells oriented toward the offensive. Arcane spell schools have also been flushed out, with the belief that each spell level should contain at least one spell from each school. To help fulfill these goals, SR adds a small number of spells to the game and modifies the schools and restrictions of some existing spells where appropriate.\nSR also improves the descriptions of many spells to be more accurate, more consistent, and, occasionally, less boring.\nAdditional Content.\nSpell Revisions includes several optional components that do not require the main component.\nDeva and Planetar Avatars.\nThis component updates the avatars of the celestials summoned by HLAs to take advantage of 1PP Attachable Wings and adjusts the weapons they use.\nMirror Image Fix.\nThis component fixes mirror images so they no longer protect from AoE spells such as Fireball.\nDispel Magic Fix.\nThis component fixes the chance to dispel magic to match the spell's description (so there is at least a marginal chance of dispelling effects of a higher-level mage) and corrects conceptual problems caused by the automatic dispelling of all magically created items.\nSupplements.\nUpdate Spellbooks of Joinable NPCs.\nThis component requires that the main component be installed.\u00a0 It patches all joinable NPC spellcasters in the game, updating their spellbooks by removing spells that should no longer be available to them and adding new ones they should have. This component should be installed after any mod NPCs are installed.\nFor more information see the Links below:"}

If the caster has both a Wizard and Priest spells, then any of those applicable spell choices can be selected.\nWhen all the spells desired are \"clicked\" on and entered, select the \"DONE\" button, and the spell sequencer creation animation graphic renders over the caster's sprite.\nAdditionally, an icon is placed on the character's portrait titled \"Spell Sequencer Active\".\nTo use the Spell Sequencer, for instance during a battle, select the character and the Special Abilities button (F12), which displays all the current abilities that can be selected. Click on the \"Spell Sequencer\" icon to activate it and designate a target.\nSpell Sequencer has a default casting time of 9, whereas\u00a0the sequencer created via\u00a0the\u00a0spell has\u00a0a default casting time\u00a0of 1.\u00a0 If the wizard wears any &lt;a href=\"Game_Terminology%23C\"&gt;casting time&lt;/a&gt; reduction gear, he can always instantly release his sequencer as if it had\u00a0a casting time of\u00a0zero.\u00a0\nOnce the sequencer is released, the three spells stored in it are immediately activated in the order from its\u00a0leftmost slot to\u00a0the rightmost,\u00a0with\u00a0no casting time nor casting delay between the spells. If different spells are stored in the sequencer, they should be stored in a way that the spell in a right slot may benefit from the effect of the spell stored in a left slot.\nThe game engine\u00a0uses\u00a0the spell in the sequencer's\u00a0leftmost slot for\u00a0determining\u00a0whether\u00a0it is technically valid for the wizard to\u00a0release the sequencer.\u00a0 If different spells are\u00a0mixed in the same sequencer, it is possible\u00a0that the sequencer be\u00a0released at the range, target or location invalid to the\u00a0other two spells, causing one or both of them to fail.\nIf the wizard dies and later gets resurrected, the\u00a0spells stored in his\u00a0sequencer's spell slots\u00a0are lost.\u00a0 If he possessed\u00a0a sequencer when he died, he\u00a0will need\u00a0to release the now dead sequencer (no effects) before he may cast\u00a0Spell Sequencer\u00a0to create one that can be used normally.\nSince the duration is permanent until triggered, you can memorize the sequencer and the spells you want to put in it, cast it, then replace the used spells and rest. That way, you still have the trigger active after rest, but also have more spell slots for the next encounter.\nA mage can have one &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; each active at the same time but can't have two of the same type active at the same time.\nTrivia.\nThis BG game spell appears to be based on the Advanced D&amp;D 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"The Simbul's Spell Sequencer\". In the Pen and paper game, the wizard can creatively design the sequencer. The linked spells need not be cast by the wizard memorizing the sequencer, or even by a wizard; priest spells can be linked to a se\u00adquencer. The linked spells have no effect until the trigger word is uttered. Then all of the linked spells take effect in the same round, one after the other, in the order in which they were cast, until all have taken effect. See the External links below for further reading.\nMod content.\nRegarding this type of spell, the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod will do the following, but only if you do not install &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt;:\nAllow players to use the individual versions of Spell Immunity in triggers&lt;br&gt;\nSpell Immunity is really eight sub-spells.

ToBex allows it to be done more smoothly on original-game installs.&lt;br&gt;\nMake spell sequencers, spell triggers, and contingencies learnable by all mages&lt;br&gt;\nIn the unmodded game, spell sequencers, contingencies etc. are in the Evocation school, making them unavailable to Enchanters; this is a serious weakness for the class. This component moves them to be in both the Conjuration and Evocation schools (like Wish), so that all mages may use them. The affected spells are Minor Sequencer, Spell Sequencer, Spell Trigger, Contingency, and Chain Contingency. This will not take effect if you have Spell Revisions installed (as SR takes care of this already by making them \"Universal\" School).\nWith &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; installed, this is the equivalent spell description:\nSimbul\u2019s Spell Sequencer&lt;br&gt;\nLevel: 7&lt;br&gt;\nSchool: Universal&lt;br&gt;\nRange: Personal&lt;br&gt;\nDuration: Special&lt;br&gt;\nCasting Time: 1 round&lt;br&gt;\nArea of Effect: Special&lt;br&gt;\nSaving Throw: None&lt;br&gt;\nThis spell allows a mage to prepare a magical sequencer that can store spells to be used later in a single swift action. The sequencer can store three spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 4th level or lower. A mage can only possess one spell sequencer at a time, and the sequencer will remain active until the spells contained within it are released."}

Spell Shield makes these attacks \"ineffective\", and then loses an amount of \"levels of immunity\" equal to the &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; of the thwarted attack. Once the shield has no more levels left, its protection falls with a recognizable sound.\nThe value of this spell comes from the fact that most Magic attacks cast against player characters, though particularly devastating, are actually level 0, and therefore cannot harm Spell Shield as they get thwarted by it. The in-game description for the spell is silent about them and obfuscates most of the mechanics behind its behavior.\nDescription.\nAs Spell Shield starts to take hold, a brief lighting effect and color fade plays over the wizard. The note \"Protected by Spell Shield\" appears in the combat log, and a new icon starts showing on the caster's portrait. In that character's \"Record\" screen, the mention \"Spell Shield\" can be found next to this icon.

This text appears even if the target had no spell protections present, or even if the spell protection present was too high level to be removed. This message can therefore be considered misleading to the player.\nAll eligible spell protections as described are removed with a Spell Thrust. For instance, an enemy mage protected by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Minor Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; would have all of those removed by a single application of Spell Thrust.\nA &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; will block this spell, and then the shield will be consumed.\nA &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; will make Spell Thrust \"Spell ineffective\" - this means that even if the target has one or more spell protections present of the 5th level or lower, it won't be able to function and is essentially negated by the globe.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Abjuration&lt;/a&gt; will not block this spell, even though Spell Thrust is an abjuration school spell.\nA Spell Thrust may be cast on a target who is invisible, sanctuaried or hidden.\nSpell Thrust will bypass an illusionary protection such as &lt;a href=\"Reflected%20Image\"&gt;Reflected Image&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, even though the internal spell effects are not flagged to do so.\nCasting a Spell Thrust on a neutral creature will turn them hostile, and perhaps others in the same vicinity.\nSpell protections removed by Spell Thrust.\nExample: An enemy mage is protected by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; is truck by a Spell Thrust. Only the Minor Spell Deflection and Spell immunity spells will both be removed simultaneously. Spell Thrust can't touch the other two because they are above level 5 spell power level.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeon and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset has no Wizard spell titled or equivalent to \"Spell Thrust\".\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects, and utility. See below for description:\nSpell Thrust\nLevel: 3\nSchool: Abjuration\nRange: Long\nDuration: Instant\nCasting Time: 3\nArea of Effect: 15\u2019 radius\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is cast, it will dispel one spell protection of 5th level or lower on all enemies within the area of effect. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first. If a target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.\nThe spell protections dispelled by Spell Thrust are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen and Spell Shield.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod Spell Thrust can't target invisible or hidden creatures without first exposing or revealing the target creature.

The spell also behaves differently than the BG video game's version. For instance, the spell has a capacity limit, and it sucks in any non AoE spell directed at the wizard into the trap, which can be released at any target the caster wishes, although the caster doesn't know for sure what spell is trapped. If multiple spells are in the trap, then a random roll determines what spell can be released. There is no \"spell recharging\" feature in the Pen and Paper spell version.

Note that with the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod, Spell Turning does reflect Breach.\nList of spells that can be turned (innate abilities and enemy-only abilities not included).\nDivine spells:\nLevel 1: Command, Doom, Magic Stone\nLevel 3: Call Lightning (even when you're not the original target), Summon Insects\nLevel 4: Mental Domination, Poison\nLevel 5: Cause Critical Wounds (including from beholder rays), Flame Strike, Slay Living\nLevel 6: Harm, Dolorous Decay, Sol's Searing Orb\nLevel 7: Energy Blades (only the electricity part), Ether Gate, Finger of Death, Implosion\nArcane Spells:\nLevel 1: Blindness, Charm Person, Chill Touch (not the fist damage), Chromatic Orb, Larloch's Minor Drain, Magic Missile, Shocking Grasp (not the fist damage), Spook\nLevel 2: Agannazar's Scorcher (even when you're not the original target), Deafness, Ghoul Touch (not the fist damage), Melf's Acid Arrow, Power Word: Sleep, Ray of Enfeeblement\nLevel 3: Dire Charm, Flame Arrow, Lightning Bolt (only if you're the original target), Melf's Minute Meteors (only the fire damage), Vampiric Touch\nLevel 4: Contagion, Polymorph Other\nLevel 5: Domination, Feeblemind\nLevel 6: Chain Lightning (only if you're the original target), Disintegrate, Flesh to Stone, Power Word: Silence\nLevel 7: Finger of Death, Power Word: Stun\nLevel 8: Bigby's Clenched Fist, Maze, Power Word: Blind\nLevel 9: Bigby's Crushing Hand, Black Blade of Disaster (only turns the level drain and disintegration effects, not the damage), Energy Blades (only the electricity part), Energy Drain, Imprisonment, Power Word: Kill\nIt will also turn enemy-only abilities that count as magical projectiles of those &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;, for example the rays of a &lt;a href=\"beholder\"&gt;beholder&lt;/a&gt;. It will also affect wands.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset\" Spell Turning\" behaves differently than the BG video game's version. For instance, from seven to ten spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows for certain how effective the spell is. A spell may also only be partially turned. If the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has variable effects determined with a d100 die roll. See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has replaced Spell Turning, which is removed from the game, with this new arcane spell. See below:\nGreater Spell Deflection\nLevel: 7\nSchool: Abjuration\nRange: Personal\nDuration: 5 turns\nCasting Time: 7\nArea of Effect: Caster\nSaving Throw: None\nThis abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 12 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic. However, it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.\nThis spell absorbs spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud).\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; (SCS) changes Spell Turning behavior and now bounces/reflects the 5th Level Breach spell and the Wand of Spell Striking. If SCS and Spell Revisions are installed then Greater Spell Deflection can block/deflect Breach spells, the same as any other single-target spell/innate magic."}

It is an in-game classification invisible to the player but that can have an impact on gameplay. For the most part, this classification gathers spells and abilities that grant immunity to other spells and effects by targeting their &lt;a href=\"power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt; or spell school, or by providing &lt;a href=\"magic%20resistance\"&gt;magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Typical spell protections are &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey should not be confused with the and spell types: The former tends to protect against physical attacks (&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Globe of Blades&lt;/a&gt;, ...), and the latter against non-physical &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;damage types&lt;/a&gt; and status effects (&lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fear\"&gt;Resist Fear&lt;/a&gt;, ...), though there is some overlap between these two spell types.\nMechanics.\nThe Spell protections type is actively targeted by , which include attacks like &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Word\"&gt;Secret Word&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt;. There doesn't appear to be other game mechanics attached to this classification.\nHowever, spells and abilities of this type were given somewhat consistent characteristics by game developers, explored below.\nDispel Magic immunity.\nWith the exception of &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Magic\"&gt;Resist Magic&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Resistance%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Magic Resistance&lt;/a&gt; spell, its &lt;a href=\"Wish%23Magic%20resistance%20on%20everyone%20in%20the%20area%2C%20including%20enemies.\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt; equivalent and &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge%2326\"&gt;Wild Surge #26 \"\u201cGlobe of Invulnerability\u201d\"&lt;/a&gt;, all spell protections are entirely unaffected by &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; and do not cease to function in dead magic areas like in the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Teleport%20Maze\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Teleport Maze&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversely, they tend not to be able to protect from Dispel Magic, with the exception of Spell Immunity when the source of dispel uses a spell school \u2014 typically Abjuration.\nVulnerability to Magic attacks.\nSpell protections rely on special \"status\" effects to achieve their purpose. Most of these effects explicitly avoid countering attacks of the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20attack%20type\"&gt;Magic attack type&lt;/a&gt;, so spells like &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt; cannot be stopped by Spell protections that rely on them.\nTwo types of effects are able to block Magic attacks: Those giving &lt;a href=\"power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt; immunity, namely the Globe of Invulnerability spells, and those targeting the spell type directly, of which there is only &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeflection, reflection and absorption by power level are powerless, so out the window go &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and Spell Trap. &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23A\"&gt;Area of effect&lt;/a&gt; attacks are a good way to ascertain that a defense is relying on power level \"immunity\" and not one of the other three, because in the \"defense by power level\" group of effects that we are discussing, only immunity can shield from AoE.\nFor self-protection only.\nSpells and abilities of the Spell protections type are all single target, and only target the caster. There doesn't appear to be any exception.\nProtection from friendly spells.\nThe effects used by most Spell protections let the caster's own spells pass through, but they're not so permissive with other party members, so a &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; from a Cleric will crash on a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Minor Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt; and the Mage protected by it will not be healed. As an AoE spell of power level 5 however, &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Cure\"&gt;Mass Cure&lt;/a&gt; would bypass all Spell protections except Spell Immunity: Necromancy.\nThis is not an issue for spell protections granting magic resistance, if only because non-hostile spells tend to bypass it altogether.\nList of spell protections.\nIn addition to spells and abilities in this list, a special Stoneskin exists that is only used by &lt;a href=\"Amelyssan\"&gt;Amelyssan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demogorgon\"&gt;Demogorgon&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the real Stoneskin spell, this one is of the \"Spell protections\" type, it is treated as a level 8 effect and cannot be dispelled. Demogorgon uses it only once, with his early battle contingency, after which he only uses the real Stoneskin spell."}

For example, a spellhaunt that formed from a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Fog\"&gt;Death Fog&lt;/a&gt; spell resemble a greenish, acidic cloud of fog and those formed from a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; spell appear as an orangish-yellow, fiery masses of vaporous flame. Although no two spellhaunts look alike, they all appear as ghostly, pulsating &lt;a href=\"Mist\"&gt;apparitions&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nThe creature will attempt to move toward the closest enemy and engage in melee range attacks with its tendril-like appendages. \nA successful hit on an enemy will cause some &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt; and drain one charge from any equipped item (if the item has charges assigned). For example, a wand, the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Amulet\"&gt;Shield Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Brilliance\"&gt;Helm of Brilliance&lt;/a&gt; etc.\nAdditionally, the same hit also removes one memorized Wizard spell (if applicable) from the target. The highest-level spell is drained, and if there are more than one in the same hierarchy, it is determined randomly from that level tier.\nA spellhaunt possesses the \"mist creature\" trait of immunity to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; and can naturally detect invisible or hidden creatures.\nThe spellhaunt is not scripted to specifically look for or attack an enemy that possesses charged items or has memorized wizard spells. It only uses the default WTASIGHT script to determine what to target.\nThe spellhaunt is almost completely impervious to magic via 100% magic resistance, immunity to spells with a &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; between 1 through 2, as well as 4 through 9. It also is specifically immune to scores of individual arcane and divine spells. There are exceptions. See the &lt;a href=\"SPELLH01.ITM\"&gt;SPELLH01.ITM&lt;/a&gt; for info. Don't rely on magic to destroy this creature, unless it is targeted by one that it is vulnerable to.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic (priest)&lt;/a&gt;) spell effects destroy illusionary creatures regardless of caster level, a spellhaunt will be destroyed and disappear from the map if either of those spells are cast upon the creature. Other sources of dispel magic, such as from the &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor\"&gt;Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; and their innate dispel magic or from &lt;a href=\"Carsomyr\"&gt;Carsomyr&lt;/a&gt; will also suffice. \nA rogue's &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;Detect Illusion&lt;/a&gt; skill can also cause the creature to vanish (but no XP is awarded). However, a spell such as &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt; has no effect on it as determined by in-game testing.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod gets rid of the racial classification of Mist and provides a new default AI script. This will result in the creature having the ability to chase and follow the party all over the map once it has been encountered."}

It is a magical prison under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizards\"&gt;Cowled Wizards&lt;/a&gt;, and anyone who breaks the magic laws in the city of &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; is sent here and locked up. Underneath the building is a magical labyrinth which is used in exceedingly rare cases to test inmates to determine if they are sane enough to leave.\nBackground.\nAt the end of , the Cowled Wizards send &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; to Spellhold for the unsanctioned use of magical energy within the city of Athkatla. &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%204\"&gt;By the time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; has reached the prison to rescue Imoen, Irenicus, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, has taken over the asylum. He's been using the place to conduct his own diabolical tests and utilizes the technology within to steal both Imoen's and the Ward's soul, which are then used to remove the curses that he and Bodhi are subjected to. He then turns the two of them over to Bodhi, who in turn sends them and the rest of the party to the magical dungeon underneath from which they must escape.\nLayout.\nA stone bridge leads to a small island that contains four separate buildings of various sizes. Two are inaccessible due to collapsed walkways. The largest building contains a doorway on its left side that allows for access into the asylum. Wooden staircases and walkways provide access to this doorway. Despite the partially dilapidated appearance of the grounds and walkways, the buildings look to be in well maintained condition.\nAccessing Spellhold.\nThere are two ways to gain access into the asylum:\nTraveling from Brynnlaw.\nLook for &lt;a href=\"Sime\"&gt;Sime&lt;/a&gt; near the transition point from Brynnlaw to Spellhold. If she's spoken to with the wardstone in the Ward's possession, a short dialogue exchange will occur and finish with:\nIf the wardstone is not possessed, Sime's dialog will offer different replies. However, the party can still transition to the Spellhold area if desired.\nNo Wardstone:.\nIf the party makes the transition to Spellhold and does not have the wardstone, a text message in the combat log will display:\nThis warning is provided because there are two large traps on the bridge that are invisible and can't be detected or disabled by the party. The traps are triggered by any creature moving across the bridge, whether individually or as a group. Both traps trigger a Flesh to Stone spell upon any creature inside the trap area. The spell is a &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt; 6 spell that bypasses magic resistance and has no saving throw. Both traps do not deactivate and remain functional anytime a creature enters.\nIf the party makes it over the bridge, it is possible that a spawned group of enemies will attack near the first wooden staircase. The enemy group changes depending on time of day. The nighttime creatures are more dangerous than during daylight hours.\nAscending the remaining staircases onto the wood decking in front of the main Spellhold building will spawn a second group of defenders, also differing depending on the hour. The doorway to enter the asylum can only be opened with the wardstone in the inventory, acting as a special key, and it will disappear from the inventory once the attempt is made. If the party made it all the way to this door without the wardstone, then they will have to return to Brynnlaw and obtain it. Remember that traveling back across the traps will still be a persistent hazard on the bridge.\nWardstone:.\nIf the party makes the transition to Spellhold and has obtained the wardstone the log displays: \nPossession of the wardstone by the party will allow travel across the bridge unmolested.\nOnce the door to the asylum is opened, the party can transition into the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Main%20Floor\"&gt;Main Floor&lt;/a&gt; area.\nContainers.\nThere are three containers in this area, a crate and two barrels. One is empty and the other two may reveal low value &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt;. Note that one container is not accessible by normal movement, although it can be seen. In order to examine it, the player would need to use some other game mechanic, such as the &lt;a href=\"Console\"&gt;Console&lt;/a&gt; command CTRLJ function or perhaps the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod's \"Dimension Jump\" spell.\nMod content.\nMods:.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod the two petrification trap effects are changed by rewriting SPIN864.spl. It now can slow and apply a permanent &lt;a href=\"Opcode\"&gt;Opcode&lt;/a&gt; 185 Held effect - a saving throw with a penalty is now allowed. As the spell slows the party members crossing the zone, it limits a game engine issue that allows super-fast movement to sometimes not trigger trap zones. Also, the spell effect is changed so that the PC won't automatically die from petrification - and allow other party members a chance to free the main character via appropriate magical cures."}

Six Shadow Thieves are encased in glass tubes, along with the Ward, and they are killed in the ensuing procedure to steal the Ward's soul. When the last Shadow Thief dies, the fourth &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;dream&lt;/a&gt; sequence takes place. When the dream is over, the party is transported from the laboratory to Level 1 of &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%201\"&gt;Bodhi's Hunt&lt;/a&gt; to begin the \"&lt;a href=\"Escaping%20the%20Asylum\"&gt;Escaping the Asylum&lt;/a&gt;\" quest. \n&lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; is now in charge of the party's fate and hunts down the party as they attempt to navigate the hazardous asylum labyrinth.\nAfter managing to work through the various labyrinth dungeons, as well as the tests of the &lt;a href=\"Apparition%20%28Spellhold%29\"&gt;Apparition&lt;/a&gt;, the party is now back in the basement after having transitioned from the &lt;a href=\"Final%20Judgement%20Spellhold%20Test\"&gt;Final Judgement Spellhold Test&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; will greet the party and advise them to seek out the residents on the main floor. The party convinces the mentally disturbed inmates to help defeat Irenicus. A cut-scene return to the basement begins battle with Irenicus in his laboratory. Once the fight is over and Irenicus has left the building, the party has the option of going through a portal in the basement and follow the escaped Irenicus and Bodhi to wherever it may lead. Or they could accept Saemon Havarian's word once again and try a different plan.\nDescription.\nThis area is below the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Main%20Floor\"&gt;Spellhold Main Floor&lt;/a&gt;. The area is mostly one large rectangle in shape, with four off shooting chambers connected to it. The center of the area is a walled-in central block, occupied mostly by a laboratory of sorts. There are two doors into that lab. There are also seven jail cells, also connected to the central block with cell doors accessible from the corridor (these doors are locked).\nA corridor runs continuously around the perimeter of the central block. From the corridor a traveler can access all the doors to the lab, jail cells, the portal room, a storeroom and the two exit chambers.\nGameplay and walkthrough (abbreviated).\nFirst entry and Saemon Havarian.\nThe party appears in a \"L\" shaped chamber from the &lt;a href=\"Final%20Judgement%20Spellhold%20Test\"&gt;Final Judgement Spellhold Test&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately the NPC &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; will step into view and address the party (even if the party is invisible). He'll say:\nThe party can select from some replies, and various dialogue will ensue. It can be confrontational, neutral at times and very smooth depending on the selections. In the end, Saemon has offered some reasons and information and then advice regarding Irenicus. He says:\nWith certain core game companions in the party there will be interjections from &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anomen%20Delryn\"&gt;Anomen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Odesseiron\"&gt;Edwin Odesseiron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Viconia%20DeVir\"&gt;Viconia DeVir&lt;/a&gt; for example. Most agree that this suggestion would be a good idea.\nAfterwards, Saemon walks briskly away and disappears. \nThe player's journal will update at this point, reading:\nFacing Irenicus right away.\nRegardless of if the party allowed Saemon to live and leave the basement, if the party desires they can buff, prepare, psyche themselves up and quaff potions etc. Then move forward and enter the laboratory to face Irenicus. Attention is now drawn to what Saemon said about using the army of inmates or perishing. If Edwin was in your party, you may recall that the Thayan mage thought that was a load of rubbish and NOW was the time to take revenge on your hated antagonist. If Anomen is in the party, he also didn't think much of Saemon's suggestion.\nIf any party member enters the laboratory (invisible or hidden does not matter) then Irenicus, who is alone stands next to the same apparatus control platform that stole &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; soul essence. Irenicus will say:\nThe player character, and the entire party are killed. The death animation is played, and it is game over.\nThe portal room.\nLocated on the eastern side of the map and along the perimeter corridor - this room has a locked door that can't be opened without a &lt;a href=\"Jon%27s%20Key\"&gt;specific key&lt;/a&gt;. If examined, a text is displayed, reading:\nThe storeroom.\nAlong the northern portion of the perimeter corridor is a closed door. If opened, there appears to be storage area. Two containers can be searched through with various items that can be obtained. One item of interest is the &lt;a href=\"First%20Journal%20of%20Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;First Journal of Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;. this will provide some insight into the main antagonist's personal thoughts, as his own words lay out the impressions and plans he considered. There could be some useful information within for the player. Also, there are a fistful of &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Dispelling\"&gt;Arrow of Dispelling&lt;/a&gt; items, which are uncommon in BG2.\nExit to the main floor.\nBehind another closed door is a room with an ascending staircase to the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Main%20Floor\"&gt;Main Floor&lt;/a&gt;."}

Incredible statues, many with magical auras and abilities are present. Additionally, there are storerooms as well.\nThis level of the dungeon labyrinth is an oddly designed area with various tests, riddles, hazards and passages that can be explored as desired. Some are optional, others must be solved. There are few clues given that make what to do obvious to the party. Each location within this level will need to be examined and explored in order to rule out what is needed and to find out what rewards and possibilities exist. For a first-time player, the best way to approach this dungeon level is to carefully explore everything before pressing onward.\nAs this labyrinth was obviously designed by the builders to facilitate tests of the mind, it will be potentially rewarding and confusing. Expect some obstacles, and definitely be cognizant of traps. Walking around and fully exploring the area with no trap detection will prove 100% fatal - no saving throw, no resistance. Beware!\nGameplay (abbreviated walkthrough).\nThe party has been transported to this area by Irenicus. Bhodi stands above the party members looking down upon them from a parapet above, and some back-and-forth remarks are made. The party is to complete a \"gauntlet\" and will be hunted at some point by Bodhi. No particular goals or advice are provided from Bodhi. Afterwards, she exits the map into a tunnel.\nImoen stands near the party and can be invited to join now. Her mental state is improved from before and she can function as a full-fledged companion again. She has no equipment, and no longer has the &lt;a href=\"Imoen%27s%20Belt\"&gt;Imoen's Belt&lt;/a&gt; that was present in the Irenicus Dungeon (for plot purposes). If for some reason the player doesn't desire Imoen as a party member, then there is a dialogue option to allow her to begrudgingly and apprehensively remark that maybe she can find her way back to Athkatla on her own. Just a reminder that the entire reason why the Bhaalspawn is in the Asylum was to rescue Imoen. Letting her go now, especially as she has lost her soul, and the &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt; just found out she is a sibling Bhaalspawn as well - is questionable at best, but it is allowed by the game. Some core party members will have some incredulous interjections about this decision. If Imoen is not added to the party, then she leaves the map, and goes somewhere, somehow, with the goal to find the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt; again.\nThe next event that can occur at a random time, but usually within a few turns after the Imoen conversation is that the Protagonist will have a sudden bout of symptoms. Something has caused an adverse reaction in your body. If Imoen is in the party, she will have interjections about this, and a dialogue is presented. A text display describes the event: \nThis strange episode passes, for now.\nIt is time to get to exploring the area. Who knows how long it will be before Bodhi starts her hunting. The party can take any path in any order it desires, so the following below will just address the area features.\nStoreroom.\nUp the steps and directly ahead is a closed door. If opened, a &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt; is observed, and its hostile. Within the room are numerous boxes, urns and lidded jars. Check for traps. Some useful items can be found in two containers. Note that an \"Opal Stone\" can be found. This gemstone isn't a valuable item like a regular gem. It has a specific purpose. The item's description reads: \"This stone has a certain energy about it. It might come in useful, although at this point you aren't sure where.\"\nSecond storeroom.\nOpen the door and see a number of &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; creatures, who unsurprisingly are hostile. Within this room are various ladders, boxes, urns, jars, bolts of fabric etc. The room smells of dung and urine from the recently dispatched inhabitants doing their business in some of the earthenware jars. Picking through the storage, two containers produce some useful items and ammunition.\nStatue of Riddles room.\nThis roughly octagonal shaped room has two entrances/exits. The bulk of the space is occupied by a central walled stonework on which are mounted carved stone faces. Seen at the top of it is a Statue rising from the interior of a robed figure with outstretched arms to each side. It has a peculiar look to it, as if it may not be entirely of stone, and seems to actually be looking back at the viewer, although it could be some sort of illusion. \nOn the outermost walls of the room are more stone faces. If any of these faces are examined, some of them will display an inspection cursor. Interacting with the cursor will display a text on the game screen, reading: \"Put your hand in my mouth.\"\nAny party member can then activate the cursor and place their hand in the stone face's \"mouth\" opening. When this is done, an animation of swirling energy transports that character inside the central structure so that they are directly below and looking up at the central robed statue. In the character's mind or consciousness, the robed figure speaks: \nThe statue will then present a riddle in the dialogue box including a listing of multiple-choice answers. Select the response desired. If the correct response is given, the statue responds:\nIf the answer is not correct, then the statue replies:\nThere are twelve stone faces that can be interacted with, and each one has a different riddle from the statue. The character can try as many times as they desire, and once a face's riddle is answered correctly, it is closed from further interaction. Once all the correct answers are provided, the statue remarks:\nDeadly Corridor.\nBehind the Statue of Riddles chamber is a corridor with an abrupt turn. Around the corner are a group of &lt;a href=\"Yuan-ti\"&gt;Yuan-ti&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Yuan-ti%20Mage\"&gt;Yuan-ti Mage&lt;/a&gt;. They are not friendly. The corridor beyond them seems to corner again and connect to a long and unusual corridor with odd stone blocks protruding from either wall. The corridor seems to lead to the storeroom that was guarded by a Clay Golem. Tread carefully.\nStatues room.\nThe party will eventually find a room with a small descending staircase with eleven similar statues lining three of the walls. This subject is discussed separately on the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20item%20riddle\"&gt;Statue item riddle&lt;/a&gt; page.\nGem Portal room.\nThrough a closed door and down a small corridor leads to a square room currently occupied by a &lt;a href=\"Ruhk%20%28Spellhold%29\"&gt;Ruhk&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"Mephit\"&gt;Mephit&lt;/a&gt; creatures. All are hostile and will aggressively attack if any party members are discovered.\nAssuming the guardians are dealt with, the strange chamber has one feature that can be interacted with. A glowing and swirling energy inside a door frame indicates some kind of magical portal. If the party is in possession of the Opal Stone, Sapphire Stone and the Ruby Stone (all can be obtained on this dungeon level), then when a character interacts with the portal one of the gemstones is consumed, and then shortly afterwards a creature surges out of the portal.\nAn Opal Stone will Induce a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Wolfwere\"&gt;Greater Wolfwere&lt;/a&gt; to spring forth from the portal. The slavering beast is hostile and blood thirsty, attacking the closest party member detected.\nA Ruby Stone will gate a &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Fiend\"&gt;Pit Fiend&lt;/a&gt; through the portal in a gust of sulphureous brimstone and ash - it is a monstrous devil from the depths of hell and bent on destruction.\nThe Sapphire stone conjures an odd &lt;a href=\"Djinni\"&gt;Djinni&lt;/a&gt;, who is neutral and offers some words and a gift for solving the portal test. The &lt;a href=\"Doomplate\"&gt;Doomplate&lt;/a&gt; is placed in the PC's inventory.\nHand of the builder.\nAscend another long staircase from the central area and pass through to a corridor. Ahead is an alcove with an altar and deity statuette atop. Examine the altar for some found items. Further along down the corridor can be seen a gigantic stone head of some unknown historical figure. Nearby are seen some guardian creatures, possibly Minotaur and Umberhulk monsters, or there may be a group of Yuan-ti (this is a random spawn area). If any party members are detected these hostile defenders will attack.\nAfter defeating the defenders, a squat clay jar can be opened to find some useful treasure. Looking over the gigantic stone head, the observer can tell that there is a passageway behind the head. The bulky statue blocks the pathway. A fine seam in the jaw of the stone head is discerned, and perhaps this block will act as a door. Interacting with the statue displays a text:\nThe party is not sure what this clue is all about, but the means to open the statue's jaw isn't understood. Perhaps further into the asylum an answer can be found.\nAfter this dungeon level has been fully explored, the party can transition through a choice of two exit doorways that descend to another &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%202\"&gt;area&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter exploring the second level of the dungeon, return to level 1. The party should be in possession of the two components needed to allow the \"Head of the Builder\" statue to allow passage towards &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%203\"&gt;Spellhold Bodhi's Hunt Level 3&lt;/a&gt;. If so, a dialogue text and journal update occur - each party member receives a reward of , and the giant stone head's jaw opens. It is now time to progress further into the asylum labyrinth.\nTreasure.\nNote: The \"T\" locations correspond to the Map Notes selected on the InfoBox.\nStatue of Riddles.\n100% completion of stone face riddles reward:\nT6.\nPortal gem test reward:\nMod content.\nFirst off, a quick note about the &lt;a href=\"Ascension\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; mod if the player has installed it. Although this mod doesn't affect anything in SoA specifically (except if &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt; is accessed before the Throne of Bhaal game portion) - decisions regarding plans for Imoen as a companion are a planning factor that can be addressed right now. Imoen will have an entire revised story line awaiting the player with Ascension in ToB - which can provide unique gameplay and tactics with her revised Bhaalspawn powers. this can make or break success in the final battle. So, consider whether taking Imoen into the party now will be what the party would want to do, so that she can gain experience and contribute better to the party's efforts later in ToB.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises all enemy creatures to some extent in the Asylum. In some cases, different or additional enemies are included. \nIf the player elected to install the \"Party's items are taken from them in Spellhold\" component, then the player will already notice that many items have been removed from the characters inventory. If the player has acquired other mod-only items that aren't normally present in the unmodified game, then they will probably still be available. This component adds a realistic touch that seems reasonable, in that Irenicus would not place the party into the Asylum labyrinth with all their gear, wands, potions, scrolls etc. That would be frankly stupid and illogical. So, if you had the fortitude to install this component, do not despair, as everything needed to overcome the challenges ahead can be resolved by using your wits and what can be found. Have fun and enjoy the more realistic difficulty of being an unwilling captive of the asylum. Note: The removed items can be recovered later. They are not gone for future gameplay.\nInstalling the &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Asylum\"&gt;Improved Asylum&lt;/a&gt; mod will revise all three Asylum dungeon levels in small and moderate ways. On the first level dungeon, the mod changes the Statue of Riddles tests. New questions and required answers replace most of the original ones. This is good for those players who have previously done this adventure and are looking for a bit of fresh mental stimuli."}

There are two storage areas, long corridors, a library, a cavern, and even an elaborate tomb.\nThis level of the dungeon labyrinth is an oddly designed area with various tests, riddles, hazards and passages that can be explored as desired. Some are optional, others must be solved. There are few clues given that make what to do obvious to the party. Each location within this level will need to be examined and explored in order to rule out what is needed and to find out what rewards and possibilities exist. For a first-time player, the best way to approach this dungeon level is to carefully explore everything.\nAs this labyrinth was obviously designed by the builder to facilitate tests of the mind, it will be potentially rewarding and confusing.\nGameplay (abbreviated walkthrough).\nEnter the second level of the labyrinth.\nThere are two entrances from level 1 to choose from. It doesn't matter which one is taken, as the party needs to explore the entire place in order to figure out how to escape the asylum. At this stage of the process that isn't really known, so there are only questions or vague clues, with no identified specific goal to attain. Also, the party isn't sure when or if Bodhi will be encountered, just that she made it clear that the party is going through a \"gauntlet\" and the bhaalspawn and companions' are prey for her hunt.\nPortcullis room.\nFor purposes of getting this area described, we'll start at the dungeon entrance that is accessed the from the south-east side of level 1, corresponding to the south-west side of level 2. Transition into a descending stair well. An open doorway with a large and empty room is seen ahead. Across the room is another similar open doorway leading to another room. There is no other way to go. If the party has a rogue that can detect traps, then decide if that is something worth doing. Closer examination of the open doorway ahead reveals small iron lined holes in the door frame and floor connection. At the top of the doorway is a slit cut into the middle of the frame and keystone. \nExplore further into the second room, which is the same dimensions as the first, and yet another doorway lies ahead with the holes and slit. At some point a trigger will initiate that drops a portcullis down from the slit and locking into the holes on the floor. This effectively partitions room 1 from 2 and prevents leaving room 2 further into the adjoining corridor. Immediately thereafter a group of &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;Umber Hulk&lt;/a&gt; creatures appear in each room. It's possible that the party may be split when this occurs. The hulking brutes attack if any party members are detected. Note that the portcullis gates won't rise up and open for a period of time. Long enough that the Umber Hulks will have time to assault. \nLong Corridor.\nThis corridor is straight and oriented in an east-west compass direction. Peering as far as the visual range allows, no doors or adjoining passages are seen. The corridor has regularly spaced illumination sources providing low level lighting. Eventually a randomly determined grouping of hostile enemies will be observed - these will be either a &lt;a href=\"Yuan-ti\"&gt;Yuan-ti&lt;/a&gt; creatures with a &lt;a href=\"Yuan-ti%20Mage\"&gt;Yuan-ti Mage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mummy\"&gt;mummies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghast&lt;/a&gt; monsters. To continue these adversaries will need to be defeated.\nThe corridor ends at a junction where there is a \"T\" connection. A closed double door is found leading south, and another corridor leads north.\nThrough the double doors.\nUnlocked double doors can be opened. A corridor leads south. Another set of double doors is seen further ahead on the west side of the corridor, and a passage or alcove is opposite.\nMoving forward will reveal a spawned group of undead. The composition of the undead creatures is determined by the protagonist's XP level. If over 2M XP it will include a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;. If the lich is able to detect a party member, then it will initiate its initial spell casting that is uninterruptible. \nThe undead is initially positioned in a close cluster that appears to be a cut-out alcove used for storage, with various vessels like urns and jars that can be searched for valuables and other found items of use.\nThe library.\nAcross from the undead spawn location are closed double doors. If they are opened a library or study of some type is seen with shelving full of dusty books, manuscripts and other odds and ends, furnishings and storage containers. More items can be scavenged in here. Mod content (see below) may add a hostile denizen to the library.\nThe builder's tomb.\nMoving further past the library and storage alcove and turning a corner lead to a set of closed double doors. Passing through the doors will reveal a fairly large ornate chamber with impressive decorative features and a high ceiling. The room is lit, and dominating the center of the chamber is a stone sarcophagus. This place is a tomb of some kind. A male undead being, with a vampiric appearance stands at the ready, neutral at the moment. The creature will speak in a hollow voice:\nIt appears that this creature isn't allied with Bodhi. The player's combat screen labels this vampire as &lt;a href=\"Dace%20Sontan\"&gt;Dace Sontan&lt;/a&gt;, although it never actually mentions this in any dialogue, but does later in the player's the journal entry.\nWith dialogue, the party can approach this encounter in a few ways. It can immediately opt to tell the vampire that they are going to kill him, or that they are here to kill him. If so then the vampire will attack.\nOr, through dialogue the party can say that (paraphrased) \"Bodhi has sentenced me to this place, and we should work together to escape\" - Dace will then reply:\nThe party can then remark and question him if he's mad, or even listening, or just bent on fighting anyone he meets. Dace will reply:\nImmediately following this, the player's journal updates:\nIf the party has already wiped out the Kobolds, obtained the crystal, and probably collected the &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Stake\"&gt;Wooden Stake&lt;/a&gt;, then just battling Dace and staking his heart is possible. Dace must be killed to obtain &lt;a href=\"The%20Hand%20of%20Dace\"&gt;The Hand of Dace&lt;/a&gt;. If the party doesn't free Dace from his tortuous undeath, then his Apparition will plead for relief if the party interacts with the sarcophagus after its corporal body is defeated. The good thing to do would be to stake the poor soul and send him to peaceful rest. If this is done, Dace's apparition will once again appear and give thanks for the good deed.\nThe storeroom.\nReachable from the Ancient Tome chamber or from a corridor, this rectangular room is always occupied by at least one random spawned hostile creature (usually some type of undead mist). Other creatures are possible with certain Mod content.\nThis room is some sort of storage area, with many urns and storage jars/vessels. Examine them and find valuables and useful items.\nAncient Tome chamber.\nThis area can be initially entered from the storeroom or from a transition point stairwell (and through a door) from Level 1 of the labyrinth. \nIn about the center half of the chamber is a curious bookstand. Atop this is some kind of Ancient Tome with opened pages visible, and indecipherable runic calligraphy. For what purpose is unknown.\nIf the player further examines and toggles the object, a text is displayed:\nAny party member can be selected to do the \"click again\" function - if so then another text is displayed:\nEach time a page is turned, a progressively tougher monster is summoned, and there are five page turns allowed.\nThe first is a &lt;a href=\"Kobold%20Captain\"&gt;Kobold Captain&lt;/a&gt; and the last is a &lt;a href=\"beholder\"&gt;beholder&lt;/a&gt;. Defeat the monsters for earned experience. Once the final monster is put down, a text message displays: \nThe party then receives &lt;a href=\"Edventar%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Edventar's Gift&lt;/a&gt;, and scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Fiend\"&gt;Summon Fiend&lt;/a&gt;. A nice haul for little risk.\nCrystal cavern.\nOn the west wall of the Ancient Tome chamber can be found a secret wall panel. Open it and a passage leads into a quasi-shaped cut stone and cavern combination area. The party may immediately be noticed by various &lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quasit\"&gt;Quasit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kobold\"&gt;Kobold&lt;/a&gt; defenders who are hostile. Expect various &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Arrow of Fire&lt;/a&gt; missiles being launched from bow wielding kobolds.\nObviously, these creatures can't take much punishment and can be easily mowed down with little risk. In most cases a single fighter type from the party can just enter alone and continue within and wipe out everything in its way. A &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; will probably kill all in the area of effect.\nA cavern chamber with more kobolds will be found, as well as a few passages leading east will be seen, but the most prominent feature is huge pinkish colored crystal in the center of the cave. If examined with a cursor toggle the crystal will display a text:\nBased on the proximity of a party member to the crystal, the object will show a dialogue box on the screen and says:\nThis will spawn two &lt;a href=\"Kobold%20Shaman\"&gt;Kobold Shaman&lt;/a&gt; creatures, one will say \"\"Yip! We discovered! No time! No time! Avatar not focused! Crystal not ready!\", the other says \"Avatar not formed! Kurtulmak not ready!\" and then the shaman will cast some spells. The Crystal will then trigger an action after it says:\nThis action summons a &lt;a href=\"Kobold%20Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Kobold Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; and some relatively high-level (for kobolds that is) guards. The witch doctor will cast a spell or two, and the guards will attack. Additionally, there will be a creature that looks like Halfling amongst the kobolds. This is the \"avatar of Kurtulmak\" (it behaves as a melee attacking kobold). When the witch doctor and kobolds are destroyed the Crystal shows a text display on the combat screen:\nAt this time another message displays:\nThe PC will then receive &lt;a href=\"Kurtulmak%27s%20Crystal%20Shard\"&gt;Kurtulmak's Crystal Shard&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory. Thus ends this cavern episode. Feel free to collect any items from the fallen, especially the single &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Stake\"&gt;Wooden Stake&lt;/a&gt;. Without that stake the party won't be able to send &lt;a href=\"Dace%20Sontan\"&gt;Dace Sontan&lt;/a&gt; to his final rest.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Asylum\"&gt;Improved Asylum&lt;/a&gt; mod adds additional content to this level. You can find another adventuring party that fights to escape the maze, but only one party can survive. An additional component can add a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; encounter (it could be the second lich found on this level depending on protagonist XP level).\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises the AI scripts for all enemy creatures. The Beholder and Mind Flayer get the SCS reworked innate eye beams and psionic abilities respectively. If the party faces the experience level dependent &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; spawn then that creature will be particularly more efficient with spell casts and also have much more staying power. Dace Soltan can be a bit more of a challenge as well if the \"Improved Vampires\" component is installed. Enjoy!"}

It must be navigated by the party in order to get to the point where the final phases of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Apparition%20%28Spellhold%29\"&gt;Apparition&lt;/a&gt; Arbiter tests will take place. \nDescription of Area.\nThe level is fully constructed of stone blocks, doors, ornamental artwork, tiled floor areas, and elaborate torch illumination consisting of braziers/sconces. Incredible statues, many with magical auras and abilities are present. Additionally, there are storerooms as well.\nIt is an oddly designed area with various locked doors, hidden wall panels, trapped triggers, barriers and passages that must be explored. Some are optional, others must be solved. There are few clues given that make what to do obvious to the party. Each location within this level will need to be examined and explored in order to rule out what is needed and to find out what rewards and possibilities exist. For a first-time player, the best way to approach this dungeon level is to carefully explore everything before pressing onward.\nGameplay.\nThere is only one way into the dungeon to start with, and that is from &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%201\"&gt;level 1&lt;/a&gt; after solving the Head of the Builder riddle. The party enters this level down a descending staircase.\nEntry room.\nIn terms of what to do first, or which way to go - it doesn't really matter. The way the level will play out is that regardless of what the party explores, there will be times when retracing and backtracking is necessary. Doors can't be opened in some places until certain \"keys\" are obtained first. The party is going to find lots of &lt;a href=\"Mithral%20Token\"&gt;mithral tokens&lt;/a&gt; and won't know what to do with them, or if there are more to be found. Plus, there are lootable items throughout all areas and XP to be gained. And so, with that said, this walkthrough will just present information in a room-by-room format. Explore everything and leave no stone unturned.\nFrom the entry room, there are two paths that can be explored. Open one of two doors to the east. There is a northeastern leading door, and a southeastern door.\nThrough the door to the northeast.\nOpening the door presents a corridor leading east, which corners to the north and ends with another closed door. Nothing is found and no containers are available to examine in the corridor.\nThe Painting room.\nOpen the door to the north. Observed is a room with low illumination, just a light source to the right of the door inside a large rectangular chamber with tiled floor. A group of several &lt;a href=\"Yuan-ti\"&gt;Yuan-ti&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Yuan-ti%20Mage\"&gt;Yuan-ti Mage&lt;/a&gt; are seen and they will react to any detected party members in a hostile fashion. Enter the room or close the door and don't go in right now, the Yuan-ti won't be able to open the door and pursue.\nThe observant party member will recall that there were four large painted pictures on the North wall of this room spaced at regular intervals. They appeared to be creature heads of some type.\nIf desired, the party can enter the room and battle these creatures. If they are defeated, some loot can be collected from their corpses. \nExamining the painted wall panels on the northern wall a bit more closely, the party can identify a mind flayer, a troll, an umber hulk and a genie representation. There aren't any openings or secret doors found inside. This room is a dead end for now.\nOpen the southeastern door.\nBack to the entry room, open the door and go east into the passageway. Eventually the corridor corners south and leads on. If the party moves slowly enough or has a rogue with &lt;a href=\"Find%20Traps%20/%20Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;Find Traps / Detect Illusion&lt;/a&gt; enabled, then likely will be discovered two secret doors/wall panels. Try to open the one on the corner of the corridor. \nHorseshoe-shaped wheel chamber.\nThe door here is locked. Pick the lock or try to force the door, or perhaps attempt a &lt;a href=\"Knock\"&gt;Knock&lt;/a&gt; spell. Assuming the door was opened, the only object of note within is a pedestal or stand with a horseshoe shaped wheel-lever upon it. Examination of it with the inspection cursor displays:\nIf the wheel is interacted with again, a display says:\nIf the wheel turned yet again, the display says:\nBased on the audible creaking noise location, the source of this sound is just across the hallway (which is the other secret door detected). \nThe other secret door (on the corridor's western side).\nIf the party detects this secret door and tries to open it, it is clear that there is no normal method to do so. Something else is needed. If the horseshoe shaped wheel in the room just east of this door is activated, then the door may be opened.\nIf the door is opened, the party will observe a group of &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; creatures, who naturally are hostile. Dispatch these monsters and enter the connecting chamber to find a storeroom littered with stinky scraps, offal, dung, bones and general troll filth scattered amidst several storage containers. Some of these can be searched through, and potentially useful items can be collected. Retrieve whatever is desired.\nMove further east and south along the corridor ending with a closed-door facing east.\nStone edifice chamber.\nOpen the closed door leading east. Inside is observed an illuminated rectangular room. The pungent odor of sweat and musk is immediate. Closed doors are seen on the north and east walls. The center of the room has a large stone edifice, some kind of a slightly curved spire narrowing at the top. the floor has ornate decor and cut wall alcoves display various small statues.\nWithin this room are several hostile axe-wielding &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt; creatures. Put these beasts down and examine any containers for possible found items. \nPainting statues room.\nOpen the northern door to this room from the stone edifice chamber. Observed is an illuminated circular shaped room. The room's center is occupied with a stone cistern with water partially filling the interior. Three cut alcoves are present on the interior walls. Each alcove displays a statue.\nThe cistern seems to be a container. If inspected, several items are within that can be collected. Two unique items found are the &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20Horn\"&gt;Minotaur Horn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer%20Painting\"&gt;Mind Flayer Painting&lt;/a&gt;. That painting may be of use in the big room where the Yuant-ti's were found, plus the mind flayer painting seen on that room's north wall matches this piece of art found.\nThe statues on the wall can be examined. Place the toggle cursor over it and the following text is displayed:\nIf a party member decides to take the painting, then another message is displayed:\nEach statue that is individually activated will provide a specific single painting, to include the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Painting\"&gt;Troll Painting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk%20Painting\"&gt;Umber Hulk Painting&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Djinni%20Painting\"&gt;Djinni Painting&lt;/a&gt;. There are no clues provided as to which painting is assigned to a statue. The magical energy that casts a spell when the painting is bestowed will launch a &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Incendiary%20Cloud\"&gt;Incendiary Cloud&lt;/a&gt; or a modified &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; spell effect on the party member who receives the painting. Unfortunately, these are not traps that can be disarmed, just hostile spells. \nNow with all four paintings in the party's possession, they could return to the large rectangular Painting room with the corresponding wall paintings on the room's north wall. You suspect that these paintings could be key findings to open a passageway or other access to another sub-area in the labyrinth.\nReturn to the painting room.\nWith the Mind flayer, troll, Umber hulk and Djinni paintings in hand, return to the painting room. This was a dead end before, but with the paintings each corresponding wall portrait on the room's north wall can be opened. Simply touch the portrait with a party member to access what is behind each. Open them one at a time or more if desired.\nThe party will face a &lt;a href=\"Ulitharid\"&gt;Ulitharid&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Troll\"&gt;Spirit Troll&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;Umber Hulk&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Noble%20Djinni\"&gt;Noble Djinni&lt;/a&gt;. They will be hostile. A few of these creatures may be under invisibility to start with.\nOnly the Umber hulk wall panel reveals a passageway to the north. The other creatures were in closed cells. Note that both the Ulitharid and Spirit Troll drop an enchanted weapon.\nThe Passageway.\nAfter felling the Umber hulk, follow the passageway north and it corners to the east. A &lt;a href=\"Wolfwere\"&gt;Wolfwere&lt;/a&gt; pack might appear and attack any detected party member.\nFurther on a closed door to the south is seen, as well as another corridor that leads north and corners east, ending at an open Iron Door leading to a vault of some kind.\nThe Vault.\nWith an open armored iron door, the party can peer inside. A square room with a single light source is seen. A reinforced chest rests on the floor. Moving a bit closer the party observes three &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt; constructs standing dormant and facing the chest. The golems are immobile and neutral. They appear to detect the presence of the party but do not threaten or move.\nThe party can preemptively attack the golems if they wish. But, perhaps checking out the chest would be a better idea? What is inside?\nIf the party sends a member to open the chest, some intriguing treasure is seen, including a clearly magical bundle of string, some more of those odd mithral token coins as well as a stunning gemstone. Just opening the chest has not caused the golems to stir.\nThe party can take the items in the chest if they desire, possibly while being hidden or invisible. What the golems will do, if anything, cannot be accurately forecast, as there no clues given about why they are there. To be certain, they can be slain beforehand, or the treasure can be grabbed and see what transpires. Make plans accordingly.\nThe Storeroom.\nOpening the closed door leads to a storeroom with a few containers and a table. Seen inside is a hostile &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt; that will engage any detected party member. Beyond the storeroom leading south to short hallway connecting to another area, the Token machine room.\nToken Machine room.\nThe Token Machine can be found at the center of this octagonal shaped room. It is a splendid contraption, like something produced by the crafters of Gond.\nExamining the machine with the cursor reveals some dialogue text:\nReading the old board reveals:\nIt continues:\nA text display reads as follows if the machine is further interacted with:\nThe player must then select how many mithral tokens to place into the machine or can select \"Leave the machine for now to look for more tokens\".\nThere is a total of 21 tokens that can be acquired throughout the level. If the player wishes to insert some tokens, the choices are 5, 10, 15 or 20 tokens. Note that it is possible to receive multiple items, but impossible to receive the same item multiple times. See the &lt;a href=\"Token%20Machine\"&gt;Token Machine&lt;/a&gt; article for a detailed account about this most important machine.\nReturn to the Stone edifice chamber.\nIt's time to explore further and go through the eastern facing closed door in the Stone edifice chamber (where the minotaur monsters were encountered).\nInto the corridor.\nPass through the door to the adjoining corridor which leads eastward. It corners to the north, and a &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; rushes towards the sight of fresh manling flesh. The corridor ends with another closed door. Open and proceed north.\nChamber of orbs.\nEnter a square chamber, with elaborate decor. A circular mosaic symbol is inlaid in the floor's center (the symbol seems to be a theme in the asylum). Numerous statuettes are atop tall supporting pillars. The western and northern walls each mount unusual orbs upon stone shelving. The orbs glow slightly, casting warm illumination into the space. A passageway leads away from the chamber in a northern direction.\nIf a party member examines one of the orbs with a cursor, a text displays:\nArmed with this knowledge, a single or group of party members could stand upon the central mosaic, then another member could activate the globe, if so a text message reads:\nThe result of the energy is different for each of the four globes. No information or clues are provided in the game to know ahead of time what the energy might manifest. Only experimenting will reveal the effects. The party can be confident that any persons in the center area will likely be exposed to the effects. It's up to the player to decide to try out the globes or leave them be. It seems as though there is no limit to how many times the orbs can release this energy.\nWhen ready to proceed forward, take the corridor leading north.\nMinotaur statue room.\nThe next room is dominated by a statue of a minotaur. There are also a closed-door facing west, another on the north wall, and a corridor leading eastward.\nThere are two female &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Elder%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; and Bodhi ahead. Ideally, Gorion's Ward is the first party member to begin exploring this area. As promised, she has hunted down the party in the labyrinth. She will initiate dialogue with the Ward, which allows a selected reply, and ends with her and the two vampires attacking the bhaalspawn. Seconds later the first involuntary change of the bhaalspawn into the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt; takes place. \nThis form can't be controlled by the player, and it will attack Bhodi. When she is subsequently damaged to a predetermined threshold, this triggers more dialogue from her, and she and any surviving vampire allies change back into bats and speedily flee the map. Bodhi cannot be slain here, although it might be possible to destroy the elder vampires with some luck (they'll turn into a gas cloud and flee - awarding 10,500 XP each). \nAfter Bodhi flees, there is about three to five rounds remaining before the Slayer form ends and the Ward returns to a normal state. During that time the slayer will attack any party members it can reach. This can be quite deadly depending on the fragility of the particular party member.\nCertain core party members, especially Imoen, will have commentary about this Slayer change episode after it ends - she has some insight to share that goes all the back to studies in &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt;. If Imoen isn't in the party, then this will of course not be revealed.\nExamination of the minotaur statue in this room reveals the following text:\nPerhaps the party already has one of the minotaur horn items found in a previous area. Seems as though there might be another one somewhere.\nIt's now time to find out what's behind the two closed doors and explore that passageway to the east.\nExplore through the western facing door.\nOpen the door and enter a large room that stretches in a north-south direction. The room is well illuminated. A cistern with some water is directly ahead mounted on the west wall. Right away to the south can be seen a hostile minotaur. It will likely move towards any detected party member and engage with its head splitting battle axe. The cistern is also a container that has some potentially useful items within. Grab what is desired from here.\nTo the north is a passage that ends in a hollowed-out cavern. Seen ahead are another group of minotaurs and a free floating &lt;a href=\"Gauth\"&gt;Gauth&lt;/a&gt;, its eye stalks focused towards the party. Hey, guess what? They are not friendly, and attack.\nReturn to the Minotaur statue room and move down the eastern corridor, which takes a sharp turn and ends at a closed door.\nThe storeroom.\nOpen the doors and immediately see a group of minotaurs inside a square shaped room. A few clay storage urns are also present. Another fight will now take place. Examine the container in here and find a second minotaur horn. Also, some more mithral tokens are found. Did the party find them all? Maybe a final visit to the Token Machine is called for? This will be the last chance to do so in the saga.\nRestore the Minotaur statue.\nAssuming the party already has both minotaur horn items in their inventory, then interact with the non-horny statue - and a text displays:\nThe exit door on the north wall is now opened, and each party member receives .\nWith the way open, the party can transition to the next area when they are ready. What may lie ahead is &lt;a href=\"Kobold%20Room%20%28Spellhold%20Test%29\"&gt;unknown&lt;/a&gt;.\nTreasure.\nThe container locations correspond to the \"Notes\" selected on the InfoBox.\nBugs.\nAs of BG2EE 2.6, a door on this map has the wrong clickable area when opened. This is identified for correction in the pending Enhanced Edition Fix Pack (EEFP).\nMod content.\nMods:.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises all fightable creatures' scripting, so they act and behave smarter. Certain spell casting creatures will get better spell casting choices and preparatory \"previously cast\" buffs, as well as use of sequencers and the like.\nVampires may be improved with the mod's component that revises those creatures.\nTroll regeneration is revised, and spirit trolls will be tougher with their special innate spell powers. The Ulitharid will use the changes made for illithids, including more &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; powers scripted for use.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20for%20BG2\"&gt;Unfinished Business for BG2&lt;/a&gt; mod and the component \"\"Bodhi Hunts you in Spellhold\" makes some potential plot changes that were cut from the original game. The UB mod restores these elements."}

There are two methods of entry, and each changes the gameplay for the player.\nArea description.\nThe Spellhold main floor consists of a large open hall with connecting study and bed chamber. The study door is sealed against any intrusion. A text message will display if the door is examined: \"This door is completely covered in magical wards. Someone very powerful must want to keep this passage from being entered. There is no physical or magical way to open it at present.\" \nFurther on is a cellblock and is accessed from the main hall and ascending a staircase. A corridor connects to a Cellblock area. The block has five small cells with barred iron doors. Within each cell is a simple bed platform. There is a sixth room, a sort of large cell that also doubles as a lockable meeting or dining room. A banquet table and highbacked chairs are within. This chamber has decorative wall ornamentation.\nAt the end of the cellblock is a less austere room, titled as the \"Inmate Commons\". It has interesting wall decor, cushioned and bench style seating and a cozy fireplace.\nOn the map.\nThere are three Auto map markers in this area viewable on the player's menu. Coordinates below:\nGameplay.\nParty arrives by being committed to the asylum.\nIf the party managed to convince Pirate Lord &lt;a href=\"Desharik\"&gt;Desharik&lt;/a&gt; that they needed to be committed to the asylum (see &lt;a href=\"Getting%20inside%20the%20asylum\"&gt;Getting inside the asylum&lt;/a&gt;) then the player will observe a cinematic cut scene of the exterior of Spellhold, and afterwards, the party will next appear in the cellblock. An official named &lt;a href=\"Lonk%20the%20Sane\"&gt;Lonk the Sane&lt;/a&gt; addresses the party and announces:\nSome questions can be asked directed at Lonk, of various types, including who he is, where are Imoen and Irenicus and that sort of thing. All given answers are a bit vague, but at least you know both are present somewhere in the asylum.\nThe party is free to explore the cellblock and the Inmate Commons area. All doors exiting the area are fastened shut and are magically sealed. There is an opportunity to converse with each of the six other inmates as well as Imoen. Core party members will have interjections and commentary depending on who is being spoken with. Gain some insight into the strange world of the mentally unstable mages undergoing \"examinations\" here.\nAfter speaking with Imoen, who disappointingly seems not to remember any in the party, a short time after the dialogue is over (or when resting) then &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; will dimension door into the cell block and start a series of remarks and conversation. There is no chance to take any action during this process, and at the end of it a sleep gas is delivered upon the party members. This leads to a cut scene cinematic taking place in the basement laboratory area. &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; is trapped in a glass tube and various shadow thieves are also in similar tubes. A strange process is initiated that slays each thief, and the protagonist's bhaalspawn powers are removed, as well as the very essence of a soul.\nThe party reappears in &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%201\"&gt;The asylum maze&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; looking down upon the party from an elevated parapet and mocking all. Apparently, the party is to face the asylum maze with built-in challenges and tests, as well as being eventually hunted down for sport.\nParty arrives using the &lt;a href=\"Wardstone%20for%20Asylum\"&gt;Wardstone for Asylum&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntry by the party through the main door into the interior of spell hold is only possible if the wardstone is possessed. \nAs soon as the party enters the facility, the &lt;a href=\"Coordinator\"&gt;Coordinator&lt;/a&gt; initiates contact. See his page for details of what transpires.\nIf Yoshimo is a party member.\n&lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; has some plot actions in this area. When the &lt;a href=\"Coordinator\"&gt;Coordinator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; reveal that the party has actually been lured here with Imoen as bait - it will also be revealed that Yoshimo was not what he seemed, and for unknown reasons at this time, is seemingly allied to Irenicus. Much dialogue and party replies occur during this event. Eventually the party will be made helpless by a sleep gas - and Irenicus and Yoshimo are present in the Spellhold basement laboratory as &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; soul essence is drained. From now on, Yoshimo will no longer be a party member. \nAfter the Battle with Irenicus.\nThis area can later be fully explored after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20with%20Irenicus%20in%20Spellhold\"&gt;Battle with Irenicus in Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; encounter, and after speaking with &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt;. If the party agrees to Saemon's plan to use his ship to pursue Irenicus, then the party is transported outside the Asylum and a future time agreed to meet in Brynnlaw's &lt;a href=\"The%20Vulgar%20Monkey\"&gt;The Vulgar Monkey&lt;/a&gt;. Now free to move, the party can reenter the asylum and finish exploring the main floor.\nThe party can also delay speaking with Saemon by being invisible, and moving past him without initiating dialogue at this time - and can continue to the old Director's Study area and explore it. The door to the study will be unlocked now - When the door to the study in this area is opened, the party will face a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt; guardian. \nOnce that impediment is felled, there are containers in the office and bed chamber that can be examined for objects and items. Now go back and speak to Saemon in the corridor.\nIf the party killed Saemon earlier, then the only way out of Spellhold is by using &lt;a href=\"Jon%27s%20Key\"&gt;Jon's Key&lt;/a&gt; and taking the portal back on the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Basement\"&gt;Spellhold Basement&lt;/a&gt; floor. The door leading out of the asylum can't be opened once Saemon is dead.\nIf the party accepts Saemon's offer to help the party get off the island of Brynnlaw, then &lt;a href=\"Leaving%20the%20island\"&gt;Leaving the island&lt;/a&gt; questline is initiated.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod offers a component under the \"Tactical Challenges for BG2\" umbrella that is titled:\nParty's items are taken from them in Spellhold\nThis component does essentially what it says: when the party are captured in chapter 4, their equipment is taken from them, and they have to survive the labyrinth beneath Spellhold without it. A small amount of nonmagical equipment is available relatively quickly in the Asylum. Players (even solo players) might want to note that Imoen does carry the Enchanted Weapon spell.\nThe taken equipment (including bags of holding, ammo cases, gem bags etc.) is stored within the Spellhold Main floor locked study area and can be accessed later in this questline. Party items provided by other mods, such as unique equipment and weapons with mod-only .ITM file identifiers will probably not be removed by SCS. Normal game provided items typically will be removed from the party."}

{"id": "4212", "revid": "49135869", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4212", "title": "Spells (Baldur's Gate II)", "text": "Not every character can cast spells. There are two types of spells: &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; spells and &lt;a href=\"Priest%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; spells. Wizards (Mages, Sorcerers, and Bards) can cast wizard spells, while Priests (Clerics, Druids, Shamans, and high-level Rangers and Paladins) can cast priest spells. Spells are divided in spell levels, from spell level 1 to spell level 9 for wizard spells, and from spell level 1 to spell level 7 for priest spells. High level spells are usually more powerful than low level spells.\nMost spells belong to just one type: They are either wizard spells or priest spells. However, some spells belong to both types and therefore are available to both wizards and priests.\nTo cast spells, wizards and priests use spell slots, which can be filled with a memorized spell of a specific level and can only be used once. Spells assigned to slots are restored after resting.\nClerics, Druids, Rangers and Paladins automatically know all spells of the spell levels they have access to. Bards and Mages need to copy spells to their spellbook, which consumes scrolls. Shamans and Sorcerers select spells at levelup and only know those spells.\nWizard spells.\nWizard spells are generally more offensively focused than Priest spells, but they also include many supportive spells. Some typical uses of Wizard spells are inflicting magical damage, creating negative status effects, protecting the caster, conjuring creatures and removing curses. There are no healing Wizard spells.\nWizard spells can be used by &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s from class level 1. &lt;a href=\"bard\"&gt;Bards&lt;/a&gt; gain the ability to cast wizard spells when they reach level 2. New wizards start with only a few basic spells. Over time, Sorcerers learn new ones and Mages and Bards obtain spell scrolls to add to their magical knowledge. The minds of Mages can only comprehend a limited number of spells. The number of spells they can have in their books is limited by their Intelligence.\nMemorizing Spells.\nIn order to cast a spell, a wizard must first memorize it. A mage can only memorize spells that are written in his spellbook. If he wants to cast the same spell more than once, he must memorize it multiple times. After memorizing a spell he must rest to make the spell available for casting. After casting the spell, the Mage must rest before that spell can be cast again. Sorcerers do not need to memorize spells in order to cast them; they can cast any spell of any level for which they have spell slots remaining. When a Sorcerer\u2019s spell slots are depleted, they must rest to restore them.\nPriest spells.\nThe Priest spellbook has spells that heal wounds of allies, cure status effects, boost armor class, summon magical weapons, increase resistance to evil, magic and elements, inflict negative status effects, etc. It has both supportive and offensive spells, but it focuses more on support.\nPriest spells can be used by &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s from level 1. &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s can use them from level 8 and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s from level 9. The only class with full access to all priest spells is the multi-class &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Ranger\"&gt;cleric / ranger&lt;/a&gt;, though it is limited to level 1-3 druid spells in &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;s unless the option in &lt;a href=\"Console%23Activating_the_Console_4\"&gt;Baldur.lua&lt;/a&gt; is modified like so:\nSetPrivateProfileString('Game Options','Cleric Ranger Spells','0')\nWhen a priest gains access to a new level of spells, they immediately learn all the spells available in that level. This knowledge and the power of the spells themselves are bestowed by the priest\u2019s deity. Priests memorize spells just like Mages. The exception to this is the Shaman class, which chooses its known spells from the Druid list in the same way that Sorcerers do. Just like Sorcerers, Shamans don't need to memorize specific spells. They can cast any spell they know as long as they have available spell slots of the appropriate level.\nSchools of magic.\nSchools of magic are groups of similarly themed spells. All wizard and priest spells fall into one of nine schools:\nSchools of magic affect gameplay in several ways:\nSpell properties.\nRange.\nRange is the maximum distance from the caster, in feet, at which the spell can be targeted. 0 means that the spell targets the caster.\nDuration.\nThe duration of a spell is the amount of time its effects persist. Spells of instant duration come and go the moment they are cast, although the results of these spells may be permanent. Spells of permanent duration last until the effects are negated by some means, usually by a Dispel Magic spell. Some spells have a variable duration.\nCasting time.\nCasting time is the time it takes the caster to cast the spell. A spell can be interrupted if the caster takes damage while casting it.\nArea of effect.\nThe area of effect of a spell is the physical space that the effects of the spell affect, be it an area or a group of creatures. Some spells, such as Bless, affect the friends or the enemies of the caster. For those spells the term \u201cfriend\u201d or \u201cenemy\u201d refers to the caster\u2019s perspective at the time of casting. For instance, if a caster charms an enemy fighter and then casts Bless, which affects only friendly creatures, the charmed fighter benefits from the effects of Bless because at the time of casting he is considered a friend of the caster.\nSaving throw.\nSome spells allow their target to make a Saving Throw to negate or reduce the effects of the spell. The most common cases are:\nList of spells (Baldur's Gate II).\nThe spells in this table are alphabetically ordered. This list contains only the spells from the game without the expansion pack.

It removes all spell protections on the target at once, unless a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; is encountered first.\nWhen the spell is cast on a target, a spell removal animation graphic is played over the target, and a text message is displayed on the combat log reading: \"Spell Protections Removed\". This text appears even if the target had no spell protections present.\nA &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt; will block this spell, and then the shield will be consumed. \n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Abjuration&lt;/a&gt; will not block this spell, even though the Spellstrike is an abjuration school spell.\nA Spellstrike may be cast on a target who is invisible, sanctuaried or hidden.\nThis spell will bypass an illusionary protection such as &lt;a href=\"Reflected%20Image\"&gt;Reflected Image&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, even though the internal spell effects are not flagged to do so.\nCasting a Spellstrike on a neutral creature will turn them hostile, and perhaps others in the same vicinity.\nSpell protections removed by Spellstrike.\nExample 1: - An enemy mage is protected by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;. The party sorcerer casts Spellstrike at the mage. The Spellstrike is consumed by the Spell Shield, and the Spell Shield is now gone. All the other protections on the enemy mage remain active.\nExample 2: - Using the same scenario above, the party sorcerer follows up with a second Spellstike at the enemy mage. The Spellstrike removes the remaining four spell protections from the enemy all in one go.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset lists the level 9 Wizard spell \"Spellstrike\" as a very rare spell from the \"Forgotten Realms\" setting. Known to be in the tome, \"Unique Mageries\". The D&amp;D Pen and Paper spell version is quite different than the BG video game's iteration. For instance, spellstrike isn't an ultimate destroyer of spell protections, but instead a powerful spell that permits the caster to negate the effect of a spell cast in either the previous round or the round that the spellstrike is cast. It's a bit more complicated to use and has several exceptions. See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects, and description. See below:\nSpellstrike\nLevel: 9\nSchool: Abjuration\nRange: Long\nDuration: Special\nCasting Time: 5\nArea of Effect: 1 creature\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is cast, it will dispel all spell protections on the target. In addition, affected creature will suffer from 100% spell failure rate in the first round, followed by 50% spell failure in the second round. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.\nThe spell protection spells dispelled by Spellstrike are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, Mind Blank, and Spell Trap.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod allows a Spellstrike to take down the &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection From Magic&lt;/a&gt; scroll effect. High level arcane casters and liches are scripted to recognize the scroll's magic and attempt to remove if they have the Spellstrike spell available.\nWith the SCS Spellstrike can't target invisible or hidden creatures (with SCS or SR or both mods) without first exposing or revealing the target creature."}

But &lt;a href=\"Huge%20Spider\"&gt;Huge Spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tasloi\"&gt;Tasloi&lt;/a&gt;, and Ettercaps and Giant Spiders elsewhere respawn.\nConnections.\nThe entire eastern zone wall is a rocky escarpment and cannot be used to connect to or travel to other areas. The north edge is similarly impassable except in the north-western corner, although entry from the north brings you to a spot midway along the northern border.\nIn the one lands in the north western part and can exit north once &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Camp\"&gt;Bandit Camp&lt;/a&gt; is available.\nWeb traps.\nThese traps are exceedingly wide. Since characters can not walk in a completely straight line, if the &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt; is at one end of the trap and is directed to disarm the trap, they may set them off by walking to the central 'disarming point', even when Detect Traps is on and the traps have been detected and are displayed in red outline. Better to manually direct the character's movement to the center.\nEncounters.\nThe Ettercap has the scroll even before the party speaks with Fahrington; it looks like a Protection from Cold scroll.\nIf Edwin is in the party, Denak will then speak the following lines and the four will disappear; if not, the four will attack.\nRest may be disturbed by Giant Spiders.\nGameplay.\nOriginal BG1.\nThose seeking to farm the Phase Spiders and the like are out of luck; as the same is true of the &lt;a href=\"Cloakwood%23Second%20Cloakwood\"&gt;second Cloakwood&lt;/a&gt; forest, there is no way to farm them in BG1. This makes Wyverns in the &lt;a href=\"Cloakwood%23Fourth%20Cloakwood\"&gt;fourth Cloakwood&lt;/a&gt; forest not only the ultimate (because of the &lt;a href=\"Wyvern%20Head\"&gt;Wyvern Head&lt;/a&gt;s that can be sold to &lt;a href=\"Officer%20Vai\"&gt;Officer Vai&lt;/a&gt;), but the only high-XP farming opportunity, with few easier ways with which to prepare for them.\nEnhanced Edition.\nIn the enhanced edition farming experience is not much of an issue as one has access to providing several high level areas to visit. Though not advised for a new party, these areas can be visited as early as chapter one."}

They typically start out as completely invisible and remain unseen without special illusionary detection's. Once the creature has performed an overt action, such as an attack, then their appearance is akin to weak invisibility. As such, the creatures are difficult to target with spells and missile fire.\nThe Spirit Troll encountered in the Ust Natha Bazaar has the appearance of a \"typical\" troll and does not posses the ability to become invisible.\nGameplay.\nThey have an innate always on &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;improved invisibility&lt;/a&gt; effect.

For that reason, they cannot be struck by single target &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;. Attacks against the Spirit Troll creature suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the troll's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus. However, they become visible when they are unconscious. \nThese creatures strike with long sinewy limbs and sharp piercing claws that hit as +3 enchanted items and inflict 2d6+2 &lt;a href=\"piercing%20damage\"&gt;piercing damage&lt;/a&gt;, which is also modified by their above average strength. Any hit will drain 1 point of &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; with a duration of 300 seconds (5 Turns). This cannot be resisted and there is no saving throw. Multiple hits are additive to the strength loss - if reduced to zero strength the target creature will die. Additionally, the hit also reduces the target's current Hit Point modifier by 1d4 +2 (no damage resistance or &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; effect can block it).\nLike a normal troll, they regenerate damage at 1 HP per second. Upon being reduced to 1 hit point, they are rendered unconscious, which provides a brief span of time to permanently kill the creature by means of fire or acid damage, otherwise they rapidly regenerate and rise to fight again.\nLocation.\nDASPITRO:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Ust%20Natha\"&gt;Ust Natha&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Ust%20Natha%20Bazaar\"&gt;Ust Natha Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;\nPPTROLL1:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%203\"&gt;Bodhi's Hunt: Level 3&lt;/a&gt;\nTROLSI01:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Keep\"&gt;de'Arnise Keep&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;br&gt;\nCellar&lt;br&gt;\nFirst Floor&lt;br&gt;\nSecond Floor&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Druid%20Grove\"&gt;Druid Grove&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Mound\"&gt;Troll Mound&lt;/a&gt; \nSpellhold - Bodhi's Hunt: Level 3\n&lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Altar%20Level\"&gt;Level 1: Altar Level&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Level 4: Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Final%20Seal\"&gt;Level 5: Final Seal&lt;/a&gt; \nMod content.\nMods.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises the Spirit Troll.

But it also drew forth the evil that lies in Amn in some measure.\"\n\"Marek knew that he had been identified as our leader... and he set in motion the events that have led to you being here today.\"\n\"Marek established a hierarchy that would assume leadership after his passing. Then he established wards of enormous strength to protect the Grove from harm.\"\n\"Marek's strength and spirit came from a perfect understanding of the earth. This spirit could not be destroyed and has always been here in the Grove as a silent partner to Nature.\"\n\"Before his passing, Marek had a wife and child. When he knew that he must die for the Grove, he had them taken far away for their own protection.\"\n\"\"Now, as Marek knew would someday happen, his descendants have returned and old enemies marshall their forces. A child called &lt;a href=\"Loren\"&gt;Loren&lt;/a&gt; has recently arrived in &lt;a href=\"Trademeet\"&gt;Trademeet&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\n\"This child is the inheritor of Marek's spirit but does not yet have the knowledge to use his power. Surely he shall be slain by the forces of chaos if you do not rescue him.\"\n\"Even now he is alone and in danger, his parents slain by an evil that haunts him. You must find the child Loren in Trademeet and fight Marek's old enemies to save the child's life.\"\nThe Great Druid.\nFor this last task in the stronghold quest, the spirit will send out a &lt;a href=\"Druid%20%28Druid%20Grove%20Messenger%29\"&gt;Messenger&lt;/a&gt;, when the time comes, to call the protagonist back to the grove to challenge for the position of The Great Druid. Until then, the Spirit only has this to say, in parting:\n\"The Grove senses a dark destiny ahead of you, with much danger both moral and physical. For now your task is done in the Grove.\"\n\"Soon you may return to fight for ascension within the Grove. Until that day comes, I shall not call on you. Go forth and find the path of balance within your life.\"\n\"The danger to the Grove is passed, now, and Loren shall be taken to the Grove where he can begin to learn Nature's path. We shall await your return.\"\n\"May the forest always open a path, good druid. Farewell!\""}

As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it can be used to strike at any opponents within 20 feet, but the wielder does not receive the standard penalty for holding a ranged weapon when engaged in close combat. \nAt level 1, it functions as a magical weapon, dealing 1d8+1 points of &lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;Magical damage&lt;/a&gt;, with an enchantment bonus of +1. For every five experience levels of the spellcaster, this bonus increases by one, up to a total of +5 enchantment level, +5 to attack rolls, and +5 to damage for a 20th-level caster. Due to its ethereal nature, strength modifiers do not apply to attack rolls or damage, and attacks with the spiritual weapon are considered melee touch attacks (+4 attack roll bonus).\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Thrown%20Hammers\"&gt;Thrown Hammers&lt;/a&gt; mod can allow the cleric caster to toss the Spiritual Hammer.

This can be particularly useful for dual-wielding characters, as only the range of the mainhand weapon is considered in that case. So, for example, if a character wields this weapons along with a dagger in the offhand (range 1ft), they'll still be able to attack from range 2 (similar to a quarterstaff, that can, say, reach from behind another party member).\nThe above information is especially powerful for hit-and-run tactics and even more so when combined with a character who can lower the weapon's already-decent initial speed factor (2) down to 0 and/or gain additional attacks-per-round. Speed factor, extra attacks-per-round and range are all important considerations for characters trying to attack before their enemies and this weapon excels in two of those (but doesn't give any extra APR)."}

The weapon has three abilities: Thunderclap, &lt;a href=\"Call%20Lightning\"&gt;Call Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;.\nThunderclap is a passive ability with a 10% chance upon every hit of the staff in melee to stun the target for two rounds if a save vs. spells is failed. If the target does not save, a message of \"stunned\" will display. The thundercap effect can be blocked by magic resistance, but it is a &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;level 0&lt;/a&gt; effect, and thus ignores spell level protections and immunities, such as a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; has or the &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; spell provides. Additionally, the stun effect can be dispelled, although it only lasts 12 seconds. \nCall lightning deals 3d8 electrical damage for each of its 3 strikes (if there's only one enemy, the following strikes won't occur, just like with the regular spell), but, unlike the Druid's own Call Lightning, enemies get no save to cut the damage in half. The spell from the staff uses the projectile Call Lightning Chain-3, and is of the Invoker school offensive damage type. The spell can be blocked by magic resistance and has a spell power of 3. The lightning will bypass mirror image. Note: The staff's projectile Call lightning Chain 3 allows indoor use, but the Druid spell Call Lightning is tagged as outdoor use only, so you can use this ability anywhere in the game.\nLightning Bolt deals 10d6 points of electrical damage and it has a range of 140' and successful saving throws half the damage dealt. This ability is exactly the same as the mage spell and, consequently, will both provoke the ire of the Cowled Wizards and receive a save penalty if used by an &lt;a href=\"Invoker\"&gt;Invoker&lt;/a&gt; (who can use this staff by either dualing to a Cleric or to a &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt;).

It apparently needs a fix to make it not apply the knockback effect to large creatures.\nNotes.\nThis staff is probably the highest damaging weapon for &lt;a href=\"Thief%23Backstabbing\"&gt;backstabbing&lt;/a&gt;, similar to a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Striking\"&gt;Staff of Striking&lt;/a&gt; but more powerful and without use of charges.\nThere is a higher damaging &lt;a href=\"Shapechange\"&gt;Shapechange&lt;/a&gt; form that can outperform peak backstab damage from this staff, but from a wielded actual weapon viewpoint, the Staff of the Ram +6 is king of backstab damage potential.\nBugs.\nAs of BG2EE 2.6, The knockback effect of the Staff of the Ram +6 should not work on large creatures. This is identified and corrected in &lt;a href=\"The%20Enhanced%20Edition%20Fixpack%20%28EEFP%29\"&gt;The Enhanced Edition Fixpack (EEFP)&lt;/a&gt;. Ref: (staf22.itm)"}

Unlike unkitted rangers, stalkers are limited to wearing &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Leather%20Armor\"&gt;studded leather&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hide%20Armor\"&gt;hide armor&lt;/a&gt;. The armor restriction supplements backstabbing, as most metal armors disable the &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Hide in Shadows&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nApart from armor, stalkers have no other restrictions in terms of weapons and protective gear. Moreover, wielding does not interfere with the stealth ability.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt; can become stalkers. Stalkers have three prime requisites: &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wisdom\"&gt;Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nStalkers can dual-class to &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s, but a\u00a0Stalker/Cleric is restricted to and as the only weapons suitable for backstabbing. However, that is not really a disadvantage in \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II\"&gt;Baldur's Gate II&lt;/a&gt;\", when this dual is typically done, as two of that game's best backstabbing weapons are quarterstaves: &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Striking\"&gt;Staff of Striking&lt;/a&gt; very early and &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Ram\"&gt;Staff of the Ram&lt;/a&gt; later.\u00a0A Stalker/Cleric can also cast &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Magic\"&gt;Righteous Magic&lt;/a&gt; to maximize backstab damage, just as the &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Cleric / Thief&lt;/a&gt; can. \nIn the non-Enhanced version of \"Baldur's Gate II\", stalkers could not dual-class with Throne of Bhaal installed.\nIf the player character is a stalker and commits a murder, for example, they will become a Fallen Ranger, which is a ranger without the special abilities, and they will lose a lot of experience points. Regaining those abilities is only possible at the end of &lt;a href=\"Ranger-Protector%20of%20the%20Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Ranger-Protector of the Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt; , they can become normal stalkers once more.\nCharacter abilities table.\nNotes:\nSpecial abilities of the Stalker.\nStealth.\nRangers can hide in shadows if they wear leather armor, studded leather armor or no armor. Every ranger starts with 15% (not confirmed) modified by racial and dexterity bonuses at level 1 to successfully hide in shadows. Attempting to hide in shadows during the day or while not in shadows incurs a penalty to the hide check. Melee attacks receive a +4 to-hit bonus if performed while hidden. \nStalkers receive a flat 20% bonus to Move Silently and Hide In Shadows at character creation.\nBackstabbing.\nAll melee attacks from concealment receive a -4 bonus to &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;, but when Stalkers are invisible, either by Hide in Shadows or &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; means, they can also execute a &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;. The weapons suitable for backstabbing are limited to &lt;a href=\"fist\"&gt;fist&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"long%20swords\"&gt;long swords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"short%20swords\"&gt;short swords&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"scimitars%2C%20wakizashi%2C%20ninjat%C5%8Ds\"&gt;scimitars, wakizashi, ninjat\u014ds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clubs\"&gt;clubs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"quarterstaves\"&gt;quarterstaves&lt;/a&gt;. Backstabs inflict significantly more damage than a normal hit, but will break the Stalker's invisibility. Magical summoned melee weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Shillelagh\"&gt;Shillelagh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Blade\"&gt;Flame Blade&lt;/a&gt; can also be used as they are all within the stalker's melee weapon array.\nMoreover, the +4 damage that Stalkers get against their racial enemy is factored into backstab calculations (unlike the bonus from exception strength). So Stalkers can do 8-16 more damage (depending on the multiplier) against their racial enemies on a successful backstab.\nStalkers have a lower backstab multiplier than &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, getting capped at 4 times base damage at lvl 17:\nRacial enemy.\nStalkers tend to focus on a particular creature, having a +4 THAC0 and +4 damage versus their racial enemy. The player chooses one of the types of creatures listed below:\nCharm animal.\nRangers can charm animals to prevent fights or to gain advantages, starting at level 3.\n&lt;a href=\"Druid%23Druid%20spells\"&gt;Priest Spellbook&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt level 8, the priest spellbook unlocks for stalkers. They can use the following spells from that moment. The spells the stalkers are able to use are the same as a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;. They can learn up to level 3 spells. Their number of spells is determined by their level and is not affected by the Wisdom attribute score.\nBonus Spells.\nStarting at lvl 12, stalkers can cast three &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20spells%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;wizard spells&lt;/a&gt; as if they were level 3 &lt;a href=\"Druid%23Druid%20spells\"&gt;druid spells&lt;/a&gt;. Stalkers need to prepare the following spells in their spell book (at the level 3 spells page) in advance in order to be able to cast them:\nGameplay.\nStalkers take a unique niche between warriors and backstabbing thieves.\nThe main advantages of stalkers over thieves is their superior &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and ability to hold on their own in melee due to higher &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Dice\"&gt;hit points&lt;/a&gt;, greater APR and early access to protective and . However, stalker's backstab multiplier is worse than the thief's and comes nowhere close to the &lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;'s.\nThe only disadvantage of Stalkers when compared to other warrior classes is the inability to use metal armors.\n&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh level class abilities are added in expansion. For all warrior classes and Monks, the pool of abilities consist of abilities which can be accesses from the special abilities menu. These HLAs are available once they reach levels beyond 3,000,000 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;xp&lt;/a&gt;, exact level varies by class."}

Reading the Note, has the following text:\nThe eleven items (not including the Note) which are found in the chest are:\nGameplay.\nAlthough the note does not explicitly provide instructions of what to do, as it is a test of the inmate's mental faculties, the observant player may notice that each statue is posed in a position holding an empty bowl, as if ready to receive an item.\nAdditionally, if the player hovers the game cursor over an individual statue and interacts by clicking the \"question mark\" - then a text message will display a riddle. Each riddle is a clue as to what item best matches with the statue's riddle. \nAn item from the chest should be removed and taken into a party members inventory, and that member should transfer the item desired to the statue's bowl. \nIf all eleven items are correctly placed in each corresponding statue, a reward of 20,000 party shared XP is awarded, and within the chest is placed a &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Rose%20Ioun%20Stone\"&gt;Dusty Rose Ioun Stone&lt;/a&gt; and a special Sapphire Stone.\nIf you are having difficulty, and need assistance, see the &lt;a href=\"Solving%20the%20statues%20riddle\"&gt;Solving the statues riddle&lt;/a&gt; article.

{"id": "55574", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55574", "title": "Statues (WK Altar Level)", "text": "This page is to add a gateway link page to document the various \"Statues\" located on the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Altar%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Altar Level&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe statues are some kind of defensive ward put in place by the &lt;a href=\"Vigil%20Knight\"&gt;Vigil Knight&lt;/a&gt; organization. Perhaps the statues are actually volunteer creatures who will be spiritually recalled to arms if anyone attempts to open the portal to the lower reaches.\nGameplay.\nThe various statues are inert and can't be directly targeted or interacted with. This is by design. \nOnly after specific actions by the party on this dungeon level will the statues animate and turn hostile towards the party. These actions involve interacting with the Altar, and or placement and choices made regarding the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Book\"&gt;Holy Book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bell\"&gt;Bell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Candle\"&gt;Candle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe statues closest to the Altar animate as one group (2 to 4 statues) determined by the party's average experience. The remaining statues animate as a second group upon triggering another event by further action at the Altar, during the Holy Ritual. \nThe statues share a common set of attributes as shown in the InfoBox. For example, they all have an innate 40% &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and 50% &lt;a href=\"Slashing%20damage\"&gt;Slashing damage&lt;/a&gt; resistance. They are all 20 Hit dice creatures, and award if defeated.\nHowever, each statue also has individual attributes, weaponry, saving throws, perhaps some droppable equipment, different classes, maybe some spell casting abilities etc. The appearances (sprite type) assigned to the statue are mostly accurate, but some are deceiving, and although a statue foe may appear as a &lt;a href=\"Hobgoblin\"&gt;Hobgoblin&lt;/a&gt;, the statue's attacks can be unique, as well as it's stats.\nSetting traps, usually an effective tactic to deal damage to creatures that may spawn or activate - is mitigated and may not (probably won't) work against the statues. When the statues activate, there is a delay before they become non-statue forms. However, the traps will fire off before that, dealing no damage because the creatures still have their protective items. To use traps effectively, set them in an area further away from their statue form, and lead them into the traps. Good hunting adventurer!\nAbout the number of statues.\nThere will be at least 6 statues present in this level's main hallway leading to the Altar sector. There could be up to 12 statues present as well. The number is determined by the party's first visit to this dungeon and is tied to the party's average experience level. If the party has an average XP level equal to or greater than 14, then the full complement of statues will be here.\nIf the party has less than level 14 average experience, then there will probably be fewer statues. \nAs a reminder, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Garlena\"&gt;Sister Garlena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Odren\"&gt;Odren&lt;/a&gt; will warn the player to reconsider taking on their quest - if the script detects that &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; doesn't have at least 10 experience levels. This gentle reminder is for the player to consider returning when the party is more appropriately tested in battle.\nSo, expect fewer statues if entering this dungeon level when the party does not meet the level design criteria for difficulty, e.g., level 14. Any statues removed by the difficulty level script check are permanently gone from the game and won't be reinserted if the party comes back to the keep later with more experience. \nThis is one downside (depending on one's viewpoint) of entering the keep at lower experience levels. As much as 120K potential XP could be missing from the adventure. Probably more actually, as the random spawns in the dungeon are also generally less difficult and have fewer XP points offered when the player enters the keep under-leveled."}

{"id": "4321", "revid": "53053884", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4321", "title": "Stealth", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"thieves\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s can effectively become invisible by using their stealth ability, which is also known as the\u00a0\"Hide in Shadows\" ability. This ability differs from &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; in a few important ways:\nMechanics.\nThe stealth ability is governed by the Hide in Shadows and Move Silently skills. [In the original game, these two skills were represented by a single Stealth skill.] The starting value of these skills varies based on class, race and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. See the &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;Thieving Abilities&lt;/a&gt; article for more information.\nIn order for the stealth action icon to be enabled, the character must be wearing no armor, (, , ) or medium armor (, ), though the latter has a stealth penalty. If heavy armor is worn, the stealth button will be disabled. There are a few exceptions to the rule. Both &lt;a href=\"Corthala%20Family%20Armor\"&gt;Corthala Family Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mithral%20Chain%20Mail\"&gt;Mithral Chain Mail&lt;/a&gt; do not penalize stealth, acting like light armor despite being Chain Mails.\nWhen a character attempts to enter stealth mode, the first condition checked is whether the character can see any hostile enemies. If hostile enemies are present, the character will fail to enter stealth. What's relevant is whether or not the character sees the enemy, not whether the enemy sees the character. For example, if a &lt;a href=\"Mist%20Mephit\"&gt;Mist Mephit&lt;/a&gt; blinds\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; with a mist ball and that results\u00a0in her not being able to see the mephit (or any other enemies), she can immediately enter stealth, even though the mephit can surely still see her. &lt;a href=\"Shadowdancer\"&gt;Shadowdancer&lt;/a&gt;s have an improved version of the stealth\u00a0ability called\u00a0\"Hide in Plain Sight\", which allows them enter stealth whether they can see enemies or not.\nFirst, there is a check for critical failure. There is a 1% chance that stealth would fail. Any source of positive luck (&lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chant\"&gt;Chant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard Song&lt;/a&gt;) would eliminate critical failure.\nNext, the character's Hide in Shadows and Move Silently skills are averaged together and compared against the lighting at the spot where the character is standing. A character standing in shadow (or at night) has a better chance of succeeding than a character standing in light. If a character is standing in shadow, their sprite will be shaded. In darkness, the average value of both skills needs to be 100 to have 100% success chance. In light, it needs to be 200. E.g. a character with 100 in Hide in Shadows and 50 in Move Silently (average: 75) would have a 75% chance to hide successfully in darkness, but only 37.5% in light.\nIf these conditions pass, the character will effectively become invisible. If any condition fails, the character will have to wait one round (6 seconds) before a new attempt can be made. If the character is under a &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt;, this is reduced to 3 seconds.\nWhile invisible, a new skills check is made each round to determine if the character has successfully remained hidden. If the check fails, the character \"leaves the shadows\", slowly becoming visible again.\nLike normal &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, the character can freely move among most enemies without risking detection. Stealth will be broken if actions other than movement are performed, such as if the character:\nInterestingly, characters can often interact with devices without breaking stealth. Also, using a group action icon doesn't break stealth.\nIf stealth is broken by an aggressive action (such as setting a trap), the character immediately becomes visible. If stealth is broken by other means (such as opening a door or failing the skills check) the character has 2 rounds before they become\u00a0visible. During this time, characters can avoid detection by breaking line of sight with any nearby enemies.\u00a0Line of sight can be broken through movement, such as by rounding a corner, closing a door, or simply moving farther away\u00a0(making increased movement speed a very desirable effect). Detection can also be avoided by using a spell, potion, or magic item to become invisible, but the line of sight must still be broken before stealth can\u00a0be re-entered.\nNote that a character may appear to make a failed backstab attempt that doesn't break stealth. Such attacks are purely cosmetic and occur without an actual attack roll being made. These attacks can be turned off by enabling the\u00a0\"No\u00a0Cosmetic Attacks\" option on the feedback screen.\u00a0\nWhen a hidden or invisible character performs a melee attack, they receive a +4 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0bonus. This bonus is unrelated to &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;backstabbing&lt;/a&gt; and is therefore awarded regardless of the attacker's class, position relative to the target, or type of melee weapon used. No bonus is awarded for ranged attacks.\nRelated items.\nStealth boosting.\nThe following items offer a bonus to either the \"Hide in Shadows\" or \"Move Silently\" skills.\nAC boosting.\nThe following armors offer improved armor class options for stealthy characters but with a stealth penalty.\nImproved versions of the &lt;a href=\"Hide%20Armor\"&gt;Hide Armor&lt;/a&gt; (+1, +2 and +3) were introduced by , but are not available to players."}

It also has two innate ability attacks. \nThe mephit will initiate the &lt;a href=\"Boiling%20Rain%20Storm\"&gt;Boiling Rain Storm&lt;/a&gt; ability as its first action when an enemy is detected and in range. The rain is described as:\nNote that this storm has an area of effect, and enemies within will be potentially exposed to the effects. However, magic resistance can block it, and it has level 2 spell power, so a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; could also shield the exposed character from harm.\nA 12 second delay will take place, and the mephit may attack in melee combat during this period. Once the delay has transpired, the mephit will launch its &lt;a href=\"Water%20Jet\"&gt;Water Jet&lt;/a&gt; attack, described as:\nThe Water Jet is fires cone shaped projectile at a single target in range, but it has an area of effect (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt; spell) that can also apply the detrimental Jet to any enemies in that cone shaped area. A &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; vs. Breath will negate the &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; effect, but not the fire damage.\nIf the target fails the saving throw the affected creature will be &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stunned&lt;/a&gt; and display a \"Stun\" icon on their portrait and be &lt;a href=\"Helpless\"&gt;Helpless&lt;/a&gt; for 1 round. Additionally, the victim will also suffer 1d3 fire damage. As the water jet has the equivalent of 2 spell power, a spell protection such as &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; or similar will stop it, as well as &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Steam Mephit has no magic, or physical damage resistance. It does however have immunity to fire damage.\nThe InfoBox summarizes the creature's special abilities and immunities to certain status effects. The game has the creature with a memorized &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt; spell but it isn't scripted to use it, so it is probably just a developer creature file copy-paste remnant."}

Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. A dispel magic will temporarily remove the nausea from a particular character, but they will continue to be subjected to the spell\u2019s effects so long as they remain within the cloud.

One skin is gained for every two levels of the caster. For example, a 10th level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th level wizard would receive 10. For each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against him, but the sixth would affect him normally. The skins will remain on the wizard until he is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.\nIt is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any area attacks (such as Fireball), and that any weapon capable of inflicting some type of elemental damage can still harm the caster - the skins will not protect against fire, cold, acid, or electrical damage, even if physical damage is blocked. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative."}

The &lt;a href=\"Clinic\"&gt;Clinic&lt;/a&gt; is on its right and the &lt;a href=\"Bunkhouse\"&gt;Bunkhouse&lt;/a&gt; is located sorta kitty-corner across and to the left of it. It's the only building on the map that's not marked.\nThe building is accessible by a &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; without a &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt;, and only by invitation of the &lt;a href=\"Gatewarden\"&gt;Gatewarden&lt;/a&gt;, who \u2013 on &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt;'s behalf \u2013 offers a lesson in \"the finer arts o' mass combat.\"\nInvolvement.\nIf you choose to accept the &lt;a href=\"Gatewarden\"&gt;Gatewarden&lt;/a&gt;'s offer, you will be led to the Storage Cellars and meet up with &lt;a href=\"Obe\"&gt;Obe&lt;/a&gt; after entering.\nHere you will be given temporary control over 5 companions, giving you a full party of 6 to lead.\n&lt;a href=\"Obe\"&gt;Obe&lt;/a&gt; the illusionist will create harmless monsters for you to practice fighting against. Every few turns he will interrupt and ask if you wish to continue; at this point you can choose to stop training and leave the cellars.\nAfter a 10 turns he will teleport you back out without asking. Obe's excuse is that his illusions begin to get real if he's been conjuring for too long without a break.\nThe monsters spawns as as follow: &lt;a href=\"Gibberling\"&gt;Gibberling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xvart\"&gt;Xvart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kobold\"&gt;Kobold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tasloi\"&gt;Tasloi&lt;/a&gt; and then 5 tuns of &lt;a href=\"Hobgoblin%20%28archer%29\"&gt;Hobgoblin archers&lt;/a&gt;. Obe will describe each monster a little before spawning them, except the Hobgoblins for which he gives the generic information. All the spawns contain 6 monsters each. When your characters stand in proximity of Obe, he may spawn new monsters before the others are killed or finish the exam before killing the last wave \u2013 however, you can move your party away to avoid the extra spawns if you wish to kill the monsters at your own pace, especially on higher difficulties when their HP are boosted.\nThis exercise bears no material rewards but helps you to understand how to make multiple players work as a team when fighting monsters \u2013 all the items temporary party have in their inventory are being taken away when leaving. The illusions do not drop any items and the chests contain no items. However, you can open the two closed chests with &lt;a href=\"Deder\"&gt;Deder&lt;/a&gt;'s (or &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward's&lt;/a&gt;) thieving ability for extra XP in \u2013 you can remove other party members and make sure Gorion's Ward portrait stays on top if keeping Deder for maximum gains). In the &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;original game&lt;/a&gt; killing each illusions nets 1 XP, but in the Enhanced Edition they give none. However, killing them still counts for \"Number of kills\" counter and up to 60 kills can be gained toward the &lt;a href=\"Achievements%23Murder%20Incarnate%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%201%29\"&gt;Murder Incarnate achievement&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile you can not take anything away, make sure you don't leave any items you brought inside your temporary party members' inventory, as these items will be lost permanently. Consumed items brought won't be restored as well. Brought metal weapons can break here as well and damage inflicted on Gorion's Ward will stay, although it's only possible to incur damage via party's own attacks.\nIt is also possible to heal any wounds that may be suffered before by using &lt;a href=\"Canderous\"&gt;Canderous&lt;/a&gt;'s special ability or healing potion from Deder's inventory. Canderous' &lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Protection From Evil&lt;/a&gt; casted on Gorion's Ward before leaving the area will also persist, and so will the effect of Oil of Speed which may be handy to steal items from the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Inn\"&gt;Candlekeep Inn&lt;/a&gt; and escaping before guards appear. You can also use other member's high lore or &lt;a href=\"Mordaine\"&gt;Mordaine's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Identify%20%28spell%29\"&gt;identify spell&lt;/a&gt; to identify items (such as &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20%2B1\"&gt;Dagger +1&lt;/a&gt;, a possible reward from &lt;a href=\"An%20Errand%20for%20Fuller\"&gt;An Errand for Fuller&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe items temporary members carry are of different type than the regular one, that's why they are always lost when brought to Gorion's Ward inventory and why the weapons don't break. This also make brought stackable items such as &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arrows\"&gt;Arrows&lt;/a&gt; don't stack together with the items found in temporary party inventories.\nTemporary Party.\nThe party that you temporarily take control of consists of 5 companions: &lt;a href=\"Arkanis\"&gt;Arkanis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canderous\"&gt;Canderous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osprey\"&gt;Osprey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mordaine\"&gt;Mordaine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deder\"&gt;Deder&lt;/a&gt;. They all have items and spells of their own. You can only use party's memorized spells, as there's no way to rest inside. None of these characters have a biography filled in, too.\nYou cannot bring any of the items from these characters' inventory outside the Storage Cellars."}

It also determines weight capability and &lt;a href=\"%23Requirements%20for%20equipment\"&gt;which equipment a character may wield&lt;/a&gt;, plus the ability to &lt;a href=\"%23Bashing\"&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt; doors or chests, though not as effective as a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Open%20Locks\"&gt;Open Locks&lt;/a&gt; skill. High strength will also give additional options in certain dialogs. Some enemies can also inflict strength drain on hit, which not only weakens characters but also kills anyone who gets drained down to 0, so higher values help protect against this effect.\nExceptional strength.\nExcept for &lt;a href=\"halfling\"&gt;halfling&lt;/a&gt;s, all &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; get an \"exceptional strength\" bonus when having a strength of eighteen. This is shown as percentage behind the 18 and a slash, where \"00\" stands for 100%. The bonus is rolled together with the other scores during &lt;a href=\"character%20generation\"&gt;character generation&lt;/a&gt; and will not change when de- and increasing strength by adding or subtracting points repeatedly. Exceptional strength gives bonuses beyond those for a non- or halfling-warrior's regular eighteen, within certain ranges; according rows in the table to the right are marked with a different color. The &lt;a href=\"wizard%20spell\"&gt;wizard spell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; will set the non- and halfling-warriors' strength to 18/50, while adding 50% to an already present exceptional strength bonus, though not beyond 18/00. &lt;a href=\"Half-orc\"&gt;Half-orcs&lt;/a&gt; of any class (not just warriors) can start the game with 19 strength if they spend enough points at character creation.\nBashing.\nBashing allows a strong character to open a locked door or chest by force-attacking it. Bashing uses the same formula as the &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;'s Open Lock and Disarm Traps skills: Skill points - 1 + 1d10 &gt; Difficulty. Therefore, by adding 8 to the bashing skill (found on the table to the right) one can determine the maximum difficulty lock that can be bashed by a particular character.\nWith a strength of 25, which can be achieved by e.g. &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;turning into the Slayer&lt;/a&gt;, the maximum difficulty lock that can be bashed will be 88 (80 bashing skill + 8), which covers the vast majority of locks in BG2EE (where most of the important locks, that prevent access to great treasure, are difficulty 80). Also, it doesn't yield &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, as a thief might gain by picking the lock.\nRequirements for equipment.\nThe tables show values for the base versions of the &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s; enchanted or otherwise special variants of them may differ.\nScore altering.\nA permanent increase of strength may be acquired via following methods:\nIf a character with exceptional strength (18/xx) gets a strength increase of +1, they always go to 19, no matter if they started with 18, 18/01 or 18/99.\nMany &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; and , as well as &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, grant temporary bonuses or penalties to strength; in case of wearable equipment often \"permanent\" in terms of \"as long as being equipped.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nn &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Strength\"&gt;Champion's Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Power\"&gt;Holy Power&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strength%20of%20One\"&gt;Strength of One&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Mazzy's ability&lt;/a&gt;, set the score to a specific value, which may result in a reduction if the target's natural strength is higher than that value.\nPotions.\n&lt;a href=\"Potions\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt; temporarily set the score to a specific value, rather than applying a bonus or penalty. Except for the basic Potion of Strength, they all can only be used by &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment.\nSome equipment sets strength to a specific value, possibly causing a reduction if it is actually higher than that; on the other hand, this protects from strength-draining effects. On the other hand, some equipment increases strength by a specific value, which can be added on top of any effect that sets strength."}

It has its own Race and Class but shares similarities with the &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; race. \nYou may encounter it in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Dungeons\"&gt;Southern Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Help%20Korgan%20Recover%20the%20Book%20of%20Kaza\"&gt;Help Korgan Recover the Book of Kaza&lt;/a&gt; quest. The creature's game file name is linked to the Lich &lt;a href=\"Nevaziah\"&gt;Nevaziah&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt uses the male vampire animation, can be struck with normal weapons, has no elemental resistance except vs. &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and conducts a potent &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; melee attack. \nGame Play.\nAs the creature shares many similarities with the Vampire, including the vampire abilities, melee attack and the most common vampire AI script - from a game play perspective they are almost identical. They will fight with their touch attack (with 3 &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt;) and attempt &lt;a href=\"Domination%20%28Innate%29\"&gt;Vampire Domination&lt;/a&gt; innate ability at available targets in range. When reduced to zero Hit points the creature goes into \"Gas Cloud Form\" and flees the battlefield. They have a rather low XP reward of 2,000 and carry no droppable items.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; makes many changes to this creature. The Hit Dice are decreased to 13, has 100 HP, 20 strength and dexterity and 19 constitution. Improved THAC0 and Armor Class is realized. It has the standard vampire cold and electricity damage resistance. The creature is also assigned the \"Improved Vampires\" default AI script. In addition, it now requires +2 enchanted weapons to hit it. It will now behave in similar fashion to a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Elder%29\"&gt;Vampire (Elder)&lt;/a&gt;. However, it still provides only 2,000 XP if defeated.\nLore.\nVampyres are a race of predators from the &lt;a href=\"%3Aw%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3ARavenloft\"&gt;Ravenloft campaign setting&lt;/a&gt; for Dungeons and Dragons. Unlike the one undead \"named\" Vampyre found in Baldur's Gate II, actual vampyres are living pack creatures that do not possess the strengths or weaknesses that vampirism and undeath provide. They look like normal humans or &lt;a href=\"half-elves\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the time they keep to themselves in human-like homes, living in packs no larger than a dozen members, and hunt humanoids to feed on their blood. On rare occasions, they blend in human communities and keep their predatory nature a secret."}

She can be recruited into the party here, for the loss of two &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; points. If not recruited or dismissed, she can be found within the &lt;a href=\"Coalition%20Camp\"&gt;Coalition Camp&lt;/a&gt;, where she can be re-recruited.\nRecruitment.\nViconia DeVir is available to recruit from &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%202\"&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;. She can be found in &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Government%20District\"&gt;Government District&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"The%20Prison\"&gt;The Prison&lt;/a&gt;, where she must be rescued from followers of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beshaba\"&gt;Beshaba&lt;/a&gt;, who want to burn her on a stake. If you try to rescue her, this will provoke the followers to attack your party.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Drow\"&gt;Drow&lt;/a&gt; have gained extreme notoriety in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Realms\"&gt;Forgotten Realms&lt;/a&gt;, recruiting Viconia reduces the party's &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; by 2. This reputation loss is regained as soon as she is removed from the group.\nIf she is removed from the party, she can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, near the far entrance of &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi's&lt;/a&gt; lair.\nIn she will be level 8, trained in Mace, Sling, Sword and Shield Style, and War Hammer.\nRelationships.\nAlignment Change\nIt is possible to change Viconia's alignment from Neutral Evil to True Neutral. This is a long process that is only possible when romancing Viconia. A general guide follows:\nKind but assertive:\nViconia will frequently have outbursts towards you and occasionally lie to you, either to hide her insecurities and weaknesses or to try to push you away (as she has been hurt too often by people from the surface to think your intentions are truly kind &amp; innocent). Always treat her with respect and kindness but with occasional Assertiveness when needed.\nDon't rush:\nAt some point Viconia will feel scared and ask to stay the night with you, as much as she may push it, don't take this opportunity if you wish to successfully change her alignment (but do so kindly). After this, you can spend the night with her in the following opportunities in the future.\nDon't Panic\nTowards the end of Shadows of Amn, Viconia will break up the relationship, claiming it will never work. Don't panic, you can continue the romance in Throne of Bhaal, where early on Viconia will give it another chance, just convince her to stay with your party...\nCompleting the change:\nIf you did things correctly, in Throne of Bhaal, at about the time you reach Amkethran (Chapter 9) Viconia will remark about how you keep changing as you chase your destiny and ask if you want her to try to change, to care more about life. If you say you do wish her to try and change, her alignment will change to True Neutral.\nGameplay.\nIn Baldur's Gate 2, her &lt;a href=\"wisdom\"&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt; has been improved by three points and her magic resistance has increased to 65%.\nBeing an evil &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt; her &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; allows her to control almost any undead type (eg. liches and vampires at higher levels). This can be exploited by using the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; spell and/or by casting &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; on her, and then positioning her near enemy undead groups. Note that her Turn Undead will also affect good-aligned paladins, however, including &lt;a href=\"Keldorn\"&gt;Keldorn&lt;/a&gt;. This can be prevented with effects and spells like &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Fear\"&gt;Remove Fear&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; score of 10 prevents her from wearing most heavy armor (with few notable exceptions, like the lightweight &lt;a href=\"Ankheg%20Plate%20Mail\"&gt;Ankheg Plate Mail&lt;/a&gt;) but this problem can be solved by using strength-boosting effects and equipment such as Draw Upon Holy Might, the &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20Takkok\"&gt;Gauntlets of Ogre Power&lt;/a&gt;, The Mauler's Arm and &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Potions of Strength&lt;/a&gt;. Her &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;AC&lt;/a&gt; can reach high values due to her high base &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; score, cleric class access to heavy armor, shields and AC/dexterity-boosting cleric buffs.\nHer maximum &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Dice\"&gt;Hit Points&lt;/a&gt; are rather low due to her being a single class cleric and she receives no bonus from &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, despite her potentially high AC and despite the presence of Hit Point-boosting equipment such as the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Helm of Balduran&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Girdle%20of%20Fortitude\"&gt;Girdle of Fortitude&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Green%20Ioun%20Stone\"&gt;Pale Green Ioun Stone&lt;/a&gt; the lack of powerful divine-based defensive spells (in contrast to arcane-based versions like Stoneskin and Mirror Image) can limit Viconia's combat effectiveness. Stat-boosting spells like &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might&lt;/a&gt; and Energy Blades are very useful for when Viconia joins a fight.\nDue to her limitations players usually relegate Viconia to the back row, buffing and healing allies and using her sling and spells from afar; although the combination of her high AC, Magic Resistance and priest buffs/offensive spells like Blade Barrier can allow her to make occasional and brief forays into melee or even tank enemy spells.\nPersonality.\nIn general, Viconia tends to be arrogant, cruel and spiteful. Having once been a &lt;a href=\"drow\"&gt;drow&lt;/a&gt; priestess she values strength and ambition, and sees compassion as a weakness. Occasionally, however, she will display a slightly less vicious side of her personality - she can be introspective, even vulnerable, when she thinks she is alone or when confronted by a firm yet honorable and sympathetic player character.\nIf &lt;a href=\"romance\"&gt;romance&lt;/a&gt;d, Viconia will (depending on the player's responses) vacillate between venomous hostility, quiet contemplation and fear of her former goddess, &lt;a href=\"Lolth\"&gt;Lolth&lt;/a&gt;. The good/neutral route of her romance also puts a tremendous strain on her relationship with the player, with little to no resolution until very late in the game.\nEpilogues.\nViconia has two official epilogues if you complete the final quest of Throne of Bhaal with her present in your party.\nIn her default Epilogue, Viconia moves on with her own adventures after parting ways with Gorion's Ward. She founds a short-lived Sharite cult under her command in Waterdeep, only to slaughter them all when they betray her, shrugging off the chastisement of her goddess. She stops an attempt by the Knights of the Shield to take over Calimport, and then assists Drizzt Do'Urden in saving the elven city of Suldanessalar from a Zhentarim plot, for which she receives the highest honor of the Seldarine from Queen Ellesime. She reportedly takes this unprecedented honor stoically, and then leaves; her movements thereafter are lost to history.\nIf Gorion's Ward completed Viconia's Romance and chooses not to embrace godhood, the two lovers continue adventuring together until they decide to settle down, with Gorion's Ward becoming an important political figure. They marry and have a half-drow son together, but after several years, Viconia is assassinated by an agent of Lolth - the Ascension mod contains an expanded version of this epilogue stating that this was achieved through the use of venom taken from Lolth's own fangs. Unable to resurrect his wife, Gorion's Ward sadly raises their son on his own, disappearing into the pages of myth - some say they go on to crusade against the drow, but none know the truth."}

It allows to increase a creature's thieving ability of choice for a short time.\nb) Portraits for Viconia:\nThis component allows you to change Viconia's portrait. Picking one of those also changes her major and minor colors to make them match the new portrait. Existing portrait options:\n- BG1 Viconia portrait for SoD, BG2, BGT, EET\n- BG2 Viconia portrait for BG1, Tutu, BGT, EET\n- SoD Viconia portrait for BG1, BG2, BGT, Tutu, EET\n- \"Drowified\" BG1 Viconia portrait for any game (by Sanctifer with small tweak by Lava Del'Vortel)\n- Recolored BG2 Viconia portrait for all games\n- Restored BG2 Demo Viconia portrait for all games in BG1 style and BG2 style (base found Parys, reworked by lolien, bob_veng and Lava Del'Vortel)\nc) Add special ability: Embrace of Shar\nThis component gives Viconia a new innate ability - Embrace of Shar - that can turn party members invisible and blind nearby foes for a short duration.\nd) Apply drow penalty: Day Blindness\nThis component adds a penalty for keeping Viconia in daylight. If outside during the day, she will receive a -2 penalty to dexterity and THAC0 as well as a -1 penalty to all saving throws. The penalty is dispelled during the night or at indoor areas.\nFor more information see the link."}

If drawn into the material realm, he lectures the player on the folly of summoning powerful extraplanar beings, and then offers them the chance to gain a magical item if they can answer his riddle.\nIf correct answer is chosen or &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Odesseiron\"&gt;Edwin&lt;/a&gt; are asked to answer, he rewards the party with the &lt;a href=\"Modron%20Heart\"&gt;Modron Heart&lt;/a&gt; and then teleports away. If riddle is failed, he will attack.\nCombat.\nThis is an incredibly difficult fight. Upon combat beginning, his &lt;a href=\"Contingency\"&gt;Contingency&lt;/a&gt; will trigger a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; spell, which will generally give him time to get off his &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, which combined with natural non-magical immunity to normal weapons and spells of 7th level or less, makes him essentially invulnerable for 4 rounds, barring a successful &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, he will cast &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt;, with a better than average chance of also hitting &lt;a href=\"Gurgle\"&gt;Gurgle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Floss\"&gt;Floss&lt;/a&gt;, if they are still alive. He also has a &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and additional Stoneskin for defense.\nOnce reduced to half health, he will stop hostility, drop the Modron Heart, award , and then nearly instantly teleport away. While it is technically possible for a party with sufficiently high damage output can kill him before the teleport, it is fairly unlikely. Still, if accomplished, he will drop two additional items on death; a Scroll of &lt;a href=\"Protection%20from%20Magic\"&gt;Protection from Magic&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Scimitar%20%2B3\"&gt;Scimitar +3&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis spell immunity does not include from items such as Potion of Fire Breath, The Victor (ring) or Screaming Bagpipes (he is easily killed with several Potions of Fire Breath).\nTechnical notes.\nThe creature starts out with the &lt;a href=\"BDSPECTQ.ITM%20%28Invisible%29\"&gt;BDSPECTQ.ITM (Invisible)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"BDMISC1B.ITM%20%28Invulnerable%29\"&gt;BDMISC1B.ITM (Invulnerable)&lt;/a&gt;, which act to make it immune to nearly all actions, as well as give it the ghostly visual effect. When the Spectacles of Spectacle are used on it, both are destroyed."}

A series of dialogue selections and choices will determine the outcome of the offer. Should the party obtain the magical rope the understanding is that this will allow entry to &lt;a href=\"Deirex%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Deirex's Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party turns down Visaj's offer, he will say that if you change your mind to speak with him again - and Visaj just remains in this spot.\nVisaj is the initiator of getting that side quest &lt;a href=\"Intrigue%20with%20Jarlaxle\"&gt;Intrigue with Jarlaxle&lt;/a&gt; underway, but it won't progress any further unless the party obtains the rope, and then enters the tower. More information about this is on the &lt;a href=\"Intrigue%20with%20Jarlaxle\"&gt;Intrigue with Jarlaxle&lt;/a&gt; article. \nShould the party decide that attacking Visaj is something desired, note that this can certainly occur. If he's attacked before he initiates dialogue then Visaj will become hostile, as will the entire drow city. Likewise, if he's attacked after the party declines his offer to buy the rope, the same thing will happen.\nHowever, if the party attacks Visaj after obtaining the rope, then he won't turn hostile, and the city remains passive. After the party obtains the rope, Visaj walks away from the party and will eventually leave the map. During that period, he can be killed. \nOddly enough, if Visaj is killed - he'll still appear again with Jarlaxle later. No mention of his being killed will even be brought up in dialogue. This seems very bizarre indeed.\nIf the party elects to attack Visaj and Jarlaxle later in the Intrigue with Jaraxle quest, then the mage will defend himself and participate in battle using his spells."}

Should the character lose the draw, then Aesgareth will collect on the wager, and the cambion's dialogue script implements a spell upon the character.\nThe spell manifests over the party member, with a lighting and sound effect, as well as a text displayed on the combat log reading \"Vitality Drain\".\nThe spell strips away 10% of the character's maximum HP modifier, permanently.\nFor example, if the character had a maximum HP value of 120, then this spell reduces it by 10%, or in this example, -12 HP. The new maximum HP modifier will be 108.\nThe second effect of this spell is that Aesgareth absorbs this vitality, and the fiend's maximum HP modifier is raised by 20. For example, Aesgareth has 150 HP. After this spell the cambion's HP is raised to 170, permanently.\nTake note that the maximum HP modifier change on a character doesn't do any immediate reduction to HP. However, damage incurred later and then subsequent healing/regeneration will reveal that the maximum HP ceiling has been lowered. \nThe spell is unaffected by &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, as the spell is of the Necromancy School, it can be blocked by the appropriate &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt; can also block it, as the spell is of the &lt;a href=\"Offensive%20damage%20type\"&gt;Offensive damage type&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd finally, a spell protection may work as well, such as &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;, as the internal spell effect components have a 9 &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;Power level&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player will know if any of those defensive measures work, as the combat log will display \"Spell Ineffective\" if it is neutered."}

First, the mage specialty kit may be changed an Invoker (or Conjurer, Enchanter or Necromancer - its random), with some different spells memorized, and a new default SCS script is assigned. \nInstallation of the \"Smarter Mages\" component, which is reactive to the game difficulty setting will determine if Vithal can use any of the Mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; he is assigned, including &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Dragon's Breath (spell)&lt;/a&gt;. Also, contingencies, spell triggers and sequencers are pre-loaded and will be used for near instant deployment of buffs and attacks. Vithal receives 1-point quarterstaff weapon proficiency.

Even though he is traveling with Jaheira, the game doesn't require you to bring both of them along at the same time.\nGameplay.\nVoghiln is a versatile party member whose stats allow him to play many roles on the battlefield. By default he is equipped with &lt;a href=\"Voghiln%27s%20Helmet\"&gt;Voghiln's Helmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20of%20Defense%20AC%206\"&gt;Bracers of Defense AC 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"War%20Hammer%20%2B1\"&gt;Warhammer +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buckler\"&gt;Buckler +1&lt;/a&gt;, 40 &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Axe\"&gt;Throwing Axes +1&lt;/a&gt;, and 40 &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Axe\"&gt;Throwing Axe&lt;/a&gt;s.

As a bard, he is the only recruitable party member who can use bard-only magic items and equipment like musical instruments. His Skald Song gives every party member in reach +2 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;to-hit&lt;/a&gt;, +2 dmg and +2 &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;AC&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a Skald, he has excellent &lt;a href=\"Lore\"&gt;Lore&lt;/a&gt; progression, making him perfect for identifying magic items on the cheap, but pitiful pickpocketing, to the point where it hardly matters what his Dexterity is. If you need him to pickpocket a target, give him at least one &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Master%20Thievery\"&gt;Potion of Master Thievery&lt;/a&gt; to drink first. His Charisma is low for a Bard but can be boosted by the &lt;a href=\"Friends\"&gt;Friends&lt;/a&gt; spell, whether by casting from his spell book or &lt;a href=\"Brevin%27s%20Quarterstaff\"&gt;Brevin's Quarterstaff&lt;/a&gt; as a charge ability, making him an excellent party leader when shopping.\nRecommended equipment: \nHis initial &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20proficiency\"&gt;weapon proficiencies&lt;/a&gt; are:\nHe knows the following spells at recruitment:&lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt; (stun), &lt;a href=\"Identify%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Identify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%2010%27%20Radius\"&gt;Invisibility 10' Radius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapon\"&gt;Enchanted Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVoghiln - this time under the title \"Voghiln the Vast\" - reappears as one of the gladiators in the new Black Pits.\nPersonality.\nVoghiln is stereotypical Viking-type: He loves to drink, he loves to fight and loves to have beautiful women around him. Ideally all at once. All of that is crowned with an over-the-top Saxon accent. And let's not forget that he likes speaking of himself in third person. Underneath his rude behavior and his inability to be faithful however, lurks a funny and charming fellow who's got his heart in the right place."}

The response is wide and predicated on the party's defenses and who's in range. Note that with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed these spells will be the SR versions, such as \"Dispel Shield\" instead of Spell Immunity and \"Prismatic Mantle\" instead of Mantle.\nThe mage has the following prepared for instant use:"}

For dialogue and choices see the &lt;a href=\"The%20Graveyard%20Lich\"&gt;The Graveyard Lich&lt;/a&gt; article.\nVongoethe is able to cast any of the spells shown in the info box, even if not memorized (by script). If hostilities start with Vongoethe, his contingency and spell triggers will initiate immediately (in just a few tics of the game clock). Expect a &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sphere%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Sphere of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;. This cloned creature can be a level 18 Lich, and if allowed or able, will start casting its own scripted spells. This will complicate the battle for the party. \nNot long afterwards (perhaps after the Improved Mantle has expired) there will be a triggered &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;. If any party members are close and observed by the Lich, then a Spell Trigger will launch a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Confusion%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Confusion (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; spells. A minor sequence can then be deployed with a &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt;. After these spells are up and running, then Vongoethe will begin focusing more on going on the offensive.\nIf at any time the lich's hit points fall to 50% or less, it will utilize a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Superior%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Superior Healing&lt;/a&gt;. At certain times in the battle the Lich has the ability to teleport to four or more different locations on the map for the purpose of gaining an advantage or to escape danger. If the lich realizes his melee defenses are down, due to expiration of the spell or being dispelled, it will automatically attempt to reapply &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;. He does not run out of these spells, by script.\nVongoethe is scripted to deploy a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; if certain summoned hostile creatures are detected, such as &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword%20%28creature%29\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword (creature)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nishruu\"&gt;Nishruu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Efreeti\"&gt;Efreeti&lt;/a&gt; and similar.\nThe lich can also summon some additional creatures for assistance, such as with the &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Animate Dead (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; spell or Summon a &lt;a href=\"Efreeti\"&gt;Efreeti&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Dragon's Breath (spell)&lt;/a&gt; HLA will be used further into the battle, if the lich is able to do so.\nNote that Vongoethe is vulnerable to instant death effect &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Kill target&lt;/a&gt; from such sources as the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20Disruption\"&gt;Mace of Disruption&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Azuredge\"&gt;Azuredge&lt;/a&gt;, should it fail its saving throw.\nTrivia.\nThe lich is a possible reference to the great German writer &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe\"&gt;link Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust\"&gt;Faust&lt;/a&gt;. In the novel a demon makes a bargain with Faust: Mephistopheles will serve Faust with his magic powers for a set number of years, but at the end of the term, the Devil will claim Faust's soul, and Faust will be eternally enslaved, a story similar to the way Vongeothe offers &lt;a href=\"Marlowe\"&gt;Marlowe&lt;/a&gt; assistance in exchange for his soul.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod and the \"Gameplay Tweaks\" component moves the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt; to the \"Throne of Bhaal\". It is now worn by Vongoethe, who gains all of the Cloak's passive power.\nAlso. if you install the \"Smarter Mages Component\" and or \"Tactical Challenges for BG2\", then Vongoethe is a level 30 Necromancer, with a full spell book of offensive and defensive spells. SCS will utilize triggers, sequencers and contingency auto castings. It retains all of the abilities and immunities of the unmodified creature. \nDepending on the difficulty settings for your game, the lich will also utilize its Mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level calss abilities&lt;/a&gt; against you, should you initiate hostilities. \nThese HLA's include: &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Dragon's Breath (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blades%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Energy Blades (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt;.\nVongoethe has prepared for instant use, the following:\nOther changes to Vongoethe:\nAfter deploying a battery of near instant cast defensive spells such as &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire\"&gt;Protection From Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Magic Energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the innate \"Fear Aura\", this Lich will then go on the offensive, and will likely bring forth a gated Fiend. This beast will also immediately begin to cast any protective buffs, if able, and then go on the offensive - probably with the \"Improved Fiends\" component AI and special powers given to gated creatures.\nWhen Vongoethe goes on the offensive (typically by round two), Expect a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; combined with &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt;, then a perhaps a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Dark%20Planetar\"&gt;Summon Dark Planetar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Dragon's Breath&lt;/a&gt; HLA, depending if it detects a certain level of fire resistance on the closest party members. Other HLA's will be used while it is fighting you. His spell choices will be influenced by what vulnerabilities it can detect upon your party members. That might mean an &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; spell, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wail%20of%20the%20Banshee\"&gt;Wail of the Banshee&lt;/a&gt; or liberal use of his five memorized &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;s. The lich can remove spell defenses with &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khelben%27s%20Warding%20Whip\"&gt;Khelben's Warding Whip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, he may be wearing the Cloak of Mirroring as well. And finally, the lich carries a rich &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt; and a random SCS Scroll.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod will change the lich's spell book to the SR versions. This Mod is compatible and designed to work with SCS.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; Mod places a rare and hard to find pages from a golem building manual in the lich's carried loot."}

The spider will launch this ability as a projectile towards the target. It is similar to the Wizard level 3 spell &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt;. Targets must make a saving throw vs. Spells with a -4 penalty to negate. If the saving throw is missed, the targets will be under a &lt;a href=\"Slow%20effect\"&gt;Slow effect&lt;/a&gt;, and be hindered with a &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; penalty of -4.

I'll be happy to offer you a room, but you'd best keep yourself as low profile as possible.

The inn's been pretty quiet since the attacks started gearing up... at first, there was just some odd occurrences: a bear attack, some hungry wolves and the like.\"\n\"Since then, there's been masses of creatures that have assaulted the walls, and the militia can barely keep up.

Don't know why... we've always gotten on well enough with the grove.\"\n\"\"But there's no explaining that to folks, not when they're lives are in danger. They saw a druid during the last attack and would have stoned him to death had &lt;a href=\"High%20Merchant%20Logan%20Coprith\"&gt;Lord Coprith&lt;/a&gt; not arrested him.\"\"\n\"He might be dead, yet, if people have their way.

Well met, my &lt;LADY/LORD&gt;! Do come in and have a seat... you are more than welcome in Vyatri's inn! What can I do for you?\"\nHe can then be asked about the following:\nGenie Trouble.\nWhile there is still a stranglehold on trade in Tradmeet, asking Vyatri if he has \"any supplies for sale\" results in the following.\n\"\"Can't say that I do... but, then, I can't say that anyone does around here. If &lt;a href=\"Waukeen\"&gt;Waukeen&lt;/a&gt; were alive, she'd be sad to see the state that Trademeet's come to.\"\"\n\"The goddess had established Trademeet to be a place of fair business only, where shady deals were punished and such. No thieves, no liars, no fraud.\"\n\"Now, we not only have thieves here but a group of genies has camped outside of the gates and swallowed all the local business... bribed all the caravans, I understand.\"\n\"No end to their gold... and they charge an arm and a leg for a loaf of bread, so the town's being starved out, you see. Waukeen would have stopped them. Now, not even Lord Coprith can do anything.\""}
